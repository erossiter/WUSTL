SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR LOUISVILLE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $700,000 for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Port of Entry at the Louisville International Airport.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   Last year, Senator McConnell secured $700,000 to establish this port in Louisville, which is critical because a significant number of packages that fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), either are imported or exported through the Louisville International Airport. Without a USFWS Port of Entry in Louisville, these packages must be sent to alternative locations such as Anchorage, Alaska or Newark, New Jersey, for clearance. 
   "A Port of Entry in Louisville will enable more goods to be imported and exported through the city," said McConnell. "Currently, those who ship or receive packages pay more and often are subjected to delays. Continued funding for this project will expedite the shipment of these packages." 
   The FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
