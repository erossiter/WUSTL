SEN. MCCONNELL: NOW IS THE TIME FOR SOLVING BIG ISSUES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader-Elect Mitch McConnell made the following statement Wednesday regarding the President's call for bipartisan action in the Congress:  
   "Like the President, I believe that now is the time for solving the big issues; divided government is often the best time for solutions on complex problems. 
   "Issues like Social Security, energy independence, and immigration reform and border security demand action. And on the issue of Iraq, it is my hope, and my challenge to my colleagues, that our debate will be based on what is best for the future of our nation and for Iraq, not what's best for a political party or presidential campaign."
