PARTISAN BUDGET PUTS JOBS, ECONOMY AT RISK
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Thursday on the conference report for the Democrats' tax-and-spend budget:  
   "At the beginning of this Congress we pledged to work together across party lines to benefit hard-working Americans. But by penalizing them with an extra $736 billion in taxes, this budget does not live up to that promise. 
   "I voted against the Democrats' budget because it is the prescription for the largest tax hike in history, it fails to reform the crisis of entitlement programs such as Social Security, fails to control government spending and piles up trillions in debt. This tax-and-spend budget is a mistake. Sadly, it isn't just about numbers on a page, it's about our jobs, paychecks, and economy - and this budget puts those all at risk."
