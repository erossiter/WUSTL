SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR SIMPSON COUNTY 911 CENTER
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $100,000 for the Simpson County 911 Center.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured $100,000 for Simpson County to improve its 911 Center. The funds will assist the County in developing mapping capabilities and upgrading technology to handle increased call volume. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues approved my request for funding for the Simpson County 911 Center," said McConnell. "These funds will help the Center upgrade its equipment to serve its population more rapidly and efficiently. In the end it is the citizens of Simpson County who stand to benefit from this enhanced emergency response system." 
   In previous appropriations bills, Senator McConnell has secured nearly $3 million to support the efforts of local law enforcement agencies across the Commonwealth. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
