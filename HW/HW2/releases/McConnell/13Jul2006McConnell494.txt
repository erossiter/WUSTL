SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES $1.5 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request for $1.5 million in funding for Western Kentucky University's Environmental Monitoring Network. The funding, which is included in the FY'07 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill, must now be approved by the full Senate.  
   The funding, administered by the National Weather Service, will be used for a weather monitoring system that will collect and analyze real-time data. The Kentucky Climate Center at WKU will distribute the information over the Internet, and provide applications to support crop and livestock management, drought monitoring, flood warnings, and disaster assessments. 
   "The partnership between WKU and the National Weather Service provides Kentuckians with useful information about their local weather," said Senator McConnell. "This funding will help complete Western's weather monitoring network by establishing additional observation stations." 
   The FY'07 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
