SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PROPOSED MERGER OF DELTA AIR LINES, NORTHWEST AIR LINES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Monday regarding the proposed merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines: 
   "The Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG) is a key economic engine of our state. Earlier this year, I contacted Delta's CEO to remind him of the importance of CVG to Kentucky's economy and to the thousands of workers at the hub. While I have been assured that CVG will continue to be an important component of these merged operations, I will carefully assess the proposed merger, and will not support it unless I am convinced that CVG and its workers will be protected."
