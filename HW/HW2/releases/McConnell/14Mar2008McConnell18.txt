SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP'S MOST RECENT, INADEQUATE FISA PROPOSAL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday regarding the House Democratic Leadership's most recent, inadequate FISA proposal:  
   "This House vote represents a 'cover vote' which the Democratic leadership believes will allow them to go on their Easter recess claiming to have passed a bill that protects America. But instead, they've done great harm to the effort to enact a responsible strengthening of our anti-terror laws during this session of the Congress. Democrats passed a bill which would drag patriotic private companies into court for answering their government's call for help, created yet another Commission to investigate the administration, and failed our intelligence professionals by denying them the tools they need to track and stop foreign terrorists before they act. 
   "This latest House Democrats' bill will not be signed into law. It's irresponsible, and has set back every effort the Senate made on a bipartisan basis to enact responsible national security legislation this year. Senate Republicans remain committed to enacting legislation providing our intelligence professionals what they need to catch terrorists before the can harm us and we will not play along with a fake effort to do otherwise."
