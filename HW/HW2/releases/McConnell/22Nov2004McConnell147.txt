SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR CLARKS RIVER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $750,000 for construction of a maintenance facility at the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   The maintenance facility will provide the shelter and space necessary to protect and prolong the life of construction equipment. 
   "The Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge is one of Kentucky's top recreational facilities," said McConnell. "I was honored to have secured this funding which will enable the refuge to continue to provide outstanding service to its many visitors." 
   Since 1997, McConnell has secured $13.25 million for the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge was created in 1996 as a result of legislation McConnell authored. It was the first national wildlife refuge in Kentucky. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
