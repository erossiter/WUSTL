SEN. MCCONNELL HONORED AS NAACP 'QUARTERBACK'
  Sen. Mitch McConnell has been named a "Quarterback" by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  
 The NAACP's honor goes to the men and women of the U.S. Congress who have championed the organization's legislative priorities. 
   The NAACP recognized Senator McConnell for his role in increasing funding for election reform by $1 billion in last year's budget. 
   In 2002, McConnell, along with Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), helped establish an independent, bipartisan commission to provide ongoing election assistance to the states, in the form of grants and as a clearinghouse for information on new technologies and effective election procedures. Senator Dodd called it "the first civil rights legislation of the 21st century." 
   "For the first time in history, the federal government is investing significant funding for election reform, which is a top priority for state officials and civil rights organizations nationwide," said McConnell. "I am honored that the NAACP recognized my efforts to help make our elections more accurate, more accessible and more honest."
