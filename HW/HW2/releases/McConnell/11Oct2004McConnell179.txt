SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR FORT CAMPBELL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Senate approved his request of $3.5 million in military construction funding for Fort Campbell.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to the President for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmark in the funding bill: 
   * $3.5 million for construction of an Aquatic Training Facility for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR). This funding will create an aquatic training facility that will enhance survivability and training for the unit's elite helicopter pilots who fly extensive and dangerous missions at considerable distances over water. It will also improve training for the helicopter pilots of the 101st Airborne, who will have access to this facility. 
   "I was pleased to have secured this funding for Fort Campbell which will be used to build an aquatic training center to help prepare our soldiers for future combat," said McConnell. 
   In addition, Senator McConnell helped protect the following projects, which were included in the President's original budget: 
   * $33 million to construct a Command and Control Facility for the 101st Airborne Division. 
   * $30 million for construction of a Barracks Complex for the 5th Special Forces Group. 
   * $1.6 million for construction of a Shoot House.
