SENS. MCCONNELL, BURR PLACE FRIENDLY BET ON ORANGE BOWL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader-Elect Mitch McConnell and Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) made a friendly wager today on the Orange Bowl. The Senators placed their bets on their respective home teams: The University of Louisville Cardinals and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.  
   Senator McConnell offered a Kentucky Fried Chicken lunch if the Demon Deacons win, and Senator Burr bet a lunch of North Carolina bar-b-que if the Cardinals win. 
   "As a University of Louisville alumnus, I am extremely proud of the Cardinals and very excited they are playing in a BCS game this year," said McConnell. "I have every confidence the Cardinals will win the Orange Bowl and I am looking forward to enjoying bar-b-que with my friend Richard." 
   "I am very excited about the Wake Forest-Louisville game. I am thrilled Wake is playing in a BCS game and proud that they are representing the Atlantic Coast Conference as the ACC champions," Burr said. "I look forward to sharing a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken with my colleague Senator McConnell." 
   The Orange Bowl airs on Fox at 8:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, January 2, 2007.
