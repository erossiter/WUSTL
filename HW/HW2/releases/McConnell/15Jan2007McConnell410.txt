REPUBLICAN LEADER COMMENTS ON SEN. WAYNE ALLARD
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the announcement by U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard that he will stick to his term-limit pledge and not seek re-election in 2008:  
   "Wayne Allard has been a powerful advocate on behalf of the citizens of Colorado, a strong voice on behalf of fiscal responsibility, and one of the hardest working Senators in Congress. Though we will miss his service in the Senate when he returns to Colorado, I know that he will continue to fight for the people of Colorado until his very last day in office. Wayne and Joan are close friends of mine, and I appreciate their remarkable service to Colorado and the nation."
