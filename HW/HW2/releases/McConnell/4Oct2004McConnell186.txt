SENS. REID, MCCONNELL CONVENE MEETING OF BIPARTISAN WORKING GROUP TO REFORM CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF INTELLIGENCE
  Sens. Harry Reid (D-NV) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY) today convened a meeting of the bipartisan working group to discuss recommendations improving congressional oversight of intelligence.  
   The Senators were asked by Majority Leader Frist and Democratic Leader Daschle to co-chair the working group, which is responsible for examining recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission to reform congressional intelligence oversight, as well as other options to improve oversight of the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Recommendation I: 
   The Senate should improve the structure and enhance the authority of the existing Select Committee on Intelligence by implementing the following reforms: 
   * Eliminate term limits for Committee Members. 
   * Ensure Majority has no more than a 1 Member advantage. 
   * Maintain apportioned slots for Armed Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations, and Judiciary Committees. 
   * Allow the Chairman and Ranking Member of Armed Services to serve as ex officio (non-voting) Members of the Committee. 
   * Elevate status of Committee from B to A. 
   * Maintain Majority Leader and Minority Leader's ability to appoint all Committee Members. Members, once appointed, would serve without term limits. 
   * At the beginning of each Congress, the Majority Leader and Minority Leader shall select a Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee. 
   * Reduce size of the Committee to 15 Members. 
   * Create designated staff positions for each Member of the Committee. 
   * Maintain non-partisan professional staff. 
   * Give Intelligence Committee a stronger role in reviewing civilian intelligence nominees. 
   * Create a Subcommittee on Oversight, and maintain Committee's authority to create additional Subcommittees as it deems necessary. 
   * Maintain Committee's subpoena authority. 
   * Require the Committee to make regular reports to the full Senate. 
   Recommendation II: 
   The Senate should consolidate appropriations authority over intelligence by creating an Appropriations Subcommittee for Intelligence, and combine the Military Construction and Defense Subcommittees. 
   Recommendation III: 
   The Senate should create a Homeland Security Authorization Committee by adding jurisdiction to and renaming the Government Affairs Committee. 
   The new Homeland Security Committee should retain its current status as a permanent "A" committee.
