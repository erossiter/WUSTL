SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR CITY OF RADCLIFF
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1.075 million for the City of Radcliff, Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Radcliff: 
   * $600,000 for the City of Radcliff to purchase law enforcement equipment, which will provide increased safety for officers and will allow the police to better communicate with the fire and public works departments during an emergency. 
   * $475,000 for the City of Radcliff Public Walkways Improvement Project. The City of Radcliff will use these funds to improve pedestrian walkways along busy Wilson Road, where foot traffic is heavy and can be dangerous. This project will improve the safety of the area for the many residents who live in and around Wilson Road. 
   "I am pleased my colleagues approved my requests of funding for the City of Radcliff," said McConnell. "This funding will be used by the city to improve its law enforcement equipment and to upgrade pedestrian walkways." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
