SEN. MCCONNELL BLASTS EFFORTS TO LIMIT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement regarding attempts by Congressional Democrats to revive the misnamed "fairness doctrine":  
   "Our Founding Fathers understood free speech is fundamental to our nation and sought to protect it with the First Amendment. As a strong supporter of First Amendment freedoms for all Americans, I will continue to work to prevent government limitations on speech. 
   "The latest attempt by House Democrats to revive the misnamed 'fairness doctrine' will silence active political voices and limit the free flow of information. Government is not the speech police and I will not support these efforts to restrict free speech. 
   "Political debate is among the most important democratic traditions of our nation and a hallmark of free society. We must continue to preserve the right of all Americans to express their views." 
   Background 
   Legislation is being drafted in the House which would require the government to police the airwaves to ensure radio broadcasters are presenting what the government decides are balanced viewpoints. The "Fairness Doctrine," as it is called, was abolished by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987 because it inhibited debate and the free flow of information.
