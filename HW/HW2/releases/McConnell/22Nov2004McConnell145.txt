SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR CENTRAL KENTUCKY AGRICULTURE AND EXPOSITION CENTER
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1 million for the Central Kentucky Agriculture and Exposition Center in Casey County, Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to secure funding for the construction of the center. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues approved my funding request for Casey County," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the County to build an agricultural center, which will allow local residents to showcase their farm products. I always enjoy visiting my friends in Casey County and am looking forward to enjoying this center with them in the future. It will clearly be a terrific opportunity for economic development." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
