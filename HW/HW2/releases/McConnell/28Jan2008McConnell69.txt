SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING CONFIRMATION OF FORMER NORTH DAKOTA GOV. SCHAFER TO SERVE AS SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the unanimous confirmation of former North Dakota Governor Edward Schafer to serve as Secretary of Agriculture: 
   "I congratulate former Gov. Schafer on his unanimous confirmation as the new Secretary of Agriculture. This confirmation is particularly timely with the ongoing discussions to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the farm bill. I hope Secretary Schafer can bring a fresh perspective to the discussions so we can enact a good farm bill prior to the initiation of planting season. Our farmers and rural citizens deserve no less."
