SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES MORE THAN ONE-HALF OF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR KENTUCKY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, personally secured more than one-half of a billion dollars for Kentucky during this year's budget process.  
   Senator McConnell worked hard this year to bring home nearly $537.5 million in funding for several major programs and key sectors of the Kentucky economy, including nearly $62 million for Kentucky's universities and more than $108 million for defense and military projects. 
   "This was another successful year for Kentucky," said McConnell, who was successful in obtaining more than one-half a billion dollars in funding for Kentucky priorities even though domestic discretionary spending was held at one percent growth. 
   "Whether it's for Kentucky's universities, defense facilities or community infrastructure projects, I will continue to use my position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to bring funding home," said McConnell. "This money is vital for the state's economy and I am pleased to have secured it on behalf of the hard working people of Kentucky." 
   The funding mentioned in this release represents only those earmarks secured through the efforts of Senator McConnell. The total does not take into consideration mandatory federal payments to Kentucky or projects secured primarily by other Congressional offices.
