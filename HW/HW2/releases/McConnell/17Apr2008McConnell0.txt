SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH SOUTH KOREA, COLOMBIA
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the need to approve free trade agreements with South Korea and Colombia: 
   "Congress should quickly move forward to approve the free trade agreement with South Korea if our beef export dispute is resolved. We must continue to show our allies that we honor our agreements as we continue to open up markets for U.S. exporters. It is my hope that we will soon recognize not only the Republic of Korea, but also Colombia, as full-fledged trading partners; both are allies eager to purchase American-made goods."
   NOTE: Kentucky is the top beef cattle state east of the Mississippi.
