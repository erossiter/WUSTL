SEN. MCCONNELL CALLS ON SENATE TO SEND HOUSE-PASSED GROWTH PACKAGE DIRECTLY TO PRESIDENT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Tuesday following House passage of the bipartisan economic growth package: 
   "An overwhelming bipartisan majority in the House quickly passed an economic growth package which neither raises taxes nor increases mandatory government spending. It is now the Senate's turn to act to speed relief to American families and businesses.
   "In the Democrats' response to the State of the Union, Gov. Sebelius called on Congress to 'work together' quickly on a short-term fix to speed relief to families. Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid previously called for a plan to be 'implemented into law without delay.'
   "The best way to do this is for the Senate to take up and pass the bipartisan compromise crafted by the House and send it directly to the President's desk--this week. Adding extraneous provisions to this cooperative package will only delay, and possibly derail, relief to America's families and job creators."
   Background:
   In the Democratic response to the State of the Union Address, Governor Kathleen Sebelius (D-Kan.) said, "If Washington can work together so quickly on a short-term fix for families caught in the financial squeeze, then we can work together to transform America." (Office of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, "Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius Address to the Nation," January 29, 2008)
   In a letter to the President, Speaker Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Reid said, "We want to work with you and the Republican leadership of the Congress to immediately develop a legislative plan based upon these principles so it can be passed and implemented into law without delay." (Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid, Letter to the President on the Economic Growth Package, January 11, 2008)
