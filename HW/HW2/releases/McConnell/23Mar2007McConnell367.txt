THE DEMOCRAT BLUEPRINT: INCREASE TAXES AND FEDERAL SPENDING, IGNORE ENTITLEMENT REFORM
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday regarding the Democrats' tax and spend budget: 
   "The budget is an opportunity to show your priorities, and Democrats are making it clear with this blueprint what theirs are. They're making it harder to pass tax relief for families, and making it easier for the government to spend the money of hardworking Americans." 
   The Democrat budget would raise taxes by $736 billion and does nothing to address the pending entitlement crisis.
