SEN. MCCONNELL: ANOTHER 'WITHDRAWAL DATE?'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding Democrats' plan to vote on yet another Iraq bill containing a withdrawal date: 
   "What unfortunate timing for Democrats, announcing yet another attempt at a withdrawal date on a day when the papers are filled with encouraging news from Iraq. While our troops are quelling violence and defeating terrorists in Baghdad and throughout Iraq, Democrats in Washington are trying to choke off funds for our troops in the field."
