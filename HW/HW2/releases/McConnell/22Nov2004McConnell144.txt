SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR BOWLING GREEN
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $5.75 million in funding for the Bowling Green area. The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. This money is in addition to the more than $11 million McConnell obtained for Western Kentucky University in the same legislation.  
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and secured the following funding: 
   * $1.5 million for the South Central Kentucky Training and Development Project at the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark. This funding will be used to provide equipment for the on-site technical training center, which will ensure that workers have the skills needed by employers at the industrial park. 
   * $2 million for the South Central Kentucky Water Infrastructure Project at the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark. This funding will be used for water and sewer improvements related to the industrial park. 
   * $2 million for the Bowling Green Transpark U.S. 68/31W Improvements Project. Funds will be used to improve U.S. 68 and U.S. 31W, which provide access to the Bowling Green Transpark. Senator McConnell previously provided $5.25 million for road improvements related to the Transpark. 
   * $250,000 for the Old Warren County Courthouse Restoration Project. The Old Warren County Courthouse was constructed in 1869 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but exposure and previous misguided attempts at restoration threaten the distinguishing historic characteristics. Funds will be used to restore and preserve this unique building. 
   "I am pleased my colleagues approved my funding requests for the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark," said McConnell. "This funding will be used to improve access to the industrial park and to provide much needed training for workers at the facility. Bowling Green is one of the leading economic engines in the Commonwealth and I'm proud to do my part to further this success." 
   In FY'04, McConnell secured $7.25 million for the Bowling Green Transpark, bringing the total amount delivered by McConnell to the Transpark to $12.75 million. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
