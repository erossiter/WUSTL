SENS. MCCONNELL, FEINSTEIN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO AWARD CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO AUNG SAN SUU KYI
  U.S. Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Wednesday introduced a bill to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi - the leader of Burma's democratic movement and Nobel Peace Laureate.  
   The Aung Sung Suu Kyi Congressional Gold Medal Act would recognize that Suu Kyi embodies the qualities represented by the medal, the highest honor bestowed by Congress. 
   The Gold Medal would be awarded in recognition of her courageous and unwavering commitment to peace, non-violence, human rights, and democracy in Burma. The legislation would also express solidarity with Suu Kyi and the people of Burma in their continuing struggle for a free and democratic Burma. 
   "While the Burmese government continues its campaign of oppression and abuse against its own people, Suu Kyi symbolizes the peaceful struggle for freedom and democracy in Burma," Senator McConnell said. "By awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal, we are letting the Burmese military junta and the world know that the people of America will continue to stand beside Suu Kyi to defend the cause of liberty. And we honor her lifelong devotion to the freedom of her people." 
   The legislation, which has broad, bipartisan support from 73 additional senators, must now be considered by the Senate Banking Committee before it can be brought to the Senate floor for final passage.
