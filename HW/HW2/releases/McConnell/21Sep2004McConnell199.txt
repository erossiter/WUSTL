SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY PROJECTS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of over $1.7 million for several University of Kentucky projects. The funding is included in the FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate.  
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured funding for the following projects: 
   * $1 million for Abandoned Mine Reforestation project. The University of Kentucky Abandoned Mine Land Reforestation project provides an opportunity to convert currently unproductive land to a valuable environmental and economic resource. With new reclamation techniques, as well as proper treatment and management, these areas can be a highly valuable source of hardwood timber. It also improves wildlife habitats and creates jobs in a region that has been plagued by chronic unemployment. 
   * $3 million for the Center for Advanced Separation Technology (CAST), of which UK will receive $428,500. CAST is a consortium of seven top mining schools, including the University of Kentucky, focused on developing new technologies to reduce the cost of separations in coal, metals, and industrial mining operations. The industry seeks advanced technologies to separate coal from waste rock near the point of extraction, which is particularly important for mining the thinner coal seams in the Appalachian region. Not only will new technologies produce cleaner coal, but the recovery of minerals in an environmentally acceptable manner also should improve. 
   * $1.5 million for the Consortium for Fossil Fuel Science (CFFS), of which UK will receive $300,000. CFFS is a five-university research consortium that includes the University of Kentucky. CFFS is conducting a research program in the field of C1 chemistry, which is focused on the conversion of feedstocks such as sythesis gas (syngas) produced from coal or natural gas, methane, methanol, and carbon dioxide into ultra clean, high efficiency transportation fuel and hydrogen, which will be required by cars powered by fuel cells. 
   "The University of Kentucky is one of the top mining research universities in the country," said McConnell. "This funding will go a long way in helping researchers understand and develop new technologies to help the industry thrive in today's environment." 
   The FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
