SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR BOWLING GREEN-WARREN COUNTY REGIONAL AIRPORT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded the Bowling Green-Warren County Regional Airport with a $150,000 federal grant.  
   Earlier this year, Senator McConnell wrote a letter of support for the projects to the Department of Transportation. The money will be used to determine the potential demand for commercial service in the region, develop operating scenarios, and formulate a detailed Air Service Marketing Strategy. 
   "The city of Bowling Green and Warren County serve as a hub for business and industry in south-central Kentucky and its airport currently lacks scheduled commercial airline service," said McConnell. "This funding will help ensure that the airport remains an integral part of the economic infrastructure of the region."
