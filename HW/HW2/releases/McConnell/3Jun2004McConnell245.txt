SEN. MCCONNELL: 'BUSH RECOVERY, AMERICA ON RIGHT COURSE'
  Sen. Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor today about the one-year anniversary of the Jobs & Growth Act of 2003:
   "Mr. President, this week marks the one-year anniversary of the Jobs & Growth Act of 2003, a bill that was signed into law on May 28th of last year. 
   "And now, a year later, we see that by every conceivable economic measure of prosperity and well being, the Bush Recovery is roaring ahead.
   "The Bush Recovery has American families on the right course.
   "The Bush Recovery has American businesses - services, manufacturing, and exports - all moving ahead at full steam.
   "The Bush Recovery has workers' income rising, their job opportunities expanding, and their take-home pay increasing. A record number of workers are working.
   "The Bush Recovery is broad, growing, and substantial - it is a record of achievement of which any President would be justly proud. But the remarkable aspect of the Bush Recovery is not what it has obtained, but what it has overcome.
   "Back in January of 2000, when President Bush was still Governor Bush, the Dow Jones Industrial average peaked at 11,723. Two months later, it had lost a fifth of its total value.
   "NASDAQ peaked in March of that year but by the end of 2000, tech stocks had lost more than half of their value. By the fall of 2000, the economy had slipped into recession.
   "Again, this had all occurred while President Bush was still Governor Bush of Texas.
   "President Bush took office with an economy already stalled, a stock market tanking, and 8 months later, America suffered an unprecedented terrorist attack on September 11th.
   "We are all aware of the toll of lives from that tragic day, but few appreciate the full effect on our freedom and on our prosperity. Planes were grounded for days and new, expensive security measures were imposed. Business in America came to a halt, each one collectively seeking to re-assess the risk and opportunity of all their endeavors, both here and abroad.
   "And average Americans - they took stock of the threats and warnings out there and acted cautiously for the sake of their loved ones.
   "As our freedom to act without fear was diminished, so, too, was the economic activity that is a reflection of that freedom.
   "A new world of uncertainty was created on 9/11, and while many have completely forgotten that the attacks even occurred, their full ramifications are felt today, not just militarily and politically, but economically as well.
   "Despite all that, America is back and stronger than ever.
   "And much of that strength can be traced back to the Jobs & Growth Act of 2003.
   "By letting workers, families, and businesses keep more of their own money, that legislation, along with the President's 2001 tax relief, laid the foundation for economic growth and job creation now and for years to come.
   * 111 million individuals and families will receive an average tax cut of $1,586.
   * 49 million married couples will have an average tax cut of $2,602.
   * 43 million families with children will receive an average tax cut of $2,090.
   * 14 million elderly individuals will see their taxes fall, on average, by $1,883.
   * 25 million small business owners will receive an average tax cut of $3,001.
   "This tax relief has prompted the growth of a surging, vital economy. Since the President signed it:
   * The stock market is up 18%, increasing America's capital base by more than $2 trillion;
   * Real business investment in equipment and software is up 14 percent annually, the fastest 3-quarter increase since the late 1990s;
   * More manufacturers have been reporting increased activity and new orders than any other time in the last 20 years, and
   * Real GDP grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate - the fastest in nearly 20 years.
   "As tax relief has prompted a surging economy, families have benefited in the last year:
   * Real disposable personal income rose at an average annual rate of 3.9 percent;
   * Household wealth hit a record high of $44 trillion; and
   * Homeownership has risen 0.4 percentage points to a record high of 68.6 percent.
   "With families stronger and businesses growing, the Bush Recovery is building strong momentum in the jobs market. In just the last year:
   * Over 1 million new jobs have been created for America's workers;
   * The unemployment rate fell from 6.1 percent to just 5.6 percent, lower than the average unemployment rates in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s; and
   * State unemployment rates fell in forty-seven out of fifty states.
   "Mr. President, America is headed in the right direction. As this chart shows, since President Bush signed the Jobs and Growth act last May,
   * We have had the strongest economic growth in about 20 years, with GDP up 5.6%;
   * We have had 1.1 million new jobs created in the last 8 months, with 800,000 new jobs in this year alone;
   * The markets are on the rebound, up 18%;
   * Homeownership is at an all-time record high of 68.6%;
   * And, due to the President's tax relief, family take-home pay is rising, up about 4%.
   "Some say the economy should be growing faster but their solution is to lock up the brakes and whip a U-Turn. That's what an agenda of more taxes, more regulation, and more government spending would do.
   "Under President Bush's leadership, America is finally headed in the right direction, the economy is picking up steam, and families, businesses, and workers across America are reaping the benefits. This is not the time to turn backward.
