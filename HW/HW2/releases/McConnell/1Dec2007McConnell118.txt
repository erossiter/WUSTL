SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON WORLD AIDS DAY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Saturday marking World AIDS Day 2007:  
   "Today, HIV/AIDS is recognized as a significant transnational crisis that poses an immediate and growing threat to social, economic and political stability across the globe. This epidemic creates widows and orphans and destroys entire families. It is especially brutal to youth, and saps the hope and promise of future generations. 
   "America has significantly increased its contributions to combating this disease. Over a five-year period, the U.S. will contribute a total of $15 billion to HIV/AIDS programs and activities. Fifteen countries, primarily in Africa and the Caribbean, are the main focus of this initiative, although funding will continue to some 100 countries where we have ongoing programs, and to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 
   "While recognizing the importance of the invaluable contributions made by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief during my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, funding alone is not enough. To stem the tide of HIV/AIDS, nations must have committed leadership, the most basic health care delivery systems, and the capacity to absorb substantial assistance targeted toward the health and welfare of all people - regardless of ethnic, tribal, political, gender, or religious affiliation."
