SEN. MCCONNELL: UK PLOT REMINDER THAT 'WAR ON TERROR IS NOT OVER'
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the disruption of a major terrorist plot centered in the United Kingdom, and the need for continued anti-terror efforts in the United States:  
   "This is yet another reminder, if anyone needed one, that the war on terror is not over. And it is a reminder that our military, law enforcement and intelligence forces are working around the clock and around the world to prevent attacks here at home. 
   "That's why we need more tools, not less, to fight terrorists. It is clear to anyone paying attention that our law enforcement and intelligence forces need every legal means at their disposal to be able connect the dots and prevent and disrupt al Qaeda's attacks. Tools such as the terrorist surveillance program and others allow us to prevent the attacks before they happen, not just to respond when it's too late. We must continue to arm our forces, so that they can disarm terrorists."
