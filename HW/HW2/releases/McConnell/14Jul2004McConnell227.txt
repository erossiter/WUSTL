OVER COURSE OF HIS CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE SEN. MCCONNELL EMERGES AS LEADING VOICE ON BEHALF OF NATION'S CHILDREN
  * In 1980, McConnell created the first missing and exploited child unit in the U.S. by combining the resources of the Jefferson County Police and the Office of Social Services.  
   * In 1982, McConnell led the Kentucky Task Force on Missing and Exploited Children. 
   * In 1984, McConnell successfully advocated for passage of the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which established a national clearinghouse for information about missing and exploited children. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is designated by the U.S. Department of Justice to fill this role. 
   * In 1990, McConnell introduced the National Child Search Assistance Act, which united missing children clearinghouses throughout the Nation and mandated the immediate reporting of missing children cases by local police to the FBI's National Crime Information Center. The bill was passed later that year as a part of the Crime Control Act of 1990. 
   * In 1991, McConnell offered the National Child Abusers Registration Act to create a national database and background screening system. 
   * In 1994, McConnell gained Congressional approval for the Federal Parent Locator Amendments Act of 1993, which enable Justice to access information in HHS's Federal Parent Locator Service. This assists in the location of a parent who has illegally taken a child from a custodial parent. 
   * In 1995, McConnell was honored by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for 15 years of service to families of missing children. 
   * In 1996, McConnell pushed for the establishment of a center to train local law enforcement officials for the recovery of missing children. The Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center opened on April 14, 1997. It was named after a 9-year-old Florida boy who was abducted on his way home from school and murdered in 1996. 
   * In 2001, McConnell worked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to secure Lost Child Alert Technology Resources (LOCATER) packages for each of Kentucky's 120 counties and 16 posts of the Kentucky State Police. The LOCATER program provides the hardware and software necessary for scanning images of missing children and rapidly distributing them to law enforcement agencies, the press, and the public. 
   * In 2004, McConnell announced the partnership of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children with Appriss, Inc. of Louisville, Kentucky. Appriss agreed to donate use of its JusticeXchange database to the National Center to help monitor the criminal justice system for suspected abductors.
