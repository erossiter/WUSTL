SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES $1 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY IN FY 2006 COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE, JUDICIARY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request for $1 million in funding for Western Kentucky University's Environmental Monitoring Network.  
 The funding, which is included in the FY'06 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, must now be approved by the full Senate. 
   This funding, which will be administered by the National Weather Service, will be used for a monitoring system that will collect and analyze real-time observations through a statewide grid of weather monitoring stations. The Kentucky Climate Center at WKU will collect and analyze data, distribute the information over the Internet, and provide applications to support crop and livestock management, drought monitoring, flood warnings, disaster assessment, water supply management, and wildfire risk assessment. 
   "WKU provides a valuable service for the citizens of Kentucky as home of the official State Climate Office," said Senator McConnell. "This funding will enable the University to expand and enhance its weather monitoring services, which will help protect residents from severe weather." 
   The FY'06 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
