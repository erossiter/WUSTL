MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY REPORT CONFIRMS URGENT NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the release of this year's trustees' report on Social Security and Medicare. Each year the Board of Trustees overseeing these programs provides Congress with a detailed account of the current and projected financial status of these trust funds.  
   "As I said on the first day of this Congress, divided government provides a unique opportunity to address big issues facing the nation. The report released by the trustees on Social Security and Medicare only underscores the critical need for Congress to set aside poll-tested politicking and address big problems like the massive entitlement crisis that will fall on tomorrow's seniors, today's children and all taxpayers."
