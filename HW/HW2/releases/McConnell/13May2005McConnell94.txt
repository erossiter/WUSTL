SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON BRAC RECOMMENDATIONS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today in response to the recommendations by the BRAC:  
   "I am relieved that Fort Knox will remain open, and in fact, will once again be the home of combat troops. I have long been an advocate for Fort Knox and believe it brings much value to our national security and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I am grateful to all those in the Fort Knox community who have helped demonstrate to the Commission its value to the U.S. military. 
   "Our military is undergoing an important transformation in order to adapt to the new national security environment, and Kentucky's military facilities will reflect those changes. Now we begin the process of careful evaluation to ensure that we fully understand the Department's recommendations and their impact on Kentucky. By its very nature the BRAC process is designed to be non-political, but within the limitations of that process, I will work with the Governor and congressional delegation to forcefully advocate on behalf of Kentucky's priorities."
