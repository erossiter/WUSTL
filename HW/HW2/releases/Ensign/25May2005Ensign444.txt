 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign is cosponsoring a bill to eliminate all federal payments for certain lifestyle prescription drugs   The Prescription Drug Coverage Stewardship Act of 2005 was introduced today to end coverage by Medicare and Medicaid of drugs such as Viagra  Cialis and Levitra       Medicare and Medicaid are broken and near bankruptcy     said Ensign     Now is not the time to be saddling these programs with expensive  recreational drugs that serve no life saving medical purpose   I take my responsibility to the taxpayer very seriously  and I think most American workers would agree that this is not a legitimate use of their tax dollars        The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare and Medicaid would spend    2 billion on such drugs between 2006 and 2015   The lifestyle medicines that would no longer be covered under the legislation include Viagra  Cialis and Levitra  The legislation would not prevent coverage by the federal government of those drugs for treatments not related to sexual performance       I  ve spoken to too many seniors who can barely afford the medications that keep them alive     said Ensign     There is no excuse for the federal government to cover lifestyle drugs and further burden a system that seniors depend on for their healthcare needs
