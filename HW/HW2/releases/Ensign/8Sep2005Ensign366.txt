 Washington  DC    Senator John Ensign made the following statement today after meeting with chief justice nominee John Roberts       Judge Roberts is extremely well qualified to serve as chief justice of the United States Supreme Court  After our conversation today  I am even more confident that his prior experience before the Supreme Court  along with his distinguished reputation as a fair jurist  will make him a great addition to the high court   I think it is very fitting that Judge Roberts will succeed his mentor  Chief Justice Rehnquist  a man who truly understood our Constitution and what it stands for
