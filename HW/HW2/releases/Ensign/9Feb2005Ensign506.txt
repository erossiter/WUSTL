 Washington  D C     U S  Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign are working to protect Nevada  s right to regulate hunting and fishing   The two Nevada Senators introduced legislation today to protect the state  s ability to distinguish between residents and non residents when issue hunting and fishing licenses       States have traditionally regulated hunting and fishing within their own borders   However  a recent ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could undermine that right   The court called into question a states authority to set different tag limits for residents and non residents        The Reid  Ensign bill would reaffirm a state  s long standing right to make such distinctions        Sportsmen and local organizations are extremely active in protecting fish and game   They spend their own money and time to support wildlife conservation through taxes  fees  and locally led non profit conservation efforts     Sen  Reid said     Nevadans pay the cost of conserving and developing our resources  and they should be rewarded for these efforts           This is a states   rights issue that should not be subject to federal interference     Senator Ensign said     Nevada  s incredible wildlife resources make it a natural attraction for hunters and fisherman  and our state has managed its recreational programs to the benefit of all Nevadans   That is how it should continue to be           Reid and Ensign were joined by a number of Republican and Democratic members in both the House and Senate who cosponsored the legislation  including Senators Ted Stevens  R AK  and Ben Nelson  D NE  and Representatives Mark Udall  D CO  and Bill Otter  R ID      The bill would also affirm the traditional authority of individual states   The regulation of wildlife has traditionally been within a state  s purview and it is in the best interest of the state and federal governments to ensure that states retain the authority to regulate wildlife
