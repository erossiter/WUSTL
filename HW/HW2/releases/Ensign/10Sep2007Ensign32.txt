 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign released the following statement regarding General Petraeus and Admiral Crockers report to Congress on the status of the troop surge in Iraq   Todays progress report on the surge in Iraq contained some encouraging news  Our military objectives are being met  and violence and death are down dramatically  Credit goes to our troops who have integrated themselves into local communities and ensured that security and basic services are provided  This bottom up approach has created a successful working relationship with local Iraqi leaders  Al Anbar province  once thought to be lost for good  is proof that this is a successful approach  By providing the basic needs of water  power and sewage to Iraqi communities  we will see continued progress toward a stable and secure Iraq  There is much work that still needs to be done  and I believe our men and women on the front lines have the ability and will to succeed
