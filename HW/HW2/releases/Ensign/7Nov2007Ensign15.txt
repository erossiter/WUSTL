 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign released the following statement urging his colleagues to demonstrate spending discipline with taxpayer dollars as Congress continues to pass Democrat spending bills that exceed the Presidents budget request by billions of dollars   Americans expect more out of their elected officials  In 20 years  Congress has never waited this long to send the President a spending bill  and in the meantime the Democrats mismanagement has led to a spending bill  9 billion above the Presidents request  This increase adds up to more than  120 billion in Washington spending over the next 10 years   Some in Congress claim this is not much of a difference  Not much of a difference  Tell that to a family of four trying to make ends meet  or a senior on a fixed income  Lets be honest with the American public  This small difference amounts to nearly 3 times the state of Nevadas entire budget   Its this type of overspending and disregard of taxpayer dollars that has been common practice for too long  One year ago  Democrats promised to bring fiscal responsibility to Washington  Future generations will be forced to pay the debts of this irresponsible Congress  and I urge my colleagues to deliver what the American public wants  spending discipline
