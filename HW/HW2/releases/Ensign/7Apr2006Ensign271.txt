 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign released the following statement this afternoon in reaction to the United States Senate  s failure to vote on immigration reform legislation       It is truly a shame that the Democrats have refused to allow amendments and meaningful debate on legislation dealing with one of the most important issues facing America today   Closing down debate violates the spirit of the United States Senate  which is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world   I had offered amendments that would have fixed major problems with this bill by addressing serious concerns over border security and America  s Social Security system  but those amendments could not be considered because of Democrats   tactics   Although I  m frustrated we were not able to agree on a bill  I remain committed to a reform of the immigration system that focuses on strengthening our borders  holding employers accountable and establishing a temporary worker program
