 Washington  D C    Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid announced today that the Nathan Adelson Hospice  NAH  of Las Vegas  which due to a flawed administrative ruling was in danger of closing  will remain open because of a provision included in the Tax and Trade Extenders bill that passed last night   The provision included by Ensign and Reid corrects an administrative decision by the federal agency overseeing Medicare and will allow NAH to continue meeting the needs of Southern Nevadans      Nathan Adelson Hospice has provided health care and assistance to the terminally ill in Southern Nevada for almost 30 years   said Ensign  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee    When I learned of this problem I knew it had to be resolved because closing our hospice is unacceptable since so many Nevadans rely on the quality care at Nathan Adelson       Every person deserves comfort and dignity as they near life s end   said Reid    It s an honor to join with the Nevada delegation to help meet the needs of our seniors      In 1999  Nathan Adelson s facility in Pahrump applied to the Health Care Financing Administration  HCFA  for satellite status but was denied because the agency determined that Pahrump was more than 100 miles away and greater than one hour driving time from the Las Vegas facility   Satellite status determines the amount of payments for health care   Pahrump is just over 50 miles and the driving time is under one hour   NAH appealed but HCFA did not respond     In 2005  the successor agency to HCFA granted the Pahrump facility satellite designation   But because this agency would not grant the status retroactively  they are now seeking overpayments totaling  3 8 million from NAH   This would not have been warranted had the facility been granted satellite status in the first place   Senators Ensign and Reid worked together to retroactively designate the facility in Pahrump satellite status  thereby erasing nearly  4 million of payments that NAH would have had to make  even though they could not afford to and would not have remained open as a result     The bill passed the Senate last night and is expected to be signed by President Bush
