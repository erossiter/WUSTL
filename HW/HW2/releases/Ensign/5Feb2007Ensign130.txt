 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement regarding the southern Nevada VA Medical Center s inclusion in the President s budget proposal      For too long veterans in southern Nevada have not had sufficient access to quality health care because  despite a growing veteran population  southern Nevada lacked a VA facility   But the President s budget   which was announced today    includes the funding necessary to keep the VA Medical Center in Las Vegas on track   Once completed  this Medical Center will improve the quality of life for veterans across southern Nevada      In the President s budget the cost estimate of the facility increased to just more than  600 million because of rising construction expenses   However the price tag would have been even higher if the Nevada delegation did not secure the facility s land
