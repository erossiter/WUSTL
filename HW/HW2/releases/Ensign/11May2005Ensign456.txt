 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  during a speech on the floor of the United States Senate this morning  urged his Senate colleagues to uphold their Constitutional duty and long standing Senate tradition by allowing up or down votes on nominees to the federal judiciary   Senate Democrats have begun an unprecedented practice of filibustering nominees        We must put an end to this mockery of our system before it becomes impossible to undo the damage     Ensign said during his address     Filibustering judicial nominations is an unprecedented intrusion into the long standing practice of the United States Senate  s approval of judicial nominees         Ensign said it is unfair to subject judicial candidates to a politicized nomination process and that doing so will discourage highly qualified people from seeking judgeships        It is and should continue to be an honor to be nominated to serve on the federal bench     Ensign said     Highly qualified and respected nominees do not sign on to being dragged through a bitter political battle   If we allow the filibustering of nominees to continue  I fear those highly qualified candidates will decline to put themselves and their families through this process         Ensign pointed out that even judicial nominees considered highly controversial  such as Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork  were given up or down votes on the Senate floor
