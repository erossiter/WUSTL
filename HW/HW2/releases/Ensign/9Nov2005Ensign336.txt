 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign said today a recently released national study confirms the harmful effects of the portrayal of smoking in the movies to young people in America   The results of the first ever nationwide study to examine the impact of smoking in the movies were released yesterday       This is a very serious health issue in America that has been largely overlooked  and I hope this study draws attention to the link between smoking in the movies and smoking among children     Ensign said     The film industry should pay careful attention to how its product is affecting the lives of America  s children        The study was conducted by researchers at the Dartmouth Medical School and Norris Cotton Cancer Center   The results were published in the journal Pediatrics   The researchers found that adolescents with the highest exposure to smoking in movies were 2 6 times more likely to begin smoking than those with the lowest exposure and that 38  of adolescent smokers began smoking because they saw it done in movies       America  s film industry has a responsibility for the impact its products have on young moviegoers     Ensign said     It is my sincere hope that the industry will be motivated by these research results to voluntarily curb the amount of smoking in films        In May of 2004  Ensign  a member of the Senate Commerce Committee  chaired a hearing on the subject of smoking in the movies and called for a notification system similar to movie ratings to alert parents to the presence of smoking in films
