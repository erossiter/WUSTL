 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign issued the following statement after he authored and the U S  Senate approved an amendment to the Senate  s Interior Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2006   The amendment blocks the U S  Forest Service from tearing down the Dreyfus Estate at the Zephyr Shoals Property at Lake Tahoe  near Zephyr Cove  South Shore  in Fiscal Year 2006        I agree with many who question the Forest Service  s intention to tear down these expensive buildings  at considerable taxpayer cost  when the Forest Service should be focusing on the prevention of a catastrophic fire at Lake Tahoe   Several people in the Lake Tahoe community and Douglas County have voiced serious opposition to tearing down the structures on the Zephyr Shoals property because there are local groups that want to utilize the existing Dreyfus buildings in a way that will benefit the public   This decision was made by the Forest Supervisor when she was literally walking out the door to take another job in Colorado   Before the removal of the structures with taxpayers   funds  I want to make sure that the Forest Service avails itself of the opportunity to reevaluate the plan and to work with the local community to come up with a solution that is best for Lake Tahoe
