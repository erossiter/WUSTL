 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign joined patients  doctors and colleagues today in calling for national medical liability reform to counter soaring malpractice premium costs that have resulted in limited access to patient care   Senator Ensign and Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  then introduced the Help Efficient  Accessible  Low Cost  Timely Healthcare  HEALTH  Act of 2005        Medical liability reform is not a Republican or Democrat issue or even a doctor versus lawyer issue   It is a patient issue     said Ensign     With the medical crisis occurring in Nevada and many states around the nation  our opportunity to enact true reform is here   Comprehensive medical liability reform is the right prescription right now         The HEALTH Act includes a  250 000 cap on non economic damages  joint liability and collateral source improvements  and limits on attorney fees according to a sliding award scale   In addition  the legislation includes an expert witness provision to ensure that relevant medical experts serve as trial witnesses instead of so called   professional witnesses    who are used to further abuse the system   Injured patients would also have access to punitive damages where providers are found to be grossly negligent            This is a medical crisis     said Ensign     A Henderson doctor recently told me about a teenage girl who had to be transported to California by helicopter to receive the care she needed   She had a very serious condition that  if not identified and treated correctly  could lead to death   Because of the medical liability situation  there was no emergency room neurologist on call to assist her   Also  many neurologists are afraid to become involved in difficult cases such as this because of the high risks of medical liability           This legislation is modeled after California  s successful Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act  also known as MICRA   The number of dubious and frivolous lawsuits going to trial has declined dramatically and brought about real reform to California  s liability system
