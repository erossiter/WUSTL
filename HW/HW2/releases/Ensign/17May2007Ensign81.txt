 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign expressed disappointment today after the Senate passed the Democrats  tax and spend budget that includes the largest tax hike in American history and ignores their campaign promises of open government and fiscal discipline  Tax relief passed by the Republicans in 2003  which has contributed to the strong economic growth and prosperity in America  will expire under their plan     Policies that let Americans keep more of their hard earned dollars and simultaneously reduced the deficit are being eliminated  said Ensign  In the state of Nevada  hardworking individuals and families will be harmed by the Democrats failure to extend the sales tax deduction  This enormous budget  which was largely crafted behind closed doors  will negatively impact millions of hard working taxpayers and pass a tremendous debt to future generations  This budget is clearly a step backwards for American taxpayers     Tax relief passed in 2003 has helped create more than 7 9 million new jobs and has helped reduce the federal deficit by half  three years before estimates  because of increased tax revenue  Letting these tax cuts expire will result in a  736 billion tax increase in the next five years  three times the largest ever in United States history  Also  this budget makes nearly no attempt to protect future generations from the  69 trillion obligation of long term entitlement spending facing America     The Democrats pledged an open  honest government and fiscal restraint during the last elections  Clearly this was empty rhetoric  said Ensign  Democrats have resorted to tax and spend policies behind closed doors  and they must be held accountable for this hypocrisy  This budget ignores the best interest of taxpayers and our country     This budget jeopardizes the extension of the Marriage Penalty Tax Relief and Child Tax Credit  and it does not fund an extension of the sales tax deduction  This tax relief has saved thousands of Nevadan families thousands of dollars
