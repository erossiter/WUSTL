 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign today introduced legislation that will split the overburdened Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and remove Nevada from the court  s jurisdiction   Under Ensign  s bill Nevada  along with Arizona  Idaho and Montana  will be part of a new Twelfth District Court  which would be able to hear cases in Las Vegas        This is a necessary action for anyone who believes  as I do  that justice delayed is justice denied     Ensign said     The Ninth Circuit Court  s unmanageable caseload has denied justice for too many Americans  and the time has come to act         The Ninth Circuit  located in San Francisco  is the largest court in the country  encompassing 20  of the population of the United States   Three of the states in its current jurisdiction    Nevada  Arizona  and Idaho    are among the top five fastest growing states in the nation        The Ninth Circuit Court has more cases that have been on hold for more than a year than all other circuit courts combined     Ensign said     We can no longer allow such a grotesquely overburdened court to function in its present form         Ensign also expressed concern over the court  s ideological leaning as part of his motivation to get Nevada out of the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit  citing specifically the court  s ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because it contains the phrase   under God           Many of the court  s rulings reflect a set of values that are odds with the majority of the people of Nevada     Ensign said     I look forward to seeing Nevada  s residents served by a new court in a new location with a viewpoint closer to their own
