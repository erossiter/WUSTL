 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign said today that he will continue to fight for Nevadans   state sales tax deduction despite Senate Democrats   defeat of its renewal tonight   Democrats defeated a bill that contained the deduction  thereby costing Nevadans hundreds of millions of dollars in tax relief   Ensign voted to preserve the tax deduction       Tonight the Democrats won and Nevada taxpayers lost  but this fight is not over     said Ensign     It took us years to get this tax relief for Nevada and other states  and we will not sit by and let it be taken from us   For those Nevadans who have been saving their receipts for the past seven months in order to save money when they file their tax returns  I can only say keep those receipts because we will continue the fight to preserve this tax relief        Because Nevada has no state income tax  Nevadans are allowed to deduct a portion of their sales tax from their federal tax returns  saving most families hundreds of dollars each year   This deduction expired last December and Republicans have worked to extend this measure of tax fairness   An extension of that deduction was part of the bill defeated by Senate Democrats tonight         Coupled with the historic reductions in the death tax  a reasonable increase in the minimum wage and critical tax relief for research and development  this bill should have been a win for each and every family  ranch  service worker and small business in Nevada     Ensign said     Rest assured  the work to renew this tax relief for Nevadans has already begun because the sales tax deduction is too important for Nevada  s future prosperity        Ensign pointed out that almost 126 000 families in Nevada earning less than  50 000 annually benefit from the state sales tax deduction       Ensign has been recognized by the National Taxpayers Union as a Taxpayers   Friend each year he has been in the Senate and has repeatedly been recognized for his taxpayer friendly record by Citizens Against Government Waste and Americans for Tax Reform
