 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign warned of a fiscal disaster for future generations if runaway government spending is not curtailed as he voted no on the 2007 Budget Resolution and  9 trillion debt ceiling increase in recent days       We need to think about the fiscal crisis awaiting the next generation of Americans and the legacy of debt we are leaving for our children   Washington must start setting priorities and reigning in spending     Ensign said     I voted no on the budget out of concern for Congress   spending habits   We cannot continue down this road because the consequences are too great        Ensign said the budget became laden with amendments that pushed it to more than       10 billion over the spending limit set by Congress   He said he voted against a  9 trillion debt ceiling because that level of debt would adversely impact America  s economy       Too many members of Congress are too involved in grabbing what they can for their states or districts without enough emphasis on overall fiscal restraint for the sake of the nation as a whole     Ensign said     We need to usher in a new era of fiscal sanity   I am not willing to subject my children and grandchildren to the level of debt that Congress has created   America has a wonderful tradition of ensuring that the next generation will be better off than their parents   I do not want my children to be denied that promise   A legacy of debt almost assures that will be the case        Ensign  along with six Republican colleagues  is a member of the Senate Fiscal Watch Team   The group  s goal is to offer measures to reform the spending system in Washington
