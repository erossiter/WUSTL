 Washington  DC   U S  Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada announced today that they have successfully fought to put Las Vegas on the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  funding list for the 2008 fiscal year   The announcement follows meetings the senators initiated and led last September with Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to discuss the issue      This funding is vital to Nevada first responders and our state s security   said Reid   It will protect the people of Nevada and the millions of tourists who visit our state each year   I m pleased Senator Ensign and I were able to work with Secretary Chertoff to ensure Las Vegas gains necessary funding based on the additional risk that comes with being a world class tourist destination   I m also very grateful for the efforts of Giles Vanderhoof  Nevada s Homeland Security Director and other officials in our state who worked with the Department of Homeland Security to make this possible       It is imperative that we do all we can to ensure the safety of Nevada residents and the millions of tourists from around the world who visit Las Vegas   said Ensign    I am pleased that Secretary Chertoff listened to our concerns and agreed with us on the importance of securing additional resources to prepare our state s first responders   Our congressional delegation will continue the fight to make sure that Nevada is receiving its fair share of homeland security funds      Cities that attract high tourist volume have been identified by the Department of Homeland Security as potential terrorist targets   This program exists to provide additional resources to urban areas that have greater security needs  to fund first responders  and to support the state and local resources needed to prevent  respond to  and recover from acts of terrorism and other disasters
