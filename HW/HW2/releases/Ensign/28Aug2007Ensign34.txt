 Reno  Nevada  Senator John Ensign welcomed members of the American Legion to Reno for their 89th annual convention today  Ensign  a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  thanked the delegates for their service and continued commitment to our nation   Ensigns speech follows    Good afternoon  I want to welcome you to Reno  Nevada  It is truly an honor to be addressing such an esteemed group of Americans  Ronald Reagan once said  Those who say that were in a time when there are no heroes just dont know where to look  You here today  and those standing for freedom in Iraq  Afghanistan and around the world  are my heroes  I applaud you for your service  your patriotism  and your continued commitment to this country  I also want to thank members of the American Legion Auxiliary for their devotion to our veterans for almost 90 years  Every year I attend a Memorial Day commemoration at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery  Its always a very moving ceremony  but it is the sea of veterans with their colored caps representing the various veterans service organizations that makes it so special  This last year  a veteran in his 80s with almost no eyesight joined us at the end to play his bugle  He said it was all he had left in the world  and he played Taps like I had never heard before  Each note seemed to represent something meaningful to hima memory from his service  a comrade  or a feeling from his heart about what this country means  It was incredibly moving  and something I wont forget  It reminded me how special our veterans are How much they have sacrificed for this country And how much their lives are touched and changed forever  You dont just return from military service and leave those experiences behind They become part of you for the rest of your life  Ive also heard that from our newest veteransthose returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  I had the privilege of meeting a young man who lost a leg in Iraq and returned home with shrapnel imbedded throughout his body  He earned four Purple Hearts  and I was overwhelmed by his patriotism and his courage  He comes from a military family11 out of 13 family members served  He told me that he can deal with the physical challenges he facesits the mental anguish that has been hardest  And hes not alone  Thats why the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act that we recently passed is so important  This legislation specifically addresses shortcomings in the treatment and care of our men and women in uniform  as well as those in veteran status  It tackles inconsistencies in Pentagon and VA disability ratings  provides more money for the diagnosis and treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  and significantly strengthens support for the families of those injured  The legislation also requires that an initial mental health evaluation be provided to veterans or returning service members no later than 30 days following a request for such an evaluation  These are all critical measures to provide our veterans with the best care possible  and you absolutely deserve it  Since George Bush became President and I became a U S  Senator  Congress has increased spending on veterans by 77 percent and increased spending on veterans health care by 83 percent  Youd be hard pressed to find a Senator with a more fiscally conservative record than me  but Ive always fought for increased funding for veterans  Because very simply  without you  there would be no United States of America  You created  shaped  and maintained the finest military in the worldbar none  For that you deserve our eternal appreciationwhich must be expressed in more than just words of thanks  And we must also say more than thank you to the men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who are fighting to secure us and defend our freedom  They are engaged in a battle against radical Islamic fundamentalists who seek to destroy our country  annihilate our citizens  and convert the world to their way of life  Unfortunately  not everyone in our country understands the threat we are facing  We have leaders who think it is a better idea to leave Iraq  They want to withdraw our troops  run home  and hide  Thank God  we have a Commander in Chief who isnt willing to stand down  He understands that if we leave Iraq today  the battle will move to our shores  Not only that  but it would be irresponsible of us to retreat from this threat  only to pass it along for future generations to fight  Thats not why you stood up to the Nazis  or to communism  or to other forms of evil that threatened our nation  You stood up to protect us  to protect freedom  and to protect our future  And that is what we must do today  And we should do it together  This is a time of war  and we need to be united in our resolve  We should not be Republicans or Democratswe should be Americans  And we should be Americans who support our troops with more than just empty rhetoricwe must also support their mission  Right now  with the surge finally in full force  our troops on the ground are making great progress  Found and cleared IEDs  vehicle borne IEDs  and caches are approximately 50 percent higher than last year  due in large part to increased effective tips from concerned Iraqi citizens  Iraqi police and security forces have stepped up and are making great improvements  Also  the number of Iraqi civilian casualties is down significantly  In a few short weeks  General Petraeus will provide Congress with a progress report on Iraq  It is irresponsible for leaders of this country to begin calling for a troop withdrawal based on speculation about the report  I urge my colleagues to show the world that we can unite  that we can put party politics aside and forge ahead as Americans  President Lincoln said the best way to serve your party is to put your country first  We owe it to the men and women sacrificing their lives around the world and to their families whose contributions at home are immeasurable  And we owe it to you  our veterans  You fought for this nation  many of your brothers and sisters died for this nation  and we must carry the banner of freedom in your name  For the 80 year old bugle player  the young veteran of Iraq with his physical and emotional wounds  and for the proud members of the American Legion  I salute you  and I thank you from the bottom of my heart  God bless you  and God bless America
