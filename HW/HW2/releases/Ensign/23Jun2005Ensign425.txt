 Washington  D C     Senator Ensign thanked federal government officials and City of Las Vegas representatives for their assistance in securing handicapped parking spaces in close proximity to the Lloyd D  George United States Courthouse and the Foley Federal Building in Las Vegas   Ensign had requested that accessible parking be made available after disabled individuals complained about the difficulty of visiting his office          Federal government buildings are built with taxpayers   dollars  and it is a slap in the face to disabled individuals when they cannot access the services provided at those buildings     Ensign said     I appreciate the responsiveness of the General Services Administration and the City of Las Vegas in making accessible parking available         Following Ensign  s inquiry  seven metered parking spaces in a City of Las Vegas parking lot adjacent to the federal buildings were redesignated as non metered parking spaces for individuals with disabilities          I believe that federal  state and local governments should lead by example     Ensign said     We were able to work together on this problem  and now members of the disabled community have equal access to federal facilities just as they would to private businesses
