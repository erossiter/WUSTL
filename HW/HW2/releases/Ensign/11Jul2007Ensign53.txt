  Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign released the following statement today after the Office of Management and Budget announced that the federal deficit has decreased by  43 billion since last year    As a result of the tax cuts put in place over the last several years  weve encouraged investment and economic growth that is helping to decrease the federal deficit  We need to do more  but were on pace to balance the budget in five years  this is a lofty goal but a necessary one that will help bring fiscal responsibility back to Washington   Despite this progress  Senate Democrats want to impose the largest tax increase in American history on hard working families  small businesses and people saving for retirement  We need fiscal discipline  not more taxes and more spending  Instead of the Democrats tax and spend budget  I hope Congress extends key tax relief  such as the Child Tax Credit  capital gains and dividends  that has kept our economy strong
