 Washington  DC U S  Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid of Nevada sent the attached letter to Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman calling on him to provide loan guarantees for geothermal energy and funding for geothermal research and development    Nevada produced close to 300 megawatts of geothermal energy in 2006 and hundreds of megawatts are scheduled to come online in the next few years  The spread of geothermal energy throughout Nevada is strengthening and diversifying rural economies across the state and saving tens of thousands of gallons of water that would be used by traditional fossil fuel plants  The continued spread of geothermal energy will be jeopardized without Department of Energy  DOE  funding for geothermal research and development  New technologies and solid financing will help deliver that supply sooner and more cost effectively    The DOEs loan guarantee program was passed into law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in order to help spur investment in new  clean energy technologies  Unfortunately  the DOE has omitted funding for geothermal energy from their Notice of Proposed Rulemaking submitted this past May  Earlier this year  the DOE also released plans to shut down its geothermal research and development program    Investing in geothermal energy will help Nevadas rural communities by stabilizing power costs  expanding and diversifying their tax base  and creating high paying jobs  said Reid  I hope this letter signed by a group of bipartisan western Senators will finally convince the Department of Energy to stop opposing geothermal energy    Nevadas potential for producing alternative forms of energy should be explored  and funding this research and development is important for Nevada and the nation  said Ensign  who chaired the first hearing on alternative energy technologies last year  Finding new and innovative ways to make America energy independent is essential to both our economic and national security  In Nevada we have developing technologies with the capacity to not only stimulate our growing economy but also help shake our reliance on foreign sources of oil   Geothermal energy is produced when the heat of the earth heats groundwater that is close to the earths surface  When reservoirs of heated groundwater are located close to surface  wells can be drilled into the earth that extract the water and inject it into turbines where the steam produces electricity  That water is then re injected back into the reservoir to maintain the reservoir  The process is then repeated  Ten other Democratic and Republican lawmakers joined Reid and Ensign in their letter  The full text of the letter is attached
