 Washington  D C     Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid  in a joint statement for a House Committee on Government Reform Subcommittee on Federal Workforce and Agency Organization hearing called today by Rep  Jon Porter  renewed the delegation  s call for a suspension of the Yucca Mountain license application due to faulty and fraudulent science        The entire premise of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository is that it will safely contain spent nuclear fuel for hundreds of thousands of years   It is becoming increasingly clear that the agencies in charge of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository cannot establish Yucca Mountain safety by using sound science  thus must manipulate the data to suit their predetermined decision     the Senators   statement reads          There are significant scientific controversies and unresolved issues regarding Yucca Mountain  including the recent revelations that critical scientific data have been falsified   All of these issues can  and must  be addressed before we go forward   There are also concerns about the Department  s testing and approval of storage and transportation casks  not to mention a transportation plan that includes loading spent nuclear fuel onto slow moving barges           As Senators from Nevada  we are interested in ensuring the Department of Energy maintains the highest level of integrity during this process   In any analysis of options  it is crucial that the Department maintain its independence and scientific credibility   By predetermining the outcome of the process before all of the information has been received and analyzed  the Department has significantly diminished its impartiality and credibility   It is clear that there is no such thing as sound science at Yucca Mountain   Until these issues are resolved and sound science becomes the driving force behind administration policies and decisions regarding the proposed Yucca Mountain repository  we call on the Department of Energy to put its license application on hold
