 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign today expressed disagreement with the recommendations of the Department of Defense  DoD  to close the Hawthorne Army Depot and to transfer the National Guard  s C 130s from Nevada out of the state   Ensign issued a statement to members of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission  who are holding a regional hearing in New Mexico today        Hawthorne has the largest  most diverse  and environmentally compliant conventional demilitarization capability in the Department of Defense depot system     Ensign said     But Hawthorne is more than just a demil facility  it is a community  a community comprised of hard working men and women who struggle to live the American dream  the dream of a steady job and raising a family in small town Nevada         Ensign challenged data used by the DoD to determine the economic impact of closing the Hawthorne Army Depot   The DoD considered Hawthorne to be part of the Reno Sparks Metropolitan Area when Hawthorne is 133 miles from Reno        The real data does not lie     Ensign said     When weighed against Hawthorne  s employable population of 1 860  the numbers tell a bleak story   The Nevada Commission on Economic Development calculates that       539 jobs will be lost by the closure of Hawthorne  totaling a 27  job loss for the local community           Ensign then questioned the DoD recommendation to relocate the eight Nevada Air National Guard C 130s to Little Rock  Arkansas             When one realizes that Nevada is the fastest growing state in the union and is twice the size of the six New England states combined  the loss of Nevada  s complement of C 130s would compromise the ability of the state to respond to a variety of emergencies     Ensign said
