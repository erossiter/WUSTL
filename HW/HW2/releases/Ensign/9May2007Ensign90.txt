 Washington  D C    Despite campaign rhetoric to address soaring gas prices  Democrats have yet to achieve their promise of relief at the gas pump   When gas prices spiked last year  Democrats held a press conference at a Capitol Hill gas station touting the need for real solutions and pledging to lower prices   At that same gas station today  a gallon costs  3 05 and experts are predicting prices to continue rising      Democrats in Congress have made a lot of promises to lower prices at the pump  but across America families planning vacations  commuters traveling to work and small businesses preparing a budget are still waiting for a plan that addresses soaring gas prices   said Ensign  who appeared on MSNBC today to discuss high gas prices    By developing our domestic resources and encouraging the use of alternative energy  America can reduce its dependence on foreign oil   Half of our oil is imported from OPEC nations such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela  a policy that threatens not only our economic engine but also our national security      Democrats have yet to bring a comprehensive energy bill to the floor of the United States Senate   One of the bills they are considering was drafted by California Senator Barbara Boxer  whose solution lacks substance because it focuses on making government buildings more efficient   This type of feel good legislation does not help average Americans at the pump  Conservation is needed  but we also must address supply and develop our infrastructure     Experts link high prices to production shortages that can be traced to a continued lack of refining capacity   A new refinery has not been built in America since 1976 because of high costs and bureaucratic red tape  which further increases our reliance on foreign oil   Diversifying our energy supply is also a critical component to a comprehensive plan  including environmentally safe exploration of Alaska s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge      Democrats need to address these concerns because America needs real solutions to help families at the gas pump   We need more than photo ops  talking points and rhetoric   said Ensign    Last year the Democrats blocked our plans to move America toward energy independence  and today their plans are short on substance   The Democrats  campaign promises are catching up with them        Ensign discusses high gas prices on MSNBC  CLICK HERE
