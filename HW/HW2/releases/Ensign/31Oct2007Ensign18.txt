 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign today testified before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works against storing high level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain Ensign stressed the importance of storing the waste where it is created   Today  we continued to make the case to keep deadly nuclear waste out of Nevada  said Ensign It is time for the Senate to recognize Yucca for what it is  flawed  irresponsible and going nowhere   His remarks full are included below   STATEMENT OF Senator John Ensign   As Prepared for Delivery   I want to thank the Chair  the Ranking  and other members of the Committee for the opportunity to present testimony on storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain I firmly believe that a storage site at Yucca Mountain should not be built and will not be built   At the outset  I want to be clear that I am not against nuclear power I believe that it presents this nation with a viable clean air energy alternative that can help our nation meet its growing needs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil In fact  nuclear energy currently provides 20  of Americas electricity What I am against is building a  60 to  100 billion repository that is scientifically unsound and Nuclear power is an important investment  but one that cannot be made idly With nuclear power generation comes waste  and this nation must be responsible and manage the waste in the safest manner possible   The proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is not a responsible solution Not a shovel has turned to begin building the actual repository intended to hold tons of hazardous  highly radioactive nuclear waste Yucca Mountain is already 20 years behind schedule  with its new opening date estimated in 2017 or beyond It is time to face reality  the repository will never be built because of the numerous and insurmountable scientific  safety  and technical problems with the site In addition  nearly three decades of poor management and oversight have demonstrated that the vast body of scientific and technical work done by the Department of Energy  DOE  and its contractors is still incomplete or moot  due to faulty science and constantly changing designs for the repository  none of which have been proven to meet scientific standards In spite of all of this  aware of the flaws and failures  DOE is still pushing forward to file its license application in June of 2008   Yucca has experienced one set back after another Some of these setbacks can be credited to the hard work of the Nevada delegation and others who have fought to cut the budget of Yucca Mountain  Others have been the result of sheer incompetence    EPAs radiation protection standards have been rejected and criticized because the standards are wholly inadequate  do not meet the laws requirements  and do not protect the public health and safety   The Yucca Mountain Project has suffered nearly three decades of scientific and quality assurance problems with transportation plans  corrosion of casks  the effectiveness of materials  etc   causing DOE to suspend work on the surface facilities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a stop work order on the containers  DOE revealed that documents and models about water infiltration into the ground water at Yucca Mountain had been falsified  costing the taxpayer million of dollars and jeopardizing the citizens of Nevada  New evidence placed the location of the Bow Ridge earthquake fault line directly beneath where DOE had designed the cooling pads for thousands of tons of highly radioactive spent fuel forcing last minute redesign    Given the numerous problems and failures at Yucca Mountain  both policymakers and industry are recognizing the realityYucca Mountain is not a safe  sound waste solution In fact  just recently  the Heritage Foundation  an advocate for Yucca  stated that We need to move beyond a Yucca only approach to spent fuel And  earlier this month Frank Bowman  the President and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute  NEI   the policy organization of the nuclear energy and technologies industry  made some very candid comments when asked about the Yucca Mountain project in an interview He stated that  a couple of years ago  we began thinking  Shouldn t we take Yucca Mountain and move it off the critical path Is there another approach that we ve been missing  because we have been so Yucca centric These are provocative  realistic statements coming from those who have been avidly pro Yucca in the past   Now we have the opportunity to face reality and move forward with sensible solutions  responsibly managing our nations nuclear waste It can be done Fortunately  scientists agree Not only do we have the technology to implement safe  on site dry cask storage  but also the technology is there to reprocess our waste  which must be part of any long term waste solution   On site dry cask storage is a viable  safe  and secure alternative that is readily available and will allow science and industry the time to catch up Dry casks are being safely used at 34 sites throughout the country NEI projects that 83 of the 103 active reactors will have dry storage by 2050 That is why Senator Reid and I have introduced the Federal Accountability for Nuclear Waste Storage Act of 2007  which would amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to require commercial nuclear power plant operators to transfer spent nuclear fuel into dry casks at independent spent fuel storage facilities located on site with the nuclear reactors These spent fuel storage facilities would be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and operated by the Department of Energy  who will also have the ownership title of the waste DOE was scheduled to begin taking title to spent nuclear fuel in 1998  but because of the myriad of technical  scientific  legal  and political problems surrounding the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository  this has not happened Taking title to spent nuclear fuel fulfills the federal governments obligation and commitment to retake control over nuclear materials This proposed on site storage will cost only a fraction of the proposed Yucca dump  the pursuit of which has already wasted billions of taxpayers dollars It is a responsible solution and it is available now   Storing the waste on site will allow the necessary time to develop a viable reprocessing program using advanced fuel cycle technologies I have long believed that we need to invest and develop these technologies as they are the critical components to long term waste management Todays reprocessing technology makes it possible to recycle and use the byproducts  which retain enormous amounts of energy  to generate new  affordable  and clean fuel Consensus is leaning toward using reprocessing technologies that have the potential to transform the waste  make it less hazardous over a shorter amount of time  and also reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal In fact  France has proven itself a model of success Using current technology  France is on target to reprocess 98 percent of its fuel  providing close to 10 percent of its power needs  and has done so without incident for years    Many of the technologies being researched today would develop processes that do not produce pure plutonium  removing the concern of proliferation If there is a positive side to the insurmountable problems facing Yucca Mountain it is that it has given impetus to the nuclear industry and other supporters of enhanced nuclear power opportunities to be open to other ideas for waste disposal  If we give industry the confidence and security that the market exists to reprocess and convert spent nuclear fuel  I am confident that the technology  both with respect to reactors and reprocessing  will develop to match our power and security needs    We can meet the energy needs of this nation if we begin to develop our domestic resources Nuclear energy is one of those resources and it can have tremendous long term benefits to this nation However  in order to harness its power we must manage the waste in the most safe  secure  and scientifically sound manner possible Yucca Mountain is not that solution It is time to move past Yucca Mountain The project is expensive Now is not the time to squander money  resources  and time on a project doomed to fail Rather  now is the time to pursue real solutions One of the solutions available immediately is to store waste safely on site as we develop viable reprocessing technologies
