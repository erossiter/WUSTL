 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement as the Senate prepares to debate the Iraq resolution supported by Democrats this week      This is yet another attempt by Senate Democrats to micromanage the war while avoiding responsibility   This resolution handcuffs our troops and sets an unrealistic timetable  neither of which will make America safer   Our men and women in uniform are fighting insurgents  terrorists and al Qaeda in Iraq  and we cannot restrict their abilities to only  limited purposes  in combat  which is what the legislation would do   Instead  we should be providing our troops with every resource they need to accomplish their mission      Our success in Iraq is not dependent upon politics  procedural tactics or presidential posturing   It is dependent upon the success of our troops and the plan put forward by the Commander in Chief and General David Petraeus  whose nomination received unanimous support in the United States Senate   Now is not the time for politics   It is time to support our troops and give General Petraeus and his plan a chance to succeed      There has already been progress on the ground since the  surge  began   Militant groups in Baghdad are abandoning their positions  the Iraqi government is commiting more resources to secure the Baghdad area  and Iraqis are encouraged because they had feared an American pullout as described in the media   We need to give this plan a chance to succeed because our national security depends upon it   We cannot afford to fail      The Democrats  bill being considering this week is S J Res 9
