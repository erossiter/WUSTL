 Mr  ENSIGN  Mr  President  I appreciate the efforts that the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member have made on this legislation  They are working hard to help out the people who have been affected by Hurricane Katrina on the gulf coast      All of our hearts go out to the people in the gulf region  The devastation that region has experienced simply cannot be put into words  The issue we are considering tonight is not what kind of assistance should be provided to evacuees but how that assistance should be provided and whether this should be done by unanimous consent      The administration has taken administrative steps to provide necessary medical care to evacuees  They have provided Medicaid waivers to certain states  Secretary Leavitt has pledged additional waivers to states that request one if the request is reasonable  For its part  Congress has already approved  62 billion for the recovery of victims and their care  I am concerned that this bill involves new spending rather than reprogramming a part of the  62 billion Congress has already appropriated  This bill would add an additional  8 9 billion in spending on top of the money FEMA has already been given      We should make some changes to this bill  I have serious concerns about four provisions included in this bill  First  this bill provides for temporary expansion of Medicaid  Second  it requires that the federal government provide 100  FMAP for Louisiana  Mississippi and affected counties in Alabama  This is a dangerous precedent and removes any incentive for these states to keep Medicaid costs down  Third  it holds 29 states harmless from a scheduled FMAP reduction in 2006  This means the federal government continues to pay more of the costs  even in states with few or no Hurricane Katrina evacuees  My final concern is that this bill also increases spending by  8 9 billion and probably unnecessarily so given the steps that Congress and the Administration have already taken      Any legislative proposal should be well thought out and fiscally responsible  If these services can be provided administratively  which HHS says they can  we should allow HHS to do so  Congress does not  and should not  alter the Medicaid formula as this bill seeks to      We  as a Congress  need to get a better handle on the money being spent  We have an obligation to those affected by the hurricane as well as to those Americans we are asking to help pay the costs of relief  We must ensure this money is spent wisely      I object to the unanimous consent
