 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign pointed to the growing threat of government seizure of private property as reason for Congress to pass comprehensive property protection legislation   Ensign attributed the increased threat to the United States Supreme Court decision one year ago Friday in Kelo v  City of New London  Connecticut       Americans should be outraged     Ensign said     More than 5 700 properties across the country have been threatened or taken since the Supreme Court decided last year to expand eminent domain for private commercial development   It is time to put an end to this eroding of our Constitutionally protected property and rights        Following the Kelo decision  Senator Ensign introduced the Private Property Rights Protection Act that would deny federal funds to state and local governments if they seize private property for economic development or to give it to another private party   The bill also denies tax benefits to private corporations that acquire wrongfully condemned property  thereby removing the economic incentive to acquire such land       I want to applaud the citizen driven efforts across the country to protect private property     Ensign said     In Nevada  more than 136 000 residents joined the People s Initiative to Stop the Taking of Our Land  or PISTOL  seeking an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to prevent further abuse of eminent domain   This should not rest solely on the shoulders of citizens   State and federal governments need to work together to preserve individuals   property rights        According to a report by the Institute of Justice and the Castle Coalition  more than 5 700 properties nationwide have been threatened by or taken with eminent domain for private development in just the past year   There were twice as many instances in the five year period preceding the Kelo decision
