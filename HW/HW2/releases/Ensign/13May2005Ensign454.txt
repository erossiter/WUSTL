 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign is cosponsoring legislation designed to crack down on the use of spyware technology   Spyware allows others to access personal information or send unwanted information to consumers without their consent   Ensign joined Senators George Allen and Gordon Smith in introducing the Enhanced Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act        We must give our federal agencies the means and resources to track and prosecute those who use spyware technology to victimize unsuspecting consumers     Ensign said     The fear of identity theft or other online fraud can stifle economic growth  and we have a responsibility to do what we can to protect consumers         The Enhanced Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act provides for the authorization of  10 million in additional resources to the Federal Trade Commission for enforcement efforts   It also provides a federal standard for anti spyware laws to provide uniform enforcement and increases the civil and criminal penalties for those who use spyware        Simply passing laws is not enough because most of those committing fraud or other crimes through the use of spyware are already violating the law     Ensign said     We need to provide the tools and resources to stop these crimes and establish sufficient penalties to deter criminals   Senator Allen has struck a careful balance between protecting consumers from unwanted spyware without stifling innovation   I applaud his leadership on this issue         The legislation provides the FTC with additional authority to coordinate efforts and share information with foreign law enforcement agencies since much of the distribution of spyware legislation is done from off shore locations
