 Washington  D C     Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid said today that a newly released study by the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  is a positive development in Nevada  s fight against a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain   The NAS report  according to the senators  calls for studies and reports on the transportation of nuclear waste that have previously not been undertaken       As we  ve said many times before  the more we delay Yucca Mountain the closer we are to defeating it once and for all     Ensign said     The tone on Capitol Hill is shifting dramatically when it comes to Yucca Mountain  from a feeling of inevitability to a realization that we must consider alternatives   NAS  s recommendation that a full scale security study be conducted verifies our long standing concerns about the risk of a terrorist attack or other possible catastrophe         I agree we should have a full scale security study before we consider transporting nuclear waste  but my concerns run much deeper   said Reid   The standards set by a security study would be meaningless unless they re strictly enforced  The Department of Energy has repeatedly failed to meet the scientific  technical and legal standards set for Yucca Mountain  I do not trust them to uphold any guidelines for transportation  I appreciate the efforts of all the talented people at NAS  but all they have really concluded is that nuclear waste can be transported safely under very strict conditions if no mistakes are made  That is not enough      Among other recommendations  the NAS study calls for an in depth examination of transportation security issues  expert evaluation of the effect of transportation on local communities and a review of extreme accident or fire scenarios     The NAS study was mandated by Congress in 2003
