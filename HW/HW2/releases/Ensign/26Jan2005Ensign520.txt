 Washington  D C     United States Senator John Ensign introduced legislation today to correct a tax inequity imposed on owners of ready mixed concrete and sanitation trucks   Currently  owners of these dual use vehicles are taxed for the fuel they consume while driving and for the fuel that is consumed while operating for a secondary purpose such as turning the mixer drum or lifting a dumpster and compacting trash         Our tax code imposes a federal tax on fuel sold for use in highway vehicles   This makes sense because vehicles that use our roads cause wear and tear  and the money raised from the fuel tax goes directly into the highway trust fund for road repair and maintenance     said Ensign     The code also provides a fuel tax exemption for   off highway   use so that fuel used by non highway vehicles is not taxed   Unfortunately  the Internal Revenue Service is not enforcing the code consistent with Congressional intent  and that has created an inequity for owners of these dual use vehicles         Technological strides have created more efficiency by utilizing one engine for both tasks   As a result  owners of dual use vehicles began to estimate the amount of fuel taxes they paid for fuel related to off road use and would claim a tax credit for that amount   The environment has benefited from these advances  but the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  has punished rather than encourage this progress        When the IRS decided to ignore its own regulation  it penalized efficiency  conservation and good environmental practices   This is the wrong approach  especially for Nevada  where our construction industry is a critical part of our booming economy     said Ensign     My legislation establishes an annual  250 00 per vehicle tax credit to restore fairness and the intent of Congress
