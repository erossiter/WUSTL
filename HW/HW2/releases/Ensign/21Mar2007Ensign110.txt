 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign introduced an amendment to the budget today that ensures that funding designated for our troops is only used for that purpose   Currently  defense funds are being raided to pay for social spending   After the defense funds are taken  the same defense item must be paid for in an emergency spending bill      Intentionally underfunding our troops and then using the money for social programs must stop   said Ensign    The result of these budgeting dishonesties is that our troops become pawns in budget games  and it is disgraceful   The Democrats  budget gimmicks allow for reckless  uncontrolled spending that is only going to burden future generations with enormous debt        Earlier this year  Democrats intentionally underfunded Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  by  3 1 billion  spent the funds elsewhere and then added it to the upcoming Emergency Defense Supplemental bill   BRAC funds are used to ensure housing for troops when they return from overseas   Money shifted from defense spending to non defense spending cost  84 billion from 2002 to 2006   Ensign s Defense Firewall amendment would stop this practice and keep our troops as America s top priority      These dishonest budget gimmicks continue the Democrats  trend of hypocrisy  and it is time we end these deplorable practices   said Ensign    It is time for a transparent  honest budget process  just like the one the Democrats campaigned on  and the Defense Firewall is a great start toward accomplishing that goal
