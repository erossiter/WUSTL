 Washington  D C   Today Senator John Ensign was named to the Finance Committee  a key panel that has broad jurisdiction over tax policy  entitlement programs and trade related matters   Im looking forward to serving on the Finance Committee  said Ensign  This seat provides me with a better opportunity to advance several of my top legislative priorities  such as reducing taxes  encouraging investment  making government more efficient and reforming our entitlement programs for future generations   The Finance Committee touches almost every aspect of the federal government ranging from Social Security and Medicare to taxes and trade agreements  These issues are not new to Ensign  As a member of the House of Representatives  Ensign was appointed as a freshman to the Finance panels counterpart  the Ways and Means Committee   Sen  Ensign has been a leader on key issues before the Finance Committee  health care  tax relief and entitlement reform  He will be a huge asset to the committee  said Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  As I told John when I made this decision  we appreciate his efforts on behalf of the Conference  And its important to recognize the efforts of people who do the heavy lifting around here on behalf of the whole team   The Nevada Congressional delegation is probably as strong as it has ever been with two seats on Ways and Means in the House and two members of leadership in the Senate  said Ensign  who is Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee  My appointment to the Finance Committee makes our delegation even stronger and better positioned to represent Nevadas interests  including gaming  mining and tourism to name a few   Ensign was selected by McConnell  whose decision was confirmed by GOP senators early this afternoon  The last Nevadan to serve on the Finance Committee was former Senator Richard Bryan who held the post until 2000  The passing of Senator Craig Thomas created an opening on the panel
