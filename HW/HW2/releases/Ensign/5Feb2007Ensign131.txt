 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement today after the President released his budget proposal      Washington needs to return to fiscal responsibility  and the President s plan puts us on a path to balance the budget in five years without raising taxes on American families and the small businesses that keep our economy strong   I believe we can demonstrate even more restraint than that and achieve a balanced budget sooner   But this is a step in the right direction for our economy and for future generations      Our Nevada delegation has fought Yucca Mountain on every front  and by working together we can stop this project   While the President s funding for Yucca in 2008 is significantly lower than his requests in recent years  it is not low enough   I remain committed to fighting this wasteful and irresponsible project not only for our health and safety but also because it is fiscally irresponsible  based on false science and bad policy
