 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement after the Senate disregarded the advice of our military commanders and set a timetable for withdrawing our troops from Iraq      Now is not the time for partisanship   We need to come together  demonstrate leadership and join across the aisle to support our troops and the plan put forward by General Petraeus        The Democrats  plan is an attempt to micromanage the day to day operations of the war in Iraq   Withdrawing does not remove us from this fight against radical Islamic extremists   Instead it will cause chaos in a critical region and allow hostile regimes  insurgents  terrorists and al Qaeda to take over   Their victory is certain if we withdraw      President Bush will rightly veto this legislation not only because it signals defeat but also because it is loaded with pet projects  earmarks and reckless spending unrelated to our war efforts   Farm subsidies and guided tours of the U S  Capitol do not belong on an emergency spending bill for our troops   While campaigning the Democrats promised honesty in government and fiscal responsibility  but their actions ignore their rhetoric      We need to give the troop surge plan time to succeed   We all must hope for its success   We have already seen progress as more than 700 extremists have been captured since the troop surge has been implemented   Now is the time to put political party loyalty aside and support our troops as they confront an enemy that wants to destroy our way of life and will follow us home if we leave without accomplishing our mission
