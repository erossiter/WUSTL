 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign voted in favor of legislation that would allow business and trade associations to join together and offer affordable group health insurance to working families   The Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  on which Ensign serves  approved the   Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act    today       Too many Americans are without health insurance     Ensign said     With this legislation  small businesses can finally afford to offer health insurance to their employees   This will greatly reduce the number of uninsured people across the country   It will ensure that patients have access to care when they need it most by making health insurance more accessible and affordable        The bipartisan bill would give small business owners the power to band together through their associations and negotiate for the benefits they want  at prices they can afford   The bill would give small or family owned businesses the opportunity to choose the health plan that is best for the owners  their families  and their employees  whether it  s a basic set of benefits or a more comprehensive option       As a former small business owner  I know how challenging it is to afford health insurance for employees     Ensign said     By letting small businesses come together  they create larger groups that can better negotiate affordable coverage   This will change the future of health care in our nation        A report prepared by the Milwaukee firm of Mercer Oliver Wyman  Inc   for the National Small Business Association found that the legislation would reduce health insurance costs for small business by 12 percent   In today  s dollars that would mean about  1 000 per employee   It would reduce the number of uninsured in working families by eight percent  or approximately one million people
