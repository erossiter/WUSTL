 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement on the Democrats  procedural vote on Iraq today that will shut down debate and block Republican attempts to provide our troops with all the resources they need to complete their mission   This political maneuver by the Democrats is hypocritical to the bipartisanship they promised while campaigning      Iraq is too important an issue for political posturing  and by calling for another vote to shut down debate on Iraq  the Democrats are yet again attempting to block a full  fair and open debate   Our actions impact our brave men and women serving abroad  and instead of playing politics we should all be united behind our troops as Americans      The Senate is the greatest deliberative body in the world  but it s becoming clear that differing views and amendments will not be considered   The Democrats  hypocrisy is becoming a pattern that ignores their promises of bipartisanship      Saturday s vote is nothing short of a political stunt   We should be unified behind our troops and mission because our national security depends upon the success of the President s plan
