 WASHINGTON  D C     U  S  Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign supported legislation today that will boost the use of renewable energy resources  such as wind  solar  geothermal  and biomass  Known as the renewable electricity standard  RES   the legislation requires that 10 percent of electricity sold by utilities producing more than 4 million megawatt hour per year be generated from renewable energy resources       The national legislation will complement Nevada  s renewable electricity standard that requires 15  of the electricity to come from renewable resources by 2013  With unlimited resources throughout the state  Nevada is poised to be a national leader in renewable energy production         Renewable energy will protect consumers from wild price swings by providing a steady  reliable source of power     said Sen  Reid  who cosponsored the legislation    There  s a reason why we call the famous geothermal geyser   Old Faithful      renewable energy is as old as the wind  as durable as the sun  as constant as the earth  Renewable energy will bolster our national security  because it  s Made in the USA and the supply can  t be manipulated by any foreign power  Finally  renewable energy creates jobs  often in the rural areas that need them the most            With passage of this measure we have diversified our energy supply  encouraged the development of renewable resources  and helped protect the environment by reducing emissions     Sen  Ensign said    This is an important part of the comprehensive energy policy Americans are calling for          The Secretary of Energy would be required to implement a program to issue credits that could be traded or sold by utilities that exceed their requirement to those who have not  The price for such credits would be capped at 1 5 cents per kilowatt hour       Other studies have even projected that the effect of the RPS on natural gas prices would result in overall reduction of energy costs for consumers       Additionally  According to the Energy Information Administration  in a study published in May of 2003            New Renewable Energy  The RPS would result in over 350 billion kilowatt hours and 68 000 megawatts of renewable generation between 2008 and 2025  That is enough to supply 56 million US homes           Negligible Cost  The cost to consumers would be about 0 18 percent  or less than one fifth of one percent increase in overall energy prices            Lower Cost of Sulfur Dioxide  The cost of Sulfur dioxide allowances are expected to be 32  lower in 2025 with an RPS than without            Cleaner Environment  The RPS would result in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 2 3  by 2025            Lower Natural Gas Prices  The RPS would reduce natural gas prices by 1 5
