 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement after voting to continue debate and allow for amendments during the Senate s consideration of Iraq resolutions        Iraq is too important an issue to restrict debate and limit amendments   Our success in Iraq is critical to our national security  and the Senate    the greatest deliberative body in the world    should have an open and fair debate   In the past  the Democrats would have strenuously objected to this kind of maneuver  and I applaud my colleagues in the Senate for stopping this ploy             Senator John Ensign
