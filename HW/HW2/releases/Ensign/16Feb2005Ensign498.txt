 Washington  D C  A senior member of the House Resources Committee  Congressman Jim Gibbons  R Nev   and his colleagues Senators Harry Reid  D Nev   and John Ensign  R Nev   and Representatives Shelley Berkley  D Nev   and Jon Porter  R Nev   today re introduced legislation that would convey federal land to build a new heliport in Clark County         As the tourism industry continues to grow  additional stress is placed upon McCarran International Airport and our air tour facilities  This legislation will ensure that our air tour operators have a quality site to conduct their business that will not adversely affect our environment or residential areas     said Gibbons         This bill represents long term relief from helicopter noise for tens of thousands of residents of the Las Vegas Valley  This is not a perfect solution but there is no perfect solution     said Reid    A new heliport will be good for our local economy and good for our quality of life  and I will work hard to ensure that it passes Congress this year            This legislation balances the interests of Las Vegas   air tour operators  the residents of southern Nevada  and the thousands of visitors who take advantage of helicopter tours every year     Ensign stated    With this bill we are able to accommodate a booming Nevada business and protect our natural resources            Helicopter tours are a fun and exciting way to glimpse southern Nevada  s natural beauty  but the noise from these flights is impacting the quality of life for too many residents of the Las Vegas Valley  Moving the heliport to a new location and establishing flight patterns to protect Sloan Canyon are both important compromises needed to protect the environment  reduce noise pollution and to ensure that southern Nevada s air tour operators can continue providing service to our many visitors from around the world     said Berkley        Our thriving tourism industry in Southern Nevada depends upon many of the services that air tour operators provide  which attract many visitors domestically and abroad     added Porter    This legislation will protects those businesses while at the same time  preserve our precious environment and quality of life enjoyed by our residents  I look forward to working with my Nevada colleagues to see this legislation become law          The bill directs the Bureau of Land Management to convey 229 acres for a new Clark County Public Heliport Facility  It seeks to prevent helicopter flights over the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area  except between certain boundaries  Fees paid for tours within the established area over the Conservation area from the new heliport will be made available to the Secretary of Interior for management of cultural  wildlife  and wilderness resources on public lands in Nevada  The Nevada delegation noted that the bill has earned the strong support of Randy Walker  Director of Aviation for Clark County  and they are hopeful it will move expeditiously through Congress
