 Washington  D C   Despite record high gas prices  the Senate is preparing to stop debate on an energy bill in order to bring one of big labors top priorities to the Senate floor  The bill would deny workers the right to cast a private ballot in union organizing elections  and Senate Democrats filed a motion last night to bring it to the floor this week  Instead of having secret ballots that remove workers from intimidation by union bosses  under this bill a union could be formed after a majority of employees publicly sign an approval card  said Ensign  For more than 60 years weve guaranteed workers the right to a private ballot  but now the Democrats want to change that  Unions support removing the secret ballot process because membership has been steadily declining since 1983  Denying workers the right to a secret ballot makes it significantly easier to form or join a union through the public card check system in this bill  Secret election ballots are part of our history and American democracy  said Ensign  This is political payback to unions at the expense of workers rights  Even people who belong to unions prefer the secret ballot process  According to a Zogby poll  78 percent of union workers favor keeping the current private ballot process in place
