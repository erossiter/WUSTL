 Washington  DC U S  Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid of Nevada are again working together to ensure the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump doesn t become a reality  this after U S  Senators Pete Domenici and Larry Craig  today introduced legislation that would allow the Department of Energy to recklessly speed up the licensing process     For the last 25 years  the Yucca Mountain project has been disastrous and has wasted billions of taxpayers  dollars  said Ensign  This bill attempts to circumvent existing hazardous material laws  start construction and increase spending on the broken Yucca Mountain project all prior to license approval  This legislation continues a reckless policy that disregards public safety and fiscal responsibility  I will continue my efforts to end this terrible project     This is an irresponsible piece of legislation  Rather than addressing the problems facing the proposed dump at Yucca Mountain  its supporters are already trying to cram in more waste before it s even built  said Reid  The dump is not based on legal  political  or scientific reality  Rather than trying to force nuclear waste into Yucca Mountain  the DOE should take ownership of nuclear waste and store it at nuclear power plans where it s produced  This is a critical topic that must be addressed as part of the bigger picture of energy independence     Reid and Ensign recently introduced the Federal Accountability for Nuclear Waste Storage Act of 2007 that would eliminate the need for the Yucca Mountain project
