 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign  Chairman of the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force  released the following statement after the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  encouraged competition in the video market by helping speed the entry of telephone companies into the video business      I commend FCC Chairman Kevin Martin and our Republican Commissioners for accelerating and supporting competition in the video market  which will directly benefit the consumer by expanding choices  lowering costs and encouraging investment in broadband networks   While I applaud this move because it helps speed competition  I also encourage the Commission to complete work on the cable docket so that we have unbiased regulations and the government does not pick winners and losers   consumers do      The Broadband Investment and Consumer Choice Act that I introduced would have gone further and moved faster to bring competition to consumers  but the Commission did not have statutory authority to go as far as I had originally proposed   Despite passing good legislation out of the House and out of the Senate Commerce Committee  action on comprehensive telecommunications reform seems unlikely because of the controversial  net neutrality  issue      The FCC s decision is an important step forward in bringing video choice to consumers  and combined with further action by state legislatures  it will spur investment in technology  such as fiber optic networks  that America needs to be more competitive
