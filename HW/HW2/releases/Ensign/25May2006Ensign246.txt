 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign voted against the immigration bill that was approved by the United States Senate this afternoon by a vote of 62 to 36  saying the bill does not uphold the principles for which he has fought during the debate on immigration reform       I was hoping to be able to vote for a bill that first made our borders more secure and then established a temporary worker program that rewarded good behavior and penalized bad   Instead  we got a bill that rewards criminal behavior with Social Security benefits  and I could not support such a flawed bill     Ensign said     The American people want to know that we have control of our borders before we begin discussing amnesty and citizenship for illegal immigrants        Ensign said the bill rewarded criminal behavior by allowing illegal immigrants who had fraudulently obtained someone else  s Social Security number to collect Social Security benefits based on work done illegally         I have many reasons for voting against this bill but the granting of amnesty to those who have committed identity theft and the rewarding of benefits for that illegal act is the most egregious     Ensign said     We should not grant illegal immigrants special consideration to which legal immigrants and American citizens are not entitled        Ensign cast his no vote on the overall bill despite the inclusion of an amendment he authored   The Ensign amendment would deny Earned Income Tax Credit benefits for labor performed while using a Social Security number fraudulently
