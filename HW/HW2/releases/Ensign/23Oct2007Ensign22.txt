    Washington  D C   Today the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator John Ensign that would stop the Social Security Administration  SSA  from paying benefits for work done under a stolen or fraudulent Social Security number Identity theft  a serious problem in the United States  is rewarded under the current Social Security policies Ensigns amendment passed with broad support from both sides of the aisle   Stories about victims of identity theft are all too common in the United States  said Ensign We need to recognize illegal work for exactly what it is  illegal We should not be encouraging people to steal the identity of hard working Americans As it stands today  thats what were doing   There have been many media reports about people who are here illegally stealing Americans Social Security numbers For instance  Audra  a stay at home mom since 2000  had her Social Security number used by 218 different people  all here illegally  to obtain jobs Even though she did not work for six years  the Internal Revenue Service sent her a bill for  1 million in back taxes because their records showed her working for the last three years   Many Southwest states have experienced a crime spree involving people who are here illegally using the stolen identities of children  said Ensign  In one case in Utah  a child apparently owns a cleaning company and works as a prep cook at two restaurants in Salt Lake City  Thats a lot of responsibility    especially for an eight year old boy   Every year employers are advised that nearly 800 000 workers do not have valid  matching Social Security numbers Ensigns amendment would prohibit SSA from processing claims for work performed under a stolen or fraudulent Social Security number As a result  resources at SSA would be freed up to process legitimate claims as the Baby Boomers start to retire Ensigns amendment passed 92 to 2
