 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign today called on Senate Democrats to allow the Child Custody Protection Act to proceed to conference   The bill  which Ensign sponsored  was approved by the Senate last night by a vote of 65 to 34  but Democrats are using procedural tactics to prevent it from moving forward to a conference in which differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill can be reconciled       We worked together in a bipartisan fashion to amend the bill and get it approved and  now that it has been approved  some Democrats are undermining the will of the Senate and the American people by unfairly blocking it     Ensign said     It is underhanded and disingenuous  and it needs to stop now        The Child Custody Protection Act makes it a federal offense to circumvent state parental notification laws by transporting a minor across state lines to have an abortion   Fourteen Democrats joined fifty one Republicans in voting in favor of the bill last night       It is disgraceful that  having found common ground on a contentious issue  we are now dealing with partisan  obstructionist tactics by Democrats     Ensign said     They complained that we should not be spending time on this issue  and now they  re forcing us to spend days overcoming their obstructionist strategy   I hope the American people are paying attention to what the Democrats are doing  and I hope they call on them to cease these actions so we can get this important bill to the President
