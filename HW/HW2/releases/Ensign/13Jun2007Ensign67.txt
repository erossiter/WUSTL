 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign today expressed concern that the Democrats energy plan will raise prices for consumers and will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil   Gas prices have increased by nearly50 percent since Democrats have taken control of Congress  said Ensign Democrats promised lower gas prices  and it is time for them to deliver real solutions The time for talk is over We need a plan that explores our domestic resources  addresses alternative fuels and develops our energy infrastructure The Democrats plan completely misses the mark because it does nothing to lower fuel prices    Oil refinery expansion must also be addressed Refinery capacity has not increased in over 30 years  but demand for oil has increased dramatically Today  Democrats voted down an increase in capacity that would have lowered gas prices for thousands of Nevadans  The amendment would have expanded refinery capacity  including in the Bay Area  where Reno and northern Nevada get the majority of their fuel   American families paying high prices at the pump need relief  not grandstanding  said Ensign Lowering the cost of gas  and other energy sources  must include increasing supply This Democrat bill only punishes those using and producing energy  which will result in even higher gas prices   In order to meet demand  we need to pursue environmentally safe exploration of our domestic resources  which include Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf  both of which are essential to securing Americas energy independence and breaking our dependence on foreign oil  The Democrats bill lacks a comprehensive effort to reduce energy costs because it does not address using our own supply of oil and gas
