 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign made the following statement in reaction to the death of Las Vegas native Kristina Miller  a victim in the recent terror attack in Sharm el Sheik  Egypt        I extend my deepest condolences to Kristina Miller  s family and friends   Unfortunately  the reach of terrorism does not discriminate   The terrorists who plan and carry out these attacks seek to murder and injure as many innocent people as possible   That is exactly why we must remain vigilant in our worldwide war on terrorism   It is in the memory of Kristina and too many other victims of terror attacks that our determination to hunt down these terrorists will not waver
