 Washington  D C    Senators John Ensign  NV  and Lisa Murkowski  AK  introduced legislation today to split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  the largest court in the country  because it is overburdened by an unmanageable caseload   Under this bill  Nevada  along with Alaska  Arizona  Idaho  Oregon  Montana and Washington  would be part of a new Twelfth Circuit      Because of its enormous and growing size  the Ninth Circuit does not have sufficient time to properly handle its caseload   said Ensign    For too long  people s lives have been on hold because the Ninth Circuit is strained beyond its capacity   Justice delayed is justice denied         The Ninth Circuit has become a circuit where justice is not swift and not always served   said Senator Murkowski    The legislation we are introducing today is intended to bring about the sensible reorganization of the Ninth Circuit  No one court can effectively exercise its power in an area that extends from the Arctic Circle to the tropics   The creation of a new Twelfth Circuit will go far in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the current court and will establish a circuit which is more geographically manageable       The sheer size of the Ninth Circuit makes its caseload simply unmanageable   said Senator Ted Stevens  an original co sponsor of the legislation   This inevitably results in delays processing cases  and it also prevents the Court from dealing with unique problems in Alaska  Hawaii  and other small states   This legislation will remedy the Ninth Circuit s limitations by creating two smaller  more efficient Courts   Separate courts will serve the people of each region better and help maintain consistency in caselaw      It takes the Ninth Circuit on average almost one year longer to handle a case when compared to other circuit courts around the country   Located in San Francisco  the court encompasses 20 percent of the population of the United States   Three of the states in its jurisdiction   Nevada  Arizona and Idaho   are among the top five fastest growing states in the nation     In addition to the size constraints  Ensign also raised concern over the San Francisco court s ideological leaning  citing specifically the ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because it contains the phrase  under God       Despite the need for an independent judiciary outside of the political arena  many of the court s rulings reflect a set of values that are at odds with a majority of the people in Nevada   I m hopeful that this bill will move forward so that Nevada residents are served by a court with a viewpoint closer to their own   Ensign added
