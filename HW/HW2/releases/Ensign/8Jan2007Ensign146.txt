 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign introduced a bill that would require Congressional approval before Social Security benefits could be paid to foreign workers who were employed in the United States   Ensign  s bill could prevent illegal immigrants  many of whom have committed identity theft  from collecting Social Security benefits under an agreement the Bush Administration finalized with Mexico   The agreement allows U S  citizens and foreign nationals to receive Social Security benefits for work performed in each country  a move that will provide benefits for illegal immigrants       The U S  Mexico Totalization Agreement is unacceptable and threatens the retirement benefits of hardworking Americans while rewarding those who have committed a felony such as identity theft     said Ensign     My legislation is important to ensure that public debate  scrutiny and analysis take place before vital Social Security dollars are sent overseas        Under current law  a Totalization Agreement becomes effective after it is signed by the President and submitted to Congress  unless one or more chambers specifically reject it   If no Congressional action is taken  the agreements are effective 60 days after submission to Congress   Under Ensign  s bill  the Social Security Totalization Agreement Reform Act  a resolution approved by both the House and Senate  will be required before an agreement could become effective   A companion bill was introduced in the House last week by Representative Barbara Cubin     In 2004  the United States reached a Totalization Agreement with Mexico  but the President has yet to submit it to Congress   The expected impact was made public by a Freedom of Information Act request  which makes it clear that the agreement does nothing to prevent employees from collecting benefits for work done while in the United States illegally   The Government Accountability Office has indicated that this agreement will increase the number of unauthorized workers eligible for Social Security benefits       We should not be rewarding people for illegal work     said Ensign     This is a matter of fairness to the American people and a matter of fiscal responsibility
