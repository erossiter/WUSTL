 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign introduced Nevada Attorney General Brian Sandoval at a Judiciary Committee hearing this afternoon and urged committee members to approve Sandoval  s nomination to the federal bench   Below are Senator Ensign  s remarks to the committee       I  d like to thank my colleagues on the committee for allowing me to come before you today   It is an honor for me to be here to introduce a great Nevadan and a highly qualified candidate for the federal bench       Brian Sandoval  s journey to this confirmation hearing is filled with remarkable accomplishments  a commitment to his community  and a deep desire to serve this nation     I want to thank Brian and his wife  Kathleen  for being here today   I also want to thank their children  James  Madeline  and Marisa  for making this trip   James and Madeline must be upset about missing school  but I  m sure they realize what an important day this is for their father     Nevadans elected Brian Sandoval Attorney General in 2002  making him the first Hispanic elected to a statewide office  but his public service dates back more than a decade to when the people of Washoe County twice sent him to the Nevada State Assembly       Then  in 1998  he was called upon to serve on the Nevada Gaming Commission and became the youngest person in our state  s history to be the chief gaming regulator   Mr  Sandoval was appointed to the Commission by then Governor Bob Miller  a democrat       I mention this because throughout his career  Mr  Sandoval has been a conduit for opportunity and bipartisan cooperation   This was evident in Governor Miller  s decision to appoint him and more recently in his nomination to the United States District Court in Nevada                                             My colleague  Senator Reid  and I agreed when I was elected to the Senate that we would each have a role in recommending Nevadans for federally appointed judgeships   Senator Reid  with his position as leader of the Senate Democrats  determined that Brian Sandoval was extremely qualified for this job   I commend Senator Reid for reaching across the aisle to choose this candidate   It is a true testament to Mr  Sandoval  s qualifications and to the respect he has rightfully earned     That respect extends beyond the borders of my home state   Last summer  then Secretary of State Colin Powell asked Mr  Sandoval to serve as his special advisor during meetings of the Organization of American States in Quito  Ecuador   He was also named to be a member of the Department of Homeland Security  s State and Local Officials   Advisory Committee   Both assignments are a great honor for Mr  Sandoval       A graduate of the University of Nevada and the Ohio State University College of Law  Mr  Sandoval is currently a member of the Nevada State Boards of Pardons  Prisons  Examiners  and Transportation   He also serves on many councils and commissions focused on domestic violence and cyber crimes     His commitment to these issues and to the community has been recognized by numerous organizations   Mr  Sandoval was named   2004 Public Lawyer of the Year    by the Nevada State Bar Association  the Washoe County Bar Association  and the Washoe County Access to Justice Foundation   He was also honored with the   Torch of Liberty    from the Anti Defamation League and the   Broche de Oro    from Hispanics in Politics     Mr  Sandoval comes before this committee with an impressive resume  but also as an   AV    rated attorney  the highest possible rating of legal professionalism  integrity  and ethics as determined by his colleagues       And for the past several years  Mr  Sandoval has led the Attorney General  s office with an absolute commitment to justice   He has fought tirelessly to protect Nevada  s children and seniors from abuse and exploitation  to stop the federal government  s plan to store nuclear waste in our state  and to aggressively enforce our laws     I am confident that his commitment to justice  which has motivated him from his days in law school to his private practice of the law to his role as Attorney General  will make him an outstanding federal district court judge   Mr  Sandoval has often been described as a rising star in Nevada   If confirmed  I have no doubt that this star will shine brightly as a member of the federal bench     I ask my colleagues to promptly and favorably report this nomination out of committee so that it can be considered by the full Senate as soon as possible     Thank you again to the committee and to the Sandoval family
