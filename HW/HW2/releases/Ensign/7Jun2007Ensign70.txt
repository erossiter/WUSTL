 Washington  D C   Despite the Democrats best efforts to prevent Republicans from offering amendments during a limited immigration debate  Senator John Ensigns amendment to improve the merit based system proposed in the immigration bill was considered last night   The amendment would have strengthened the merit system by adding more points for immigrants who are high skilled workers  who served honorably in the United States military  who speak English or who have health insurance  Ensigns amendment would have greatly expanded the points available to workers in the fields of health and physical sciences  technology  engineering and mathematics  but it failed by a small margin   Included below is the speech that Senator Ensign delivered last night on this amendment  As prepared for delivery  Mr  President  this bill does a laudable job in setting up a new merit based system for the future  That is the right thing to do for our country  But the bill misses the mark  Our country needs an immigration system that recognizes we want to attract the best and the brightest from around the world  We have been doing that for many years because we recognize that when people who are smart and talented come to this country  they actually create jobs  They create opportunities for other people in this country  The current bill unfortunately misses the mark on this merit system  This bill today is worse than current law  and that is why the high tech community across the country has come out in opposition to the provisions in the merit based system that is in this bill   I want to tell a small anecdote that will illustrate the problems with the system on attracting talent here  In my office today  a gentleman by the name of Bill Watkins from the Seagate Technology Corporation out of California  just opened a new branch in Singapore and hired U S  graduates  foreign students who graduated from M I T  and other universities here  The reason he hired them to go to Singapore where he will pay them less money than he would have paid them in the United States  the reason he sent those jobs out of the United States is because of our immigration policy  The immigration policy basically allows us to educate foreigners in the United States  But then after we educate them  well send them home  The amendment that I have today says that we are going to actually value people who are educated here  especially in the science  technology  engineering  and mathematics fields  We call those the S T E M  fields  And the health science fields  were going to give you even more points than the current bill does so that into the future  we will attract the best and the brightest from around the world  Its the idea of being a brain drain to the rest of the world  People from all over the world want to come to America   We want the best and the brightest to come to America  Because of this fact  whether its low skilled  high skilled workers  4  of the people who have high skill jobs in the future will create the jobs for the other 96  of Americans  Those are the talented people we want to attract  Over half of the start ups in Silicon Valley in the last 10 years have come from immigrants  Those people  when they start up companies  create jobs in America  They create opportunities  Some high skilled  some low skilled  but they are creating opportunities for people to pursue the American dream  So  while the current bill is moving in the right direction  it misses the mark  So my amendment says that we are going to reward those in the sciences  those in the technical fields  for example  those who have a Ph D  in electrical engineering  Were going to give you enough points to virtually guarantee entrance into this country  Its a good thing  Thats why the high tech community is supporting my amendment   Mr  President  we also put in this amendment that if youre an immigrant  if youre one of these z visa holders  we actually want you to be rewarded for doing military service  So were going to offer another amendment to make sure they can do military service  And then when they do that  we want them to come into this country to serve in our military  There should be no greater honor  and we should reward them with legal permanent status and the ability to get legal permanent status  Mr  President  we have a shortage of nurses in this country  We give more rewards for people in the health sciences as well in our amendment  I think this is critical to improve this bill  If were going to do a comprehensive Immigration Reform bill  we certainly shouldnt make it worse than current law  And this bill is worse than current law when it comes to high tech workers coming into this country   So  Mr  President  I would urge all of our colleagues to support this amendment  I know its a delicate balance that we have between the various people that have brought this bill together  but I truly believe this is an improvement on not only current law  but its also an improvement  a great improvement on the current bill
