 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign made the following statement after the Senate failed to provide emergency funding for the Department of Defense   Our nation just celebrated the heroism of veterans and members of the armed services and this funding would have provided them the necessary resources to carry out their mission on the front lines  The funding for General Petraeus and his troops on the ground should have been provided months ago  and it is shameful that we have failed to provide it yet again  We cannot fight a war with 535 members of Congress micromanaging those on the front lines  The Democrats continued insistence on setting a surrender date undermines our generals and those selflessly fighting to secure Iraq and protect us from Islamic extremists  This is a time when we as Americans must stand behind the brave men and women in our military
