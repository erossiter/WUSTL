 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement after the Senate passed a bill to raise the minimum wage and offset the costs with small business tax relief      Today the Senate passed a bill to raise the minimum wage while incorporating much needed tax relief for the small businesses that keep our economy strong   Simply put  without the tax relief offset many small businesses would have to lay off workers to pay for this minimum wage increase      Despite the Democrats  best efforts to muscle through a stand alone minimum wage increase  a move that would have crippled small businesses  Senate Republicans stood firm for the entrepreneurs that provide jobs to millions of Americans      This is a matter of fairness to the small businesses that make up the backbone of our economy   The tax relief included in this bill recognizes the costs associated with raising the minimum wage by providing a tax relief offset to keep our economy growing      By forcing Democrats to concede that we cannot carelessly raise the minimum wage without considering the added costs to small businesses  we have won a significant victory and have demonstrated our fiscally conservative principles
