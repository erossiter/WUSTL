 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  during a speech on the floor of the United States Senate today  urged his colleagues to confirm Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court   Alito  s nomination was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday by a vote of 10 8       President Bush nominated Judge Alito  and we are here to consider his choice   I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Alito  and I find that he is extremely qualified to join the Supreme Court   His experience  his temperament  his understanding of the role of the Court  and his respect for the law make him an admirable candidate who I believe will serve this nation well     Ensign said during his remarks     Ensign has said that he hopes Judge Alito  if confirmed  would help steer the Supreme Court away from a current trend of judicial activism and back to what Ensign said is its proper role  interpretation of the laws Congress passes       The single most important factor that went into my decision to support Judge Alito has to do with a judge or justice  s role on a court   The job of the judiciary is to apply and interpret the Constitution and the laws of the land     Ensign said in his speech     Unfortunately  not everyone sees it that clearly   That is why judicial activism has become so rampant   But  in no way or form is it in the judiciary  s purview to make laws   That is clearly the job of legislators elected by our citizens   Legislators make laws  and judges apply them   Judge Alito understands that and has demonstrated so throughout his esteemed career        Ensign met with Judge Alito in Ensign  s Capitol Hill office in November
