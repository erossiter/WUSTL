 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign brought the Child Custody Protection Act to the floor of the United States Senate for debate today   The legislation is designed to prevent minors from being transported across state lines for the purpose of evading state laws in order to have an abortion   As of Thursday afternoon  the bill had 41 cosponsors       In most schools across the country our children cannot go on a field trip  take part in school activities or participate in sex education without a signed permission slip   An underage child cannot even receive mild medication  such as aspirin  unless the school nurse has a signed release form   Some states even require parental permission to use indoor tanning beds   Nothing  however  prevents this same child from being taken across state lines  in direct disobedience of state laws  for the purpose of undergoing a life altering abortion     Ensign said during remarks on the Senate floor     Ensign pointed out that the Child Custody Protection Act does not supersede  override or in any way alter existing state parental involvement laws   The bill does not impose any federal parental notice or consent requirement on any state that does not already have a parental involvement law in place   Forty five states have passed some form of parental involvement legislation       The Child Custody Protection Act addresses the interstate transportation of minors  sometimes by a predatory older male or his parents  in order to circumvent valid  existing state laws that require parental notification or consent     Ensign said     This bill goes a long way toward strengthening the effectiveness of state laws designed to protect parents and their young daughters from the health and safety risks associated with secret abortions        The Child Custody Protection Act will likely be voted on next week
