 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign today introduced legislation designed to protect private property owners from having their land or homes seized by the government under eminent domain provisions   Ensign  s bill  the Private Property Rights Protection Act  was drafted in response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed for the taking of private property by the government for the purpose of economic development       It is a fundamental right of American homeowners to have their property protected from government seizure     Ensign said     Despite what the Supreme Court says  we cannot allow a government entity to decide that an individual should lose his or her home so that a city can make money   Americans are outraged by that possibility  and so am I        Earlier this year the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Kelo versus the City of New London  Connecticut  that a city could seize private property for the purpose of increasing the city  s tax revenue   The company at the center of the seizure effort  New London Development Corporation  has received  4 million in grants from the United States Congress   Ensign  s bill will prohibit the use of federal funds for any such purpose in the future       Sadly  it was Congress that made it financially possible for a city government to take a family  s home in Connecticut     Ensign said     This has to change   We cannot provide funding for the seizing of homes that families in America have worked lifetimes to build and sustain        Ensign  s bill will also deny tax benefits to private corporations who acquire wrongfully condemned property  thereby removing the economic incentive to acquire such land
