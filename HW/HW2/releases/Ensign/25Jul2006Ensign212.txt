 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  s Child Custody Protection Act passed the United States Senate with a vote of 65 34 today   The bill makes it a federal crime to circumvent state parental involvement laws by taking a minor across state lines for an abortion       As a father  I have to give my consent for many things my children do  from taking school field trips to receiving aspirin from a school nurse  yet some minors are being driven across state lines for a life altering abortion without their parent  s permission     said Ensign     It is appalling to me that our young daughters  some not even old enough to drive  are being taken across state lines to have an abortion without their parent  s knowledge         Ensign  s bill will not override or supersede any existing state laws requiring parental notification or consent in regard to minors having abortions   The legislation does exempt parental involvement if the girl  s life is in danger and for other extreme circumstances   It also creates a new federal crime if someone who has committed incest with a minor takes her across a state line for an abortion       The sad truth is that many cases show that these young girls are being driven across state lines by much older  predatory males in order to escape valid state laws     Ensign said     An overwhelming number of Americans agree  as I do  that parental involvement laws are important   I am very proud that my bill will help states enforce their laws recognizing the importance of parental involvement  and I believe it will bring more parents into this major decision making process        Ensign  s Child Custody Protection Act had 43 cosponsors   Forty five states currently have some sort of parental notification laws in place
