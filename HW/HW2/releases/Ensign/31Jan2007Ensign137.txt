 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign introduced legislation today that would provide seniors with greater access to physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language pathology services   The Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act would repeal the Medicare beneficiary therapy caps  an arbitrary restriction that prevents many seniors from receiving much needed therapy      The bottom line is that without this change seniors would lose critical rehabilitation services and their chances for a healthy recovery would be restricted   said Ensign    I urge my colleagues to support this because we should not limit the therapy and recovery options available to our nation s seniors  especially the oldest and sickest on Medicare      Studies have found that  in one year  almost 650 000 Medicare beneficiaries would have had their physical  occupational or speech language therapy benefits prematurely ended because of this cap      Therapy is essential to the successful rehabilitation of seniors suffering from conditions such as stroke  Parkinson s disease and congenital heart failure   said Ensign    Congress has demonstrated its opposition to these arbitrary limitations year after year   It s time to act for our seniors and ensure that they receive the rehabilitation services they need             Through moratoriums or a measure known as an exceptions process  Congress has implemented short term fixes in 1999  2000  2003  2005 and 2006   This is a redundant task that only temporarily resolves the issue  and it ignores the need to permanently fix this problem for our seniors   Without Congressional action  the beneficiary cap on therapy services will be effective on January 1  2008  less than one year from today  and our seniors will lose access to critical services       Ensign s bill will permanently resolve this issue and was introduced today with Senators Lincoln  Cardin  Collins  Reed  Warner  Graham  Akaka  Hatch and Hagel joining as cosponsors
