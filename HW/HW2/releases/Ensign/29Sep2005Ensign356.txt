 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign submitted the following statement in support of the confirmation of Judge John Roberts as Chief Justice of the U S  Supreme Court   Ensign  s statement will be entered as part of the permanent Congressional Record     Floor Speech of Senator John Ensign  On the Supreme Court Nomination of Judge John G  Roberts   September 27  2005     Mr  President     I rise to speak in support of John Robert  s nomination for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court   The debate that the Senate will have this week is truly historic   In our nation  s history there have only been 16 previous Chief Justices  The opportunity to vote on a nomination for Chief Justice is a once in a lifetime opportunity and should be undertaken with recognition of its importance   The importance of this vote simply cannot be overstated       I believe that our nation is best served when we confirm individuals who appreciate that the role of a judge is not to make laws but to uphold the Constitution   We need judges who understand that their oath requires them to follow the Constitution and to apply the law in a modest fashion   Judges do not serve in the legislative branch   They should not make the law   As Senators  that is our job     Under our Constitution  judges are appointed to interpret the law   They should apply the law without prejudice   Judges must be open to the legal arguments presented by each of the parties before them   They must fully and fairly analyze the facts and faithfully apply the law     I have carefully considered John Robert  s record and his qualifications   I believe that his record reflects a proper understanding of the role of judges   I met with him and discussed face to face his views on the role of Supreme Court Justices   Judge Roberts possesses the highest intellect and integrity   He has also demonstrated that he is fair minded   He possesses the necessary experience  as an attorney for the government  in private practice  and as a judge  to serve on the High Court   By any objective measure  John Roberts is qualified to sit on the bench  and he deserves to be confirmed     Judge Roberts  in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee and in his writings throughout his career  has presented himself as a man with a clear view of the role of a Supreme Court Justice   to interpret the law and to uphold the Constitution   His answers to specific questions have been necessarily and appropriately limited so we must trust  as we have with past nominees to the Court  that Judge Roberts is presenting himself and his views honestly   I believe he has  and for the sake of our country  I hope so      Today  throughout the judicial branch  judicial activism is impeding and restricting freedoms the American people should expect to enjoy as envisioned by our nation  s founders   Recent and significant rulings have established standards created not by elected members of Congress but by activist judges   These rulings have infringed on Americans   rights to exercise their religious beliefs  to recite the Pledge of Allegiance  and to own property without fear that the government might seize that property for economic gain     Now more than ever we need justices who will stand against this type of judicial activism  adhere to the proper role of upholding the Constitution  and leave the task of creating laws to the Congress   John Roberts is representing himself as someone who believes in a return to what our founders intended  and we hope his portrayal of his views is honest and true       Historically  the Senate has confirmed a nominee when the nominee is found to be well qualified   John Roberts certainly meets this criterion   Historically  the Senate has based confirmation on a nominee  s record  writings  and prior decisions   There is ample documentation on which my colleagues can make a decision with respect to John Roberts   nomination   And the documentation supports confirmation       John Roberts deserves to be confirmed  and America deserves a Chief Justice like John Roberts   I yield the floor
