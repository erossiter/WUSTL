 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  in testimony today before the Senate Judiciary Committee  again urged splitting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals   Senator Ensign has introduced legislation that would split the Ninth Circuit Court in order to reduce the case overload resulting from extreme growth in its area of jurisdiction       I believe that it is not only the duty of Congress but also our obligation to ensure that the Judicial branch is operating efficiently     stated Ensign     The adage of   justice delayed is justice denied   is appropriate with respect to the operation of the Ninth Circuit  My primary motivation is to ensure that my constituents  the people of Nevada  have equal access to justice        The jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals currently includes Nevada  California  seven other states  and two territories   The court handles more than five times the number of cases than an average circuit and takes far more time to resolve cases than other circuits   The increase in case numbers can be directly related to the increase in population since the time the court was established        It is unacceptable to have such long delays in our justice system  and I believe that splitting the Ninth Circuit will speed up this process     said Ensign     People are forced to put their lives on hold as they wait for their case to be heard  and this is an injustice we have the ability to fix now         The Senate Judiciary Committee also heard testimony today in favor of splitting the Ninth Circuit from Assistant Attorney General Rachel Brand   It marked the first time in recent years that a member of the Administration has testified in favor of the split
