 Washington  D C     Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid have secured  5 million for a National Wild Horse and Burro Adoption Center to be located in Lyon County  near Mound House and Carson City   The senators included a measure in the Supplemental Appropriations Act that provides the funding for the design  engineering  and construction of the facility   The funds were originally approved as part of a farm subsidy bill in 2002        This adoption center will provide a home for thousands of wild horses and burros who otherwise would have likely died from malnutrition or other illness     Ensign said     It will also provide a tourist attraction for visitors to enjoy and a boost to Lyon County  s economy   These animals are an important part of Nevada  s western culture and deserve to be cared for           This center is a Nevada solution that will put resources where they can do the most good     Senator Reid said     The ultimate goal  of course  is to protect the wild horses while at the same time protecting private and public lands throughout the state   This is a tremendous opportunity for Nevada  s wild horse advocates to blaze a trail that will serve as an example for the federal program           The entire cost of the adoption center is more than  9 million   The remaining funding will be sought from the State of Nevada  charitable organizations  and private donations   When complete  the center will include room for more than 20 permanent and 100 adoptable horses and burros  a display area  classroom  and veterinary clinic   The facility will be run by the University of Nevada  Reno and The National Wild Horse Center  a non profit agency
