 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign has won approval of an amendment to protect southern Nevada air tour operators   ability to provide aerial tours of the Grand Canyon   The amendment was approved as part of the Transportation Treasury HUD Appropriations bill with Senator Harry Reid as a cosponsor         There was an effort by federal bureaucrats to impose restrictive measures on air tours between Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon and with this amendment  we have blocked that effort     Ensign said     Air tours are a vital part of southern Nevada  s economy  so it  s important to protect their interests when those interests are threatened          For years  air tour operators have struggled with red tape at the FAA     Reid said     Small businesses like air tour operators are the lifeblood of our economy  and this amendment clarifies the original intent of Congress so that there is no confusion         In 2000  Congress exempted Las Vegas based air tour operators from a new Lake Mead air tour management plan because air tour operators fly over the lake solely as a route to the Grand Canyon  not to tour Lake Mead itself   The Federal Aviation Administration sought to submit air tour operators to the complex Lake Mead plan simply because many of those flights take planes over Hoover Dam so tourists can see the dam on the way to the Grand Canyon       Because air tour operators already comply with a strict air tour plan for the canyon  Ensign  s amendment establishes that flights from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon that travel over Hoover Dam are part of the Lake Mead exemption and not subject to further FAA restriction
