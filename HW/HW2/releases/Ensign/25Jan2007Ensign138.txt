 Washington  D C    An amendment offered by Senator John Ensign today would have made health care more affordable and accessible by expanding the ability of people to use their Health Savings Account to pay for health insurance   The amendment lost by a 47 48 vote      Health Savings Accounts have proven to help reduce the number of uninsured   said Ensign    We should expand these tax free accounts so that more people can take advantage of them   My amendment would make it easier for people to get healthcare coverage by allowing people to use their pre tax Health Savings Account dollars to pay for health insurance premiums      Health Savings Accounts set aside savings tax free for healthcare costs and work in conjunction with a high deductible health insurance plan   Ensign s amendment would permit individuals and families who purchase high deductible health plans on their own to use their Health Savings Account to pay plan premiums        We need innovative solutions in healthcare  and I m disappointed that Democrats played politics on an issue so critical to providing quality health care to Americans   said Ensign    This is one of those innovative solutions and is an important component in addressing the number of uninsured Americans across the country
