 Washington  D C     Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid today released the following statement after an Enron provision for which they have fought was included in the final version of the comprehensive energy bill   The provision will allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to rule on nearly  330 million in contracts entered into between Sierra Pacific Nevada Power and defunct energy company Enron   The Senators have maintained that Nevada ratepayers should not be held liable for the cost of the power since it was never delivered and Enron was engaged in fraudulent business practices        The inclusion of our Enron provision in the energy bill will allow Nevada  s case to be heard by the proper authority  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   We now have a much better chance of a ruling in Nevada  s favor which will relieve our ratepayers from the potential burden of nearly  330 million in contracts for power that our state never received   This is a very important step in the final resolution of this issue           Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid
