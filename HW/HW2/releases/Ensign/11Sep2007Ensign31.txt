 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign released the following statement in commemoration of the anniversary of September 11  2001   Today is a day of significance and somberness for our nation  Six years ago we were tested  and we came together in a way that showed our radical Islamic attackers what it means to love freedom  I dont think that anyone who witnessed that day will ever forget the horror and patriotism that grew from the destruction and tragedy in New York  Washington  D C   or Pennsylvania  It is important to always honor the memory of those who died tragically that daythe innocent bystanders and the heroes who rushed to save others  May their lives continue to inspire patriotism and a love for freedom in each of us  That will ensure that those who seek to destroy us can never claim victory
