 Washington  D C   Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid introduced legislation today that would remove a restriction on a portion of the city of Renos land that hinders planned economic development  In 1866  the title of the land was granted to the Central Pacific Railroad  now Union Pacific  for construction of the nations first transcontinental railroad   The purpose of this land exchange was satisfied long ago  but because this outdated restriction has not been cleared up over the years  economic development projects along Renos train trench will be hindered without Congressional action  said Ensign  Lets fix this once and for all   By reducing downtown congestion and making downtown Reno safer for pedestrians and motorists  ReTRAC has been a tremendous success for the community  Now its time to take the next step  said Reid  The legislation that Senator Ensign and I introduced today clears the title on downtown land so that businesses can return to downtown Reno and economic redevelopment can march forward   The United States kept a reversionary interest in the land to ensure that it was used to facilitate the building of a railroad  As part of the Reno Transportation Rail Access Corridor  or Reno ReTRAC  the railroad agreed to grant the city of Reno title to the land immediately surrounding the right of way for the project within the city    It is unclear whether the railroad had authority to make this conveyance given the federal reversionary interest  Clearing title to these parcels is necessary for future economic development   A companion bill was introduced and passed in the House of Representatives by Congressman Dean Heller
