 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign released the following statement today after voting to continue working to improve the immigration bill  The current immigration system is broken and unfair  This bill has significant flaws that need to be addressed relating to providing Social Security benefits for fraudulent work  effective interior enforcement and border security  My Social Security amendment would close a loophole that allows illegal immigrants to collect Social Security benefits for work done fraudulently  As it stands today this bill encourages identity theft  but my amendment would fix that  Another important amendment would strengthen interior enforcement and implement a system that tracks which temporary workers are here and which have left  Today  40 percent of illegal immigrants in America have overstayed their visas  but this amendment would put an exit tracking system in place  The status quo is simply unacceptable  but in its current form this bill also falls short in too many ways  Todays vote allows us to move forward and improve an immigration reform bill that is needed
