 Washington  D C     The Pentagon is considering using National Guard troops to help secure America  s borders  an idea proposed by Senator John Ensign several weeks ago   Ensign proposed an amendment April 4th that would reimburse states for the cost of putting National Guard troops on the border       It  s gratifying to see a positive response to the idea of using the National Guard on our borders and I hope it continues to move forward     Ensign said     Securing our borders is the first and most crucial step in immigration reform and the National Guard can play a vital role in shoring up America  s security at the borders        Earlier this week  Ensign and a group of other senators spoke to White House adviser Karl Rove and Deputy Chief of Staff Joel Kaplan about the idea       I  ve seen firsthand the tremendous job our Border Patrol agents do on the front lines  but the job is overwhelming and we owe it to them and to the American people to provide enough manpower and resources to truly control our borders     Ensign said     Use of the National Guard can take us a step closer to secure borders and cut down on the violence that accompanies illegal border crossings        Ensign  s original amendment was blocked on the Senate floor   He said he will work to include it as part of the immigration package currently being negotiated in the Senate
