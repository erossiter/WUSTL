 Las Vegas  NV  Senator John Ensign made the following statement regarding the case of Terri Schiavo        Rarely  if ever  has Congress been asked to intervene in a situation with such immediate life and death ramifications as that of Terri Schiavo   It is a tragic case for all involved  regardless of the outcome  and my thoughts and prayers  as well as those of my colleagues in the United States Senate  go out to Terri Schiavo and her family   When faced with such decisions  I believe Congress should always err on the side of the preservation of life   In Terri Schiavo  s case  that means resisting efforts to have her feeding tube removed  thereby intentionally bringing about her death by starvation   We should foster a culture of life in America  and I believe that facilitating Terri Schiavo  s death would violate that principle           Senator John Ensign
