 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign today applauded President Bush  s signing of the renewal of the Patriot Act  which took place this afternoon at the White House   The Patriot Act has been revised by Congress to enhance the balance between effective protection from terrorists and the privacy of American citizens       We cannot demand adequate protection without giving our law enforcement agents the tools they need to keep us safe     Ensign said     The Patriot Act enables law enforcement agents in their battle against terrorists  while maintaining the important privacy rights Americans are guaranteed under the Constitution   I  m very pleased to see President Bush sign the renewal of the Patriot Act        In addition to anti terrorism provisions  the Patriot Act now also includes measures to combat the illegal sale and use of methamphetamine  or meth   The Combat Meth Act  part of the Patriot Act  restricts the sale of necessary meth ingredients  imposes tougher penalties for meth traffickers and enhances international enforcement of anti meth trafficking laws       Meth is ruining lives in Nevada and throughout the country  and a crackdown on its sale and use is absolutely the right thing to do     said Ensign  who worked for inclusion of the Combat Meth Act     This deadly and highly addictive drug is  unfortunately  inexpensive and readily available   We must do all we can to assist law enforcement officers and prosecutors as they work to curb the use of meth everywhere
