 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign said today that the train derailment which produced a corrosive chemical leak in a Pittsburgh suburb is a reminder of the dangers of transporting lethal substances   This includes the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository  where trains are supposed to ship thousands of tons of high level nuclear waste to Nevada   The early morning derailment sent several train cars into the river and 200 residents near the area were evacuated   This is the second incident of its kind this month        It  s worrisome that this is the second incident this month in which a train accident has resulted in a deadly chemical leak into a community  s water supply     Ensign said     This is clearly an increasing problem across the country and exactly why Nevada  s Yucca Mountain is a risk we cannot take         The first occurrence happened earlier this month when a South Carolina train crash resulted in the leakage of harmful chlorine gas killing 9 people  injuring more than 250 and forcing the evacuation of more than 5 000        The Energy Department still intends to transport more than 70 000 tons of high level nuclear waste across the country  with almost 30 percent of it coming to Nevada  s Yucca Mountain   If the nuclear industry  s past accident rates are applied to the projected shipments  then 10 rail accidents are expected        The possibility of endangering Nevadans will never happen under my watch     Ensign said     I will do everything I can to protect the safety and welfare of our citizens
