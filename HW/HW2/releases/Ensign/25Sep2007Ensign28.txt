  Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign called on his colleagues today to extend the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  but refocus the program on its original intent of providing low income children  not adults  with health coverage   I support this program  but it was created to help low income children  not adults Would we expand our free school lunch program to include parents  said Ensign Its irresponsible to expand this program beyond its intent when so many eligible low income children are not enrolled   According to a study done for the Department of Health and Human Services  there are 794 000 low income children currently eligible for SCHIP but not enrolled Under the Democrats proposal  adults will continue to receive money meant for children  and it could even expand eligibility for the program to families earning up to  82 000 a year   The Democrats are still pushing this plan  despite a veto threat from President Bush months ago  and are now up against a deadline because the program is set to expire at the end of September   I urge my colleagues to stop playing politics with SCHIP and pass an extension so low income children will not go without health insurance  said Ensign The Democrats want to expand this program toward Washington controlled government health care Thats the wrong direction and the wrong solution for the healthcare problems we face in America Lets extend SCHIP and refocus the program on its original intent of helping low income children
