 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  Senator Harry Reid  and Congressman Jim Gibbons have secured a commitment from Mesa Air Group that it will work toward providing Ely citizens with continued air service through Las Vegas   Last week  Mesa Air Group  s Air Midwest was selected by the Department of Transportation to provide federally subsidized essential air service to Ely  Nevada   The leaders and residents of Ely opposed the selection because Air Midwest had proposed providing service through Salt Lake City instead of Las Vegas       I am pleased that Mesa Air Group is eager to work with us to improve air service options for Ely residents     said Ensign     Air service between Ely and Las Vegas is critical for those who live in Ely and for the area  s economy   I will continue to work with my colleagues and Mesa Air Group to finalize an air service plan that is favorable to the residents of Ely and meets the airline  s business plan          We are pleased to know Mesa Air Group will soon be providing better travel opportunities to the people of Ely and nearby rural communities     said Reid     Streamlining the process to Las Vegas will help travelers transfer to other airports more easily   This is good for Nevadans  good for tourism  and good for Ely  s economy          Access to and from our rural communities can often times be extremely challenging  especially for those located in the eastern most region of the state   I am pleased that Mesa Air Group has committed to work toward providing the residents of Ely with continued air transportation to and from Las Vegas  allowing them access to many of our state s essential services     said U S  Congressman Jim Gibbons       Mesa is committed to working with the community of Ely in finding a flight schedule that will best meet its needs   Mesa is one of the largest Essential Air Service providers in the United States and we have achieved that status by listening to the communities we serve   I am sure we will find a compromise that satisfies Ely  s needs and is economically viable for our company     said Mickey Bowman  Vice President of Planning for Mesa Air Group
