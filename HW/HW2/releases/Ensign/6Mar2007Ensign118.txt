 Washington  DC    Today U S  Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada introduced bipartisan legislation that would require nuclear waste to be stored at the facilities where it is produced  The Federal Accountability for Nuclear Waste Storage Act of 2007 would eliminate the need for the proposed Yucca Mountain Project         As elected leaders  we have a moral responsibility to protect the thousands of Nevadans and millions of Americans that could be put in harm s way because of projects like proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump   said Reid   This isn t just a Nevada issue  it s a national issue  It would be dangerous and irresponsible to ship the most dangerous substance known to man through cities and small towns  and past schools  hospitals and businesses so it could be buried 90 miles outside of Las Vegas  The next step forward is to secure nuclear waste in scientifically sound ways at the sites where it is produced  This legislation will accomplish that          This bill provides a safe  responsible  common sense way to dispose of nuclear waste   said Ensign   We must look for long term innovative solutions to recycle waste produced by nuclear power  and as we look for these solutions  we should not transport dangerous waste through cities and rural areas across our nation to Yucca Mountain         The bill would also require the federal government to take responsibility for possession  stewardship  maintenance  and monitoring of the waste and increase safety at all nuclear power plants by providing funding for additional security to guard against accidents or terrorist attack        Today the Department of Energy announced plans to revive the proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain and increase storage levels by an undisclosed amount  despite strong opposition from Nevada s congressional delegation and a myriad of scientific  safety and technical problems
