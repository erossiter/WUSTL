 Washington  D C     An amendment by Senator John Ensign to allow American troops to use tear gas in certain combat situations has been approved by the United States Senate   Ensign  s amendment corrects an interpretation of the Chemical Weapons Convention on the use of tear gas and other riot control agents  or RCAs   Because of that interpretation  the military refrains from using tear gas  which Senator Ensign and others consider a valuable tool for American troops on the ground       Police officers in any city in America can use tear gas to avoid loss of life  but our men and women carrying out the global war on terrorism cannot     said Ensign  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee     This is not right  and it must change        Under a 1997 interpretation of the Chemical Weapons Convention  the American military currently operates under the understanding that tear gas has been categorized as a chemical weapon and its use banned without direct Presidential approval   Military leaders and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld have argued in favor of clarifying the interpretation to allow for the use of RCAs as a life saving measure  as they can often be used instead of lethal force       American and allied troops are going through terrorist infested neighborhoods in Iraq and Afghanistan neighborhood by neighborhood and door to door  encountering innocent civilians as well as heavily armed insurgents     Ensign said     Tear gas is an effective alternative to bullets    an alternative that will protect our troops and the people they encounter on their mission to track down terrorists        Ensign  s amendment was adopted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act  which was approved by the Senate this afternoon by a vote of 98 to 1
