 Washington  D C   Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid today announced the opening of an outreach clinic for Elko veterans  The clinic will treat veterans primary and mental healthcare needs through face to face visits  two days a week  at the current telehealth clinic location  Elko veterans must currently travel to Salt Lake City  Utah  for many services not provided at the telehealth clinic in Elko  This new outreach facility will provide Elko and nearby veterans with better  more convenient access to medical services  said Ensign  a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  This is the next step toward getting Elko a Community Based Outpatient Clinic  and I encourage all veterans to enroll in this system to demonstrate the demand for veterans care in the community  Veterans in Elko County  and across the country  deserve the best health care possible  This benefit was earned as a result of their selfless sacrifice to our nation   This is great step forward to ensure veterans both in and out of Elko County have the care they deserve  said Reid  If the current outreach clinic doesnt meet veterans needs  I will continue working with the VA to make sure they fully understand what services are required for those who have defended our freedom  Senator Ensign and I will revisit the issue again in the future to determine if our veterans have the sufficient care they so desperately need   Currently  only a small number of the thousands of veterans in Elko County are utilizing the limited veterans healthcare services because of the travel distance required to access these benefits  As local veterans increase the use of local services  greater demand will bring more resources  The outreach clinic is scheduled to be open two days a week  but hours of operation and services provided can be expanded if demand increases  The outreach clinic is set to open in August of 2007
