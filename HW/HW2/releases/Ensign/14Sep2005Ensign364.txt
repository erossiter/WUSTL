 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign made the following statement after a federal judge declared unconstitutional the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools       A decision such as this only serves to infuriate Americans and motivate an even greater loyalty to the Pledge   I join the great majority of Americans who will once again feel disappointed and angry at our judicial system for making such a ruling   I only hope it serves to emphasize the importance of selecting judges who stick to their jobs applying the Constitution and the laws of the land and who do not use their gavels to make laws
