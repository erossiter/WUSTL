 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign today spoke before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts to urge a split of the overburdened Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals   Along with Senator Lisa Murkowski  R AK   Ensign introduced the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization and Modernization Act to divide the current Ninth Circuit into two new circuits       This splitting of the Ninth Circuit is absolutely necessary if the residents of Nevada and the other western states are to have equal access to justice     Ensign said     Right now  citizens living under the Ninth Circuit face incomparable delays and judicial inconsistencies         The proposed new Ninth Circuit would include California  Hawaii  Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands   The new Twelfth Circuit would be comprised of Arizona  Nevada  Idaho  Montana  Oregon  Washington and Alaska       The largest circuit in the country  the Ninth Circuit encompasses 20  of the entire nation s population     Ensign said     The Ninth Circuit has the highest cases per jurist ratio   And the trend is not changing   The Circuit is just too large        Ensign recognized that members of the court have tried to address problems that occur with a heavy case load  but they have reached they point where nothing else can be done   He called on Congress to help correct the problem       The solution is clear that this court must be split  and I urge my colleagues to join me in our Constitutional duty to ensure equal justice for all Americans     Ensign said
