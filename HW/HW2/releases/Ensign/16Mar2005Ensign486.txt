 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign released the following statement in reaction to allegations  made public today  that employees with the U S  Geological Survey had falsified documents relating to the suitability of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository        We in Nevada have said for years that the science at Yucca Mountain is faulty    now it appears the science is fraudulent   This latest development provides yet another reason to abandon the misguided notion of storing high level nuclear waste in Nevada and will hopefully encourage an accelerated discussion of alternatives that are safer and more scientifically sound   These revelations will undoubtedly bolster Nevada  s legal case against Yucca Mountain   Senator Reid and I will remain vigilant and weigh our options for further action  but today it is clear the Yucca Mountain project continues to crumble before its supporters   eyes           Senator John Ensign
