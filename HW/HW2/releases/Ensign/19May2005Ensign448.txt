 Washington  D C     Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid have won approval of an Energy Bill amendment that could lead to Nevada Power ratepayers being relieved of  330 million in fees under fraudulent contracts entered into with defunct energy company Enron   The amendment was authored by Senator Maria Cantwell  and Ensign successfully lobbied his Republican colleagues for support   The measure has been approved by the Senate Energy Committee and will be part of the energy bill that will be voted on by the full Senate        Nevada ratepayers should not be held liable for millions of dollars   worth of electricity that they never received     Ensign said     I will do whatever I can to make sure Nevada is not stuck with a  330 million bill for acts of fraud committed by Enron   The approval of this amendment is a major step in that direction         The amendment  approved by the Senate Energy Committee by voice vote this morning  reasserts the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  for determining the validity of the Enron contracts   FERC has already indicated that Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power should not be responsible for the contracts  so approval of the amendment is a major victory for Nevada residents        Enron is one of the worst corporate swindlers in modern history     Reid said     And the company is trying to force Nevadans to pay for its illegal and fraudulent activities and for electricity it never delivered   The committee  s vote today reinforces what we in the Congressional delegation have been saying all along  that FERC should step in and protect Nevada ratepayers by voiding these contracts   It is FERC  s main responsibility to protect ratepayers from just this type of abuse   It  s time the agency stepped up to the plate           Nevada Power has fought hard on behalf of their ratepayers  so it  s gratifying to help get this amendment secured and lift this  330 million burden from the backs of residential ratepayers in Nevada     said Ensign
