 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign released the following statement today following the Senate  s vote to continue debate on renewal of portions of the USA Patriot Act   The motion was not approved  delaying renewal of the provisions  which is a defeat for supporters of the act       I  m disappointed in today  s vote and look forward to continuing the debate on this important legislation   I remain a supporter of the Patriot Act  and feel it gives law enforcement important tools to keep Americans safe from terrorists   The Patriot Act  by and large  gives those agencies fighting terrorism the same tools available to those fighting organized crime and other dangerous activities   While it is essential to carefully monitor the application of the Patriot Act and diligently safeguard individuals   rights  the law remains an effective tool in the protection of innocent Americans from terrorists          Senator John Ensign
