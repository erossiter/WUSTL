 Washington  D C     A   point of order    raised by Senator John Ensign halted asbestos reform legislation being considered by the United States Senate tonight   By a vote of 58 41  the Senate refused to waive the Budget Act to consider the asbestos legislation  known as the FAIR Act   The asbestos reform bill now goes back to the Judiciary Committee to be reconsidered   Senator Ensign released the following statement after tonight  s vote       We need fairness and justice for those whose health has suffered because of exposure to asbestos  but this bill provided neither fairness nor justice   The potential of leaving the American taxpayers on the hook for literally hundreds of billions of dollars in future liability made this piece of legislation absolutely unacceptable to me and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle   Tonight  s vote was a victory for taxpayers across the nation          Senator John Ensign
