 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign attempted to introduce amendments to the immigration bill this week  but Senate Democrats are continuing to block Republicans out of the process  As a result  today Ensign voted against ending debate because he wants to continue improving this bill  Ensign was joined by his Republican colleagues and 15 Democrats    Because the current system is broken  we need immigration reform  but it has to be good for America  Democrats promised open and fair debate during their campaigns  but examples of it are harder and harder to come by  said Ensign  who wants to offer amendments to improve an immigration bill that is being rushed through the Senate  The Democrats hypocrisy now cuts into one of the most important issues facing our nation  One of Ensigns amendments will prevent illegal immigrants from collecting Social Security benefits for work done under a stolen or fraudulent Social Security number  Under this bill  an illegal immigrant who used a stolen Social Security number for 10 years  for example  and then is granted legal status will be entitled to full Social Security benefits if he or she petitions the Social Security Administration within six months  Legal immigration is good for America  Ensign added  We need secure borders and an employee verification system so that employers are held accountable for the workers they hire  Immigration reform needs to be good for Americans as well as for immigrants  Thats why we need a merit based system that welcomes those who are coming here to contribute to our economy  work hard and pursue the American dream  Debate and a vote on Ensigns and other Republican amendments depend on Senate Democrats  who so far have been reluctant to allow an open process  Another Ensign amendment would have fixed a flaw in the bill that gives people granted legal status welfare benefits sooner than legal immigrants  The immigration bill weakens the historic Welfare reform of 1996  which Ensign helped author as a member of the House of Representatives   These are amendments that would improve the bill and allow us to keep moving toward a reform that not only is necessary but also could become good for America  Ensign added  Im disappointed in Senate Democrats for attempting to limit opportunities to improve this bill
