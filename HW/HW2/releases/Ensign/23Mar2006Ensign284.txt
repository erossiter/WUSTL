 Las Vegas  NV    Senator John Ensign issued this statement following the release of an analysis by the Government Accountability Office on the Yucca Mountain project   The analysis pointed out potential delays with the project due to Department of Energy  DOE  quality assurance problems           It s completely appropriate for the Government Accountability Office to question the ability of the DOE to move ahead with building Yucca Mountain   They re not alone   Many of my colleagues in the Senate are wondering the same thing   The nation needs to understand that this project hasn t even begun to be built   Now is the time to end this project before any more time and taxpayers   money are poured into it
