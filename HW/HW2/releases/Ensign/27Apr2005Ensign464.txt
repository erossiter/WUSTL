 Washington  D C     Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada introduced new legislation today that will help protect the Las Vegas Valley from flooding  The Orchard Basin Flood Control Act would allow the construction of a flood basin on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management  BLM   The land is strategically located at a critical point for flood control efforts         Here in Washington  a lot of people think Southern Nevada doesn  t need flood control because we  re a desert     said Reid    Actually  the Las Vegas Valley gets dangerous  and even deadly  flash floods  The Orchard Basin will help control floodwaters  to protect people and homes in the area            Every year we see how dangerous flash floods can be and parts of our communities struggle with damage from flood waters     said Ensign    We need to work together on many different fronts to lessen the danger of flash floods and the Orchard Basin Flood Control Act is a big part of those efforts          The Orchard Basin Flood Control Act releases 65 acres of land from the BLM  s Sunrise Mountain Instant Study Area to allow the construction of a new floodwater detention basin  The Orchard Detention Basin is a vital part of the Clark County Regional Flood Control District  s master plan to protect the rapidly growing Las Vegas Valley  The project is designed to shield 1 800 acres of urban land from flooding       Part of the land needed to build the Orchard Detention Basin is inside the Sunrise Mountain Instant Study Area  An   instant study area    is a federal designation that protects environmentally sensitive lands by restricting development  The new legislation would change that designation to allow for the construction of flood control projects only         This detention basin is one of more than 130 needed throughout Southern Nevada  and it  s a critical part of the drainage network to capture stormwater runoff and reduce flooding     said Gale Fraser  General Manager of the Regional Flood Control District    68 detention basins have already been built throughout Clark County  Approval of this legislation will allow us to move forward with flood control improvements on the east side of the Las Vegas Valley  near Charleston and Hollywood at the base of Sunrise Mountain
