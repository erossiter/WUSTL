 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  Senator Harry Reid  and Congressman Jim Gibbons have received notice from the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  that air service will continue between Ely and Las Vegas   Service to Las Vegas was to be discontinued by Scenic Airlines when a new carrier  Mesa Air Group  proposed sole service to Salt Lake City         I commend the residents of White Pine County for their diligent advocacy of air service to Las Vegas     said Ensign     The service to Las Vegas is important for the residents of Ely because it maintains an in state hub with lower fares to other destinations   I would also like to thank Mesa Air Group for working in good faith to resolve this issue with the delegation and White Pine County residents         Air service between Ely and Las Vegas is crucial for many Nevadans   Reid said    We are pleased that Mesa Air Group will be providing such an important service for our community   The improved travel option will not only benefit residents  but the economy and tourism as well      The congressional delegation worked with community leaders  residents of White Pine County  Mesa Air Group and the FAA to reverse the Salt Lake City proposal in favor of Las Vegas   As a result  Mesa Air Group will offer one stop service through Cedar City  Utah  to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport where travelers can fly to U S  and international locations       I am pleased that Mesa Air Group will be providing the residents of Ely with continued air transportation to and from Las Vegas  allowing them access to many of our state s essential services     said U S  Congressman Jim Gibbons     The approved service will have one stop in Cedar City  Utah  because McCarran Airport requires Transportation Security Administration screening that is not available at the Ely airport   The new air service  flying six roundtrips per week as Air Midwest  will commence on or about November 12  2006
