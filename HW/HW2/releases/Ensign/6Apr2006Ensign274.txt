 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  a member of the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee  took advantage of a hearing on Capitol Hill today to reiterate his commitment to the veterans   hospital soon to be built in southern Nevada   Ensign addressed the Construction and Lease Authorization Needs hearing this afternoon       The specialized care that will be provided at this facility will eliminate veterans having to travel long distances to southern California and more importantly will provide the comprehensive health care that these men and women so richly deserve     Ensign said during the hearing     Veterans seeking care presently overwhelm the VA healthcare system in Las Vegas   They are forced to go to multiple locations for their health care and many have to leave their families and travel out of state   This approach is burdensome and inappropriate for our growing population of veterans   They deserve much better than the healthcare services they are presently receiving        A 90 bed full service hospital and 120 bed VA nursing home will be built at Pecos and the 215 Beltway in North Las Vegas   Groundbreaking is set for later this year   Nevada  s veterans have identified the hospital as their top priority       I will use this hearing and any other venue available to seek reassurances from VA Department officials that the Las Vegas VA Medical Center Complex will be built on time     Ensign said     Nevada  s veterans deserve no less
