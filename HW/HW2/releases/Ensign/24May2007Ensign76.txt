 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign s efforts to stop the Yucca Mountain Project continued today as he successfully cut the project s authorized spending by more than  90 million  The Senate Armed Services Committee  SASC  passed its annual Defense Authorization bill this afternoon with a significant reduction in the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal Fund because of Ensign s commitment to stop deadly nuclear waste from ever being shipped to Nevada     The more success we have in cutting funds for this reckless project  the further from reality it becomes  said Ensign  a member of SASC  Today s milestone is another reason for more talk about alternatives instead of expedited and unrealistic timelines for completion based on fraudulent information put out by the Department of Energy     The Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal Fund allocates funding for the Yucca Mountain Project  Last year the Senate authorized  333 million for the fund  but today the SASC passed a bill that allocated  242 million  Reducing funds for nuclear waste disposal helps slow the progress of Yucca Mountain     We need to fight Yucca Mountain at every front  and the efforts of our entire delegation are paying off  said Ensign  Now is the time for this project to end before any more taxpayer money is poured into it
