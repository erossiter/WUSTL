 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  during testimony today before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for the agency  s efforts to establish safety standards for Yucca Mountain   Senator Ensign  s statement to the committee is below      Mr  Chairman     Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the second proposed rule concerning Yucca Mountain radiation standards   This rule  on its face  does not make sense   And the closer one looks  the worse it appears     The EPA found itself in a difficult position   The original EPA Yucca rule had been thrown out by a federal court  which found its 10 000 year compliance period was not consistent with recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences       The EPA could have simply modified its rule by extending it to cover the time of peak radiation exposure as required by the Court  We know why the EPA did not do this  It didn  t do it because Yucca Mountain could not be engineered to meet that standard  Yucca Mountain could not be built     So instead of putting forth a common sense solution  the EPA proposed the weakest peak dose standard in the world  a proposal opposed by the National Council of Radiation Protection   Again  when it comes to Yucca Mountain  sound science has been rejected     There are those who believe Congress should ignore recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences and simply lower the safety standards for the storage of the planet  s most deadly material   Senator Reid and I are committed to making sure that doesn  t happen     Mr  Chairman  Yucca Mountain continues to be plagued with problems and delays   The Department of Energy no longer even pretends to know when Yucca could open or how much it will cost   DOE once again has stopped work at Yucca Mountain after an NRC audit revealed that several years of data collection was done with equipment that had not been calibrated  This data is critical to health and safety because it relates to how water could enter the repository and cause corrosion of the nuclear waste storage casks      We need to find another solution to our country  s nuclear waste problem   We need to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to require the DOE to take title of all spent nuclear fuel   And we need to invest in new technologies at our national labs to recycle the waste without producing weapons grade plutonium as a byproduct   Transmutation technology  which transforms radioactive products into less dangerous materials and produces electricity as a result  is quickly emerging as a viable alternative     Mr  Chairman  this new proposed radiation standard  like so much of the so called science at Yucca Mountain  is a farce   The EPA was forced to create this ridiculous standard to make Yucca Mountain look scientifically feasible on paper   It is not   It is a dangerous  misguided project fraught with junk science and fraudulent data
