 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign announced today that he has secured  750 000 to operate an emergency warning system for the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area  including the Mt  Charleston and Lee Canyon areas   The system would utilize an emergency siren  electronic warning signs and a public education campaign   The funding was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee as part of the Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill today          This funding is critical to ensuring the safety of the Spring Mountains   residents and visitors     said Ensign     When fire  avalanche or other natural catastrophes strike the Spring Mountains  there is a very narrow window of opportunity to evacuate the area and make sure that law enforcement can access it   An emergency warning system will provide a tremendous boost to public safety efforts in those crucial moments         The U S  Forest Service administers the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area  which continues to see an exponential increase in visitors each year   Visitors access the Spring Mountains via two lane canyon roads  making it extremely difficult for first responders to reach accidents in a timely manner   There is currently no comprehensive avalanche or fire warning system in place to warn of threatening conditions          When I participated in the Mt  Charleston Summit in February organized by Senator Reid and Commissioner Maxfield  I made a commitment that I would go back to Washington and secure funding for this type of vital infrastructure for the Spring Mountains     said Ensign     We are one step closer to making that a reality today         The  750 000 in funding would be provided to the U S  Forest Service   The language Ensign secured in the bill directs the agency to consult with local law enforcement and governments in Clark and Nye Counties concerning design and implementation of the system
