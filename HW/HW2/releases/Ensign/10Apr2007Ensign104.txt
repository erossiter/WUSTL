 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign made the following statement today at a press conference with fellow members of Senate Republican leadership as Democrats continue to play politics with emergency funding for the Global War on Terrorism       I m the former chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee on Armed Services  now the ranking member   There s no question that readiness of the United States armed forces will be hurt by the delay in approving the supplemental      We have had testimony on the Armed Services Committee   We have a hearing this afternoon on readiness of our forces   And the reprogramming absolutely hurts the readiness of our armed forces        The training that they need  having to take it from one pot of money to another pot of money  in the long run costs you money   It not only hurts readiness  but it costs you money   Contracts get delayed  and we see what happens with federal contracts when they get delayed   They end up costing more money in the long run       So it is absolutely critical for the House to come back from its vacation to get the work done so that our men and women in uniform have the resources that they need to get the job done that we have sent them on          This should not be a partisan issue   This should not be a Republican or Democrat   This should be Americans coming together to support our troops  especially at a time of war   It is absolutely critical that we put our party labels aside and become Americans  get together  work this thing out   The differences are great  but we can work those differences out if we put our country before our political parties
