 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign made the following statement in response to President Bush  s speech this morning in Maryland where he discussed his plan to reform Social Security        Today President Bush gave one of his strongest speeches outlining this administration  s goals for the future of Social Security  This is not an issue that can continue to be pushed aside  ignored and left for future generations to deal with   Social Security is not a partisan issue  and I applaud President Bush for putting forth his ideas and for having the courage to address this difficult issue
