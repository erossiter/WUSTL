 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign joined a bipartisan group today to send U S  Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne a letter urging him to uphold the Constitutional rights of law abiding citizens in National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges  Currently  the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service prohibit individuals from carrying a firearm  however  other federal land management agencies allow the transporting and carrying of firearms in accordance with local state laws   I fundamentally believe that we should protect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens  said Ensign  And when it comes to federal lands  we should have a consistent policy that does not infringe upon these rights  Todays letter is a first step  and Im hopeful that Secretary Kempthorne will alleviate this concern   The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service allow law abiding citizens to carry and transport firearms  The inconsistent policies across federal agencies pertaining to firearms are confusing  burdensome and unnecessary   Moving to a standard policy would respect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding gun owners  said Ensign   The letter to Secretary Kempthorne was signed by Ensign and 47 senators from both sides of the aisle
