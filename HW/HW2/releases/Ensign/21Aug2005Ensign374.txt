 Lake Tahoe  CA  Senator John Ensign joined Senator Dianne Feinstein today in announcing a bipartisan effort to craft legislation for fuel reduction with a 10 year completion date   The announcement was made at the annual Lake Tahoe Summit        Setting concrete goals for fuel reduction in the Lake Tahoe basin is critical   We cannot wait any longer to make this commitment     Ensign said     The threat of catastrophic fire is real  and we must put as many resources as possible into protecting this beautiful national treasure   Senator Feinstein did a tremendous job working to pass the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003  and I  m proud to join her in this effort         The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act  SNPLMA   legislation which Ensign authored  has already provided critical funding for fuel reduction   SNPLMA required that a disposal boundary be drawn around the Las Vegas valley and that the disposable land be auctioned to the highest bidder  The proceeds of those land auctions  which have generated more than  2 billion  go into a fund to acquire environmentally sensitive land in Nevada and for the state  s general education fund        The most recent round of recommended expenditures included  10 million for fuel reduction at Lake Tahoe  and in remarks at the Summit  Ensign pledged to secure additional funding for fuel reduction        Fuel reduction is a priority and will require a team approach     Ensign said     In the coming months  the Nevada and California Congressional delegations  along with interested groups and community leaders  will work together to develop legislation that will help us reach the common goal of protecting Lake Tahoe through an aggressive fuel reduction plan   We have several options when it comes to funding this project  and I am committed to securing the necessary resources to make this a reality
