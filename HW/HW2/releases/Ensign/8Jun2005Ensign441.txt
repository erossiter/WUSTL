 Two million children in the United States have a parent in prison  Without positive adult intervention  Big Brothers Big Sisters estimates that 70 percent of those children are  at some point  likely to be incarcerated themselves  But Sen  John Ensign  R Nev   and Rep  Adam Schiff  D Calif   have dedicated themselves to changing that statistic       Each of them has found a   little brother    through BBBS  and they are teaming up to spread the word       For Ensign  it began in 1997  when the Nevada Republican  who was still in the House at the time  was matched with Donzale Butler  a 9 year old whose father was in prison and whose mother was trying to get off welfare       The group matched him with then Rep  Ensign  one of the fathers of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act       For the past eight and a half years  Butler has spent most Sundays at Ensign  s Las Vegas home with the Senator  his wife and their three kids who  in the words of Ensign    just adore    their adopted brother       Ensign says he and Butler talk about everything from school to sports to girls to responsibility  When Ensign talks with Butler about his dad  who was released from prison three years ago  Ensign tells him that   it  s important that he love his dad    but that   just because his dad made mistakes doesn  t mean he has to          Ensign  who was a veterinarian before entering politics  has helped Butler land a couple of jobs  including work in a vet  s office  to help him foster a strong work ethic         Somewhere  somebody has to break the chain  Because if he doesn  t break it  he can pass it on to his kids     Ensign said    As a society  you are just building in the future prisoners if you don  t get involved          Ensign  Schiff and Kelly Perdew  the winner of NBC  s   The Apprentice  Season Two     will come together Wednesday to announce an initiative to help BBBS raise the money and manpower needed to reach 1 million children  a four fold increase from present enrollment numbers       The 11 a m  gathering on the Cannon House Office Building terrace comes nearly two decades after Schiff first got involved       As a 26 year old clerking for a federal judge in 1986  he walked into the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles on the advice of a former law school classmate       Schiff  who was handed three applications  was immediately struck by what he read in the form prepared by David McMillan and his mother  McMillan had made three wishes  the first was for a big brother  the second was for a puppy and the third was for a beautiful world       Schiff remembers being amazed how a 5 year old was mindful enough about the world around him that he would want something as abstract as   a beautiful world            I would have gone for the skateboard or the bicycle     Schiff said      And so Schiff and McMillan formed a strong bond  going to the beach  watching movies  dining and playing in the park  McMillan was even a groomsman in Schiff  s wedding         I became a part of his family and he became part of mine     Schiff said       McMillan would go on to earn an undergraduate degree from Yale University and a graduate degree from the University of Southern California  s film school       When McMillan  who is one of 10 young writers in the Warner Bros  Television Writing Workshop  wrote the March 22 episode of the CBS drama   Judging Amy     the two got together to watch the show at his mother  s apartment         It can  t be overestimated    how important   just being around someone    can be  said McMillan    He was there for me when my dad was not          There has also been a political dimension to the relationships       McMillan  who calls Schiff   one of the good guys    in politics  has walked precincts  appeared in direct mail pieces and narrated a biographical commercial for his   big brother          When Ensign tried to unseat Sen  Harry Reid  D Nev   in 1998  Rhonda Butler appeared in an Ensign ad  thanking him for being a Big Brother to her son       As for Perdew  he got involved in the late 1990s  when he was matched with Zack  who was 11 or 12 at the time       He was inspired to get involved because of his experience growing up with divorced parents  Perdew  who switched off living with his mom and dad  said    It always felt weird to have one of them missing          BBBS has grown exponentially since its inception  But Judy Vredenburgh  the organization  s president and CEO  thinks there has been more continuity than change in the first 100 years         What  s amazing is that we  ve absolutely stayed focused on matching one child in need with one volunteer  That  s what we know works     Vredenburgh said    The one thing that is really different is that we now have the technology     so that we can take our social service to scale          While BBBS has always served children of incarcerated parents  the organization redoubled its focus on that demographic in 2001  when it partnered in the creation of Amachi Big Brothers Big Sisters  a program that matches church congregants with children of prisoners    Today  121 BBBS offices nationwide have dedicated programs to serve children of prisoners       Vredenburgh estimates that between 20 percent and 25 percent of Big Brother kids have a parent in jail  Prior to the start of the initiative  the total was   probably half that number            The number one problem in America today is a lack of fathers in the home     Ensign said    You can  t fix that overnight  But you can at least help that problem by becoming a mentor
