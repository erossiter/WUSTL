  Washington  D C   An amendment by Senator John Ensign to protect scarce Social Security dollars was approved today with overwhelming and bipartisan support  Ensigns amendment stops the Administrations efforts to send Social Security dollars to Mexico through an unfair and irresponsible agreement  The Administrations proposed Totalization Agreement is unfair to the American taxpayer and careless considering the solvency problems facing the Trust Fund   Social Security is already on unstable financial ground  and for too long we have been irresponsible with Trust Fund dollars  said Ensign  This proposed agreement is severely flawed on several levels  For instance  the Mexican government does not keep sufficient records on births  deaths and marriages  so it would be nearly impossible to determine when to stop sending checks   This proposed agreement would allow Mexican workers to qualify for partial Social Security benefits in the United States with as little as one and a half years of work history  instead of the normally required 10 years  Family members living in Mexico would also qualify for U S  Social Security benefits because the proposed agreement waives rules that prevent payments to non citizens  such as children and spouses  living outside the United States    These agreements are about fairness  but in this case it will have precisely the opposite effect at the expense of the American taxpayer  said Ensign  The proposed U S  Mexico Agreement further threatens the retirement security of hard working Americans   Totalization Agreements are common  They allow workers who divide their careers between two countries to combine credits from both countries to quality for Social Security benefits  They also prevent workers from paying into two systems  However  the Government Accountability Office has warned that this agreement will increase the number of unauthorized workers eligible for Social Security benefits  Ensigns amendment passed 91 to 3   In 2004  the United States reached a Totalization Agreement with Mexico  which has not gone into effect because the President has yet to submit it to Congress  Citing concerns that the current process to ratify a totalization agreement does not include sufficient debate and scrutiny  Ensign introduced a bill in January requiring approval from both the House and Senate before totalization agreements go into effect  Currently  these agreements become effective 60 days after they are submitted to Congress unless one chamber specifically rejects it
