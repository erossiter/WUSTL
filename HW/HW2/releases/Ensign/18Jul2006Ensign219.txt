 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement today in reaction to the latest proposed timeline for the Yucca Mountain project by the Department of Energy      Once again  DOE has set forth a timeline with no basis in science or reality   The efforts of the entire Nevada delegation combined with DOE s scientific defense of the Yucca Mountain project  which has ranged from incomplete to fraudulent  have resulted in a consensus that alternatives to Yucca Mountain need to be considered   Senator Reid and I intend to move forward with our legislation to force DOE to take possession of nuclear waste where it is produced   Now is the time to be talking about such alternatives  not an unrealistic timeline that will never materialize          Senator John Ensign
