 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  s Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2005 passed the United States Senate unanimously late last night   The goal of the legislation is to put an end to animal fighting by stiffening the penalties for raising and transporting animals for the purpose of fighting        This gruesome practice must come to an end  and as a Veterinarian and U S  Senator  I will continue to work toward that day     said Ensign     Not only is animal fighting abhorrent but with it often comes illegal gambling  illegal narcotics and human violence   There is no place in our society for animal fighting and the other behaviors it promotes         Ensign  s legislation makes the transportation of animals for fighting a felony  establishes a penalty of up to two years in prison and bans the transportation of tools specifically designed for animal fighting   It is explicitly limited to interstate and foreign commerce and protects states   rights where weak federal law is compromising their ability to keep animal fighting outside their borders        As a Veterinarian  I saw firsthand the devastating results of animal fighting     said Ensign     It is hard to believe that human beings can purposely bring pain to innocent animals  but it happens every day across the country   I look forward to swift action in the House of Representatives so that we can send this to the President           Companion legislation in the House of Representatives remains in Committee   Support for the bipartisan legislation has come from more than 200 police and sheriffs   departments across the country  the USDA and National Chicken Council  the American Veterinary Medical Association and The Humane Society of the United States        Senator Ensign has not only been a determined opponent of animal cruelty  but also an effective one     states Wayne Pacelle  president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States  the world  s largest animal protection organization     Because of his efforts this week in the Senate  we are one major step closer to having a strong national law that cracks down on the gruesome and barbaric practices of dogfighting and cockfighting
