 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement as Senate Democrats celebrated passage of a 9 11 Recommendations bill that includes major provisions not recommended by the bipartisan 9 11 Commission      Today the Senate passed a bill hailed as the  9 11 Recommendations bill   but when you look at the details it s clear that the bill weakens national security  most specifically at our nation s airports      By providing collective bargaining rights to Transportation Security Administration  TSA  screeners at our airports  Senate Democrats put political loyalty ahead of the safety and security of the American people   The bipartisan 9 11 Commission did not recommend collective bargaining rights for TSA employees because  as a matter of national security  our airport screeners need flexibility   not more layers of uncompromising bureaucracy   to keep us safe      I voted against this bill because providing collective bargaining rights to TSA jeopardizes our national security  and the President will rightly veto this bill
