 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign issued this statement regarding the Environmental Protection Agency  s  EPA  proposed radiation standard       I am appalled at the complete arrogance of the EPA in announcing these standards   We  ve been down this road before   The federal appeals court already determined that the 10 000 year standard violated the law   This new standard is no better  and the EPA has provided no scientific basis for the 350 millirem figure   The EPA has also refused to take the public  s right to be informed on this issue into consideration   A 60 day comment period is absolutely unacceptable given the serious ramifications for the public  s health   I will continue to fight this blatant disregard for science  the law and the health of Nevadans
