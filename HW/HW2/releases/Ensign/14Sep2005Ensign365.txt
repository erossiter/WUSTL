 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  in a letter to President Bush  is urging an immediate and coordinated rescue of pets abandoned in the wake of Hurricane Katrina because of the serious health risks these pets pose to remaining residents and rescue workers in the region   Ensign  a veterinarian  sent the letter to the White House yesterday   In it  he called on President Bush to designate an individual to coordinate the effort to get the thousands of abandoned pets rescued and relocated        In the wake of Hurricane Katrina  we have witnessed in the Gulf Coast region devastation rarely experienced in our nation  s history   It will take months just to begin to grasp the loss of human life  property damage  and environmental harm that was caused by the storm     Senator Ensign  s letter reads in part          An urgent concern that has arisen from the destruction in Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama has been the large number of pets left behind   These animals represent not only an emotional concern but also a significant public health hazard   These animals must be rescued and transported from the region as quickly as possible to avert the potential for diseases  such as salmonella and E  coli  as well as injury to rescue workers and citizens   As we write you  Mr  President  thousands of pets remain abandoned in the streets of New Orleans and throughout the Gulf Coast region threatening the welfare of rescue workers and citizens still in the area       The federal government must provide the tools necessary to quickly and safely collect and transport abandoned animals from the disaster area to shelters and homes around the country   We urge you to designate an individual to coordinate not only the federal government  s response to this emergency but also the efforts of private rescue groups   We believe that this federal leadership is necessary to ensure a timely and orderly animal rescue operation before the threat to public health becomes a reality         The letter was co signed by Senator Rick Santorum  R PA
