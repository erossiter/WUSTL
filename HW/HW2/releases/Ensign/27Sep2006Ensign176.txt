 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  chairing an Armed Services subcommittee hearing this morning  demanded answers as to why American military personnel are not allowed to use tear gas in hostile situations in Iraq and Afghanistan   Ensign directed his questions to Pentagon officials during a hearing by the Readiness Subcommittee this morning       It is incomprehensible to me that we deny our military the use of a tool that can help save their lives and the lives of civilians in hostile areas     Ensign said     We owe it to our men and women risking their safety every day to give them the resources they need to do the deadly job with which we  ve tasked them   It is cheap rhetoric to say we  re giving our troops the resources they need while denying them the use of tear gas         Current policy does not allow for the use of tear gas  also referred to as Riot Control Agents  in Iraq and Afghanistan urban combat situations despite authorization being permitted by law       Leaving our troops with only the option of lethal force in dangerous situations on the streets of Baghdad is irresponsible and wrong     Ensign said     The use of tear gas  quite simply  will save lives  and we need answers as to why it is currently not allowed so we can correct this situation and allow our military the use of this important resource        Senator Ensign sponsored legislation in 2005 that restated American policy that allows military use of tear gas by listing it as a non chemical weapon that can be used as an alternative to lethal force   Executive Order 11850 authorizes the use of tear gas in certain situations
