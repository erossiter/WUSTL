 Memorial Day is the time set aside for us to honor  remember  and salute our nation  s fallen heroes   Ideally  this is something we should do every day that we are free  thank those who made that freedom possible       If not for the brave men and women who donned the uniform of our armed forces and who sacrificed their lives to defend our borders and our ideals  we would surely not be living and breathing the freedom we all cherish today   For more than 200 years  men and women have left their families and livelihoods behind  they have traveled to far and foreign lands  and they have shown extraordinary courage in fighting for this nation     I have to wonder  where do we find men and women like that   Where do we find men and women who are willing to lay down their lives for strangers and who are willing to leave their loved ones behind   They are remembering their fallen comrades today  and they are buried in cemeteries across this country and around the world   Today we honor the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for us and whose families did as well     We can never thank them enough for the price they paid for our freedom  but we can spend today keeping them in our thoughts and prayers   May we never forget them  and may God continue to watch over them     God bless you all  and God bless America
