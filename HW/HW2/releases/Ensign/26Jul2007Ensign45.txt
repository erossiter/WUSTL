 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign  who  chaired a hearing in 2004 on the subject of smoking in movies  praised Disney  for its recent decision to prohibit smoking in its movies  Im pleased that Disney has acknowledged that smoking  in movies adversely impacts our children and their health  said Ensign  By  banning smoking in its movies  Disney is protecting our children because habits  are formed at a young age and television shapes those habits  This voluntary  action by Disney  without action by Congress  should be  applauded  Over the past few years  Ensign has met with directors  in Hollywood and  top executives at the Motion Picture Association of America to discuss how the  habits of actors and actresses on screen impact our  children  I hope others in the entertainment industry move in the  same direction because studies have shown that children exposed to smoking in  movies are far more likely to pick up this deadly habit  said  Ensign  Researchers at Dartmouth Medical School and Norris Cotton Cancer Center found that adolescents with the  highest exposure to smoking in movies were 2 6 times more likely to begin  smoking than those with the lowest exposure  This study  which was published in  the journal  Pediatrics  also  found that 38 percent of adolescent smokers started because they saw smoking in  movies
