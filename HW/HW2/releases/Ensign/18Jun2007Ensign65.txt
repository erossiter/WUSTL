 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign announced today that he secured a commitment from Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to hire seven additional attorneys and six additional support staff members for Nevadas U S  Attorneys Office  The Nevada office has faced a worsening staff shortage  now at one of its lowest points as it operates with less than 80 percent of its allocated employees  Nevadas office has been understaffed for too long  and despite our states rapid growth  the office has fewer employees now than it did in 2002  said Ensign  who has been working with the Department of Justice to bring additional resources to the U S  Attorneys Office  This commitment is a step in the right direction because inadequate staffing has left the people who protect our communities stretched thin  According to federal allocations  the Nevada office should have about 45 attorneys on staff  but today there are only 38  which is only one more than 2002  Gonzales also committed to hiring additional support staff for Nevada  When considering both attorneys and support staff  the Nevada office has six fewer total employees than it did in 2002  even though it represents one of the fastest growing states in the nation  The U S  Attorneys Office in Nevada represents one of the largest and fastest growing districts in the country  but its staffing does not reflect that and it has not for years  said Ensign  Nevada needs to have adequate resources to effectively prosecute criminal cases relating to terrorism  child predators or identity theft for example  I appreciate the Attorney Generals commitment to hiring these additional employees  Nevadas U S  Attorneys Office currently has about 71 total employees  The office works with federal agencies such the Federal Bureau of Investigation  the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service to prosecute cases on behalf of the federal government
