 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  who has led the fight to do away with travel restrictions at Dallas   Love Field created by the Wright Amendment  is supportive of a compromise agreed to today but said he would still like to see the Wright Amendment completely repealed       Representatives of the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth  along with officials from American and Southwest Airlines  announced a compromise today that will allow airlines to offer   through ticketing    service from Love Field in Dallas to destinations within the United States       Today  s compromise is a positive step and the traveling public will benefit  but my belief that the Wright Amendment should be fully repealed has not changed     said Ensign  who introduced legislation in July of 2005 to repeal the 1979 Wright Amendment  which restricts flights from Love Field to nine states bordering Texas       Having the federal government implement restrictions on how and when the American people can travel is fundamentally wrong in my view     Ensign said     Private entities should compete for the consumers   business in an atmosphere of free competition   The Wright Amendment goes against that principle and should eventually be repealed
