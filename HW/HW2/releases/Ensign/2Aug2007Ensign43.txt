 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign took a stand against earmarks today at a press conference where he called for more transparency and more accountability when it comes to the earmarking process   Lets bring the process out of closed meetings and the back rooms of Congress and onto the floor of the United States Senate  said Ensign  Earmarks amount to millions and millions of unaccountable federal dollars often passed into law without a hearing or debate  Joined today by Senators John McCain  AZ   Jim DeMint  SC   Tom Coburn  OK   Lindsey Graham  SC  and John Cornyn  TX   Ensign discussed the ethics bill in Congress and how it does not go far enough   The loopholes in this bill will result in the same earmarking process in Congress  which was at the source of several recent scandals  The bill will continue to allow secret earmarks  last minute additions and Senators to waive disclosure requirements  Instead of the Senate Parliamentarian  the bill allows a select few in Democrat leadership to determine which earmarks are subject to disclosure rules and which are not  The American people have demanded earmark reform for long enough  said Ensign  Without truly changing the way earmarks are put into bills  we are not addressing the root of the problem  The American taxpayers want a process that is honest and transparent  and this bill does not go far enough when it comes to earmarks and pork barrel spending
