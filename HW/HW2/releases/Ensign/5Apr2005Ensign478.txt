 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign testified today before the House Government Reform Subcommittee regarding the possible falsification of data used at the Yucca Mountain Project and the e mail communication between federal employees about the project      The following are excerpts from Senator Ensign  s testimony        Mr  Chairman  the quality assurance program was put in place as part of the NRC licensing process to verify the accuracy and credibility of work that has been completed to protect public health and safety   The fact that the alleged fraud deals with the issue of water infiltration is critical because it impacts the corrosion of casks and the containment of radioactivity            We  re not talking about how realistic this scenario would be for a science fiction novel or a movie script   The corrosion of casks and the containment of radioactivity are frightening realities that Nevadans and all Americans face should this project proceed based on fraudulent science           And at what cost do we forge ahead with the Yucca Mountain site   To bury it in a location where science has taken a back seat to fraud and politics is completely reckless   We cannot afford to continue this project           If there is a positive side to this potentially criminal activity regarding Yucca Mountain  it has given impetus to the nuclear industry and other supporters of enhanced nuclear power opportunities to be open to other ideas for waste disposal   I hope that our nation gives a long hard look at other options because  58 billion is a lot to pay for a repository that is not based on sound science and will not be licensed in the foreseeable future
