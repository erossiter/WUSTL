 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign and Representatives Jon Porter and Dean Heller expressed disappointment today as House and Senate Democrats continue to shut down debate and block Republican alternatives on critical issues such as Iraq and funding for our troops      Democrats said they would reach across the aisle and work in a bipartisan manner  but they re denying major alternatives that we want to debate   Their actions are hypocritical to what they campaigned on for so long   said Ensign    I m disappointed because I want to send a message of support to our troops  I want to ensure that they will have all the funding they need to finish the job  and I want victory in Iraq   The Democrats  strategy on Iraq amounts to nothing more than political posturing while our troops are in harm s way       All 435 members of Congress represent our troops on the ground   Congressman Porter said today   To prevent an alternative point of view is not only inappropriate but implies the majority is taking a highly partisan approach to this important debate  It is unfortunate that the Democrats have chosen to send such a disheartening message to our service men and women on the ground       The new majority in Congress has been a drastic change for our government  In my first two days in Congress Democrats proposed making it easier to raise taxes  and then on my 14th day they forced a vote to actually raise taxes   Their agenda is completely closed off and hidden from the American people  with no attempts at reconciliation  no hearings or committee action  and no open process   On Iraq  Democrats have offered no real proposal  nothing to vote in support of  and no plan on how to win   said Heller     During debate on an Iraq resolution last week  Senate Democrats did not allow any Republican proposals  one of which declared that Congress should not cut off funding for the troops in the field   This week the Senate is considering a spending bill drafted by Democrats which cuts funding for our troops returning home from overseas     After conflicting statements from the House majority leadership on the Republican s potential involvement in this week s debate  the Democrats subsequently prohibited an alternative resolution or motion to recommit
