 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign today cosponsored legislation that would allow phone numbers to be permanently registered with the Federal Do Not Call Registry  Currently  registered phone numbers expire five years after initial registration    Individuals have the right to block intrusive solicitations on a phone line for which they are paying  said Ensign who was the original author of the Do Not Call Registry legislation in 2003  We have all received these annoying calls  and having the ability to block the disruptive calls is a freedom I believe in protecting    Over 132 million phone numbers have registered with the National Do Not Call Registry  and nearly 52 million of these numbers are set to expire in the next year  Reregistering these numbers will be burdensome for the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and the individual    Most individuals who have signed up for this service do not know it will expire  said Ensign  This will create a tremendous amount of work for the FTC and individuals when it is time to reregister   Ensigns legislation to create the Do Not Call Registry in 2003 was the fastest bill passed by Congress since the resolution condemning the attacks on Pearl Harbor
