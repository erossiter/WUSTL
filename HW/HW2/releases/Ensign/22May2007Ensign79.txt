 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign joined 22 other Senators in cosponsoring the Stop Over Spending Act of 2007  which was introduced in the United States Senate today  The bill aims to eliminate the tax increase and outrageous spending increase from the Democrats  recently passed budget     The budget that was passed last week was an insult to hardworking American taxpayers  said Ensign  The Democrats have chosen to strangle the economy with tax increases and recklessly spend federal dollars  While Democrats promised fiscal responsibility in their campaigns last year  they have since abandoned that promise to the American public  By endorsing the Stop Over Spending Act  Democrats could end their trend of hypocrisy before their terrible budget negatively impacts the economy  but that s wishful thinking     The Stop Over Spending Act focuses on key fiscal issues that the Democrat budget neglected and ignored  It addresses the looming fiscal crisis of entitlement programs  automatically balances the budget by 2012 without raises taxes  cuts wasteful spending and creates bi partisan commissions to study and reconcile foreseen budgetary problems in the future     The federal government is spending money it simply does not have  Average citizens cannot do this  and the federal government should not be allowed to do this either  said Ensign  Democrats are ignoring a looming fiscal crisis by playing disingenuous budget games  and I will not let future generations be burdened with debt because of their neglect  Serious reform is needed  and the time has come for Democrats to show the courage to make the necessary changes
