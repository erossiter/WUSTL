 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign  a past Chairman of the Senate High Tech Task Force  released the following statement urging Congress to pass a permanent moratorium on taxing the Internet   The Internet has encouraged tremendous innovation and job creation  and slowing this growth with the dead weight of taxes is the wrong direction for our economy I am disappointed that the House only passed a four year extension of the ban  but Americans should know that a majority of Congress  including Democrats and Republicans  are fighting to make this permanent When this bill reaches the Senate  I am hopeful that my colleagues will vote to keep the government from taxing this invaluable resource   The tax moratorium expires November 1  2007 Today the House of Representatives passed only a four year extension
