 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues  during a Capitol Hill press conference this morning  called for reform of the earmark process in Congress   Ensign was joined by Senators John McCain  John Sununu  Tom Coburn  Lindsey Graham  Jim DeMint  Jon Kyl  Evan Bayh and Russ Feingold       The current political climate in Washington  in which Americans are demanding more transparency of the spending process  is creating an historic opportunity for meaningful reform     Ensign said     By putting an end to secret agreements made in smoke filled rooms in the dead of night  we can restore a measure of credibility to the system and get a handle on runaway government spending        The reform proposals include allowing a Point of Order objection against any unauthorized earmark  allowing them to be stricken from appropriations bills and conference reports   Also being proposed is a ban on the consideration of any conference report that includes spending items that the conference members have not agreed upon       We have a situation now where Senators are reluctant to oppose massive spending bills because those bills include projects for their respective states     Ensign said     It is time to clean up the process and create an unprecedented era of accountability by forcing lawmakers to justify any spending proposal
