 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign released the following statement this morning in reaction to President Bush  s nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States       I look forward to learning more about Judge Alito  s stance on the role of the Supreme Court and how the Constitution should be interpreted   This is one of the most important and solemn votes a senator can make  and I intend to learn as much as I can about Judge Alito before deciding which way to vote   I hope my senate colleagues will join me in calling for a fair and dignified confirmation process          Senator John Ensign
