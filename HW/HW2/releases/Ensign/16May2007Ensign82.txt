 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign voted today to impose political benchmarks on Iraqis  condition further economic aid to Iraq on progress in meeting the benchmarks and withdraw elements of U S  troops if requested by the Iraqi government     Our troops continue to wait for Congress to pass a war spending bill  but  regardless of how many times the Democrats offer it  we cannot tie the hands of our military commanders  and we cannot set a surrender date  said Ensign  The legislation I supported today is a step in the right direction because it sets political benchmarks that hold Iraqis accountable by threatening a reduction in foreign aid     This amendment provides that no Economic Support Funds may be made available to Iraq unless they can demonstrate progress  To meet these benchmarks  Iraqis must ensure that more Iraqi Security Forces can operate independently and they can provide an even handed enforcement of the law  Iraqis must also commit to spending  10 billion of Iraq s own funds on reconstruction projects     Democrats have long requested benchmarks and more of a focus on a political   not military   solution  As part of a compromise to ensure that our troops get the funding they need  Senator John Warner offered this amendment     A separate measure was offered by Democrats that would have set an arbitrary surrender date for our troops  and once again an overwhelming bipartisan majority rejected it     America should not set a surrender date because it sends the wrong message to our troops and tells our enemy how long they need to hold out  said Ensign  Let s put politics aside and get a bill passed that provides our troops on the frontlines with the resources they need
