 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement after Attorney General Alberto Gonzales hosted a news conference today regarding the firing of U S  attorneys      The Department of Justice completely mishandled the dismissal of Dan Bogden as Nevada s United States Attorney   I appreciate the Attorney General s coming forward today to take responsibility for the mistakes that were made  to find out what went wrong and to address these problems immediately      In my discussions with the Attorney General over the past few days  two items have become clear to me  Resources at the U S  Attorney s Office in Nevada are not sufficient and we need specific benchmarks to review U S  attorneys   Despite serving in one of the fastest growing states in the nation  Mr  Bogden actually saw a decline in resources during his tenure at the office   That is unacceptable  and the Attorney General has promised me that more resources will be given to our U S  Attorney s Office in Nevada   We need to correct this situation because we need to make sure that our U S  attorneys have the adequate tools to do their jobs properly and effectively      Dan Bogden has a solid performance record at the U S  Attorney s Office  which is why I urged the Department of Justice to restore his reputation   There should be no doubt that he demonstrated leadership and performed well as Nevada s United States Attorney
