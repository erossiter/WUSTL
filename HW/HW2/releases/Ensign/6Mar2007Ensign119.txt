 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign  who participated in today s Armed Services Committee hearing to receive testimony on living conditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington  D C   released the following statement expressing his concerns about how the Army has handled this situation      I am very concerned by the conduct of our senior military officers at Walter Reed   When it comes to caring for our troops  we should support our men and women in uniform instead of blaming bureaucracy and skirting responsibility   It is unacceptable that our soldiers face excessive delays when awaiting discharge   This disability rating system has evolved into an adversarial one where the wounded soldier  after recovering from combat wounds  must then fight against an unyielding bureaucratic system simply to get the benefits he or she deserves       I am particularly concerned by the remarks made by Lieutenant General Kiley  who is currently serving as the Army Surgeon General and is the top medical officer in the Army   When asked at a House hearing yesterday why he was unaware of the conditions at Walter Reed Building 18  Lieutenant General Kiley responded   I don t do barracks inspections at Walter Reed    This type of response is unacceptable and lacks leadership  accountability and responsibility   These conditions and delays must be remedied at once
