 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign made this statement following President Bush s State of the Union address      Our nation faces many challenges today  but they are not insurmountable   President Bush laid out an aggressive agenda  and I look forward to studying the details of his plans and working with my colleagues on many of his initiatives   The President addressed many of the issues that I have made a priority including reforming medical liability  expanding health savings accounts  strengthening our border patrol and emphasizing math and science in our classrooms   As a member of the Senate s Fiscal Watch Team  I was especially pleased with the President s emphasis on reining in wasteful and unaccountable government spending   He also made it clear that we cannot pull out of Iraq and turn it over to terrorists   For our own security  we must stay committed  and we must succeed      I applaud the President s vision and look forward to working across party lines for the good of the country
