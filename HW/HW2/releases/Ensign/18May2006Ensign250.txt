 Washington  D C    An amendment offered today by Senator John Ensign would prevent Social Security benefits from being awarded for illegal labor in the United States   Under current law  an individual who has entered this country illegally and worked for a number of years can  after obtaining legal status  apply for and receive Social Security benefits relating to the work done while that person was in the country illegally      Our Social Security system was not designed to benefit those who have entered America illegally   Ensign said    We should not be rewarding illegal behavior  and the Social Security system should not be paying out to the detriment of legal American citizens   Fraudulently using someone else s Social Security documents is not a victimless crime       Ensign said the use of falsified documents by illegal immigrants looking for employment in the United States is destroying the credit and finances of tens of thousand of innocent Americans   His amendment would make it easier for the legitimate beneficiary to receive his or her rightful benefits      When an illegal immigrant uses another person s Social Security number  someone s identity has been stolen   Ensign said    Falsifying documents is turning people s lives upside down and destroying the victims  work history and eligibility for benefits   These victims are asking for help  and we ought to help them       My office has heard from a woman whose Social Security number has been used by more than 200 illegal immigrants  resulting in a claim of more than a million dollars against her by the Internal Revenue Service even though she hasn t worked in years   Ensign said    A five year old girl already has a tainted work history because her Social Security number has been used by illegal immigrants   Children and people trying to earn an honest living are encountering nightmares because of identity theft by illegal immigrants   My amendment would remove an incentive for illegal immigrants to fraudulently use someone else s Social Security number      The Ensign amendment would allow immigrants to accumulate credit to qualify for Social Security only after they have been assigned a valid Social Security Number
