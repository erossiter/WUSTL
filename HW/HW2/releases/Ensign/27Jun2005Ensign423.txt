 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign expressed relief today that work on U S  95 will continue after highway officials and the Sierra Club reached an agreement to end a long standstill on construction along the high traffic interstate        A federal lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club had stopped expansion work on U S  95 for more than one year at a cost of up to  30 million to Nevada taxpayers   Ensign included an amendment in the Senate transportation bill to dispose of the lawsuit and allow the project to continue as a way to pressure the sides to come to the table and solve their differences outside of the courts        Today is a great day for those of us who know the frustration of being stuck in traffic on U S  95     Ensign said     Finally  the widening can continue and the quality of life for southern Nevadans can continue to improve   I am pleased that all the parties could come together and work out their differences for the benefit of our community and our environment         The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the widening of U S  95  and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last July ordered that work be stopped pending a ruling on the case   Ensign  s amendment gave the Sierra Club  the Nevada Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration time to resolve their differences before the amendment was included in the final legislation          We can all breathe a sigh of relief today     said Ensign     Although we will never get back the past year of standstill  it is time to look forward   Rather than wait on the Ninth Circuit  the people of this community have made it clear that they want the work to continue  and so it will
