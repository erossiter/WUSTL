 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign  as gas prices across Nevada reach an all time high  expressed his continued frustration that Democrats have yet to bring one bill to the floor of the Senate that addresses America s energy needs  Despite year old campaign rhetoric and promises to reduce America s reliance on foreign sources of oil  the Democrats  hypocrisy continues as families throughout Nevada and around the country continue to face record high prices at the pump     Moving America toward energy independence needs to be more than a bumper sticker and a campaign slogan  said Ensign  The Democrats continue to talk about conservation  but we can t conserve our way to energy independence  We need to tackle this issue from every angle by enacting comprehensive reform that addresses our dangerous reliance on imported oil  That includes exploring our domestic resources  advancing alternative fuels and developing our energy infrastructure  Rhetoric may help win elections  but real reform will help families at the pump     Diversifying our energy supply is a critical component to any comprehensive plan  including the environmentally safe exploration of Alaska s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf  Part of the answer must also include alternative energy such as wind  solar and geothermal  all of which can be found in Nevada     Our economy depends on tourism  and during the summer months  families travel to visit friends and vacation  said Ensign  We are approaching Memorial Day  and the Democrats still have not brought a bill forward that would truly help people who are considering these unprecedented costs when making or curtailing their plans
