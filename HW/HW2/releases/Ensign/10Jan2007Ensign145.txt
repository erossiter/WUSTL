 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign continued his fight for national medical liability reform with his introduction today of the Medical Care Access Protection  MCAP  Act of 2007       Medical liability reform works  and it s turning the tide against frivolous lawsuits and outrageous jury awards   said Ensign  whose bill is cosponsored by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell    We ve seen it in California  in Texas and in my home state of Nevada  where the number of medical malpractice lawsuits has decreased drastically   It s been a crisis driving doctors out of business for too long   It s time to protect patients across the country and ensure access to quality health care      The MCAP Act calls for comprehensive medical liability reform by setting a reasonable cap on non economic damages and providing for unlimited economic damages   Under Ensign s bill  a patient can recover up to  250 000 from a healthcare provider and up to two healthcare institutions each for a total of  750 000   Injured patients can therefore be awarded non economic damages totaling  750 000   There are no limits on economic damages that may be incurred over one s lifetime  such as loss of employment and past and future earnings   The bill also limits attorneys  fees and includes an expert witness provision to ensure that relevant medical experts serve as trial witnesses instead of so called  professional witnesses  who are used to further abuse the system      So long as there are women in this country who fear giving birth in their cars before they make it to a hospital because their local obstetrician couldn t afford liability insurance  we have a crisis   said Ensign    Obstetrics is just one area in which doctors have been driven out by ridiculous medical liability costs   We must take control of this system and put the priority on the patients and their access to health care         This legislation is modeled after medical liability reform enacted in Texas in 2003   Since then  patients have experienced greater access to health care and to critical specialists
