 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign announced today that Nevada  s Title I education funds have increased by 8 71  over last year  leading the nation in funding growth   Senator Ensign fought to have a high growth provision included in the No Child Left Behind Act to ensure that a fast growing state such as Nevada would receive funding more proportional to its growth       This is great news for Nevada  s students     Ensign said     These funds are directed to disadvantaged students  and an additional  6 million dollars will go a long way in improving educational opportunities for them across our state        During debate over the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001  Ensign worked to include language that required the Department of Commerce and the Department of Education to produce annually updated data on the number of Title I eligible children in each state   He argued that less frequent population updates would fail to account for student population growth in fast growing states such as Nevada  costing the state millions of dollars in funding       Nevada  s students were at a tremendous disadvantage when our population was only updated every three years     Ensign said     We  re growing so fast  and we need our funding to reflect that   The high growth formula was a tremendous victory for us  as proven today         Title I funds are used at the discretion of the school districts and can be used for teachers  to provide teacher assistants for students who are underachieving and to buy computers and books
