 Washington  D C     The White Pine County Lands bill was approved as part of a broad tax package last night  thanks to the efforts of Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid  who were able to get the bill inserted  The Senators say the legislation will provide an economic boost  preserve pristine wilderness areas in Nevada  and expand parks and trails  while also improving upon the already successful Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act  SNPLMA       This legislation is the result of countless meetings  hearings  and public discussions   said Ensign    We brought everyone to the table and created a bill that balances economic opportunity while preserving the pristine beauty and wilderness areas in our state       The White Pine County land bill represents the great art of compromise   I m proud that so many Nevadans came together to both protect our precious public lands and serve the needs of our growing communities   said Reid     The White Pine bill is modeled after the SNPLMA  the Clark County Lands bill and the Lincoln County Lands bill  all of which have proven to be successful   SNPLMA is significantly strengthened through the White Pine bill by authorizing of a comprehensive 10 year hazardous fuels reduction plan for the Spring Mountains  permitting the BLM to clear and protect public lands in the Las Vegas Valley that are reserved for affordable housing  which will alleviate problems with dumping  implementing the Clark County Multispecies Habitat Conservation Plan  and accelerating the construction of parks and trails in Clark County     Construction of a new reservoir was endorsed in the bill  which will provide substantial long term benefits to Nevada by conserving 3 million acre feet of Colorado River water   The proposed reservoir will be adjacent to the All American Canal      In Southern Nevada water remains an issue to every community   said Ensign    But this reservoir is a significant step towards a comprehensive solution that includes conservation  planning and technology      In Eastern Nevada and the Great Basin Area the possibility of catastrophic fire threatens the entire habitat   This bill provides funding to reduce the risk of fire through restoration projects and the improvement of critical watersheds   The bill designates more than 550 000 acres of wilderness in White Pine County and transfers 3 526 acres to the Ely Shoshone Tribe for traditional  ceremonial  commercial and residential purposes     Currently more than 94 percent of White Pine County land is managed by federal agencies   The bill expands economic opportunity in the county by allowing up to 45 000 acres of Bureau of Land Management  BLM  lands to be privatized   Each year a portion of land will be released with 5 percent of land sales proceeds going to the state education fund  10 percent to White Pine County law enforcement  fire protection  transportation  and natural resource planning  and 85 percent to fund the protection of wilderness areas in White Pine County     Provided below is additional information on some of the accomplishments within this legislation     Land Transfers for Nevada State Parks    The bill conveys land for two existing state parks and one state wildlife management area to expand and improve the management of these areas   The Charcoal Ovens State Park will receive about 658 acres of Bureau of Land Management land they currently manage as part of the park  Cave Lake State Park will receive a conveyance of land totaling 2 960 acres  and Steptoe Valley Wildlife Management area will receive approximately 6 281 acres to expand this popular waterfowl and wetlands area     The bill also conveys two small parcels of land for the expansion of the airport and industrial park to support future economic development in White Pine County     Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act Amendments    This title amends the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998  SNPLMA  to improve the effectiveness of the Act  while proposing new conservation oriented expenditure categories from the Special Account     Specifically  for SNPLMA Special Account expenditure categories  the bill provides new authority for  1  three comprehensive  ten year hazardous fuels and fire prevention plans for the Spring Mountains  the Lake Tahoe Basin  and the eastern Sierra in Douglas and Washoe Counties  and Carson City   2  the Bureau of Land Management to clear and protect public lands in the Las Vegas Valley that are reserved for affordable housing  alleviating problems with dumping   3  authority for Washoe County to access parks and trails funds from the Special Account to purchase remaining Ballardini Ranch lands for use as a passive park and natural area   4  implementation of the Clark County Multispecies Habitat Conservation Program  and  5  authority for White Pine County to nominate conservation and parks projects to be funded by SNPLMA      For SNPLMA improvements  the bill also speeds the progress of local governments  parks and trails projects by replacing a cumbersome reimbursement system  which constrains the financial ability of local governments to finance projects  with a requirement that local governments be paid up front     All American Canal Projects    This title provides for the construction of the  Drop 2  reservoir along the Colorado River and provides for the lining of the All American Canal to conserve and capture Colorado River water   The construction of these projects will be financed by the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the result will be the conservation of an average of 60 000 acre feet of water per year   In return for the financing of the projects  Nevada will be guaranteed the right to divert and consume a portion of water from Lake Mead in addition to Nevada s basic apportionment of 300 000 acre feet   These measures will further help southern Nevada s water needs
