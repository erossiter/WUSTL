 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement as Senate Democrats continue to put politics ahead of national security   Today Senate Democrats have renewed their efforts to provide the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  with collective bargaining rights  a measure Ensign voted against today because it compromises security to benefit big labor unions      Providing collective bargaining rights to TSA employees will add more layers of bureaucracy to an agency that needs to be able to adapt quickly to terrorist threats   Senate Democrats are pushing this through as a 9 11 Commission Recommendation but it s not listed on one of the 567 pages of the book   They can call this legislation whatever they want  but the bottom line remains  Collective bargaining for TSA was not included in the 9 11 Commission Report      Last August  during the British air bombing threat  senior TSA officials briefed and trained screeners within six hours on new procedures to ensure our safety   They used real time information and intelligence to adapt  keeping us safe and allowing travel to continue   TSA needs to have this flexibility to respond to emerging threats  but the Democrats  provision would jeopardize TSA s ability to shift personnel to meet our security needs      Consider McCarran Airport as an example   This change would mean even longer delays because McCarran relies on this flexibility to meet varying travel demands and security threats throughout the day   TSA needs to have the ability to adapt not only to meet unanticipated security threats but also to meet the needs of specific airports   All airports have unique travel schedules and peak periods  and  since southern Nevada relies on McCarran for tourism  we need to make sure it has the necessary flexibility to ensure everyone s safety      Additional Information on the Democrats  Plan to Bring Collective Bargaining to TSA     Collective Bargaining For TSA Has Previously Been Considered And Rejected    Collective bargaining at TSA has been a topic of discussion since its inception and has been evaluated and rejected in every instance   Collective bargaining was not included in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001  it was rejected by the TSA Administrator in 2003  and it was considered and rejected by multiple Federal and Labor Relations Courts from 2002 2006     Collective Bargaining Was Not Included In The 9 11 Commission Report    The 9 11 hijackers took advantage of static and predictable security procedures at U S  airports to successfully hijack four aircraft   TSA security strategy as recommended by the 9 11 Commission is based on flexible and unpredictable methods to prevent a repeat of previous attacks   Collective bargaining requires negotiating a predetermined framework within which the agency is required to operate   This is ineffective in the post 9 11 environment
