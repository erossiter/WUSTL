 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign offered written testimony for today  s House Subcommittee hearing on Yucca Mountain  criticizing the Department of Energy for haphazard and irresponsible work on the project   Today  s hearing was chaired by Representative Jon Porter       Mr  Chairman  I remain dismayed  but frankly not surprised  that DOE has again cut corners on the very program which has been set up to verify that all scientific data and engineering designs submitted to support a license for Yucca Mountain are accurate and reliable     Ensign  s statement reads in part     Despite its promises DOE has been unable or unwilling to correct quality problems with data  models  software  and management since 1998 and continues to rely on costly and cumbersome reviews that  to date  have proven ineffective   For over 20 years  DOE has had problems developing and implementing the plans and procedures related to quality assurance        Ensign  s statement also renewed his call for alternatives to Yucca Mountain       We need to find another solution to our nuclear waste problem  I think that we need to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to require the title to all spent nuclear fuel  stored in dry casks  to be passed on to the DOE upon on site transfer from storage pools to casks   Senator Reid and I introduced legislation to allow the DOE to assume liability of the waste onsite before it is transferred to Yucca Mountain   Conveying the title means the DOE will have full responsibility for the possession  stewardship  maintenance  and monitoring of all spent nuclear fuel          So far  the Department of Energy has done nothing to instill confidence that the science underpinning the Yucca Mountain program is truly sound
