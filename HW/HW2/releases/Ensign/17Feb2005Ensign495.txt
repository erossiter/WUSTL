 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign introduced legislation today that would provide greater access for Medicare recipients to physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language pathology services   The Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act of 2005 would repeal the Medicare beneficiary therapy caps that prevent many seniors from receiving therapy        It is irresponsible to set an arbitrary cap on how much therapy a Medicare beneficiary can receive     said Ensign     It ignores the health needs of our senior population  especially the oldest and sickest   That is why I call on my colleagues to repeal this cap now  before Medicare beneficiaries begin paying the price for our inaction            A recent study found that  in one year  almost 650 000 Medicare beneficiaries would have had their physical  occupational or speech language therapy benefits prematurely ended because of the cap        Therapy is crucial for the successful rehabilitation of seniors suffering from conditions such as stroke  Parkinson  s disease and congenital heart failure   Whatever limits are placed on their therapy options are also placed on their chances for recovery         Congress has already shown its opposition to this arbitrary cap by placing a moratorium on enforcement of the cap in 1999  2000 and 2003   The latest moratorium will expire on January 1  2006   Without congressional action  the beneficiary cap on therapy services will be effective again in less than a year   Cosponsors of Ensign  s legislation include Senators Lincoln  Hagel  Murray  Bingaman  Corzine  Johnson  Hatch and Collins
