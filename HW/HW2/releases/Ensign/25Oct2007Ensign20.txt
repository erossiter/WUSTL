 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign released a statement today calling for fiscal discipline and responsible management of the appropriations process  Tomorrow marks the first time since 1987 that Congress has failed to send the President a single appropriations bill this late in the year   Washington needs fiscal discipline  but the path being paved by the Democrats leads us in the wrong direction  Im disappointed that Congress has failed to send even one appropriations bill to the President  In 20 years  Congress has not waited this long  and the result is a rushed process that inevitably leads to more spending   We need to be responsible when we are spending the taxpayers dollars  and Im afraid thats not what Congress is doing right now  Weve passed spending bill after spending bill that exceeds the Presidents request  We cannot continue to increase spending and hope to eliminate the federal deficit    The American people want restrained spending  lower  fairer taxes  and responsibility in Washington  Thats what Congress should deliver
