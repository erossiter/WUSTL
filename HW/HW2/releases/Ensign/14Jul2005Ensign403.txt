 Washington  D C    The United States Senate has approved an amendment offered by Senator John Ensign that could dramatically shorten lines at airport security checkpoints   Ensign s amendment requires the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  to begin testing multi compartment bins for passenger belongings at TSA security checkpoints       As a frequent traveler myself  I am very aware of long lines at airport security   Ensign said   This is a common sense amendment that will make the entire security process move along smoothly  but at the same time travelers can be assured that their security isn t being compromised       Currently  passengers often have to place belongings in two  three  sometimes four bins  requiring more bins than necessary and creating longer lines  By using a multi compartment bin  passengers could use fewer bins for their belongings since they can place a cell phone  laptop  shoes  and other items in one bin   In this manner  TSA screeners have to view fewer images on computer screens   This issue was brought to Ensign s attention by officials at McCarran Airport          Moving passengers through security in a more efficient manner will not only benefit those traveling but also allow for the use of TSA employees in areas other than stacking and moving bins   Ensign said
