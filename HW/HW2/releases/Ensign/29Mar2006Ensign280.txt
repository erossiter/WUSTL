 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  s Invest in the USA legislation is responsible for  217 billion flowing back to the United States in 2005  according to a report by the American Shareholders Association   Invest in the USA  a provision included in the American Jobs Creation Act  created a one year window during which American companies with overseas assets could return those assets to American soil at a dramatically reduced tax rate          Many of the countries we compete with in the global economy do not tax their companies   foreign assets   This is the perfect example of how we are boosting our economy by leveling the playing field for American businesses     Ensign said     Rather than investing their money abroad  they are bringing those assets home and using them for job creation and investment right here        The Ensign provision lowered the tax rate for one year from 35  to 5 25  so that U S  companies that had kept assets abroad because of high tax rates would be encouraged to return the money to the United States   The report predicted that another  100 billion would return to the United States in 2006       For the first time in recorded history  foreign earnings retained abroad are negative     Ensign said     That is the way it should always be   We need to continue to encourage U S  companies to invest in our economy rather than that of another country   This is common sense legislation that is truly paying off        The report can be accessed at  http   www americanshareholders com news asa repats 03 20 06 pdf
