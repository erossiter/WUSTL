 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign is cosponsoring a bill designed to improve the monitoring and tracking of sex offenders in the United States   The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act was introduced today        Parents and law enforcement officials everywhere deserve the most effective means to monitor sex offenders so they can best protect our children     Ensign said     Too many children are suffering lifelong psychological damage at the hands of predators with previous offenses   We owe it to our nation  s children to strengthen the law wherever possible to prevent these horrible crimes         The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act places new requirements on sex offenders  including a requirement that they register before they are released from incarceration   This will cut down on the number of offenders who disappear after release despite the requirement that they sign onto a sex offender registry   In addition  the bill extends the length of time an offender is on a registry from 10 to 20 years and mandates that repeat offenders wear a monitoring device for life        We cannot provide children with adequate protection from sexual predators unless we know exactly who the offenders are and where they are     Ensign said     The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act will provide valuable tools for police and prosecutors and peace of mind for parents         The bill also requires offenders to update their registration in person twice a year and to provide up to date photos and fingerprints annually   A national sex offender DNA database will also be created under the terms of the legislation
