 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign is applauding the Department of Justice  s decision to support splitting the overburdened Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals   Ensign has long called for dividing the court and has introduced legislation to that effect   The DOJ position in favor of splitting the Ninth Circuit was outlined in a letter to House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner dated November 14         It is very gratifying to see the Department of Justice agree with those of us who have been calling for the split of the Ninth Circuit Court for some time     Ensign said     Hopefully  this will add to the momentum on this issue  and we will soon see the court divided into more manageable jurisdictions  which will improve the administration of justice in America        The letter to Chairman Sensenbrenner was signed by Assistant Attorney General William Moschella  who outlined the drastic increase in the Ninth Circuit Court  s caseload due to the population boom in western states including Nevada       The Department believes that dividing the Ninth Circuit would improve the administration of justice at the Federal level in the States located within that circuit     the letter reads     The sheer size of the Ninth Circuit has led to serious administrative difficulties that have adversely affected its ability to render justice efficiently        Along with Senator Lisa Murkowski  R AK   Ensign has introduced the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization and Modernization Act to divide the current Ninth Circuit into two new circuits   Under Ensign  s proposal  the new Ninth Circuit would include California  Hawaii  Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands   A new Twelfth Circuit would be comprised of Arizona  Nevada  Idaho  Montana  Oregon  Washington and Alaska
