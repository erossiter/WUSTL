 Washington  D C     The White Pine County Lands Bill  introduced by Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid yesterday  contains an expansion of the turf replacement program in Clark County  designed to dramatically conserve water in southern Nevada   Under the White Pine County bill  funds from land sales would be allocated to supplement the popular   cash for grass    program implemented by the Southern Nevada Water Authority       This is an opportunity to bolster and expand a program that drastically conserves water and doesn  t cost Nevada taxpayers a dime     Ensign said     Replacing water needy landscapes with desert xeriscapes requiring no water is a smart and responsible idea  and I  m proud to see the expansion included as part of the White Pine County Lands Bill        Under the White Pine County Lands Bill  a portion of the funds from land sales will be used to assist public institutions such as schools and local governments in replacing their current landscapes with more water efficient landscapes       The ongoing drought continues to be one of the more pressing problems in southern Nevada  and  with our growth continuing  the problem is just going to get worse without creative solutions     Ensign said     The Southern Nevada Water Authority created a smart  common sense remedy in its turf buyback program  and those sorts of solutions deserve our full support        Since being implemented in 1999  the Clark County turf buyback program has completed more than 20 000 turf replacement projects  saving more than 12 billion gallons of water   Expanding the turf buyback program will save 42 000 acre feet of water per year  an amount which is nearly 20  of southern Nevada  s allocation from the Colorado River
