 Washington  DC  One week ago today  Nevada s congressional delegation sent a letter to Gregory Friedman  Inspector General for the U S  Department of Energy  requesting an investigation into the  109 million contract awarded to the law firm Morgan  Lewis  and Bockius to represent the Energy Department  Today  the congressional delegation was notified that the Inspector General will officially investigate the contract      This is great news for Nevada and a huge blow to the dump  said Reid  Morgan  Lewis has a long history of working for the nuclear industry to force the dump on Nevadans  and it is laughable to think that this law firm can now provide DOE with objective advice required to serve the public interest  The Energy Departments hiring of a firm with such major conflicts of interest shows the extremes to which it will go to turn our state into the nations nuclear dumping ground  The hiring of this firm could be a waste of up to  109 million taxpayer dollars  I look forward to a speedy decision by the Inspector General   I m pleased the IG is investigating this because its blatantly irresponsible for the Department of Energy to hire a law firm with ties to Yucca Mountain proponents for a supposed impartial role in the licensing process  said Ensign  DOE should stop trying to rush this through  and as a nation we need to start considering new options because Yucca Mountain will never be built  Given the red flags raised by this contract there is no question that the IGs office is absolutely right to examine whether or not there is a conflict of interest that should ultimately disqualify Morgan  Lewis  said Congresswoman Berkley  The Bush administration is working overtime to see that Nevada is turned into a toxic radioactive waste dump  but we will continue to fight every one of their attempts to bend the rules or ignore the law in hopes of finally achieving that goal  The Nevada delegation looks forward to the findings of the IG  which could very well turn out to be dj vu all over again   The contract with Morgan Lewis is a lucrative deal which could potentially cost taxpayers millions of additional dollars  I am encouraged that the IG will investigate the potential conflicts of interest before committing more money to this financial  albatross  said Porter   The Energy Departments use of taxpayer money to hire a law firm with ties to the nuclear industry is clearly inappropriate  DOE has made one mistake after another over the course of their oversight of the Yucca Mountain project  Hopefully the IGs willingness to investigate this contract will result in the correction of their most recent mistake  said Heller
