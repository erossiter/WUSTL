 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign today released the following statement regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission  s ruling on the expensing of stock options   The SEC delayed for six months the implementation of a rule by the Financial Standards Accounting Board  FASB  requiring companies to recognize the cost of stock options in their bottom lines        This decision does not go far enough to protect investors  the business community  American entrepreneurs and our country  s economy from FASB s bad rules    The ability of individual investors to accurately monitor the economic health of companies has been significantly hampered and small businesses will be particularly impacted   At a time when we should be encouraging investment and economic stimulation  these FASB rules will instead create confusion and will slow economic growth   I will continue to explore legislative options in an effort to preserve broad based employee stock options           Senator John Ensign
