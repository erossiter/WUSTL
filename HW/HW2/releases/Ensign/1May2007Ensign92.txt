 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement today as the President vetoed a war spending bill sent to the White House by Democrats that calls for a surrender date      The President is right to veto this legislation because it handcuffs our military commanders and sets a surrender date for our troops fighting in Iraq        It s not just that this bill lets politicians micromanage the war  it also spends billions of dollars unrelated to our efforts in Iraq   Democrats promised fiscal discipline but this blatantly disregards their campaign promises   By adding this unrelated spending  Democrats are placing their own domestic priorities ahead of the needs of our troops on the front lines      Let s put politics aside and pass a war spending bill that the President can sign because  if the Democrats continue playing politics  the welfare of our troops will be jeopardized   Now is not the time to try and earn political points   Let s come together as Americans  support our troops and fight for victory in Iraq     CLICK HERE to watch Senator Ensign s related speech    CLICK HERE to listen to Senator Ensign s related speech
