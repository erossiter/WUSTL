 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign is condemning remarks by Senator Richard Durbin  D Ill  in which Senator Durbin compared members of the U S  military to Nazis  Soviets who ran prison gulags and Pol Pot  s Khmer Rouge regime        Any comparison of American men and women in uniform to the most evil regimes in mankind  s history is beyond irresponsible    it is vile and reprehensible     Ensign said     It is disgraceful for a member of the United States Senate to lower this discussion to such a shameful level         Senator Durbin  as reported by the Associated Press  made the comparison during a speech on the Senate floor while discussing an FBI report on the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay        If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in their control  you would most certainly believe this must have been done by Nazis  Soviets in their gulags  or some mad regime    Pol Pot or others    that had no concern for human beings     Durbin is quoted as saying      Senator Ensign said America  s servicemen and  women deserve better from America  s elected officials        We should always investigate allegations of wrongdoing and  if any is found  hold those responsible accountable   We should always have a full and free debate about these matters     Ensign said     However  to make such comparisons while our men and women in uniform are fighting and dying for us is truly sickening   I sincerely hope we hear no more senseless  hateful remarks of this kind on the floor of the United States Senate or anywhere else
