 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign tonight released the following statement in reaction to the announcement of an agreement to allow up or down votes on only three of President Bush  s judicial nominees       I am certainly relieved that three fine candidates for the federal bench will get what all nominees deserve  a fair up or down vote on the floor of the United States Senate   I believe we have set a harmful precedent with this agreement  however   We have allowed 40 senators to determine for all of us who will be considered by the Senate   I have expressed grave concern that good people will not want to put their names forward for consideration if they have to endure a grueling nomination process and still not be assured a vote by the Senate   That concern still exists for our best and brightest nominees with the creation of this deal  and it is a concern that should be shared by every American who cares about a strong and independent judiciary          Senator John Ensign
