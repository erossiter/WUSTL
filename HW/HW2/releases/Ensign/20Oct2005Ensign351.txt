 Washington  D C     An amendment by Senator John Ensign to prevent the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  from competing with private industry tax preparers has been approved as part of the Transportation Treasury HUD Appropriations bill   The IRS had strongly objected to the Ensign amendment       The IRS should not be getting into a field where taxpayers are already well served by the private sector     Ensign said     Having the IRS prepare tax returns poses risks and costs to taxpayers that I find unacceptable        Ensign  s amendment will thwart the IRS  s attempt to prepare tax returns for American tax payers in competition with private industry  which is currently serving taxpayers efficiently   The IRS effort would have also left taxpayers without protection or representation if returns were filed in error       Most tax preparing services offer free representation in the event of an audit or if an error is made     Ensign said     But if the IRS is the entity that prepared the return  as the agency has proposed  the taxpayer is left without that protection   Having the Internal Revenue Service enter the tax preparation market without important taxpayer protections is an unacceptable idea        Ensign also pointed out that private industry tax preparing organizations have prepared ten million tax returns for low income taxpayers over the past three years
