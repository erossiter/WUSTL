 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign will chair a hearing tomorrow on why soldiers are not permitted to use tear gas on the battlefield   Current policy does not allow for the non lethal use of tear gas  also referred to as Riot Control Agents  in current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan despite authorization being permitted by law   The hearing will be held by the Senate Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee on September 27  2006  at 10 00 a m  in Russell Senate Building  Room 222           It is an outrage that our men and women in uniform cannot use these defensive weapons to help protect their lives and the lives of innocent civilians     said Ensign     This is a non lethal alternative that will save lives in current and future operations   I  m outraged that troops in current military operations don  t have this life saving tool available to them even though legislation has been passed and an executive order signed        Senator Ensign sponsored legislation in 2005 that restated American policy that allows military use of tear gas by listing it as a non chemical weapon that can be used as an alternative to lethal force   Executive Order 11850 authorizes the use of tear gas in certain situations        I just simply cannot fathom why we are not allowing our soldiers and Marines to use these non lethal weapons     said Ensign     Throughout America police use tear gas to subdue crowds and flush suspects out of buildings   Not once have I heard of a death associated with its use   I believe in giving our men and women in uniform every tool they need to succeed  and this is a tool they need
