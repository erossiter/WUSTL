 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign introduced legislation today to require that a voter verified paper trail be used with touch screen voting machines   The Voting Integrity and Verification Act  VIVA  would clarify language in the Help America Vote Act  HAVA  that was signed into law in 2002        In the November 2004 elections  Nevadans entered a new frontier for casting their votes     said Ensign     We became the first state in the nation to require that voter verified paper audit trail printers be used with touch screen voting machines   Not only did our election go off without a hitch  but voters across Nevada left the polls with the knowledge that their vote would be counted and that their vote would be counted accurately   Every American should have that same confidence         Senator Harry Reid is a cosponsor of Ensign  s legislation        Congress set aside billions of dollars for states to buy new  more reliable electronic voting machines  But those machines aren  t perfect  and without a paper trail we can  t guarantee that all votes will be counted correctly     Senator Reid said    Nevada is the only state that had a paper trail system in place statewide for the last election  We need to help the rest of the country catch up to us  All Americans should know that their vote matters         A voter verified paper trail would allow voters to review a physical printout of their ballot and correct any errors before leaving the voting booth   This printout would be preserved at the polling place for use in any recounts   Some states have misinterpreted HAVA as requiring that machines be able to print vote totals or ballot images from a computer  outside the presence of the voter  long after the polls have closed   VIVA clarifies what is required by the states to ensure the integrity of the ballot         Congressman Jim Gibbons has introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives        Nevada led the nation in our state of the art electronic voting process last year   To ensure the most accurate and efficient voting procedure  it is time for the nation to follow Nevada s lead     said Gibbons     This legislation would ensure that every state has electronic voting machines with paper trails to guarantee a voter s vote is recorded clearly and counted accurately   In short  this bill improves our voting process for the 21st Century         Additional cosponsors of Ensign  s legislation in the Senate include Senators Burns  Feinstein  Nelson  Dayton  Chafee  Sununu and Durbin
