 Las Vegas  NV    Senator John Ensign made this statement following today  s vote by the BRAC Commission not to relocate eight Nevada Air National Guard C 130s to Little Rock  Arkansas   This vote  along with a series of other votes made over the last several days  will determine the Commission s final recommendations to the President which will be submitted by September 8        I am extremely pleased that the BRAC Commission has voted to keep the eight C 130s with the Nevada Air National Guard   The Reno based aircraft are crucial to homeland security efforts in our state  and eliminating them would severely hinder our ability to respond to any large scale emergency   We are a geographically large state with annual flooding  large scale wildfires  major fault lines  the largest dam in the nation and a tourist destination unlike any other in the world   The Nevada Air National Guard  s support of these diverse needs is paramount  and today  s vote allows that mission to continue
