 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement following President Bush s speech on his plan for Iraq      We are at a critical point in this war  and we cannot afford to fail   We cannot permit Iraq to be a failed state from which terrorists can launch attacks against the United States  The President put forward a comprehensive plan that calls for an increase in troops and putting more Iraqis back to work         I applaud the President s efforts to encourage the implementation of an oil revenue sharing plan where all Iraqis hold a share of their countries  wealth  This is a change in Iraq s direction that I believe will help lead to political stability because all Iraqis will have a stake in the future of their country          In order to be certain this plan can be effective  I believe we need to make sure our troops have all the flexibility and resources they need to bring us victory   They need to be able to go after the Shiite death squads  they need to be able to go into mixed Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods  they need to be able to go after Iranian operatives  They need to be able to use common sense tools like tear gas when they re going door to door rooting out insurgents         Now is not the time for partisanship   we need to forget whether we are Republican or Democrat and all be American   The bottom line is that the safety of the American people depends upon our success in Iraq
