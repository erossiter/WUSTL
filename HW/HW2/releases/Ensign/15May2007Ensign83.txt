 Washington  D C     United States Senator John Ensign made the following statement upon receiving confirmation from the Department of Defense that a Nevada soldier was among the missing after a patrol ambush in Al Taqa  Iraq     My thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Anthony J  Schober and his family  I cannot begin to imagine how they are dealing with this news  I want them to know that the people of Nevada and this nation are with them at this difficult time  and we are all hoping for the swift and safe return of Sergeant Schober
