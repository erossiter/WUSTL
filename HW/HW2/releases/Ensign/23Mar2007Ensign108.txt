 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement as Senate Democrats ignore their campaign rhetoric and pass a budget resolution that raises taxes and increases spending      There is a serious need for fiscal discipline in Washington  and we must start setting priorities and curtailing runaway spending   Raising taxes to pay for more spending is not the answer because passing along this enormous debt to our children and grandchildren is irresponsible      The Democrats  budget fails future generations by calling for record tax hikes and enormous spending increases   This is another example of Democrats in the Senate breaking their campaign promises   Already they ve ignored promises to work in a bipartisan manner  to promote open  honest government  and to support our troops   This time their hypocrisy will add  2 trillion to the national debt at a time when fiscal responsibility needs to be a top priority      We need to move toward smaller  more efficient government  and this plan pushes America in the wrong direction at the expense of taxpayers      Included below are some specifics on the Democrats  budget plan  which passed on a party line vote of 52   47     Calls for the largest tax increase in American history with some estimates at  900 billion    Spends more than  1 trillion of the Social Security surplus    Increases the national debt by  2 trillion    Contains zero proposals to cut or eliminate wasteful spending    Increases spending by more than  125 billion in just one year when compared to the President s budget
