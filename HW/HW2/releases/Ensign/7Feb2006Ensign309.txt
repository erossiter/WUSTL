 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  following a conversation with Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson this morning  said that increased construction costs will not derail the veterans   hospital and medical center planned for southern Nevada   Despite the fact that funding for the project was not included in the Department of Veterans Affairs FY   07 budget Ensign has been assured the project remains firmly on track  with groundbreaking set for later this year       I reiterated to Secretary Nicholson that this is a project that must be given the highest priority  and I  m proud to say he agreed and restated his commitment to helping us make it a reality for Nevada  s veterans     Ensign said     There may be some concern about the facility not being included in the VA  s budget  but there is no need for unnecessary alarm bells   The hospital is on track  and it will be built on schedule          I  m pleased to report that real progress is being made in establishing a new VA medical center in Las Vegas and we are on schedule to break ground this year     Secretary Nicholson said     Veterans and their families can rest assured that VA is firmly committed to this project and our support of this mission continues to be steadfast        The estimated cost of the construction of the hospital and medical clinic has risen from  286 million to  406 million due to an expanded architectural design and rising construction costs in the Las Vegas area   According to the VA  the funding level already approved is sufficient to keep the project on track through 2007       Our congressional delegation has worked hard to get this important project approved and funded  and we are all looking forward to the day that the facility  s doors open and Nevada  s veterans begin receiving the care they deserve without having to travel out of state to get it     Ensign said       A total of  259 million has already been approved for the planning  design and construction of the hospital and medical center   Groundbreaking remains scheduled for late August or early September of this year
