 Washington  D C    An amendment introduced by Senator John Ensign to create a Law Enforcement Assistance Force passed the United States Senate today   The legislation proposes a system for retired law enforcement personnel to voluntarily register and be called upon as qualified first responders for national disasters      This amendment makes use of one of our most valuable resources in an emergency situation  the men and women who have a lifetime of experience in law enforcement   said Ensign    We saw a desperate need for trained first responders in the days following Hurricane Katrina   We need to put this plan into action before another disaster of that magnitude strikes again        The Law Enforcement Assistance Force provides for retired law enforcement personnel to apply to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  and complete the necessary paperwork and training before a disaster occurs   That pool of qualified first responder volunteers could be called into action to work side by side with federal  state or local law enforcement agencies in the affected communities        A retired Las Vegas Metro police officer  Tom Page  came to me with this common sense idea to transform how we respond to disasters and emergencies   Ensign said    He understood the desire of retired law enforcement personnel to lend a hand in our darkest hours   We should channel that experience and desire into a force we can count on in situations of disaster and emergency      The amendment  added to the 9 11 Commission bill  also provides for DHS to reimburse volunteers for their expenses
