 Washington  D C     Earlier this week Senator John Ensign was presented with the   Star Among Men    award by the Video Access Alliance   Ensign was given the award because of his leadership on legislation introduced last July  The Broadband Investment and Consumer Choice Act   This legislation modernizes our communications laws to speed the entry of new competitors in the cable television market and is the basis for the comprehensive bill now before the Senate Commerce Committee       I am honored to receive this award  especially from an organization focused on giving consumers the choice they deserve     Ensign said     Outdated government regulation is denying consumers additional choice in video  and I believe local cable subscribers deserve more options at better prices        Current laws related to video franchising have not been updated since 1996  and advances in technology have made them obsolete         Our current regulations are outdated  and opening these markets will help both consumers     said Ensign     With open markets consumers are given the opportunity to find the best products at the best prices   The investment in new networks to provide video also has the tremendous benefit of faster  more widely available broadband   In the last few years we have fallen from 11th  to 13th  to 16th in the world in broadband   The country that invented the Internet needs to do much better  and the investment that will occur as a result of this legislation will help return the United States as one of the leaders in the world in high tech        Senator Ensign is Chairman of the Republican High Tech Task Force and Chairman of the Technology  Innovation and Competitiveness Subcommittee  Ensign  s technology and innovation leadership also includes the Invest in the USA Act which has infused more than  300 billion into the United States for job creation
