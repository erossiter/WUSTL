 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign introduced a broad tax bill today aimed at protecting millions of middle income Americans  small business owners and seniors from a tax increase With four members of the Finance Committee as original cosponsors  The AMT Repeal and Tax Freedom Act would fix a flawed tax policy  known as the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT   and encourage economic growth by permanently extending the tax cuts on capital gains  dividends and marginal rates   The AMT was originally intended to ensure that the wealthiest paid their fair share of taxes  but now this flawed policy ends up encroaching on middle income families  said Ensign We need to fix this once and for all with a full repeal   This bill has a double benefit of ending the AMT and stopping future tax increases for all Americans  Crapo added  The legislation maintains the maximum tax rate of 15 percent on long term capital gains and dividends  More than 20 percent of Idaho taxpayers report capital gains income or receive dividends  If we do nothing  taxes will go up for Idaho families investing for their childrens future and for Idaho seniors who rely on dividends to supplement their retirement income   Ensigns bill would prevent more than 23 million taxpayers from being affected by the AMT Congress never intended for the AMT to hit so many people  but  because it is not indexed for inflation  middle income Americans will be forced to pay higher taxes if a solution is not developed Ensigns bill would fix this problem Permanently extending the tax cuts on capital gains  dividends and marginal rates would protect more than 90 million taxpayers  including small business owners and seniors  from facing a tax increase   In todays global economy  we need to make sure our tax system does not encourage businesses to invest elsewhere or provide incentives for capital to be moved overseas  said Ensign The latest trend of tax increases is moving us in the wrong direction  but my legislation would put us back on track   The Democrats plan to let these tax cuts expire  which will result in a higher tax bill for 150 000 small businesses in Nevada Under one Democrat proposal to fix AMT  Nevada taxpayers on average would face a  361 tax increase Seniors on a fixed income will have to send more of their money to Washington as well because many seniors rely on investment income which will be taxed at a higher rate under the Democrats plan
