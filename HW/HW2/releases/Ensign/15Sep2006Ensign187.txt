 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign  in a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter  is asking for a hearing on the case of two U S  Border Patrol agents convicted in the shooting of an alleged drug smuggler in Texas   Ensign says he wants the incident more thoroughly investigated before the convicted agents are sentenced       I believe that Congress should thoroughly investigate the unanswered questions  involving this incident  This incident does involve allegations of wrong doing by the  agents  It also raises concerns about whether a conviction of the agents is just given the  facts of the case  I believe that Congress should also investigate this matter to ensure that this case does not negatively affect Border Patrol morale and the agency s efforts to  retain and attract highly qualified personnel or threaten the effectiveness of the agency in  a manner that undermines national security  We should also seek to ensure that this case  does not lead to the reluctance of Border Patrol agents to defend themselves in already  dangerous  and sometimes life threatening  situations     Ensign wrote     The U S  Border Patrol agents  Ignacio Ramos and Jose Alonso Compean  have been found guilty of using excessive force and are scheduled to be sentenced October 19   The incident involves the shooting of an alleged drug smuggler near Fabens  Texas  last February   Ensign said he wants to make sure the agents have been treated fairly and that the matter has been sufficiently investigated       Earlier this year  I traveled to Yuma  Arizona  and spent a day with the Border  Patrol along the United States Mexico border  I was able to see first hand the difficult  circumstances facing the Border Patrol and was very impressed with the job that this  agency plays in the protection of our nation  Every day  the men and women of the  Border Patrol are forced to deal with heavily armed drug smugglers and human  smugglers as well as the threat of terrorism     Ensign wrote     Ensign was contacted by Agent Compean  s relatives  who live in Nevada
