 Washington  D C   Senator John Ensign s continued efforts to protect children from sexual predators were praised recently by Big Brothers Big Sisters  Ensign received a letter of appreciation from Big Brothers Big Sisters President and CEO Judy Vredenburgh for sponsoring the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006  The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act protects children from sexual predators and gives law enforcement and prosecutors the necessary tools to arrest and prosecute sex offenders  Individuals committing these horrific crimes against children should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law  said Ensign  who has been a Big Brother for 10 years  This legislation will assist in putting sexual predators behind bars  and I will continue to work with Big Brothers Big Sisters to protect our children from these horrible individuals  Senator Ensign recently supported efforts to increase funding for the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act  His amendment to the recent Emergency Supplemental bill would have doubled funding for the U S  Marshals Service to track down the estimated 100 000 sex offenders who have failed to register and to prosecute child pornographers and individuals who exploit children  Unfortunately  these increases were removed by Democrats from the final bill  Big Brothers Big Sisters is a proven and effective program that has helped more than two million children nationally  and I commend them for their tremendous efforts in helping get at risk youth on the right track  said Ensign  With the help of Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Adam Walsh Act  more sex offenders will be behind bars  and our children will be safer  Big Brothers Big Sisters is a national organization mentoring at risk youth in more than 5000 communities throughout the United States and will assist approximately 266 000 children in 2007
