 Las Vegas  NV    Senator John Ensign  s Invest in the U S A  Act is being credited with bringing more than  191 billion in foreign earnings back to the United States by 91 S 500 companies   The Ensign provision  included in the American Jobs Creation Act that was signed into law October 22  2004  by President Bush  created a one year window during which American companies with overseas assets could return those assets to American soil at a dramatically reduced tax rate         It is very gratifying to see the impact that the Invest in the U S A  Act has had on the economy     Ensign said     More than  191 billion that would have been invested in foreign countries is instead boosting the U S  economy by increasing corporate tax revenues and reducing the deficit   The legislation is working exactly as we predicted it would         The Ensign provision lowered the tax rate for one year from 35  to 5 25  for the assets of U S  companies that were stranded overseas by high tax rates            Billions of dollars in assets that had been held overseas are now flowing into the American economy     Ensign said     The funds are being used to strengthen the financial stability of U S  companies  for expansion  for new hires and for research and development   This is common sense legislation that is now paying off to the benefit of our workers and our economy          The amount of money returned to the United States already exceeds by 41 percent the official government forecast of  135 billion put forward by the Joint Committee on Taxation   The results were released in a report from the American Shareholders Association  a non partisan  not for profit organization that analyzes legislation affecting shareholders   Economists and Wall Street analysts are estimating that the Ensign legislation will ultimately result in as much as  350 billion returning to the United States
