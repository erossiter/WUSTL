 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign has begun crafting legislation designed to thwart local governments intending to seize private property through eminent domain for commercial development   The bill would prohibit federal funds or tax advantages from going to any local government or private entity pursuing commercial developments through eminent domain      Ensign began working on the problem immediately after the recent Supreme Court decision allowing local governments to force the sale of private property for commercial projects   Ensign  s legislation would deny often crucial tax incentives to private corporations and other entities looking to develop seized land         Owning private property is a fundamental constitutional right of the American people guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment and  when the Supreme Court ruled it could be seized from private individuals so governments could pursue profit driven projects  I had to act     Ensign said     This is judicial activism at its worst  and I will do what I can to protect homeowners and property owners who might find themselves targeted by greedy local governments         In addition to denying local governments all federal funds for developing seized land  Ensign  s legislation would cut off incentives  such as tax code benefits  to private developers   By doing so  there would be no demand for seized property  making potentially seized land unattractive to commercial developers        This is an issue that demands action that is not only swift but also thorough and creative     Ensign said     It is my goal to provide peace of mind to property owners in Nevada and throughout the country by making it financially unfeasible to seize private land for development
