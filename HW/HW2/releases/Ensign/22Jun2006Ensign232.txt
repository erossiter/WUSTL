 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign will continue to fight to require the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  and the Joint Committee on Taxation  JCT  to provide a   dynamic scoring    analysis when scoring legislation  despite the defeat of an amendment Tuesday that would have put such a requirement in place   Ensign  s amendment was defeated by an 11 11 vote in the Senate Budget Committee Tuesday       We should not continue to implement tax and spending policy changes without knowing how those changes will impact America  s economy and affect the lives of the American taxpayers     Ensign said     This is too important an issue not to pursue  and I plan to continue to fight for a dynamic scoring requirement        Ensign  s amendment would not have replaced the current static scoring formula the CBO and JCT currently use but would have required an additional analysis that would examine how certain proposed policies impact the economy and tax structure       Tax policy alters the benefits of work  savings and investment     Ensign said    Dynamic scoring can help us determine the real impact of legislative proposals and whether they encourage or discourage economic growth         Ensign said he is encouraged by positive feedback on his amendment from both Republicans and Democrats and will work to get a dynamic scoring measure to the floor of the Senate this year
