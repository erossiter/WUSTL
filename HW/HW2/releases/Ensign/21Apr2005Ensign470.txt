 Washington  D C     A bill by U S  Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign that would protect Nevada  s right to regulate its own hunting and fishing has passed a Senate Committee       The bill would allow Nevada  and other states  to distinguish between residents and non residents when issuing hunting and fishing licenses  States have traditionally regulated all hunting and fishing within their borders  but a recent ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals questioned how states can allocate hunting tags for residents and non residents         Nevada sportsmen work hard to enhance the fish and wildlife habitat in Nevada     said Reid    Nevada  s hunting and fishing groups are actively involved in local  non profit conservation efforts  They also support conservation through taxes and fees  Nevadans invest in conserving our fish and game resources  and they should be rewarded for their efforts            This is a states   rights issue that should not be subject to federal interference     Senator Ensign said    Nevada  s incredible wildlife resources make it a natural attraction for hunters and fisherman  and our state has managed its recreational programs to the benefit of all Nevadans  That is how it should continue to be          Reid and Ensign  s bill would reaffirm the long standing right of states to make decisions about tag limits and licenses  The bill was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee today  and now goes to the full Senate for approval
