 Las Vegas  NV    Senator John Ensign applauded enactment of the Secure Fence Act which authorizes construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the southern border   The legislation was signed into law by President Bush today   Ensign saw first hand the need for secure fences in urban areas during a tour earlier this year along the United States Mexico border        It is critical to the security of our nation and our citizens that we secure our borders     Ensign said     Building fences in urban areas will greatly assist the efforts of our border patrol agents in preventing illegal entrance into our country and protecting our communities        Senator Ensign is responsible for two important pieces of legislation that have been enacted into law   He led the effort to double the number of trained border patrol agents  and  following his briefing on the border  he introduced legislation to send the National Guard to the border to provide support to the border patrol       Proving to the American people that we can secure our borders is also a step toward comprehensive immigration reform   I believe that the Secure Fence Act is an important tool in making sure that we know who is entering our country     said Ensign
