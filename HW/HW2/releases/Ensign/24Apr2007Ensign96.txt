 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign released the following statement regarding the conference report for the war spending bill which mandates troop withdrawal to begin no later than October 1  2007      I will vote against this bill because it sets a withdrawal deadline based on the judgment of politicians in Washington with no regard for our commanders on the ground   Victory in Iraq is not going to be easy  but a timetable for withdrawal amounts to surrendering to al Qaeda   It tells our enemy that their victory is on the horizon if they wait us out until the surrender deadline      Providing our troops with the resources they urgently need should not be a political issue  especially while our young men and women stand in harm s way   We need to support our troops by sending the President a war spending bill that provides our military with all the resources they need   It s already overdue
