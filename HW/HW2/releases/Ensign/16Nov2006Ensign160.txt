 Washington  D C    Senator John Ensign told a Senate committee today that a bipartisan public lands bill for White Pine County  written by Ensign and Senator Harry Reid  would provide tremendous benefits to Nevada and that the money generated from the bill should remain in the state for the good of the people of White Pine County  Ensign and Reid testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee today  The White Pine County Land Bill was written in cooperation with local governments  conservationists  hunters  citizens  federal agencies  individuals  community organizations  and other stakeholders      This bill will be a tremendous victory for the residents of White Pine County and all of Nevada   said Ensign  whose great grandparents settled in the county more than 100 years ago    It finds a balance with all groups involved   It gives economic opportunity to the residents of White Pine County and preserves Eastern Nevada s stunning landscapes   Also  this bill reduces fire hazards around Lake Tahoe and the Spring Mountains  helps purify Lake Mead s water  promotes water conservation  and provides more affordable housing throughout our state      Ensign also addressed critics of the legislation who seek to have the money from the White Pine land sales directed to the federal Treasury   Ensign has successfully fought off similar efforts in the past        If it was not for the Nevada Congressional delegation taking the initiative to write these lands bills  we would not have  for example  300 million at Lake Tahoe to do restoration work on federal lands   Ensign argued    I ask that you not penalize Nevadans for finding innovative ways to improve our public lands   Other Western states should follow the example we have set in Nevada and write their own bills
