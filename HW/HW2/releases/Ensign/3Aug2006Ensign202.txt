 Washington  D C     Senator John Ensign testified today before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on the Nuclear Fuel Management and Disposal Act which pushes for nuclear waste to be deposited at the Yucca Mountain repository       This bill doesn  t enhance the management and disposal of nuclear waste    it simply expedites it     stated Ensign     The bill tries to legislate around the scientific and safety flaws of Yucca Mountain because supporters of the project know that it will never be opened if current laws and regulations remain in place        The proposed bill removes all Department of Transportation  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Surface Transportation Board and state authority over the transportation of nuclear waste        Congress has heard repeatedly from experts who acknowledge that the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository will never be built because of the numerous and insurmountable scientific  safety and technical problems with the site     Ensign remarked     The bill claims to protect the health and safety of the public   Instead it erodes it   It undercuts safeguards for both the transportation and storage of nuclear waste  leaving the public more vulnerable than ever        The full text of his remarks can be read below        STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN ENSIGN    Hearing on S  2589  the Nuclear Fuel Management and Disposal Act    Before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources    Thursday  August 3  2006    Submitted for the Record    I want to thank the Chair  the Ranking  and other members of the Committee for the opportunity to present testimony on S 2589  the Nuclear Fuel Management and Disposal Act       I find the stated purpose of the bill to be outrageous    considering its content   The stated purpose of this bill is to enhance the management and disposal of nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste  to ensure protection of public health and safety  and to ensure the territorial integrity and security of the repository at Yucca Mountain   This bill fails on all three fronts     First  this bill doesn  t enhance the management and disposal of nuclear waste    it simply expedites it   The bill tries to legislate around the scientific and safety flaws of Yucca Mountain because supporters of the project know that it will never be opened if current laws and regulations remain in place   Congress has heard repeatedly from experts who acknowledge that the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository will never be built because of the numerous and insurmountable scientific  safety  and technical problems with the site   In addition  nearly three decades of poor management and oversight have demonstrated that the vast body of scientific and technical work done by the Department of Energy  DOE  and its contractors  is incomplete or moot due to constantly changing repository designs and plans which do not meet scientific standards       This legislation does nothing to correct those problems  it merely attempts to circumvent them   In fact  the bill changes the funding mechanism to remove Congressional control and eliminates much needed oversight of how taxpayer dollars are being spent on this project   It also scales back NRC licensing requirements and eliminates regulations with the idea of getting nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain as fast as possible  regardless of the potential consequences   With all the flaws apparent in the project to date  I believe it is disingenuous to claim that management and disposal will be enhanced by cutting corners and taking a   make it work    approach to the nations   most hazardous waste     Second  this bill doesn  t ensure protection of public health and safety    it erodes it   It undercuts safeguards for both the transportation and storage of nuclear waste  leaving the public more vulnerable than ever   It removes all Department of Transportation  DOT   Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC   Surface Transportation Board  and state authority over nuclear waste transport so that DOE has sole control over a nuclear transportation scheme of unprecedented magnitude   Shipments of waste would be exempt from present and future DOT safe routing regulations  from DOT safety regulations  and from NRC safeguards regulations       Furthermore  the bill would exempt material that is transported or stored in NRC licensed containers or located at Yucca Mountain from federal  state  and local environmental requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  RCRA    This would eliminate the requirement that hazardous non nuclear contaminants mixed with the nuclear waste be identified and treated according to RCRA  Clearly this evasion of RCRA could serve as a precedent that would impact future transuranic waste shipments to the WIPP facility  as well as DOE environmental clean up and legacy management sites across our nation       In February of this year  the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  released its report on the dangers associated with transporting nuclear waste and advocated that states and local governments have a central role in any successful waste transportation program   This legislation directly contradicts that recommendation   It abolishes state  local  and tribal government transportation authority and circumvents involvement from other federal agencies  such as NRC  DOT and the Department of Homeland Security  which is currently called for under exiting law   According to DOE  45 states  700 counties  and 50 Native American tribes will be affected by the transport of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain   Common sense would dictate that giving away all transportation authority to DOE  rather than the agencies and communities directly affected  does not protect the almost 11 million people within a half mile of the transportation route     Third  this bill does not ensure the territorial integrity and security of Yucca Mountain   Instead  it jeopardizes national security by withdrawing land currently controlled by the Air Force and the Nevada Test Site   One of the premier test and training sites in the country  Nellis Air Force Base has a varied mission portfolio that is met only by the size and diversity of its ranges and capabilities   Similarly  the Nevada Test Site is the only location that offers safe  secure  and remote testing for defense systems and high hazard operations   Not only does this legislation call for a land withdrawal from these two sites  it also hands DOE the rights to the airspace  giving a non defense agency the right to dictate what missions and operations can be conducted   This is not a zero sum game   Withdrawing land to ensure the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain meets NRC licensing guidelines would erode the integrity of Nellis and the Test Site   It is not prudent to risk our national security by limiting the ability of these unique assets for a project like Yucca Mountain  which remains riddled with problems and questions and is doomed for failure       We need to find another solution to our nuclear waste problem and this legislation is not it   Instead  we need to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to require the title to all spent nuclear fuel  stored in dry casks  to be passed to the DOE upon on site transfer from storage pools to casks   Senator Reid and I introduced legislation to allow the DOE to assume liability of the waste onsite before it is transferred to Yucca Mountain   Conveying the title means that the DOE will have full responsibility for the possession  stewardship  maintenance  and monitoring of all spent nuclear fuel   The DOE would also be made responsible for various maintenance and oversight that would be associated with implementation     The fact remains that if Yucca Mountain was a workable  safe  and scientifically sound plan  it would not require legislation to move it forward   This bill only makes Yucca seem workable on paper by rolling back the many laws and regulations designed to protect the public health and safety of all Americans
