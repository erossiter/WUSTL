 Washington  D C     The energy bill approved by the United States Senate today contains a provision fought for by Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid that will protect Nevada consumers from more than  300 million in outstanding contracts that defunct energy company Enron is attempting to collect from Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power        Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power entered into contracts in good faith and now face the prospect of being on the hook for  300 million in power our state never received     Ensign said     Obviously that is an unacceptable situation because the bill would be paid by residential ratepayers  so I  m very pleased that our fix to this problem is part of the energy bill           It was unacceptable that an unscrupulous company like Enron was trying to charge  300 million for power they never actually delivered  Hard working Nevadans should not have to pay for Enron  s shady behavior     Reid said    That  s why we worked so hard to get this provision in the energy bill  It will protect Nevada  s companies and Nevada  s families         The provision  introduced by Senator Maria Cantwell with support from Ensign and Reid  mandates that a ruling on the validity of the outstanding contracts be made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  as opposed to a bankruptcy judge   FERC has already indicated that the power contracts should not be enforced  making it likely the commission will issue a ruling favorable to Nevada ratepayers
