Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Soon after the holiday season ends  2008 will be upon us  It is a year that promises to hold a lot of excitement and new possibilities for the future of our great nation  Before the clock winds down on 2007  though  I want to look back on this past years accomplishments in the 110th Congress and remind Arkansans of all that we have achieved together   Last November  the American people made a down payment for change by sending a clear signal when they went to the pollswe need a new direction for our country  No issue defined that election or consumed the hearts and minds of Arkansans more than Iraq    Unfortunately  the stark reality is that the President  aided by his allies in Congress  stymied effort after effort by this Congress to bring about real change  Despite those setbacks  the new Congress has begun to bring accountability and oversight to the Presidents conduct of the war for the first time in five years   The status quo that accepted waste  fraud  and abuse is over  As we move into 2008  Iraq will remain a top priority for this Congress  We will continue to press President Bush to bring our troops home safely and responsibly while maintaining that the Iraqi people must reach a political solution and achieve peace  It is time for them to stand on their own   This Congress was also able to address other priorities of the American people for the first time in a decade and passed significant legislation that gave Americans a quick return on their down payment for change   Early in this Congress  the House and Senate implemented the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission to increase our first responders capabilities and protect our nation from terrorism   We passed a lobbying and ethics reform bill to increase transparency in the legislative process   At a time when the Department of Veterans Affairs is seeing an influx in veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan  this Congress passed the largest funding increase for veterans health care in the history of our country   We also approved the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act that included a provision that I championed to prevent disabled veterans from being unfairly taxed due to administrative errors by the Department of Veterans Affairs   Congress also acted to approve the 2008 Defense Authorization Act which included a provision that was a part of the Total Force GI Bill that I introduced with Congressman Vic Snyder  It allows National Guard and Reserve members who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan to use the educational benefits they have earned for up to ten years after their service   In addition  the largest increase in college aid to students since the G I  Bill was signed into law so that more Americans can afford a quality education and help our country remain competitive in the global economy for years to come   The President signed a comprehensive energy bill passed by Congress that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil  The bill includes incentives for renewable energy sources  encourages energy conservation through efficiency in appliances and our homes  and implements the most significant fuel efficiency standards in our history  In 2008  I look forward to building on this progress by passing a complementary package of energy tax incentives   This Congress also worked hard to provide relief for working families  For the first time in 12 years  we passed a long overdue increase in the federal minimum wage  raising it to  7 25 per hour   Congress passed legislation to prevent nearly 25 million Americans from being unfairly taxed by the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  which could have resulted in their paying  2 000 to  3 000 more in taxes   We also worked to address the problem of homeownership and passed a provision that I have long championed to allow a tax deduction for homeowners who make less than  110 000 and pay private mortgage insurance premiums   And in the final days of the 110th Congress  we passed the most significant farm legislation in our countrys history  It was a strong  fair  and balanced bill that provided more resources for nutrition  conservation  rural development  and renewable energy than ever before  It also preserved the modest safety net for Southern farmers so that they can continue to compete in the global marketplace  This bill still awaits final negotiations between House and Senate leaders before being sent to the President   As we look ahead to 2008  there are still many priorities that we must address  Like many hard working families across America  I was disappointed in the Presidents decision to veto a bipartisan childrens health insurance bill that would have provided health coverage 10 million children in this county  including 110 000 in Arkansas  We must address this issue again in 2008 so that working class families across our country can know their children will be able to receive the medical care they need    Also  I will continue to advocate for broader reform to Medicare and Medicaid  to renew and reform the No Child Left Behind Act for education  and to address health care for the self employed and small businesses  I am proud of what we achieved and accomplished in 2007  and Arkansans can be sure that I will continue to move forward to complete the work that the American people have asked us to do
