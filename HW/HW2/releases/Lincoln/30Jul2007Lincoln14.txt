Guest Column by U S  Senator Blanche L  Lincoln                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 30  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 This week  the U S  Senate is set to renew the ten year old State Childrens Health Insurance Program  known nationally as CHIP and in Arkansas as ARKids First  As the mother of twin boys  I know all too well the need for reliable health insurance coverage for children  Like so many parents throughout our state  my husband and I have experienced the long sleepless nights by their sides  and weve stayed at home to care for them whenever they come down with the illnesses that children often do  In situations like these  health insurance coverage is critical  not only to the lifelong health of a child but also to a family s peace of mind  But that peace of mind should not only belong to families who can afford private health insurance  it should also belong to the working families who are struggling to make ends meet  ARKids First and similar programs across our country are federal state partnerships which provide health care coverage for more than 6 million children  Since the federal programs inception ten years ago  the number of children without health care coverage has dropped by one third nationwide  ARKids First covers approximately 65 000 children in Arkansas  and in conjunction with Medicaid  it has been tremendously successful in reducing the number of uninsured children in our state  Arkansas has been a leader nationwide in reducing its number of uninsured children from over 20 percent in 1997 to 10 percent today  Yet despite our successes  an estimated nine million children across our country remain uninsured  nearly two thirds of whom are eligible for programs like ARKids First or Medicaid  Over the past several months  I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Senate Finance Committee to cover more of these children  The extraordinary bipartisan effort we have put forth has made renewal of this vital program much more of a reality   If passed in the Senate  our bill would provide  at minimum  an additional  35 billion over five years that will allow states to preserve coverage for the children currently enrolled while reaching an additional 3 2 million uninsured  low income children  The bill also takes steps to ensure that children get a healthy start in life by providing care for low income pregnant women  and it establishes pediatric quality measures to improve the level and efficiency of care they receive  Investing in care early in life can stem long term health issues later on and can save taxpayers billions of dollars in potential costs for caring for unhealthy individuals  Unfortunately  despite overwhelming bipartisan support  President Bush has threatened to veto this bill  He has countered with a plan that provides only a  5 billion increase over the next five years  Under his meager proposal  one million children currently covered by CHIP would be dropped from their current health insurance coverage  and the additional 3 2 million we seek to cover in our bill would also be left out  The Presidents signature education policy played up the theme about leaving no child behind  yet it seems he is willing to do exactly that to millions of low income children who need medical insurance  To me  that is unacceptable  After all  how can we expect children to be ready to learn if they are not healthy when they enter the classroom  In a time when more and more Americans are struggling to find affordable health care  it is our moral obligation to ensure that of our nations children receive quality care to ensure a healthy future  State health insurance programs like ARKids First have allowed us to cover millions of children which is critical to the lifelong health of a child and to a familys peace of mind  As we move forward together to renew state childrens health insurance programs  I am hopeful that we can do so in the same bipartisan spirit that was demonstrated when it was created ten years ago  It is up to us to put politics aside  not only for the future of our nation  but for the well being of millions of children across our nation  They are depending on us  and its time that we fulfill our commitment to them
