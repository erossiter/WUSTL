                    Lincoln on U S  Attorneys Controversy                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln on U S  Attorneys Controversy  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 15  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today released the following statement on the controversy involving the firing of eight U S  Attorneys    Each day  we learn more and more about this Administration s general attitude towards transparency and our system of checks and balances   Information revealed this week shows that the Justice Department deliberately planned to circumvent the rules for appointing U S  Attorneys by politicizing an emergency provision in the Patriot Act           While the Administration publicly said that they desired their nominee  Tim Griffin  to go through the nomination process before the Senate  emails between White House staff and Justice Department officials made public this week prove they planned to  run out the clock  to avoid a process required by our Constitution           We know that U S  Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President   Our forefathers gave the executive branch the power to appoint U S  Attorneys   But our founders also created a necessary set of checks and balances by the legislative branch to approve the President s nominees   Without this constitutional system  the judicial branch of government would simply be an extension of the executive branch           Ultimately  the Administration s actions are a disservice to all Americans who have been denied a voice   Next week  the Senate will take up a bill to restore its advisory role in the confirmation process  and I strongly support that measure                      Given the involvement of the Attorney General s office in intentionally trying to avoid the Senate confirmation process   combined with the serious reservations many in the Senate have had about the Attorney General s nomination since he was appointed   I believe the Administration and the nation would be better served if Mr  Gonzales were replaced           I voted against confirming Mr  Gonzales when he was appointed because I was not confident he could exercise the independence and judgment that the post of Attorney General demands   The U S  Attorneys controversy has caused a serious breach between the Justice Department and Congress  a breach that I m not sure can be repaired if Mr  Gonzales remains Attorney General
