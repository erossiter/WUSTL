Senator Blanche Lincoln

 Katie Laning  202 224 4843 During this time of year  many of us are focused on preparing for Christmas dinner or finding that last minute gift for a family member   In our attempt to have the perfect Christmas  we can often worry over every detail and take the joy out of what should be a very joyous season   At those times  it   s important to slow down and reflect on the fact that gifts and a holiday feast are not what   s most important   We do the most to honor this season of the year when we think of others and give of ourselves   Many Arkansans are doing just that        Whether it   s answering the call of duty and serving in the Middle East or opening our homes and communities to the victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita  this has been a year when Arkansans have given their all   We   ve watched as members of our 39th Infantry Brigade returned from Iraq in April with 42 fewer members and much heavier hearts   More than 160 000 of their fellow service members remain in Iraq   The bravery and sacrifice of the 39th and all service members should be a reminder of what selfless giving really means      Our state has also served as a refuge for thousands of Mississippi and Louisiana residents during the weeks and months after hurricane Katrina and I am proud of the many stories of kindness and compassion generated by Arkansans during this time       The holiday season is a perfect time to focus on what   s most important   We can all look for ways to show support for the soldiers and families who sacrifice for us in distant lands   We can also help uplift families who have had difficult years   Here are a few suggested ways in which you can help     Operation USO Care Packages  The United Service Organizations  Inc   USO  is enlisting support of individuals around the world to support the troops through Operation USO Care Package  With a donation of  25 you can sponsor a care package and include a personal message of support and encouragement  These USO Care Packages include items that are generally requested by military personnel and a message from the donor thanking them for their service and sacrifice  You can find out more at www usocares org     Children of Fallen Soldiers Relief Fund  The Fund is a non profit organization founded as a means of providing College Grants and Financial Assistance to surviving children and spouses of our U S  Military service members who have lost their lives in Iraq or Afghanistan  Its    financial assistance program assists disabled service member families as well  You can learn more at www cfsrf org      Arkansas Foodbank Network  The Arkansas Foodbank Network is a nonprofit organization that was developed in 1984 with a mission to eliminate hunger in Arkansas  They solicit  secure  collect and distribute over 7 million pounds of food to more than 450 food pantries and feeding programs in 44 Arkansas counties  They have ample opportunities for Arkansans to donate and volunteer  You can learn more about how you can help at www arkansasfoodbank org      Arkansas Hunters Feeding the Hungry  Arkansas Hunters Feeding the Hungry is a highly successful program that has provided approximately one million meals to the state   s most needy citizens  Through the program  hunters are urged to donate one deer or a portion of a deer to Arkansas Hunters Feeding the Hungry so that the state   s less fortunate can have healthy meals  They have about 32 meat processors statewide who accept and process venison and other wild game from hunters for the program  To find out how you can help call 1 877 945 2543 or 501 224 9200 and ask for Bob Barringer     Finally  don   t forget to look for ways you can contribute in your own neighborhood   There are so many opportunities  big and small  to affect someone   s life for the better   If you know of a local church or synagogue that is helping support and uplift those in your community  don   t hesitate to let them know that you can help  This holiday season  let   s remember to show how grateful we are for our blessings through sacrifice and service to others
