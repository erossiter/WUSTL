                    Lincoln Advocates Greater Access to Educational Benefits for Military Reservists Before Key House Hearing                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln Advocates Greater Access to Educational Benefits for Military Reservists Before Key House Hearing  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 27  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today continued her fight to give America   s military reservists greater access to the educational benefits they have earned while serving overseas      Lincoln testified today at a joint hearing of the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Subcommittees to discuss Montgomery G I  Bill benefits for active duty service members and the Selected Reserve  Lincoln received a special invitation to testify at the hearing because of her efforts to allow National Guardsmen and reservists to access their increased educational benefits in the same way that active military personnel already do      More than 500 000 members of the National Guard and Reserve  including more than 8 000 Arkansans  have been called upon for duty since the tragic events of September 11th   Lincoln told House members at today   s hearing   Nearly 1 700 Guardsmen and Reservists from Arkansas are currently mobilized  These citizen soldiers are serving with distinction in a hostile environment to defend the freedoms we cherish as Americans  As their families and communities welcome them home with open arms  our nation should do the same by ensuring they receive the benefits they   ve earned      The Montgomery G I  Bill in its current form does not allow military reservists who have served on active duty to access their increased educational benefits once they separate from their service  This stands in stark contrast to active duty soldiers who have up to ten years after their separation of service to utilize their educational benefits  In fact  these benefits continue to be the only benefit that military reservists who have been on active duty in the War on Terrorism may not access when they eventually separate from service     Lincoln believes that guardsmen and reservists who have been on extended activations comparable to active duty soldiers deserve comparable transition and readjustment benefits  Her proposal to give military reservists greater access to the benefits they have earned was successfully included as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act now currently being considered by a Senate House conference committee
