Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today unveiled six legislative initiatives to reduce our nation   s dependence on foreign oil by encouraging the use of cleaner  renewable energy developed in Arkansas            Taken together  these bills are aimed at encouraging the production and use of cleaner renewable energy  right here at home  so that the United States will no longer suffer from the whims and manipulations of foreign suppliers and cartels like OPEC     Senator Blanche Lincoln said      We can   t deny the fact that we live in an age of uncertainty in the global marketplace     Faced with this current climate of instability  it   s critical that we explore and develop all possible domestic options as sources for our energy supply   Energy independence is not only a key component of our nation   s economic independence  but it is a key component of our national security         Lincoln said her package of energy incentives would encourage the development of alternative fuels  promote more energy efficient consumption  expand access to natural gas  give our farmers the incentive to turn their agricultural commodities and waste products into renewable fuels  such as biodiesel  and give livestock farmers incentives to turn their waste by products into renewable fuel      Lincoln has been successful at getting several of these tax related measures to promote biofuels included in both the 2003 and 2004 Senate Energy Bills   However  both of these bills were mired in partisan politics and never passed   Lincoln   s energy package  which could convert Arkansas into a significant source of renewable energy  includes the following        Biodiesel incentives  This legislation would extend tax incentives to encourage the production and use of biodiesel  a clean burning alternative fuel produced from renewable sources such as soybean  cottonseed  rice oils or animal fats   Lincoln said that farmers in Arkansas and other farm states will benefit from increased production of this environmentally friendly  biodegradable fuel       Energy efficient appliances  This legislation would create tax incentives to encourage appliance manufacturers to produce super energy efficient washing machines  dishwashers and refrigerators   Lincoln said this bill would encourage the development and production of these appliances and allow consumers to benefit from cost and energy savings       Expanded access to natural gas pipelines  This legislation would encourage companies to construct new natural gas delivery pipelines through tax incentives   Lincoln   s legislation would help ensure that more rural Arkansas consumers have access to natural gas to heat their homes and fuel cooking appliances         Animal wastes  This legislation would encourage the production of energy from animal waste and rendered fat  which would benefit Arkansas    poultry producers   Lincoln   s bill would create tax incentives for energy production from alternative sources which include liquid fuels  while at the same time reducing the amount of animal wastes generated in agricultural production       Turning landfill gas into energy   Lincoln   s bill would encourage the production of energy from landfill gas   This legislation would establish tax incentives for the additional collection and use of methane gas generated by decomposing garbage from landfills  which can be developed into energy to fuel clean burning vehicles and power generators to produce electricity        Municipal trash combustion  This legislation would encourage the production of clean  renewable energy from municipal solid waste  while helping communities meet the challenge of trash disposal   This bill would provide tax incentives to produce energy from municipalities    waste and would save valuable land while significantly reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere
