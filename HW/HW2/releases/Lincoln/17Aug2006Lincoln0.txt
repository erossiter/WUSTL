               Lincoln  Pension Reforms Will Help Protect America   s Workers  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 17  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   said that when President Bush signs a pension reform bill today  the new law will immediately shore up the country   s private pension funding and help provide America   s workers the retirement security they have earned through those plans      From the recent Enron and WorldCom scandals and other corporate mismanagement of employer funded pension plans  it is clear that America   s working families need stronger protections to safeguard their lifetime savings   Lincoln said   This reform package is an important step in strengthening our country   s pension funding and giving our workers the assurance that the benefits they have earned will be there for them when they retire  Companies have a legal and moral obligation to their employees to provide those promised benefits  and this law will help Corporate America fulfill that responsibility       Earlier today Lincoln  a member of the Senate Finance Committee which crafted several measures of the overall package  participated in the bill signing by President Bush at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building  Lincoln noted that the bipartisan legislation  which passed the Senate by a vote of 93 5  is an example of what can be accomplished when the two parties work together for the public good      I commend Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus for their steadfast commitment to shepherd through a series of meaningful reforms that will help America   s workers   Lincoln said   Their leadership ensured the bipartisan passage of legislation dedicated to working families  Congress should strive to work regularly in this bipartisan spirit      The new law includes several reforms to shore up companies    pension plans and provide workers real retirement security by making each underfunded plan in this country 100 percent funded  Lincoln stressed that with Baby Boomers beginning to hit retirement age  it   s even more important to ensure workers    retirement savings  The new law imposes changes to funding formulas to ensure that businesses are meeting obligatory payments to their pension plans  It also requires businesses to provide more information to their employees regarding the health of the plan  including disclosure of funding levels      In addition  the law sets up restrictions on new benefits a business can offer until all promised benefits are received  It also sets aside more time for struggling airlines to meet their commitments to their employees and provide continuity in the airline industry   s pension system      The comprehensive legislation also includes several savings initiatives for America   s workers  Lincoln noted that Americans are at the lowest savings rate in our country   s history  The important savings provisions included in this legislation are     Permanent Extension of 2001 Savings Tax Incentives     The measure permanently extends savings incentives that were enacted in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001  The annual contribution limit for Individual Retirement Accounts increases to  5 000 in 2008 and is indexed for inflation thereafter  Without this action  the limit was set to return to  2 000 in 2011  Additionally  the 2001 law increased annual contribution limits for IRAs and qualified pension plans and created additional  catch up  contributions that allow people age 50 and over to make additional contributions to boost their savings before retirement     Individual Retirement Accounts Distributions for Guardsmen and Reservists     The new law provides that distributions from an IRA or pension plan taken by members of the National Guard or Reserves who are called to active duty through 2007 are not subject to early withdrawal penalties      529 Qualified Tuition Programs     The legislation makes permanent a tax exemption for state sponsored college savings plans  allowing families to make withdrawals from their accounts tax free to pay for higher education expenses  This provision  which was set to expire in 2010  is critical in helping parents save for their children   s college education  The GIFT college investing plan is a 529 plan sponsored by the state of Arkansas      Saver   s Credit     A provision in the new law makes permanent a saver   s tax credit aimed at lower  and moderate income taxpayers  The credit  which was set to expire this year  allows workers who make contributions to an IRA or qualified pension plan to receive a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first  2 000 of annual contributions  The credit is available to married workers with incomes of up to  50 000 and single workers up to  25 000     Split Tax Refunds     A provision in the new law encourages retirement savings by allowing workers to choose whether they want to deposit a portion of their federal tax refund directly into an IRA  Previously  workers were only able to deposit their entire federal tax refund
