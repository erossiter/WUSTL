Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     At a U S  Senate Finance Committee hearing today  U S  Senators Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   said that a bill she   s introduced would offer small businesses more affordable health care choices for their employees without sacrificing important benefits like diabetes supplies and mammograms          The crisis of ever escalating health care costs is not going away  and in fact  it   s getting worse     said Lincoln      Small Businesses know that offering health insurance helps them with recruitment  retention  employee performance  and the overall success of the business   This is something I firmly believe Congress should address right now   Our bill would help our small businesses  the true backbone of our communities  and it would allow us to begin to address the very real needs of the working uninsured         Lincoln touted her bill at a Finance Committee hearing today which she requested to examine various approaches to small business health insurance   Lincoln   s bill  titled the    The Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act of 2006      SEHBP  which she has introduced with Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois  would allow small businesses with up to 100 employees to band together for lower health care prices by pooling their purchasing power and spreading their risk over a large number of participants          One thing I   ve learned in the time I   ve served in the Senate  when you have a good idea it   s good to have an ally on the Senate Finance Committee     said Durbin      And the first ally that I have is Blanche Lambert Lincoln         The high cost of health insurance is the top concern for small businesses in Illinois and across America     Durbin continued      With today   s coverage options  small businesses are unfairly forced to make a choice between taking care of their employees and paying the bills that keep their doors open   Our Small Employers Health Benefits Program will give employees of small businesses the same kinds of health care choices Members of Congress already have  for less than they pay now  while making it affordable for owners to provide it          Lincoln and Durbin have worked on their SEHBP proposal together since 2003 and said that their bill is modeled after the successful    Federal Employees Health Benefits Program    which has provided health care benefits to federal workers for over 40 years   A competing plan  offered by Senator Mike Enzi  R WY   would bypass state mandated coverage for many important health needs and allow insurance companies to define benefits packages       Lincoln welcomed Star City native  Len Nichols  to today   s Finance Committee hearing   Nichols  who currently serves as the Director of the Health Policy Program at the New America Foundation in Washington  praised Senator Lincoln   s bill as the better approach to help small businesses offer health insurance options for their employees   Nichols said that Lincoln   s bill would insure a greater number of small business employees than Senator Enzi   s bill because her approach would preserve state mandated coverage such as dental anesthesia procedures  various out patient services  Hospice care  children   s preventative health care  and maternity and newborn coverage           Lincoln   s bill  which combines the best of what the government can do with the best that the private sector can do  has been endorsed by and array of organizations including   the American Academy of Family Physicians  the American Medical Association  the American Osteopathic Association  the Consumers Union  the Federation of American Hospitals  the National Association of Community Health Centers  the National Association of Women Business Owners  the Small
