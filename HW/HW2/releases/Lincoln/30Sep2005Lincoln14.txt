2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   took to the Senate floor today to demand that the Senate take immediate action to pass a much needed emergency health care relief package to help those who have been affected by Hurricane Katrina      Earlier this month  Lincoln introduced the  Emergency Health Care Relief Act of 2005   which has the bipartisan support of the Senate Finance Committee   s top two ranking members  Chairman Charles Grassley  R Iowa  and Ranking Member Max Baucus  D Mont        Lincoln has maintained that the measure is desperately needed to help the hundreds of thousands of people that have been displaced by the Hurricane Katrina and as a result  have placed excessive demands on our health care system  Lincoln said that now is the time to ensure that hurricane survivors have quick access to health care  and to ensure that states have the peace of mind to know that they will not be shouldering the financial burden alone      The following is a transcript Lincoln s remarks on the Senate floor delivered mid day today                    THANK YOU  MR  PRESIDENT  I COME TO THE FLOOR             TODAY TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN WHAT WE HOPE TO BE AN             OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY BRING ABOUT AN AWARENESS OF THE DIRE             NEED  NOT JUST OF THE EVACUEES  OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE             AFFECTED STATES WHO HAVE RECEIVED SUCH INCREDIBLE  DEVASTATING             NATURAL DISASTERS  BUT ALSO THE OTHER AMERICANS THAT ARE             INVOLVED IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE  THE OTHER AMERICANS WHO HAVE                 OPENED THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOMES  THEIR HOSPITALS AND             CLINICS  THEIR PHARMACISTS    THEIR PHARMACIES  THEIR COMMUNITY             CENTERS  THEIR CHURCH BASEMENTS  THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE             RECOGNIZE WHAT HAD IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN  THEY VE             RECOGNIZE WHAT HAD IT MEANS TO BE A FELLOW AMERICAN  AND             THEY VE RECOGNIZED WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR  MR              PRESIDENT  I WAS  OH  I GUESS TONGUE IN CHEEK PERHAPS                 CRITICIZED FOR BEING A LITTLE OVERPASSIONATE ON THIS ISSUE  SO             I GUESS I LL RESUME MY GOOD  SOFT SPOKEN  AND COMMON SENSE             APPROACH TO WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE TO BE A REAL PROBLEM  TO             HAVE DEEPER ROOTS IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE VALUES THAT WE AS             AMERICANS REALLY DO PROFESS AND ARE WILLING TO PUT OUR MONEY             WHERE OUR MOUTH IS WHEN WE SPEAK OF THESE VALUES  AND TO REALLY                 TALK ABOUT NOT JUST THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT BUT ALSO THE LONG TERM             IMPACT OF THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE OR THAT WE FAIL TO MAKE IN             A TIMELY WAY  SO I LL COME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE              MAYBE KEEPING MY COMPASSION DOWN A LITTLE BIT WILL BE HELPFUL              BUT IT S HARD  MR  PRESIDENT  WHEN WE LOOK OUT AND SEE THE KIND             OF COMPASSION IN THE FACES OF THE INCREDIBLE CONSTITUENTS THAT             WE SERVE  THAT WE REPRESENT  THAT WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF                 COMING TO THIS FLOOR TO REPRESENT EACH AND EVERY DAY  WE ALSO             LOOK OUT AT THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT WE ALSO CAN BE PROUD OF              OUR NATION S HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS  AND STATES THAT HAVE BEEN                AT A TIME    HAVE BEEN THERE AT 00 TIME WHEN VULNERABLE             AMERICANS NEED THEM

OPENED THEIR DOORS TO WELCOME KATRINA S             SURVIVORS FROM ALL THROUGHOUT THE GULF COAST REGION  HOSPITALS                 EVACUATED THOSE WHO NEEDED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION  DOCTORS  NURSES

HIS LIFE     WHO IN THE NEEDIEST TIME             OF HIS LIFE IS GIVEN THE CARE THAT HE NEEDS AT THAT TIME             WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS  WE COULD PASS THE EMERGENCY HEALTH             CARE RELIEF ACT THAT SENATOR BAUCUS AND SENATOR GRASSLEY HAVE                 WORKED SO HARD IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO COME ABOUT  I HAD OFFERED             AN AMENDMENT A MONTH AGO    A MONTH AGO  I COULD SEE FROM MY             PROVIDERS THOSE DOCTORS AND NURSES  THOSE PHARMACISTS THAT             WORKED 24 7  WHO SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LABOR DAY WEEKEND TAKING             CARE OF THEIR NEIGHBORS FROM MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA  WHO             DIDN T ASK QUESTIONS  I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A                 TREMENDOUS NEED DOWN THE ROAD TO PROVIDE THEM A PEACE OF MIND             THAT NOT ONLY THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING IN HELPING THOSE             NEIGHBORS BUT ALSO THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO DO THE GOOD JOB             IN PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE CONSTITUENCIES  THE NEIGHBORS THAT             THEY HAVE KNOWN AWFUL THEIR LIVES IN THE COMMUNITIES OF ARC             ANCHT MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES IN EAST ARKANSAS  PARTICULARLY IN                 THE DELTA REGION  ARE ALREADY DISPROPORTIONATE POVERTY             COUNTIES  HOSPITALS  CLINICS  COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE ALL             ALREADY  BEFORE KATRINA EVER HAPPENED  WERE DISPROPORTIONATE             MEDICAID AND MEDICARE FACILITIES  THEY WERE ALREADY HEAVILY             DEPENDENT  TOMORROW THEY RE GOING TO TAKE A CUT  BECAUSE TO             SAVE MONEY IN THIS COUNTRY  TO LOOK AT WHERE WE RE GOING TO             SAVE MONEY  WE RE GOING TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL SHARE OF THEIR                 MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT AS OF OCTOBER THE 1st  OUT OF THE 29             STATES THAT ARE GOING TO SEE A CUT IN THEIR MEDICAID             REIMBURSEMENT  SEVEN    THE MOST A  EFFECTED SEVEN STATES                 THE SEVEN MOST AFFECTED STATES IN THIS COUNTRY WILL SEE A CUT             IN THEIR REIMBURSEMENT TOMORROW  THOSE WHO DEPEND ON THE SAFETY             NET  THE HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET OF THIS COUNTRY  BECAUSE WE ARE                 SO TRAPPED  SO PARALYZED IN THE RED TAPE THAT WE WANT TO CREATE             IN THIS BODY HERE  WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY  THOUGH  MR              PRESIDENT  AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE FOR KATRINA             SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS OF SUCH AN INCREDIBLE NATURAL DISASTER              BUT TO ALSO PROVE TO THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY OF THIS WORLD  THIS             NATION THAT WE CAN REACT WITHOUT THE UNBELIEVABLE WEB OF RED                 TAPE THAT LEAVES THEM HANGING  THAT LEAVES THEM HOLDING THE BAG             FOR THE COST OF SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE             FOR  NOT JUST HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE RE GOVERNMENT  HELD             ACCOUNTABLE FOR BECAUSE WE ARE THE INSTITUTION THAT WRAPS ITS             ARMS AROUND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE MOST IN NEED  AND                 WE CAN DO SO IN AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY  TO MY             COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE SO DESPERATELY WORRIED             ABOUT THE COST OF WHAT WE ARE DOING  WHO ARE SO AFRAID OF             HELPING ONE TOO MANY NEEDY PEOPLE  I SAY TO YOU  WELL LOOK AT             WHAT WE VE PROPOSED  WE VE WORKED HARD TO KEEP THE COST DOWN                  WE VE MADE IT TEMPORARY SO IT WOULDN T EXPLODE OR OVEREXPAND              YES  AN ALREADY VERY EXPANSIVE PROGRAM  BUT AS SENATOR LANDRIEU             MENTIONED  THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING HOME TOMORROW  I JUST SAW             A PIECE IN MY HOMETOWN OF HELENA  A COUPLE WENT TO JACKSON AND             FOUND NO HELP  THEY WENT TO MEMPHIS AND WERE SENT TO TUNIKA                  MISSISSIPPI  AND AT TUNIKA AT THE RED CROSS FACILITY WHERE THEY             WERE TOLD IT WAS ALREADY OVER CAPACITY  THEY WERE SIMPLY SENT             AWAY  THEY WENT TO THE NEXT BRIDGE THAT CROSSED THE GREAT             MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND INTO MY HOMETOWN  REMEMBERING SOMEONE             THAT THEY HAD GROWN UP WITH IN THEIR CHILDHOOD FROM CHICAGO AND             CALLED HIM HOPING THAT HE WOULD BE THERE  HE WAS  HE WAS A             PASTOR OF A CHURCH  HE D OPENED HIS CHURCH DOORS AND HIS HOME               HE AND HIS WIFE HAD OPENED THEIR HOME  WELCOMED THEM IN AS WELL             AS OTHER FAMILIES THAT WERE ALREADY LIVING THERE  REACHED OUT             TO IN THIS    IN ONE OF THE MOST POVERTY STRICKEN COUNTIES             ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY  REACHED OUT TO A SMALL HEALTH CARE             FOUNDATION THAT THIS COMMUNITY HAD MANAGED TO PUT TOGETHER OVER             THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO TRY AND REINVIGORATE THEIR HEALTH             CARE INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AS A                 COMPONENT OF REBUILDING THE VITALITY OF THEIR COMMUNITY              CREATING JOBS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GET INTO A MORE INDEPENDENT             SITUATION  BUT WHO LOCATES BUSINESSES OR FACTORIES OR JOBS IN             AN AREA WHERE YOU DON T HAVE THE NECESSARY HEALTH CARE TO BEGIN WITH              SO YOU VE GOT A SMALL NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION NOW             PAYING FOR THIS COUPLE S HEALTH CARE  BECAUSE THE PROVIDERS                 HAVE NO EARTHLY IDEA WHETHER THEIR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING             TO BE THERE FOR THEM  MR  PRESIDENT  WE ARE BIGGER THAN THAT             HERE  WE RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN OPEN ENDED PAYMENT  WE RE             TALKING ABOUT A TEMPORARY ABILITY TO GIVE PEACE OF MIND TO THE             PEOPLE WHO SINCE DAY ONE WHEN THIS DISASTER STRUCK HAVE NOT                 ASKED QUESTIONS  HAVE PUT THEIR FULL FAITH AND HOPE IN THIS             FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT  FOR ONCE  IT WILL DISREGARD THE RED             TAPE  LOOK WISELY AT SOMETHING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE              AND LOOK WISELY AT A PAST EXPERIENCE LIKE 9 11 WHEN WE WERE             ABLE TO TEMPORARILY OFFER A HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET TO SURVIVORS             THERE  AND EXPECT THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THE WISDOM AND THE                 COURAGE IN THIS BODY TO PROVIDE THEM THE PEACE OF MIND THAT             WHAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN WAS THE RIGHT THING TO             DO  THE BILL THAT WE RE TALKING ABOUT  MR  PRESIDENT  ENSURES             FULL FUNDING  FULL FEDERAL FUNDING WITHIN THE AREAS WHERE             MEDICAL CARE HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR VICTIMS OF THE HURRICANES                  MEDICAID IS OUR HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET IN THIS COUNTRY  AND I             THINK THIS CRISIS ITSELF HAS SHOWN US JUST HOW IMPORTANT THIS             SAFETY NET IS TO OUR NATION  WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES             NOT UNRAVEL IN THE FACE OF THIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY  DO WE HAVE             CONCERNS ABOUT MEDICAID              DO WE FEEL LIKE THERE ARE PLACES THERE WHERE WE COULD BE MORE             EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN THAT PROGRAM              YOU BET  MR  PRESIDENT  YOU BET THERE ARE PLACES WE CAN BE MORE                 EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE  I KNOW THAT CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY HAS             SUGGESTED SOME IN TERMS OF THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS             THROUGH MEDICAID THAT CAN BE NEGOTIATED IN A BETTER  MORE             EFFICIENT WAY TO PROVIDE MORE COST EFFECTIVE DRUGS THROUGH THAT             PROGRAM  AND HOPEFULLY LEAD THE WAY TO SEEING US PROVIDE MORE             COST EFFECTIVE PHARMACEUTICALS FOR ALL OTHER PROGRAMS  JUST AS             WE DO WITH THE VETERANS  ADMINISTRATION  AND WE CAN DO THAT             WHEN WE WORK                BUT TO STRAP A PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED AS A SAFETY NET FOR             PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MOST DEVASTATING OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS NOT             THE WAY TO DO THAT  MR  PRESIDENT  THE ADMINISTRATION PROMISED             US THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE WHOLE FINANCIALLY THE STATES THAT             WERE PROVIDING HEALTH COVERAGE TO EVACUEES n AND THEY SAY THAT               THERE S NO NEED FOR THE GRASSLEY BAUCUS INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE             FULL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAID  BECAUSE THEY WANT TO USE             WAIVER POLICY  BUT WHAT THEY DON T TELL US IS THAT THERE IS NO             FEDERAL FUNDING  THERE S NO FEDERAL DOLLARS IN PROVIDING THAT             WAIVER POLICY  THERE S NO DOLLARS THAT THEY RE GOING TO PUT             BEHIND THAT  THEY VE ASKED LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI AND             ALABAMA  THESE AFFECTED STATES  TO SIGN MEMORANDUMS OF                 UNDERSTANDING TO AGREE TO BE ON THE HOOK FINANCIALLY FOR A             PORTION OF THE MEDICAID COST OF THESE SURVIVORS HOW             HUMILIATING  HOW HUMILIATING TO GO TO A STATE THAT HAS BEEN             DEVASTATED AND TO SAY WE RE GOING TO PUT YOU ON THE HOOK RIGHT             HERE AND RIGHT NOW FOR THE COST OF WHAT YOUR NEIGHBORS WANT TO             PROVIDE  AND WE AS A NATION  THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE WORLD                 SUPPOSEDLY  SHOULD BE ABLE TO CARE FOR OUR AMERICAN CITIZENS             WITH  WE KNOW THAT THOSE STATES ARE IN NO POSITION FINANCIALLY             TO INCUR THAT KIND OF COST  THREE    THOSE THREE GOVERNORS             TESTIFIED BEFORE THE FINANCE COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS WEEK  ONE             OF GOVERNORS MENTIONED THAT SHE DIDN T EVEN HAVE THE RESOURCES             THROUGH HER STATE LEGISLATURE TO OVERCOME THE INCREASE IN COSTS                 THEY WERE GOING TO SEE BECAUSE THE LOSS OF FEDERAL DOLLARS             THEY RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE TOMORROW WHEN THEIR FEDERAL             MATCHING PORTION OF MEDICAID IS CUT  AND THAT WAS BEFORE             KATRINA EVER HIT  THAT WAS BEFORE THIS DEVASTATION HAS HIT              THEY COULDN T FIND THE RESOURCES IN THEIR STATE WITH A             DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF LOW INCOME DEPENDENT ON THAT SAFETY                 NET TO BE ABLE TO COVER THAT  AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE DISASTER              I KNOW THOSE GOVERNORS WERE HIGHLY CONCERNED  THEY EXPRESSED IT             IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND IN THEIR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ABOUT             MAKING SURE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THERE FOR THEM             TO MAKE THEM WHOLE  TO EXTEND TO THEIR STATES    LOUISIANA              MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA    WHEN THEY WERE UNABLE TO DEAL WITH             THAT UNDER THEIR CURRENT BUDGETS  FOR US IN ARKANSAS  WHAT DOES                 IT MEAN              THAT WE RE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG DUE TO BUDGETARY ISSUES  DUE TO             THE FACT THAT THERE S A FEW PEOPLE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES             SENATE THAT ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE TEMPORARY SPENDING TO             HELP THE NEEDIEST OF THIS DEVASTATION THAN THEY WERE ABOUT THE              62 BILLION THAT WE VOTED FOR FEMA  NOBODY OBJECTED TO THAT                  MR  PRESIDENT  AND I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS FROM TAKING THE MONEY             FROM THAT  FEMA S GOING TO PROBABLY COME BACK AND ASK US FOR             MORE MONEY ANY WAY  BUT I VE GOT TO SAY TO YOU  IF IT WERE YOUR             MOTHER OR YOUR SISTER OR BROTHER OR NIECE OR NEPHEW  UNCLE OR             PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS THAT HAD BEEN DISPLACED  THAT FOUND             THEMSELVES IN A STRANGE COMMUNITY WITH A CHRONIC ILLNESS              WHETHER IT WAS HEART DISEASE OR DIABETES  PERHAPS IT WAS CANCER                 IN NEED OF TREATMENT  PERHAPS IT WAS A CHILD  A CHILD WHO             NEEDED HEALTH CARE  CAN YOU IMAGINE THE FEAR OF THINKING THAT             YOU WOULDN T BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT              OR TO FIND THAT THE PROVIDER THAT WAS PROVIDING IT FOR YOU WAS             SCARED TO DEATH THAT IT WAS GOING TO PUSH HIM OVER THE EDGE  TO             PUSH HIM OVER THE EDGE SO THE FACT THAT THEY HELP ENOUGH OF             THOSE PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE OR PEACE OF MIND THAT                 EVENTUALLY THEIR DOORS WOULD BE CLOSED  THAT THEY WOULD NO             LONGER BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF CARE  I KNOW THAT AS             I VE TOURED THE SRABG WE CAMPS    EVACUEE CAMPS THERE IS AN             UNBELIEVABLE FEELING OF GRATITUDE AMONG THOSE DISPLACED AT A             TIME WHEN THEY HAD TO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED  A WOMAN WHO WAS             ABOUT TO GET MARRIED  WHO HAD LOST HER WEGD DRESS    WEDDING             DRESS IN NEW ORLEANS  BUT THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY IN                 ARKANSAS PROVIDED A WEDDING DRESS  A WEDDING  PEOPLE WHO HAD             BEEN DISPLACED  WHO DIDN T KNOW WHERE THEIR OTHER FAMILY             MEMBERS WERE  WHO WERE SEPARATED  AND YET  WHO WERE STILL SO             GRATEFUL FOR THE FOOD  THE WARMTH  THE HOSPITALITY  THE LOVE             AND THE ARMS THAT ENVELOPED THEM IN THE SEE    IN THE ESRABG             WAY CAMPS WHERE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES  SOME HAVE BEEN DISBURSED                 AND THEY HAVE GONE TO STAY WITH AUNTS OR COUSINS OR SISTERS IN             OTHER STATES WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE WANT THIS             EXPANSION  WE DON T TWAPBT JUST FOR THE STATE OF ARKANSAS  WE             KNOW WE VE ALREADY SENT MANY EVACUEES TO PENNSYLVANIA  NORTH             CAROLINA  A U A U  UTAH  THEY TOO ARE GOING TO NEED HEALTH CARE             BECAUSE THEY DON T KNOW WHEN THEY RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO             BACK  AND THEY DON T KNOW WHAT THEY LL BE GOING BACK TO  MR              PRESIDENT  THEY DON T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR JOBS  THE             HEALTH CARE THEY MAY HAVE HAD WHICH IS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS                 BILL TO KEEP PRIVATE INSURANCE STILL IN THE GO ALONG  TO MAKE             SURE THAT WE MAKE IT WHOLE AS WELL  THAT WE PUT AS FEW PEOPLE             AS POSSIBLE INTO THAT FEDERAL SAFETY NET  WE VE GOT AN             OPPORTUNITY HERE  MR  PRESIDENT  AND I JUST HOPE THAT AS A             NATION WE CAN REALIZE THAT SPENDING MORE AND MORE TIME TO TRY                 AND BRING UP CONVOLUTED WAIVERS  OUR MEDICAID  OUR STATE             MEDICAID DIRECTORS KNOW THAT MOST OF WHAT S IN THOSE WAIVERS IS             AN EMPTY PROMISE  LAST NIGHT IN ARKANSAS  WE GOT A WAIVER FROM             H H S  BUT IT CERTAINLY IS CONTRIBUTING ONLY TO MORE RED TAPE             TO WHAT S ALREADY BEEN CREATED  IT PROVIDES MORE QUESTIONS THAN             ANSWERS  THERE S NO MONEY ATTACHED TO IT  SO IT REALLY IS AN                 EMPTY PROMISE UNTIL WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THE SURVIVORS              THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE STATES HAVE RECEIVED NO             RELIEF  NO LEGITIMATE HELP  THEY RE OUT THERE DOING THIS             WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE OF WHERE IT S GOING TO COME FROM  YOU             KNOW  WE DON T KNOW IN THESE WAIVERS WHAT SERVICES ARE GOING TO             BE COVERED  HOW DO WE KNOW              HOW DO WE EXPECT PROVIDERS TO KNOW WHAT THEY CAN PROVIDE AND             WHAT THEY CAN T                  MOST OF THEM WERE GIVEN THE ASSURANCES FROM THEIR STATES THAT             DON T WORRY  WE RE A PART OF A GREAT NATION  AND WHEN YOU             TREATED THOSE PEOPLE OVERT WEEKEND ON LABOR DAY  WE RE GOING TO             ASK THEM TO GO BACK IN THEIR MINDS FOUR MONTHS AND FILL OUT THE             KIND OF PAPER WORK TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN GET REIMBURSED FOR A             AT THE TIME NEWS SHOT OR FOR    FOR A TETANUS SHOT OR FOR A             PROCEDURE  WHATEVER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN  THEY IN GOOD FAITH HAVE                 FILLED OUT WHAT THE STATE HAS ASKED THEM TO FILL OUT TO MAKE             SURE THAT THEY RE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY             PROVIDED  AND YET  THROUGH THESE WAIVER PROCESSES THERE S YET             ONE MORE PIECE OF RED TAPE  ONE MORE FORM TO BE FILLED OUT  ONE             MORE WEB OF WASHINGTON BUREAUCRACY THAT THEY RE GOING TO HAVE             TO DEAL WITH  WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE THAT THERE S MONEY BEHIND                 IT  THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THAT  SO I             THINK  MR  PRESIDENT  AS WE LOOK AT THE WAIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN             OFFERED  THEY CREATE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT  THE             ADMINISTRATION HAS SUGGESTED CREATING A NEW UNCOMPENSATED CARE             POOL TO REIMBURSE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS  WHEN WE ASKED WHERE             WAS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM  THAT S WHAT THEY TOLD US  A             NEW UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL  WHY WOULDN T WE USE SOMETHING THAT                 ALREADY EXISTS  THAT ALREADY HAS FRAUD AND ABUSE STIPULATIONS             IN THERE AND CAUTIONS              WHY WOULDN T WE USE A SYSTEM THAT WE CAN CONTINUALLY IMPROVE ON              BUT WE RE GOING TO CREATE A NEW UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL  WE             DON T KNOW WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING TO COME FROM  I WOULD             QUESTION MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE LOOKING AT THE FISCAL             RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS TO QUESTION THAT  AND A NEW             UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL  IT DOESN T HAVE ANY PARAMETERS TO IT                  IT DOESN T HAVE ANY PROTECTIONS IN FRAUD AND ABUSE  HEALTH CARE             PROVIDERS WOULD RECEIVE NO GUARANTEE ABOUT WHICH SERVICES AND             HOW MUCH CARE WILL ACTUALLY BE REIMBURSED THROUGH THIS             UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL  MR  PRESIDENT  I GO BACK TO THE STORY             I USED IN COMMITTEE THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO SURVIVED             ON TOP OF HER REFRIGERATOR  SHE WAS REPORTED ABOUT IN  THE             ECONOMIST   SHE SURVIVED ON HER REFRIGERATOR FOR THREE DAYS                  WAS ABLE TO FINALLY GET OUT  SHE MADE IT AS FAR AS BATON ROUGE              SHE WAS A DIABETIC AND QUITE IN NEED OF CARE  SHE WENT TO TRY             AND SEEK OUT HEALTH CARE AND WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS             CATEGORICALLY INCORRECT AND COULDN T GET CARE  THAT S THE KIND             OF RED TAPE THAT WE RE GOING TO PERPETUATE IF WE DON T LOOK AT             THE REASONABLE PROPOSAL THAT SENATOR GRASSLEY AND SENATOR                 BAUCUS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO PRODUCE  DID IT GO AS FAR AS I D             LIKE IT TO GO              IT DOESN T  MR  PRESIDENT  I VE BEEN OUT THERE  I SEE WHAT             THESE PEOPLE ARE UP AGAINST  BOTH THE PROVIDERS AND THE             EVACUEES  I SEE WHAT THEIR FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH  NOT JUST             THE LACK OF CARE  THE LACK OF ESSENTIALS OR THE COMMUNITIES             THAT ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEM  BUT THE DIGNITY THAT THEY             WANT TO MAINTAIN  THE DIGNITY P     DIGNITY IN THEIR LIVES TO                 FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT A HOME  WITHOUT ANY POSSESSIONS              DISLOCATEED FROM THEIR FAMILY  THEIR NEIGHBORS  THE PEOPLE WHO             CARE FOR THEM AND LOVE THEM  TO FIND THEMSELVES IN STRANGE             PLACES WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GIVE THEM THAT             SENSE OF DIGNITY AND CARE  SO IN MY SOFT SPOKEN AND             COMMON SENSE WAY  MR  PRESIDENT  I WOULD LIKE TO APPEAL TO MY             COLLEAGUES  WE CAN BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE  WE CAN LOOK FOR                 WAYS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE CARE AND PEACE OF MIND TO THOSE WHO             NEED THE HEALTH CARE  BECAUSE THOSE WITH WHOUT RESERVATION ARE             PROVIDING IT TO SOME OF THE MOST  THE NEEDIEST  THE MOST             DESTITUTE OF AMERICANS AT THIS TIME IN OUR COUNTRY  AND I ASK             MY COLLEAGUES  PLEASE  PLEASE DO NOT PUT THIS OFF FOR YET             ANOTHER WEEK  DON T SEND US HOME TO OUR STATES TO TELL OUR                 PROVIDERS  TO TELL THE AMERICANS THAT HAVE EVACUATED THE GULF             COAST THAT THEY ARE NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR US TO DEAL WITH             THIS ISSUE IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION  SO I THANK YOU  MR              PRESIDENT  FOR YOUR INTUL GENERALS    INDULGENCE  AND MY             COLLEAGUES  I COMPLIMENT MY FRIEND FROM MONTANA  FOR HE AND             SENATOR GRASSLEY S ATTEMPT TO REALLY WORK THOROUGHLY THROUGH             THIS ISSUE AND TO REALLY BRING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT S NOT ONLY                 PRACTICAL AND COMMON SENSE ORIENTED  THAT S LIMITED IN ITS TIME             FRAME  BUT THAT S ALSO COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS OUR FELLOW                 AMERICAN  THANK YOU  MR  PRESIDENT  MR  BAUCUS  MR  PRESIDENT                           THE

FIGHTS             FOR THEM  I JUST WANTED TO STATE MY PERSPECTIVE  THE SENATOR             FROM ARKANSAS IS ONE OF THE BEST  SHE S A BELIEVER  SHE FIGHTS             FOR HER PEOPLE  AND ALL OF US ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT  MR              PRESIDENT  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE  THREE POINTS             ABOUT THIS     END
