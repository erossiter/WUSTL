Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln today stepped up her fight to ensure that America   s farmers aren   t forced to shoulder an unfair share of the deficit reduction burden because of drastic cuts in agriculture programs proposed by President Bush     Lincoln successfully enlisted a bipartisan group of Senators to sign a letter to Sen  Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee  and the Committee   s Ranking Member  Sen  Kent Conrad  D ND   to underscore the importance of keeping current farm program spending levels intact   Lincoln said she wrote her letter to demonstrate the unified opposition to the drastic cuts in farm and commodity programs proposed by President Bush last month in his Fiscal Year 2006 Budget            In her letter to the Senate   s top two budget leaders  Lincoln said she hoped to    underscore the importance of maintaining the commitments made to American farm families  rural communities  low income families and children  risk management and conservation under U S  farm policy          She said the President   s recently proposed cuts to U S  farm policy    bring to rest a disproportionate burden of deficit reduction on the shoulders of our nation   s farm families  rural communities  environmental protection  and other important rural initiatives        Aside from discussing the impact of the proposed cuts on rural America  Lincoln discussed the global trade implications  adding     U S  farm policy is also about U S  global competitiveness at a time when foreign subsidies and tariffs are five to six times higher than our own  Unilaterally disarming U S  farm policy would be especially ill timed now as negotiations to level the global playing field continue          In addition  Lincoln   s letter discusses the importance of child nutrition assistance programs that would be affected by President Bush   s proposed cuts   The following is the complete text of Lincoln   s letter with a list of all signing Senators     Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Conrad       We write to underscore the importance of maintaining the commitments made to American farm families  rural communities  low income families and children  risk management and conservation under U S  farm policy       We share your commitment to deficit reduction and look forward to working with you to achieve this goal  But it is important to consider what U S  farm policy has already contributed to deficit reduction  U S  farm policy for commodities has already achieved  16 billion in savings compared to the March 2002 CBO cost estimate   Meanwhile  mandatory funding for conservation  rural development  trade promotion  research  renewable energy  and forestry initiatives have all sustained cuts in the last two years totaling more than  2 billion   These numbers do not include another  38 million in annual cuts to Federal Crop Insurance resulting from the renegotiation of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement with crop insurance providers        U S  farm policy for commodities amounts to about one half of one percent of the total federal budget  while helping sustain an economic sector representing 17 percent of the nation s GDP  25 million jobs  and  3 5 trillion in economic activity  Yet while this area of farm policy has already saved an amount equal to 26 percent of the total amount proposed to be saved over the next five years  the most recent budget proposal contemplates yet another  7 billion in net savings over the next 10 years from both commodities and crop insurance   Additionally  these proposals actually increase the odds of Congress being forced to enact additional emergency assistance in the future  These reductions are in addition to a proposed 9 6 percent cut to discretionary agriculture funding  This reduced funding will cause USDA to absorb 16 5 percent of the cuts in federal discretionary funding  while accounting for just 2 percent of the total       The recently proposed cuts to U S  farm policy  when added to the more than  18 billion in mandatory savings already achieved  bring to rest a disproportionate burden of deficit reduction on the shoulders of our nation s farm families  rural communities  environmental protection  and other important rural initiatives       Besides being an economic engine for our country and helping to provide Americans with the safest  most abundant  most affordable food supply in the world  U S  farm policy is also about U S  global competitiveness at a time when foreign subsidies and tariffs are 5 and 6 times higher than our own   Unilaterally disarming U S  farm policy would be especially ill timed now as negotiations to level the global playing field continue under the Doha Round of the WTO   The importance of a strong farm economy to our nation s overall economy can be found in a December 12  2003 Wall Street Journal article entitled   Farm Belt Becomes Driver for Overall Economy   as well as the 1980s farm financial crisis that rocked the economic foundation of even our largest cities       Conservation initiatives under U S  farm policy are also remarkably successful in rehabilitating wetlands  wildlife and wildlife habitat  curbing soil erosion  and improving air and water quality through voluntary  incentive based practices   We hope to build on this success rather than turn back             Today  millions of low income families and school aged children in America rely on the food nutrition assistance provided by USDA   As we work to reduce hunger and improve healthy eating habits  the importance of U S  farm policy is only enhanced   Congress worked in a bipartisan way to ensure the integrity of nutrition assistance and we are pleased the food stamp error rate is now at an all time low      We believe these important priorities for our nation are worth defending and we hope you will consider our strong commitment to them as you craft the Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2006              Thank you for your consideration as you undertake the difficult task of working to craft a budget resolution          Sincerely
