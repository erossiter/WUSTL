2007 legislation will go to a Senate House conference committee to negotiate differences between the two chambers        These projects significantly contribute to the  economic development and business growth of communities throughout Arkansas     said Lincoln      I am pleased that we are taking positive steps towards securing federal dollars that will enhance navigation  flood control and water quality while providing more resources to the Delta Regional Authority as it continues its work to improve the quality of life in the Delta region    I   ll continue my fight to ensure that these funds are approved by the Senate and included in the final bill           Arkansas needs to make critical investments to improve our navigation and water quality operations  This funding is a
