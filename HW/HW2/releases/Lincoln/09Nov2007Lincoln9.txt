Katie Laning  202 224 4843 National Veterans Awareness Week is November 11 17  2007  Washington U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark  announced todaya bipartisan resolution topay tribute toour veterans has passed the Senate The resolution  whichLincoln cosponsored  designates the weekstarting with Veterans Day  November 11 17  as National Veterans Awareness Week   It is important that we take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 25 million Americans  including nearly 286 000 Arkansans  who have served our county in the Armed Forces  said Lincoln  Taking care of our veterans not only honors their sacrifice  it helps recruitment and retention of future service members by demonstrating our commitment to those who have given so much  We must not fail those who have sacrificed so greatly on our behalf  or those who continue to fight for our freedoms today   Lincoln has consistently fought for initiatives that expand benefits for our veterans  The following is a list of some of the veterans proposals she has championed this year   Total Force GI Bill  Lincoln introduced the Total Force GI Bill earlier this yearalong with Congressman Vic Snyder  Ark  2nd   A provision from this bill allowing members of the National Guard and Reserve greater access to educational benefits was included in the Senate passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  Unlike active duty soldiers who have up to ten years after their service ends to utilize their educational benefits  operational reservists  those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan  must forfeit the educational benefits they have earned once they separate from service  Lincolns proposal would correct this inequity   Disability Claims Backlog  Lincolns proposal to address the growing backlog of pending disability compensation claims was included in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act  2008  which passed the Senate in September  Her legislation provides the Veterans Administration  VA  an additional  70 million to hire additional disability claims processors  employ additional processors for the Board of Veterans Appeals  and provide the one year cost for increased training resources and quality measures for Training and Performance Support Systems and Skills Certification   New disabilities claims have grown by 39 percent from 2000 to 2006  The VA currently has a backlog of nearly 400 000 claims  Lincoln said her State Senate office in Little Rock has seen this firsthand working with several Arkansas veterans  The average time to process a claim is 177 days  or almost 6 months  Waiting time for appeals is even greater  The number of cases received by the Board of Veterans Appeals has grown by 82 5 percent since 2001  Next year  the estimated wait for an appeals resolution is expected to increase to 700 days    Concurrent Receipt  Lincolns amendment to help more disabled veterans receive full and immediate concurrent receipt of their disability benefits and pensions was also included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  The amendment will allow veterans categorized as 100 percent unemployable due to a service connected disability to receive their full disability pay and retirement pay immediately   Under legislation adopted by Congress more than a century ago  the pension of a disabled soldier is reduced by the amount of that soldiers disability payment  In 2004  Congress agreed to a ten year phase in of concurrent receipt to all veterans who are 50 to 100 percent disabled  Lincoln said she will continue her fight for full and immediate concurrent receipt for all disabled veterans  Doing so would extend concurrent receipt to over 400 000 veterans across the nation and would repeal the ten year phase in of benefits for thousands more   Physical Evaluation System and Mental Health Treatment  Earlier this year Lincoln introduced the Servicemembers Healthcare Benefits and Rehabilitation Act of 2007  which takes steps to correct many of the flaws in the military health care system  This bill would consolidate the Physical Evaluation System by placing the Informal and Formal Physical Evaluation Boards under one command in order to streamline and expedite the process  The legislation would also require all servicemembers who have received orders for deployment to a combat theater to receive a mental health assessment both before and after deployment
