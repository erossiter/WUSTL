Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 27  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today introduced two bills she said would  help correct many of the problems that have arisen due to the Bush Administration   s poor implementation of the Medicare prescription drug program        These bills are practical  common sense improvements to the Medicare Prescription Drug program that I believe would help reduce confusion for beneficiaries and ensure that pharmacists are reimbursed more quickly and fairly     Lincoln said      Lincoln said that she introduced the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act of 2006 after hearing from several pharmacists in Arkansas who have encountered problems in the implementation of Medicare   s new prescription drug law   She said her bill recognizes pharmacists as important partners in making the program a success for America   s seniors and that it would cut back on the practice of pharmacy    co branding    by plans that can lead some patients to believe that only certain pharmacies can provide their medicines   It would also require the establishment of plan information hotlines for pharmacists and physicians alike          Throughout rural Arkansas  many seniors depend on their local pharmacists as a primary source of health care     Lincoln said      Since the drug program went into effect on January 1st of this year  pharmacists have been on the front lines to assist Medicare beneficiaries  especially those who were transitioning from Medicaid drug coverage   Pharmacists have reported that new Medicare drug plans weren   t paying them in a timely way  forcing some of them to take out loans to keep their stores open  They reported that reimbursements from plans were too low  and  that many seniors were simply confused         This bill aims to correct these problems so that pharmacists can continue providing quality care as the implementation of the drug program continues        Specifically  Lincoln   s Pharmacy Access Improvement Act of 2006 addresses the following issues           Requires drug plans to pay pharmacies within 14 days and to pay interest on amounts that  pharmacists are not paid in time          Requires drug plans to pay reasonable dispensing fees  and it requires plans to update their prescription drug pricing standard no less frequently than every seven days         Prohibits drug plans from advertising a particular pharmacy on drug cards and requires a disclaimer on all marketing materials so seniors know that other pharmacies are available in the plan   s network       Lincoln   s second bill  the Medicare Simplification Act of 2006  would make it easier for seniors to compare drug plans and would prohibit drug plans from dropping coverage of a drug during the benefit year  among other important provisions    It would reduce confusion for beneficiaries who enroll in the program by setting standards for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  CMS  approval and classification of plan offerings  so that seniors and people with disabilities can be better informed   The bill will also outline uniform consumer protections for drug benefit participants     Lincoln  a member of the Senate Finance Committee where both bills have been referred  was joined at a Capitol Hill press conference today by Finance Committee Ranking Member Senator  Max Baucus  D Mont   to announce the two bills     In addition  Lincoln encouraged Medicare participants who have not signed up for the Medicare prescription drug program that in order to avoid higher premiums to remember the May 15th sign up deadline   For additional information and to enroll in one of the plans  seniors can call Medicare at 1 800 MEDICARE or visit www medicare gov   The Seniors Health Insurance Information Program in Arkansas also provides free counseling to Arkansans on Medicare and can be reached toll free at 1 800 224 6330   Lincoln also encouraged seniors to contact her office for assistance toll free in Arkansas at 1 800 352 9364
