                                                                                                                                                      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 09  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today hailed the passage of tax provisions that will provide relief for America   s working families and give assistance to businesses  yet lamented the political maneuvers which plagued the tax package throughout the year        It is unfortunate that these important tax measures were delivered at the eleventh hour after being held hostage to inter party fighting this year     Lincoln said      Finally  America   s businesses will have the tools they need to help them remain competitive in the global marketplace and families will receive relief in critical areas such as financing their children   s education        In addition to several already expired tax extenders  the legislative package also includes a new deduction for private mortgage insurance   Lincoln said this provision would encourage home ownership by allowing mortgage holders with family incomes of up to  110 000 to deduct premiums paid for mortgage insurance   Lincoln has fought for a private mortgage insurance deduction since introducing a stand alone bill in 2005        The deductibility of mortgage insurance for low  to middle income families will provide valuable assistance to many who would otherwise never realize the American dream of owning their own home     Lincoln said     The legislation that passed the Senate early Saturday includes the following tax provisions      Research   Development Tax Credit     provides a tax incentive for businesses performing research and development in the United States   Lincoln called American businesses    innovators    and said our country has benefitted from the research they have undertaken and the investments they have made   This deduction will assist businesses in continuing their important research which is critical to keeping the United States competitive in the global marketplace       Work Opportunity Tax Credit and Welfare to Work Tax Credit     provides employers with tax incentives for hiring individuals from targeted groups including veterans as well as economically disadvantaged Americans such as food stamp recipients and welfare recipients      Deduction for Qualified Tuition and Higher Ed Expenses     allows parents and students to deduct qualified tuition and related expenses from their taxable income   Lincoln noted that the tuition deduction has been an effective tool for providing more Americans access to college  particularly at a time when the cost of higher education has risen by 44 percent      Deduction for Teacher Expenses     gives teachers a deduction of as much as  250 for personal funds spent by them to buy classroom supplies   The deduction will help more than 23 000 teachers in Arkansas who provided classroom supplies with money out of their own pockets      The legislative vehicle also includes tax credits to encourage the use of alternative sources of energy   Lincoln said these tax incentives will help place our country on the path to greater energy independence       Lincoln noted her disappointment in the process which produced the removal of the widely supported timber tax credit  a provision that had been included in the overall package earlier this year   Lincoln said that Arkansas    family owned timber companies and integrated timber companies currently suffer from an unfortunate position in our tax code   As it is written today  the tax code gives an unfair advantage to non taxpaying entities   The tax credit that was removed in a late hour maneuver would have helped level the playing field for companies that provide local jobs in our communities      For more than a year  Lincoln has worked with a large bipartisan and bicameral group of members to bring relief to Arkansas    communities that depend on timber for their livelihoods         It is unfathomable and disappointing to me why a measure which had received such broad bipartisan support would be removed from the overall legislation at the last minute of the game     Lincoln said
