                    Senator Blanche Lincoln   s Reaction to President Bush   s State of the Union Address                                                                               Both                                                    Senator Blanche Lincoln   s Reaction to President Bush   s State of the Union Address   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 23  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   issued the following statement in response to President Bush   s  State of the Union  speech tonight      In his speech tonight  the President stated his desire to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to bring results to the American people   Senator Blanche Lincoln said   While we have seen little evidence of this approach during the President   s first six years in office  I hope that he will use the remainder of his Administration to find consensus on the important issues facing America   s working families today       The President mentioned his goals of working with Congress to address our national health care crisis  to make our country more energy independent  and to build on the progress of our education policies  Again  I hope that the President will chart a new course in the spirit of bipartisanship on these issues      The President must recognize that the issue of highest importance to the American people     one that demands a cooperative approach     is the war in Iraq and our global war on terror  The President must acknowledge the growing discontent across the nation with his Administration   s lack of results in Iraq  The President cannot continue to dismiss these concerned voices     Iraq  The President and I share the same goal of a stable and secure Iraq  and I truly hope for the sake of our soldiers and the Iraqi people that our next steps result in progress  The deaths of three Arkansas soldiers this week serve as a tragic reminder of the toll this war has taken on families across our nation       Now is the time for the President to work with Congress on a plan that stabilizes Iraq and brings our troops home safely and as soon as possible  He has dismissed the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group  his own Joint Chiefs and other military leaders who have said that an increased U S  military involvement in Iraq is not a guarantee to an end to the sectarian violence  The future of Iraq has serious consequences for our nation  and it is essential for the President to heed advice from others     Health Care  Approximately 46 6 million Americans  including 470 000 Arkansans  lack health insurance  An additional 16 million people are under insured and without coverage that adequately addresses their health care needs  While we don   t know how helpful the President   s new proposal would be  I am pleased he has taken a step to address this national crisis and I welcome him to the health care debate  As we move ahead and consider many proposals  I will work to ensure that America   s working families receive access to the quality and affordable health care they need and deserve     Energy Independence  Lessening America   s dependence on foreign sources of energy must be a top priority for this Administration  The President has spoken of his commitment to energy independence in the past  and I hope that his words will be followed by action  The President has recognized the role renewable fuels can play in lessening our dependence on foreign oil  however  we must make a serious investment in these alternative fuels in order to succeed       In order to achieve our goal of energy independence  we must ensure that our rural communities have the tools necessary to build the infrastructure to produce and distribute these fuels  It has long been recognized that one of the most efficient models for getting this industry off the ground is small facilities serving a local area  This industry represents an opportunity to revitalize many rural communities and we must do all we can to ensure they can take advantage of it     Education  I   ve met with various teachers  students  and administrators from across Arkansas and while we all support the intent of No Child Left Behind  we also need to look at ways to better address the needs of our schools and to ensure that we provide our children with the knowledge and training they will require for the future  We have a responsibility to give public schools the flexibility and tools they need to be successful  and that begins with properly funding No Child Left Behind     Immigration  Last year  the Republican led Congress fell short on reforming our nation   s broken immigration system  I am pleased the President has reaffirmed his support for the bipartisan compromise reform passed by the Senate       Finally  let me say again that I appreciate the bipartisan tone of the President   s speech tonight  but it will take actions to bring results to our working families  our men and women in uniform  our teachers and students  our agricultural producers  and our seniors
