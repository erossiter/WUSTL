                    Lincoln on U S  Senate Floor  Congress is Committed To Funding Troops                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln on U S  Senate Floor  Congress is Committed To Funding Troops  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 19  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate to dispute President Bush s statements questioning the resolve of Congress to provide necessary funding to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan      Last month  Lincoln joined her Senate colleagues in passing an emergency spending bill that was above the President s request and would provide nearly  100 million for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan   The legislation would provide additional dollars for troops  combat equipment  housing  and health care needs  specifically mental health care for those suffering from traumatic brain injuries and post traumatic stress disorder  In addition  the legislation sets measurable benchmarks for the Iraqi government  such as assuming control of their own security operations  containing sectarian violence  and making the tough decisions toward political reconciliation      Lincoln believes this legislation offers the necessary guidelines to bring our troops home safely and as soon as possible     The following are Lincoln s remarks on the Senate floor  as prepared for delivery  Mr  President  I rise today to talk about an issue that is on the forefront of the minds of many Americans  the war in Iraq       But before I begin  I d like to take a moment to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Virginia Tech community        The entire nation grieves with you at your tremendous loss  and I want you to know that the state of Arkansas stands with you as you begin to cope with this senseless tragedy   You will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers in the coming weeks and months      Mr  President  news from the Pentagon last week hit many families throughout the state of Arkansas particularly hard        Four years into the conflict in Iraq  the Army National Guard put 13 000 reservists  including nearly 2 000 in the largest National Guard unit in Arkansas  the 39th Infantry Brigade  on notice that it should be prepared for a second deployment at the end of the year        The Pentagon s decision to potentially deploy these troops marks the first time during Operation Iraqi Freedom that full Guard units would be called on for a second tour of duty        Our Arkansas troops already have performed bravely in Iraq and will no doubt do so again      Today  along with the many Arkansans honorably serving in the active duty military  over 1 600 of our citizen soldiers have been activated for service in the Middle East and along our southern border with Mexico       The 142nd Fires Brigade based in Fayetteville mobilized last week and is expected in Iraq this summer        80 members of the 213th Area Support Medical Company are preparing for their mobilization orders in June   Many of these members served in Iraq before with the 296th Ambulance Company        The Headquarters Company  871st Troop Command is also expected to be mobilized in June      Since the war began  our troops have performed their mission with incredible bravery and skill in some of the harshest conditions imaginable       Because of their sacrifice  we have seen a popularly elected government replace a ruthless dictator  And we have seen a democratic Constitution   approved by the Iraqi people   replace authoritarian rule      Tragically  we also have seen civilian mismanagement of this war that is not reflective of the tremendous sacrifice put forth by our men and women in uniform      Today  more than 3 300 service members   56 with Arkansas ties   have given their lives in this undertaking and more than 24 000 have been wounded      Now  as our troops contemplate the thought of returning to Iraq to continue an undefined mission  President Bush has questioned the resolve of Congress to provide our troops with the resources they need to finish the job      I take exception to the President s comments and want to make clear to the American people that Congress is committed to providing our troops with everything they need to safely and effectively complete their mission      Just last month  I voted with a majority of my Senate colleagues for an emergency spending bill that was above the President s request and would provide nearly  100 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan        We met each of his requests and provided every nickel that he asked for and more        The additional dollars we approved provide for their combat equipment  housing  and health care needs  particularly addressing mental health issues for those suffering from traumatic brain injuries and post traumatic stress disorder      Our legislation also sets measurable benchmarks for the Iraqi government  such as assuming control of their own security operations  containing sectarian violence  and making the tough decisions toward political reconciliation that desperately need to be made      The Senate did this in record time   In the past two years  it took well over 100 days to get to the supplemental   We ve acted in less than 50 days to get it passed in the Senate  and we anticipate sending him a bill next week      Despite our best efforts to find common ground  the President has threatened to veto this bill once it reaches his desk  even though the final language has yet to be negotiated       What is so egregious about our approach that the President will not consider signing it   The President points to two issues in particular      First  he claims that this bill  would impose restrictions on our military commanders and set an arbitrary date for withdrawal from Iraq  giving our enemies the victory they desperately want       I would argue that the constantly shifting objectives of this war make it difficult to imagine an end to the U S  commitment       Americans are exhausted with it  and the President s justification for staying in Iraq becomes harder to stomach each day      As Iraq slides deeper into an increasingly violent civil war  the President s high risk surge strategy has increased our military involvement       This strategy also comes at a time when the U S  intelligence community reports that al Qaeda has become an increased threat to our national security because we have devoted so much manpower  resources  and attention solely on Iraq       And it comes at a time when our own military reports that its readiness has dramatically eroded because it is over extended and under equipped      Our bill seeks to address these issues            In the Senate bill  we acknowledge that the conditions in Iraq have changed substantially since we originally authorized the war in 2002      We are no longer fighting an enemy that will one day show the white flag and surrender   Instead  we are now the referee in a brutal fight for dominance between two warring religious sects and countless militias who are all hungry for power      While I agree with the President that we should not leave Iraq in chaos  U S  troops should also not be in the position of  policing a civil war      That is why U S  policy must focus on a strategy that encourages  Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for their country and attempt to find a political solution to the conflict      Our efforts are already having their intended effect   On Tuesday  the President s own Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  stated that  the debate in Congress  has been helpful in demonstrating to the Iraqis that American patience is limited   The strong feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable probably has had a positive impact in terms of communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open ended commitment      The President has also chided Congress for providing much needed emergency funding for items such as Katrina recovery  agricultural disaster relief  the State Children s Health Insurance known as S CHIP  and fire fighting to name a few      He has attempted to paint this funding as pork barrel spending when the reality is that these are dollars that will be used to rebuild Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama  dollars that will be used for farmers to offset losses from drought  dollars used for the health care needs of our nation s neediest children  and dollars for our first responders      These are funds that are needed now  and the supplemental offers the best opportunity to address these emergencies      Moving forward  I am pleased that President Bush met with Majority Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi yesterday   I see that as a sign of progress  but I am also disappointed that the President may choose to veto the bill we send him      For the security of our country and for the sake of our troops  it is time for a new direction       It must be a direction that better reflects the reality that real progress ultimately lies with Iraqis taking responsibility for their own future       This new direction must also acknowledge that we must do more for our troops   when they are in harm s way and when they return home     They not only deserve our appreciation and support  they deserve the very best equipment  armor  and other battlefield amenities necessary to complete their mission  as well as the proper care  benefits  and attention once their military service is complete      Our troops are worthy of this commitment  and I strongly believe this bill offers the necessary guidelines to bring them home safely and as soon as possible      Thank you  Mr  President  I yield the floor
