 Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   Thursday commemorated the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in a speech on the Senate floor  The following is the text of Lincolns remarks  as prepared for delivery  September 25th  2007  marks the 50th Anniversary of one of the most important days in our countrys history  On that day in 1957  Minnijean Brown  Elizabeth Eckford  Ernest Green  Thelma Mothershed  Melba Pattillo  Gloria Ray  Terrence Roberts  Jefferson Thomas  and Carlotta Walls changed the world when they entered the doors to Little Rock Central High and desegregated the Little Rock School District  Known collectively as the Little Rock Nine  these brave young men and women faced down a jeering crowd  the Arkansas National Guard  and even their own Governor  to take a principled stand and march toward greater equality for all in our nation and in my home state of Arkansas  Next week  in Little Rock  we will commemorate the heroic sacrifice that these students made to blaze a trail so that future generations could benefit  In doing so  it is also appropriate to recognize those in the community who lifted up these individuals and gave them strength  Arkansans Daisy and L C  Bates  Chris Mercer  Wiley Branton  and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall either gave these children daily guidance or fought for them in the court system to ensure that they could have access to a quality education that was their right   We must also not forget the enormous role that the parents of the Little Rock Nine played to ignore threats and intimidation that came their way   What happened in Little Rock fifty years ago is not only a testament to those students  but it is also a testament to those who supported them   It is a testament to the people of Little Rock of all backgrounds who decided that they would confront their own consciences  And it is a testament to those who  upon reflecting on the matter  decided that doing whats right was worth the cost  I also want to recognize the other communities in Arkansas who led the way for integration in the Deep South  even prior to the famous stand off in 1957  that often receive little attention  Shortly after the Brown v  Board of Education decision in 1954  the communities of Charleston  Fayetteville  and Hoxie desegregated their schools to comply with the ruling of the Supreme Court  Former U S  Senator Dale Bumpers  a Charleston native and the attorney for the Charleston School Board in 1954  was very involved in his communitys decision  In a recent newspaper interview  he recounted that the Charleston School Board made up their minds that the Supreme Court decision meant what it said and that Charleston could save itself a lot of trouble by going ahead and integrating immediately instead of fighting it out and essentially knowing it would be a lost cause  Dale Bumpers continued to push for change later as a lawyer  Governor  and U S  Senator  In 1998  he authored the legislation that established the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site  which is administered with the National Park Service  the Little Rock School District  the City of Little Rock  and other entities   He was also responsible for the legislation that awarded the Little Rock Nine with the Congressional Gold Medal  our nations highest civilian honor  Monday  I will be in Little Rock to dedicate the new Visitors Center and Museum at that site  The new center will feature exhibits on the Little Rock Nine and the road to desegregation  As a young child who experienced firsthand the integration of the schools in my hometown of Helena  Arkansas  I cannot imagine the fear and anxiety those students must have felt in that tumultuous environment in 1957  I feel fortunate that my community embraced the process of integration  and that my parents  in particular  were engaged and kept me in the local school district when so many of my friends were being moved to private school  My husband Steve  who is a Central High graduate  and I are both better people for learning in integrated schools and experiencing the diversity it provided  I appreciate the lifelong lessons that I learned in my early years  and it is because of the Little Rock Nine that it was possible  Their decision to move this nation forward makes me proud to be an Arkansan  and it makes me proud to be an American  In closing  I want to specifically thank my colleagues in the Arkansas delegation  especially Senator Mark Pryor and Congressman Vic Snyder  Ive been proud to work with both of them to secure funding the new Visitors Center   In addition  I joined with Senator Pryor  who attended Little Rock Central  to introduce a resolution which recognizes the 50th Anniversary of the schools desegregation  It passed the Senate earlier this month  and I want to thank my colleagues for their support  Mr  President  there is still much that can be done in our country to ensure that the goals of the Little Rock Nine are achieved and that equal rights are available for each and every individual   We have come very far in the last 50 years  As we move forward  we should let the lessons of the past provide a measure of our progress and the inspiration to build on our achievements for all of our fellow man
