Laning  202 224 4843 WASHINGTON     The Arkansas Delegation today met with BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi to discuss Pentagon recommendations to close the Red River and Lone Star Army Depots and realign the 188th Air National Guard Unit in Fort Smith  Delegation members stressed the critical missions each installation conducts       Principi told Delegation members that BRAC decisions would be made on the military value of each base and pledged that his commission would thoroughly consider and review all testimony and documentation Delegation members presented on behalf of Arkansas military bases       Holding a meeting with the Chairman of BRAC immediately following the publication of his commission   s report is indicative of our Delegation   s commitment to fighting for our facilities   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   said   While today was merely the first step in the process  we have conveyed our unified voice and have indicated to the BRAC Commission that their recommendations would have severe impacts in Arkansas  Over the next several weeks  I look forward to providing evidence and documentation to the BRAC Commission of the invaluable contributions Red River  Lone Star and the 188th Fighter Wing are currently making to our national defense           I thank Chairman Principi for taking the time to meet with us today  It was a good first meeting and we intend to follow up with other BRAC Commissioners  Chairman Principi said something today that was very important  He wants these BRAC recommendations to be made on the military value of each base and I think we have a strong case when it comes to Fort Smith and Texarkana  As we speak  F 16   s from the 188th are proving their military worth by being deployed to the Middle East  The Red River and Lone Star Army Depots provide support and maintenance for some of our most critical weapons systems and vehicles including the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Multiple Launch Rocket System  both of which have been key to our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq     U S  Senator Mark Pryor  D Ark   said     We will continue to scrutinize the DOD   s recommendation and work to make sure the BRAC Commission understands the important role Arkansas   s military installations play in our overall defense strategy           I am very grateful for Chairman Principi s time and attention   The meeting was positive and gave us the opportunity to promote the value of the 188th s current mission to the top official on the BRAC Commission   We outlined the investments that have been made in the 188th and explained how they have always scored well on their tests  have an excellent relationship with the community and how the airmen of the 188th are currently playing an instrumental role in the mission in Iraq   The Senators and I will continue to promote these qualities to Chairman Principi and hope to bring him to Fort Smith to see this firsthand in the very near future   said U S  Congressman John Boozman  R Ark   3rd       Today s Arkansas Congressional Delegation Meeting with Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission Chairman Principi was one of many steps and actions I will be involved with in the BRAC process  I appreciate Chairman Principi agreeing to meet with us on such short notice   Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant are important military facilities in keeping our soldiers safe during wartime and providing them with the equipment they need to do their job   The value of the work done at the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition plant is clear as the work involves making and repairing items that keep our troops safe  such as armor plated doors for Humvees   I will not let these bases be closed without a fight and will continue to work with local community leaders in Texarkana  the Arkansas and Texas Congressional Delegations  and BRAC Commissioners as the process continues to unfold   U S  Congressman Mike Ross  D Ark   4th  said
