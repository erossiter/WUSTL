Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today paid tribute to the late Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Winthrop Paul Rockefeller in a speech on the floor of the United States Senate   The following is the text of Lincoln   s remarks  as prepared for delivery       Mr  President  today I rise to pay tribute to one of Arkansas    great public servants  business leaders and philanthropists  Lieutenant Governor Winthrop Paul Rockefeller   Win Paul passed away quietly last Sunday after a period of illness        Words can hardly express the sense of loss that we Arkansans feel at the passing of Win   Everyone has heard of the Rockefeller name       It   s renowned the world over   And truth be told  Win could have used that name and his family fortune to do whatever he wanted or nothing at all   Many in similar circumstances have chosen to indulge themselves in personal excess     But not Win   He chose to live the life of a servant   He had a plaque placed at his home on Petit Jean mountain in Arkansas that I think sums up how he lived and what he believed       The plaque quoted Micah 6 8        He has showed you  oh man  what is good   And what does the Lord require of you   To act justly and to love mercy  and to walk humbly with thy God        All through his life you see evidence of his desire to live out that scripture   He was compassionate and thoughtful   He showed a strong love for his fellow man and a commitment to leaving this world a better place than he found it     Part of that commitment was expressed through his work at Little Rock based Winrock International     one of the World   s leading incubators of economic progress for developing economies      His work there not only has had a profound impact on 107 nations spread across the globe  but also has impacted Arkansas    rural areas   I   ve worked closely with Winrock on many of those initiatives        His Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation has also helped enrich the quality of life for rural Americans especially in the area of home ownership       He also strongly believed in developing the potential in our young people   One of his favorite organizations was the Boy Scouts of America   He served on the executive board of the national council  and he was president of the Quapaw Area Council in 1997 and thereafter was a vice president       He also founded a program called Books in the Attic  in which Boy Scouts collect used books to distribute to families  Most importantly  he served for many years as an assistant scoutmaster for Troop 12 and attended Scout camp with his sons regularly     Win was also the father of two special needs children   His desire to see them and others like them succeed in life moved him to open a school for differently abled children called the Academy at Riverdale in Little Rock       This is just another example of the kind of heart that he possessed     Throughout his lifetime  Win also served in charitable organizations in many ways   The list is long  but some of the charities include the Arkansas State Police Commission and the President   s Council on Rural America       He served as a Texas Christian University trustee and was on the national boards of Ducks Unlimited and The Nature Conservancy       He served on the boards of the Arkansas Cancer Research Center and the Arkansas Arts Center Foundation  He was a trustee of the Winthrop Rockefeller Charitable Trust and was vice chairman of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation       And in his spare time he was one of the finest Lieutenant Governors the State of Arkansas has ever known     As I close paying tribute to this thoughtful and kind man  I am reminded of the story of David   He was looked upon as the most unlikely of men to become King of Israel       In the same way  it was easy for many to believe that they could look at outward things     Win   s money  family connections and status     and draw conclusions about who he was       But  as with David  man looks on the outside  but God looks on the heart   Win   s heart was always in the proper place     a faithful place   And I truly believe that his heart has now found its rightful place in the hand of his King       My condolences go out to his lovely wife Lisenne  his three daughters and five sons   To his extended family     including my dear friend and colleague Jay Rockefeller   I pray that the Lord would keep the entire Rockefeller family in their time of grief
