                                                                                                                                                          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 09  2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 WASHINGTON D C      Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor today announced a double victory for the Little Rock Central High School Museum and Visitor Center  including committee passage of  5 1 million to complete the Visitor   s Center and advancement of a commemorative coin marking the 50th anniversary of the school   s desegregation crisis     Lincoln and Pryor said the first victory of the day involving Little Rock Central High School includes a  5 1 million earmark they helped secure in the Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations Bill  This funding would allow the Little Rock Central High School Museum and Visitors Center to be complete in time to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the school   s desegregation crisis  The bill was passed today by the Senate Appropriations Committee  and must next be passed by the full Senate      In 2004  Pryor introduced Senate Resolution 420  legislation to leverage funding and support within the Senate for completion of the Visitor   s Center by 2007  Working with members of the Little Rock Nine and former Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Elijah Cummings  the resolution passed unanimously and  733 000 in design funding was secured through the appropriations process      As a result of this funding  the National Park Service was able to move forward with the Visitor Center  awarding contracts to an architect and an exhibit designer  Today   s announcements will help complete the process       The integration of Central High due to the events of 1957 shaped our nation and deserves to be preserved for future generations   Lincoln said   Securing the necessary funding for this new facility has been a long hard fight and I   m pleased that we can finally announce that we re one step closer to realizing our dream  The example of these nine students  who overcame adversity and hate to achieve tolerance and equality  is a lasting tribute to their families  the state of Arkansas  and to the entire civil rights movement of this country          We   ve been working long and hard to ensure the extraordinary achievements of the Little Rock Nine are properly recorded and recognized at the Visitors Center  This  5 1 million earmark represents the light at the end of the tunnel     Pryor said     Soon  families will be able to gain a better understanding and appreciation of the people and events that shaped the civil rights movement through unique stories and state of the art exhibits right here in Little Rock         Lincoln and Pryor also announced that the Senate Banking Committee will pass  S  582  The Little Rock Central High School Desegregation 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act    this evening  The Senators introduced the bill in March  which would direct the Treasury to mint and issue 500 000 coins beginning January 1  2007  A portion of the funds would cover production costs and the remaining funds would go toward improvements and programs at the Central High Museum and Visitor Center  Two commemorative coins are issued by Congress each year to reflect significant events in American history     The Senators credited Congressman Vic Snyder for introducing identical legislation in January and garnering support from 321 House cosponsors  There are 71 cosponsors on the Senate version      This coin commemorates the courage and determination of the Little Rock Nine and their families   Lincoln said   It is a small token of recognition for those young Americans who acted out of their deeply held belief that they could help create a more just society for themselves and those around them  Their principled stand is extremely deserving of recognition         A commemorative coin is an opportunity to honor the important role the Little Rock Nine played in our nation   s history  and to help highlight and fund the Visitor Center     Pryor said     Today   s action by the Senate Banking Committee means we have overcome perhaps our biggest hurdle  I will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to promote and pass this bill
