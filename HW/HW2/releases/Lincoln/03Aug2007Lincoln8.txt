                    A Look Back on the Successes of the 110th Congress                                                                               Both                                                    A Look Back on the Successes of the 110th Congress   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 03  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 As Congress begins the August work period and Members travel back to their states and districts  I am planning to visit with constituents throughout Arkansas to discuss their priorities and the agenda in Congress for the rest of the year  Before looking forward  though  I want to take a moment to reflect on what has been accomplished thus far during this Congressional session  Last November  the American people sent a clear signal when they went to the pollsthey wanted a new direction for our country  No issue defined that election or currently consumes the hearts and minds of Arkansans more than Iraq  The status quo is no longer acceptable  Americans have indicated a willingness to change the course in Iraq  and Ive considered many solutions to achieve that goal since day one of the 110th Congress  While we continue to work toward that objective  it is important to note that the U S  Senate has passed significant legislation during the first seven months of this Congress to address the needs of hardworking Americans  First and foremost among these has been raising the minimum wage  Any parent who works 40 hours a week should not have to raise a family in poverty  and Im proud that Congress has finally passedand the President has signedlegislation that gives American workers the increase they deserve  The first phase of the minimum wage took effect on July 24  When the full  7 25 wage increase is implemented in 2009  it is expected that it will directly affect approximately 113 000 minimum wage workers in Arkansas  nearly 9 4 percent of the workforce in our state  As part of the minimum wage increase  I also authored a small business tax package that became law  This provision will assist small businesses by balancing their interests and giving them the tools to grow their business  A secondary benefit of the minimum wage increase is that the added income will make it less likely these Americans will have to work more than one job  That translates into more time that parents will have to go to a PTA meeting  attend their childs baseball game  take their children to church  or care for aging parents or a sick child  The fabric of our country is composed of hardworking families  and this investment will only strengthen the fibers that make up our great nation  Congress is also working to fulfill our moral obligation to ensure our nations children receive the quality care they need for a healthy future  I am proud that the Senate passed legislation to preserve coverage for the 6 6 million children currently enrolled in the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  and to reach an estimated 3 2 million additional uninsured  low income American children  Currently  there are approximately 65 000 of Arkansass children who receive coverage through this program  known as in our state as ARKids First  Passage of this legislation is a significant step to build upon this successful program  which has allowed us to greatly reduce the number of children who need health care coverage in Arkansas and across the country   Congress also has provided billions of dollars for veterans health care  Our veterans have sacrificed so greatly on our behalf  and the least we can do as a grateful nation is to deliver the quality care and assistance that was promised to them  By not doing so  we risk our credibility as a nation with future servicemen and women  The budget agreement that the we passed earlier this year represents the largest increase ever for veterans health care  Special attention was paid to mental health issues that have not been adequately addressed in the past such as traumatic brain injuries and post traumatic stress disorder  College access and affordability has also been made a top priority by this Congress  The Senate has committed  17 billion in additional funding for higher education  the largest increase for higher education since passage of the GI Bill  This legislation simplifies the financial aid process for low income students  ensures that the student loan program treats students fairly  and provides more funding for the Pell Grant program that many students in Arkansas depend on to attend college  I continue to hear from Arkansans about the high price of gas  The Senate has taken a major step forward to help control those prices by creating a modern day energy policy that will strengthen our economy and national security  By promoting the production of renewable fuels  we create opportunities to reduce our reliance on foreign oil while giving our producers in rural America another market for their products and creating good paying jobs right here at home  Congress also passed a pay raise for our troops  provided funding to help rebuild the Gulf Coast  and addressed agriculture disaster relief that the President has signed into law  We have also passed a fiscally responsible budget in both the House and Senate that places an emphasis on addressing the needs of hardworking Americans and passed the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform bill in our nations history  paving the way towards a government that reflects its citizens values of honesty and transparency  Democrats are also making America safer by strengthening our borders  ensuring first responders have the tools they need to do their jobs  and enhancing security at our airports  ports and mass transit facilities  Weve achieved many successes already this year  but there is much more left to do  You can be certain that I will continue to fight for the priorities that are important to Arkansans  and I encourage you to make your concerns known as we pursue our agenda in the Senate
