                    Lincoln  Comprehensive Bill Will Modernize National Energy Policy                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln  Comprehensive Bill Will Modernize National Energy Policy  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 22  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   announced today that the Senate passed energy bill contains several of her initiatives to spur renewable fuels production and encourage the development of energy efficient products    The Senate has taken a major step toward creating a modern day energy policy that will strengthen our economy and national security by promoting the production of homegrown renewable fuels  Lincoln said  Im pleased to have secured several provisions that will help encourage the production of biofuels that will help us meet our energy needs while lessening our dependence on foreign oil   Lincoln is a member of the Senate Energy Committee and assisted in writing the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 which passed the Senate late Thursday  The comprehensive bill includes several provisions Lincoln fought to enact earlier this year   Biofuels Help Desk  Lincoln has pushed to establish a program within the Department of Energy  DOE  to set up regional information centers on biofuels  These centers would provide a point of contact for those interested in producing or using biofuels with information about potential federal money for biofuel projects or information on where consumers can obtain biofuels  This is intended to help local communities take better advantage of this fast growing industry   Engine Durability Study  One of the key factors in promoting the expansion of biodiesel is encouraging more vehicle manufacturers to extend their warranties to allow the use of biodiesel  Currently  few manufacturers have warranties that allow the use of this fuel  Lincolns study would help to determine biodiesels effect on the durability of engines in the hopes of encouraging more vehicle manufacturers to change their warranties to allow the use of biodiesel  Cellulosic Biofuels  This legislation would provide a tax credit to producers of cellulosic biofuels  Cellulosic resources  such as crop residues  agricultural fibers  plants  and grasses  can be used to produce a homegrown  renewable fuel that could help reduce our dependence on foreign oil  Energy efficient appliances  This provision would provide for new energy and water efficiency standards for several home appliance products  It would establish first ever water conservation standards for clothes washers and dishwashers along with a new energy standard for dishwashers  The legislation also provides for new energy efficiency standards for dehumidifier products  and requires the DOE to conduct a new rulemaking on future refrigerator standards  Lastly  and in order to ensure that federal standards keep pace with technological developments  the legislation requires the DOE to conduct future rulemakings on dishwashers and clothes washers to determine if new energy and water standards are warranted  and if so  what they should be   During debate on the overall bill a majority of Republicans blocked the Finance Committees tax package that included Lincolns initiatives to extend tax incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel  Measures to encourage energy efficiency and reduce emissions  including Lincolns incentives for energy efficient appliances and idling reduction devices for heavy trucks  were also part of the tax package that fell to partisan politics    It is unfortunate that the progress we have made in the production of biodiesel is now in jeopardy  Without the biodiesel tax credit  which expires next year  it will be difficult for this exciting industry to continue to grow  Lincoln said  I will continue to fight for provisions that spur the production of fuels grown in rural America and measures designed to increase energy efficiency
