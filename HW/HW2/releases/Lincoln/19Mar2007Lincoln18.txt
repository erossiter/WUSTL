                    Lincoln on U S  Senate Floor  Bill Will Restore Constitutional Process of     Confirming U S  Attorneys                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln on U S  Senate Floor  Bill Will Restore Constitutional Process of     Confirming U S  Attorneys  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 19  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   Monday delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of a bill to restore the Senate s advisory role in confirming U S  Attorney nominees            Lincoln is a cosponsor of the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007  a bill that would allow the Attorney General to appoint an interim U S  Attorney for 120 days  not indefinitely   If after that time an individual has not been nominated and confirmed by the Senate  the district court would appoint an interim U S  attorney   The Senate is expected to vote on the bill Tuesday  March 20            The following are Lincoln s remarks on the Senate floor  as prepared for delivery  Mr  President  I come to the Senate floor this evening as a cosponsor of Senator Feinstein s legislation regarding the interim appointments of U S  Attorneys          I am here this evening to vigorously restate my support for this bill and urge my colleagues to support its passage   I originally signed onto this legislation in January following the interim appointment of Tim Griffin as U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas  who replaced former U S  Attorney Bud Cummins          When Congress reauthorized the Patriot Act last year  we granted the Administration the authority to appoint U S  Attorney vacancies on an interim basis   The Administration asked for this authority based upon the idea that if a national security issue arose requiring a new U S  Attorney  the Attorney General could step up and provide a replacement in a time of crisis without the delay of the confirmation process           In a January Senate Judiciary hearing  Attorney General Gonzales stated that this provision would not be used for political purposes or to circumvent the nomination process   Furthermore  the Attorney General pledged that he would work with home state senators to provide replacement U S  Attorneys          I listened to the Attorney General s comments  but we now know that the actions of his Justice Department in recent months does not match his rhetoric   Specific information revealed last week shows that the Justice Department deliberately and deftly planned to circumvent the rules for appointing U S  Attorneys by politicizing the emergency provision we authorized          In one e mail exchange between White House staff and officials at the Department of Justice  the Administration specifically plotted to  gum this to death  and otherwise  run out the clock  in an effort to avoid the confirmation process to replace former U S  Attorney Bud Cummins          These actions are a disservice to all Americans and demonstrate a willful lack of transparency and respect for the system of checks and balances our forefathers instituted          Now  I recognize that U S  Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President and are political appointees   However  they have a duty and a responsibility to implement the laws of our nation without political favor or bias          That is why the confirmation process is so important   to ensure nominees are qualified and are committed to the rule of law   It is an important check and balance that has served our nation well and any attempt to undermine it represents a breakdown in our system          The e mails released last week show either a blatant attempt to deceive the Senate or  at the very least  serious mismanagement under the Attorney General   This controversy has caused a serious breach between the Justice Department  Congress and the American people  a breach that I m not sure can be repaired if Mr  Gonzales remains Attorney General          And that is why I am here this evening  Mr  President  to preserve the Senate s role in the confirmation process and to restore our system to the way our forefathers envisioned          I want to take this time to compliment Senator Feinstein  Senator Leahy  and Senator Specter for the leadership they have shown on this issue   This bill represents a compromise on this issue  and the bipartisan leadership they have shown should serve as an example to this entire body          I also want to thank the numerous U S  Attorneys and their staffs for the critical work they do to protect our communities by enforcing the laws of our nation   Far too often  they do not receive the credit they deserve          It s unfortunate that the Senate must set time aside to debate this legislation because we have many priorities that must be addressed as this year progresses   However  our democracy relies on an independent and unbiased law enforcement  and it is our duty to ensure that these problems our corrected          Mr  President  I yield the floor
