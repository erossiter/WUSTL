                    Lincoln to Bush  Fix Medicare Problems Now                                                                               Both                                                    Lincoln to Bush  Fix Medicare Problems Now   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 15  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   is calling on President Bush to address several critical issues related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Program so that beneficiaries do not face unnecessary hardship in the coming months      In a letter sent yesterday to the President  Lincoln said that the resignation of Dr  Mark McClellan  Medicare   s top official  presents an opportunity to focus on the continuing problems with the drug program   s implementation  Lincoln called on the President to fix several measures before Congress recesses at the end of this month in order to avoid potential problems for beneficiaries  The complete text of Lincoln   s letter to President Bush is as follows       Dear Mr  President     As you know  on September 5  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  Administrator  Dr  Mark McClellan  announced he would leave his post next month  I believe this transition presents an opportunity to address some ongoing concerns regarding implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug Program  As you search for a successor to replace Dr  McClellan  I encourage you to select an individual who possesses the knowledge and skills that are necessary to succeed in this critical management post and who makes improving the Medicare Prescription Drug Program a top priority        In the meantime  there are several critical issues related to Medicare Part D that require immediate attention in order to avoid potential problems over the next few months  I do not believe that any of these measures are unreasonable  and have been given considerable attention here in the U S  Senate  I urge you to seize the opportunity to make them a priority and move these bills before we recess  Not taking immediate action could result in hardship for many Americans  These issues include        Eliminate Enrollment Penalty  The Medicare Part D prescription drug program is complex  and individuals in addition to low income beneficiaries should not be penalized for late enrollment  I am a co sponsor of S  2810  sponsored by Finance Committee Chairman Grassley  which would amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to eliminate the months in 2006 from the calculation of any late enrollment penalty under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program  If the late enrollment penalty is not removed  many older adults will be forced to pay a penalty for every month that they are in the Medicare prescription drug plan  causing a major financial burden for these adults in their later years     Improve Pharmacy Access  Fair dispensing fees for participating pharmacies will help ensure greater access for more beneficiaries  Two key components of the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act of 2006  S  2664   of which I am a co sponsor  requests that the Secretary of Health and Human Services establish reasonable dispensing fees for covered Medicare Part D drugs dispensed by participating pharmacies and requires a prescription drug plan  P P   sponsor to encourage generic utilization by paying an increased dispensing fee for generic drugs      Additionally  some PDS have taken steps that  in effect  limit beneficiaries    ability to obtain extended supplies through retail pharmacies  Some PDS have made their own mail order pharmacy the only preferred pharmacy for extended supplies  others permit retail pharmacies to provide extended supplies but require the beneficiary to pay higher cost sharing  consistent with the guidance issued by CMS  I am concerned that these rules may undermine the spirit of the Medicare law   s provisions regarding a level playing field between mail order and retail pharmacies and the Agency   s own objective of ensuring reasonable access for beneficiaries        Assistance for State Outreach and Enrollment  Area Agencies on Aging  AAAS   Native American Aging programs  and State Health Insurance Assistance Programs  ships  have provided counseling on Medicare Part D enrollment without adequate funding  In FY 2006  SHIP programs  of which one third are operated by AAAS  are funded at  31 5 million  With the exception of a few one time only grants  these agencies have had to absorb the costs from budgets that are already stretched tightly  I know that in Arkansas more work needs to done  as many people who may be eligible for the low income subsidy have not signed up for benefits  While the Social Security Administration has processed 67 931 of the 80 987 applications submitted  there are approximately 13 000 individuals who may still be eligible for the subsidy  CMS needs to dedicate funds to these agencies to provide further support and outreach to low income persons  New funding of at least  30 million should be allocated to the AAAS and Native American aging programs in FY 2007 and  13 million to the SHIPS  This funding would cover about one percent of the cost of performing enrollment assistance and counseling  which costs approximately  100 per beneficiary      Erroneous Medicare Part D Premium Withholdings  The high number of erroneous Medicare prescription drug refund premiums withheld from Social Security checks is unacceptable  Over 500 000 beneficiaries have had incorrect premiums withheld  with 200 000 cases occurring in August 2006  My state offices have been inundated with constituent calls regarding this problem  For example  one couple enrolled in a particular plan and a few days later decided to switch their plan  CMS has not dropped them from the first plan  nor have they notified Social Security about the change  As a result  Social Security is withholding premiums from the first plan  about  100  and CMS now owes them  900  Additionally  there are another 3 765 Arkansans who have had their premiums refunded who never requested refunds  These types of errors must be remedied to prevent confusion among beneficiaries and communication needs to be enhanced between the agencies and Congress        I appreciate your immediate attention to these matters  We should not let the opportunity pass to address these important issues in the remaining days of this Congress  I look forward to working with you and the new CMS Administrator in the future to further improve the Medicare Part D program so that it reaches a greater number of older adults
