                    Lincoln Continues Fight to Increase Federal Minimum Wage                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln Continues Fight to Increase Federal Minimum Wage  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 10  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     During a U S  Senate Finance Committee hearing today  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   once again called for Congress to increase the federal minimum wage for America   s working families       Increasing the federal minimum wage is long overdue in this country   Lincoln said   Workers    wages have remained stagnant while the cost of living  including utilities  gasoline  housing  groceries  higher education  child care and health care  has increased  I believe that any American who works 40 hours a week should not have to raise a family in poverty  It is my hope that with the newly elected Democratic Congress  the measure will finally pass and Americans will no longer have to work for an hourly wage that barely buys two gallons of gas today      Since coming to the Senate  Lincoln has voted seven times to increase the minimum wage  In the nearly 70 years since the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act  Congress has passed laws to raise the minimum wage only 8 times  with the most recent increase occurring in 1996  Lincoln noted that states such as Arkansas have passed their own minimum wage increases in response to Congress    failure to make an increase at the federal level     Lincoln also encouraged the committee to look for ways to provide relief for small businesses that will be affected by a minimum wage increase      Small businesses provide the majority of the jobs in Arkansas and are the backbone of our rural communities   Lincoln said   Just like our workers that face obstacles as a result of stagnant wages  our small businesses have their fair share of challenges whether it be rising health care costs or staying competitive in the ever changing global market place  Therefore  it makes sense that we look for ways to provide relief for our small businesses as we work to pass a minimum wage increase       The U S  House of Representatives is expected to vote on a minimum wage increase today and the Senate plans to take up the measure later this month
