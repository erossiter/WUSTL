                    Lincoln Energy Provisions Included in Committee Bill                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln Energy Provisions Included in Committee Bill  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 02  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   announced today that her provisions to promote the domestic production of renewable fuels and energy efficient appliances were included in a comprehensive energy bill passed by the Senate Energy Committee  of which Lincoln is a member           Entrepreneurs and businesses across the country  particularly in rural America  are pushing forward with plans to produce alternative fuels   We ve seen a dramatic increase in the use of biodiesel alone over the past few years because of important tax incentives that have encouraged its production and because of the exciting potential this energy source holds for the future   Lincoln said           Our government can and should make a stronger commitment to energy independence by offering our production pioneers the kind of partnership that brings substantial progress   The 2005 energy bill was an important first step  and I will continue to push for provisions that promote alternative fuel use and energy conservation             Lincoln said her provisions included in today s comprehensive bill on biofuels and energy efficiency would encourage the creation of new markets for our producers and more affordable technologies for our consumers   The Committee s bill included the following Lincoln provisions          Biofuels Help Desk  Lincoln has worked to establish a program within the Department of Energy  DOE  to set up regional information centers on biofuels   These centers would provide a point of contact for those interested in producing or using biofuels with information about potential federal money for biofuel projects or information on where consumers can obtain biofuels   This is intended to help local communities take better advantage of this fast growing industry          Engine Durability Study  One of the key factors in promoting the expansion of biodiesel is encouraging more manufacturers to extend their warranties to allow the use of biodiesel  Currently  few manufacturers have warranties that allow the use of this fuel   Lincoln s proposed study would help to determine biodiesel s effect on the durability of engines and would encourage more manufacturers to change their warranties to allow the use of biodiesel          Energy efficient appliances  This provision  which would provide for new energy and water efficiency standards for several home appliance products  is based on legislation Lincoln introduced earlier this year   The legislation establishes first ever water conservation standards for clothes washers and dishwashers along with a new energy standard for dishwashers   The legislation also provides for new energy efficiency standards for dehumidifier products  and requires the DOE to conduct a new rulemaking on future refrigerator standards   Lastly  and in order to ensure that federal standards keep pace with technological developments  the legislation requires the DOE to conduct future rulemakings on dishwashers and clothes washers to determine if new energy and water standards are warranted  and if so  what they should be           The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included Lincoln s package of energy tax incentives  including measures to encourage the development of alternative fuels and the production of energy efficient appliances that allow consumers to benefit from cost and energy savings
