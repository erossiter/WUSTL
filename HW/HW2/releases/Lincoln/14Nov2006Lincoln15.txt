a wide range of issues  including health care  tax  trade  agriculture  and energy policy         My committee assignments will allow me to play a strong role in guiding the issues most important to

poverty and relies heavily on the security and strength of the Medicare and Social Security programs   The future of our farm families and the strength of our state   s economy is tied directly to a fair trade policy and a strong Farm Bill  which will be up for reauthorization next year   In addition  Arkansas    farmers and business community stand ready to lead our country down the path of energy independence   I look forward to making progress on these fronts for all Arkansans           When the 110th Congress convenes in January  Lincoln will serve as the sixth highest ranking

face so they are able to enjoy every blessing and opportunity our nation offers
