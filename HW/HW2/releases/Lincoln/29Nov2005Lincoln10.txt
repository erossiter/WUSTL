Katie Laning  202 224 4843 WASHINGTON     Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor  along with Congressmen Marion Berry  AR 01   Vic Snyder  AR 02   John Boozman  AR 03  and Mike Ross  AR 04   announced today that Arkansas will receive  5 9 million from the U S  Department of Labor  DOL  to train workers for careers in the automotive and advanced manufacturing industries  The Arkansas Delta Training and Education Consortium  ADTEC   a partnership of four community colleges in the Delta  will use these funds to establish a training program to support the state s growing automotive industry      With a number of automotive manufacturing plants and the possibility of a new Hino Motors Ltd  truck plant in 2007  Arkansas has the potential to become a center of automotive excellence  Although the region is adjacent to a vast transportation network  including the Mississippi River  the world s largest cargo airport  and FedEx s global headquarters  the Delta still lacks the skilled workforce critical for a manufacturing economy  Arkansas  Congressional Delegation has worked with Governor Huckabee and Elaine Chao  Secretary of DOL  to fund the ADTEC consortium and establish a program in the Delta region capable of providing community based job training      The four community colleges that make up ADTEC include Mid South Community College  Arkansas Northeastern College  East Arkansas Community College  and Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas  The consortium intends to partner with local workforce investment boards and the K 12 public school systems throughout counties in the Delta region to provide workforce development training and educational classes       In order to bring jobs to the Delta we must look for opportunities to develop a skilled workforce to make the region a more attractive place for businesses to locate   Senator Blanche Lincoln said    Federal investments like this in education and training programs increase the marketability of the Delta ten fold  and as a result allow the region s economy to grow   I m proud to support the Consortium s ongoing efforts to improve life in the Delta         This training opportunity opens up a career pathway for thousands of Arkansans to earn a better paycheck and improve the standard of living in the Delta region     Senator Mark Pryor said      Having skilled employees trained and ready to work will serve as a catalyst for growth in our state   s automotive industry         This is a great example of what can happen when individuals from the city council to the Cabinet in the White House work together for the common good   Congressman Marion Berry said   It creates a force more powerful than a hurricane or an earthquake or military might  and we are going to see the result of that in just a few years because of this grant          The potential of Arkansas is great     Congressman Vic Snyder said     Federal funding to educate a workforce to support our state s growing automotive industry is a wise investment         In order to lure new manufacturing jobs to the state of Arkansas  we need to have a skilled labor base for employers to draw from   This grant will help train Arkansans for careers in the automotive manufacturing field which will in turn make our state more attractive to automotive companies looking for locations for new plants   This kind of economic development is crucial for the future of the Delta   Congressman John Boozman said      I am very grateful to Secretary Chao and the Department of Labor for awarding this important grant to establish a job training program for workers in Arkansas s automotive industry   Congressman Mike Ross said   This grant will not only be a tremendous boon for Arkansas s Delta economy  but it also enables Arkansans to be on the cutting edge of automotive and manufacturing technology and compete in today s competitive and constantly evolving industry
