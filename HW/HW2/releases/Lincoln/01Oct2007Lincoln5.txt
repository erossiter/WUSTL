Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Guest Column byU S  Senator Blanche L  Lincoln This past August  the U S  Census Bureau released a report  Income  Poverty  and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States 2006  that revealed alarming new information about the uninsured in the United States  According to the Census Bureau  both the percentage and the number of Americans without health insurance increased in 2006  The percentage without health insurance increased from 15 3 percent in 2005 to15 8 percent in 2006  and the number of uninsured increased from 44 8 million to 47 million  In Arkansas  the number of uninsured in our state rose as well  The percentage of uninsured Arkansans rose from 17 2 percent of the population in 2005 to 17 5 percent of the population in 2006bringing the total number of uninsured Arkansans to 482 000  Meanwhile  public opinion polls suggest that more than three quarters of Americans believe the number of uninsured Americans is a very important public policy priority  The fact is  being insured matters to people  According to the Institute of Medicine  approximately 18 000 people die each year because they are uninsured  Those who lack health insurance do not get access to timely and appropriate health care  They have less access to important screenings  state of the art technology  and prescription drugs  Moreover  health insurance makes economic sense  A 2005 Families USA study detailed that Americans with family health insurance coverage provided by private employers spent an extra  922 in premiums due to the cost of care for the uninsured  and Americans with individual coverage spent an extra  341  And its not just low income Americans who lack insurance  Working families need the most help with this problem  As health care costs rise  we are finding that more and more employers are not able to pay for premiums and are dropping coverage  Eight out of ten uninsured Americans in our country are working  More than 32 million uninsured Americans have an income of  25 000 or more  I have been working with my colleagues in the Senate to address this problem for a number of years  There is not one solution that will provide a quick fix  However  I do believe in a step by step approach to this problem that includes two major components  the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  and small business health care coverage  Last month  I hosted forums across Arkansas to discuss renewal of SCHIP and help build momentum for its passage  I was pleased that the House and Senate recently agreed on a compromise that would increase SCHIP  known in Arkansas as ARKids First  by  35 million over the next five years  Since its inception in 1997  ARKids First has successfully reduced the number of uninsured children in our state from over 20 percent in 1997 to 9 4 percent today  Unfortunately  President Bush is threatening to veto the bill that a bipartisan majority in Congress agreed upon  Included in our proposal were provisions that I fought for to ensure that uninsured children get a healthy start by providing care for pregnant women and establishing pediatric quality measures to improve the effectiveness  safety and efficiency of the care they receive  I also fought for measures that would invest in the development of evidence based quality measures for childrens health care  provide access to much needed dental care for lower income children  and ensure that children enrolled in SCHIP would have access to mental health care that is on par with the level of medical and surgical care they are currently provided  I am also committed to ensuring that small business owners have access to affordable health insurance plans for themselves and their employees  To this end  I introduced legislation in the last Congress and am working together with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to draft similar legislation that would give our small businesses affordable choices among private health insurance plans  Small employers across Arkansas have repeatedly told me that the ability to offer health insurance has a positive impact on recruitment and retention  employee morale and performance  and the overall success of their businesses  The clock is ticking  and it is up to us in Washington to find a solution so that hard working Americans can be assured of a healthy tomorrow  Each year that passes without action places more and more Americans in a vulnerable position  As the richest  most powerful country in the world  we owe it to the working families who want to protect themselves and their families from an uncertain future with access to affordable health care coverage  Americans and Arkansans shouldnt have to gamble on their health and well
