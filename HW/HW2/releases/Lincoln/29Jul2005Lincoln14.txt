Laning  202 224 4843 WASHINGTON     Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor  along with Congressmen Marion Berry  AR 01   Vic Snyder  AR 02   John Boozman  AR 03  and Mike Ross  AR 04   today announced Arkansas will receive  2 3 billion over the next 5 fiscal years  or  476 4 million annually  from the Transportation Reauthorization Bill to help address critical highway and transportation needs throughout the state   The bill passed the House of Representatives Friday  and is expected to pass the Senate before the end of the week      Members of the Congressional delegation said the  286 transportation highway bill will help address critical infrastructure needs that are not currently being met  spur economic development and create jobs  increase safety and anticipate future highway needs   According to the United States Department of Transportation  every  1 billion investment in our highways results in 47 500 jobs annually         This bill is desperately needed by our communities in Arkansas because when we invest in highway and infrastructure projects  we create jobs     Lincoln said      The projects this bill will fund are long overdue and are vital to our state   s economy and the well being of the entire region           This bill will allow significant investment and progress to be made on our roads and highways in every pocket of the state     Pryor said     It will pay off in dividends for our economy and quality of life in Arkansas          After close to three years of debate  I am pleased to see Congress finally come to an agreement on a highway bill   Berry said   Our delegation stuck together through it all and secured significant investments for our state  I am excited about this news and am confident that these projects will help Arkansas make long overdue improvements to our transportation system         Funding for transportation and infrastructure is very good news for the safety and convenience of Arkansans driving on our highways     said Snyder       The Third District of Arkansas is one of the fastest growing regions in the country  which is why  as a Highway Bill conferee  I worked hard to ensure that our projects were well funded   I am pleased that this bill is on its way to the President s desk so we can give Arkansas  infrastructure budget a much needed shot in the arm   said Boozman       After eleven extensions of the Transportation Reauthorization Bill since October 2003  we have passed a long overdue roadmap for transportation funding in America   said Ross    This funding will go a long way in meeting Arkansas s extensive road needs   As an economic ambassador for Arkansas  I am proud to have helped secure the funding throughout the course of the lengthy transportation reauthorization process
