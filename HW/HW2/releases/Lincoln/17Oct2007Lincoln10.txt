2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Senator Lincoln Continues Work to Provide for Americas Veterans  Washington  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today applauded the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee sefforts highlighting the need to improve health care and benefitsforAmerica s veterans  Lincoln has worked to addressseveral priorities on behalf of our country s veterans that werediscussedduring today s committee hearing  in whichformer Senator Bob Dole and former Secretaryof Healthand Human ServicesDonna Shalala  co chairs of the Presidents Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors  as well as Lt  Gen  James Terry Scott  Ret    Chairman of the Veterans Disability Benefits Commission testified    Veteransface anincreasinglycomplex system of care and benefits  Moreover  the influx of returning service members has further strained an under funded and under staffed VA  said Lincoln  Our heroic military men and women have served in some of the harshest conditions imaginable  and the least we can do is provide them with the care and benefits they deserve   Reports conducted by these two commissions represented at today s hearingemphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to reforming our veterans health care and benefits system  including a reduction in the veterans claims backlog  a resolution to the concurrent receipt problem that prevents disabled veterans from receiving full retirement and disability pay  a restructured Physical Evaluation System  and improvements to the treatment of mental health disorders  Lincoln has worked on these issues throughout her career and sponsored legislationearlierthis year to address them  These proposals include the following   Disability Claims Backlog  Lincolns proposal to address the growing backlog of pending disability compensation claims was included in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act  2008  which passed the Senate last month  Her legislation provides the Veterans Administration  VA  an additional  70 million to hire additional disability claims processors  employ additional processors for the Board of Veterans Appeals  and provide the one year cost for increased training resources and quality measures for Training and Performance Support Systems and Skills Certification   New disabilities claims have grown by 39 percent from 2000 to 2006  The VA currently has a backlog of nearly 400 000 claims  The average time to process a claim is 177 days  or almost 6 months  Waiting time for appeals is even greater  The number of cases received by the Board of Veterans Appeals has grown by 82 5 percent since 2001  Next year  the estimated wait for an appeals resolution is expected to increase to 700 days    Concurrent Receipt  Lincolns amendment to help more disabled veterans receive full and immediate concurrent receipt of their disability benefits and pensions was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  which the Senate passed last month  The amendment will allow veterans categorized as 100  unemployable due to a service connected disability to receive their full disability pay and retirement pay immediately   Under legislation adopted by Congress more than a century ago  the pension of a disabled soldier is reduced by the amount of that soldiers disability payment  In 2004  Congress agreed to a ten year phase in of concurrent receipt to all veterans who are 50 to 100 percent disabled  Lincoln said she will continue her fight for full and immediate concurrent receipt for all disabled veterans  Doing so would extend concurrent receipt to over 400 000 veterans across the nation and would repeal the ten year phase in of benefits for thousands more   Physical Evaluation System and Mental Health Treatment  Earlier this year  Senator Lincoln introduced the Servicemembers Healthcare Benefits and Rehabilitation Act of 2007  which takes steps to correct many of the flaws in the military health care system  This bill would consolidate the Physical Evaluation System by placing the Informal and Formal Physical Evaluation Boards under one command in order to streamline and expedite the process  The legislation would also require all service members who have received orders for deployment to a combat theater to receive a mental health assessment both before and after deployment   The Presidents Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors was created on March 6  2007  by executive order  It was charged with conducting a comprehensive review of the care provided to service members returning from the Global War on Terror   The Veterans Disability Benefits Commission was established by Congress in 2004  It conducted a two and a half year study of the benefits and services available to veterans  service members  their survivors  and their families   Approximately 268 000 veterans reside in Arkansas  It is estimated that nearly 99 000 people receive health care from the VA in Arkansas each year
