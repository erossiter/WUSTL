         Lincoln Steps Up Fight to Improve Children s Health Care  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 19  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington  Continuing her fight on behalf of Americas working families  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today announced a significant legislative victory for her initiatives to help improve the quality of health care for children and pregnant women   Lincolns proposals were included in the Senate Finance Committees bill to renew and improve the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   Known in Arkansas as ARKids First  this joint federal state partnership has been enormously successful in providing health care coverage to more than 6 million uninsured children across the country  The full Senate is expected to consider the legislation reauthorizing SCHIP  which expires in September  as early as next week    Health insurance coverage is critical to the lifelong health of a child and to a familys peace of mind  Lincoln said  That peace of mind should belong not only to those families who can afford private health insurance but also to the working families who are struggling to provide for their children   Lincoln was successful in her efforts to include a proposal that seeks to lower the number of premature births in this country by improving access to health coverage for pregnant women  Every year  more than 500 000 infants are born prematurely  and this problem is on the rise across the nation with one out of every eight babies now born prematurely  In 2004  more than 13 percent of births in Arkansas were premature ranking Arkansas among the states with the highest incidence of preterm births  Lincoln has called maternity care vital to the health of both mothers and infants and said it can reduce future health care costs    Dr  Jennifer L  Howse  President of the March of Dimes  said the SCHIP agreement gives states the option to cover low income pregnant women without having to obtain a federal waiver  Providing the full spectrum of maternity coverage  prenatal through post partum care  improves the likelihood that problem pregnancies can be managed successfully and that the risk of a poor birth outcome is significantly reduced   In addition  Lincoln worked to include an amendment to help improve care given to high risk infants in order to assure their optimal growth and development and to prevent re hospitalization in the first year of life  Lincolns amendment would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report on the development of measures that promote healthy birth and reduce the rate of premature birth   Another Lincoln provision included in the SCHIP agreement would provide the explicit federal authority and resources   45 million over five years  to invest in the development and testing of quality measures for childrens health care  Currently  most private and public support for health care quality improvement is focused on care given to adults  not children  Lincolns measure would help close the gap between the federal governments investment in pediatric health care and health care for adults   Finally  Lincolns initiative to help fund the expansion of SCHIP by taxing tobacco products known as small cigars at the same rate as cigarettes was also included in the Finance Committee bill   Although weve made great strides in recent years to combat youth cigarette smoking  a few in the tobacco industry have found a loophole which allows them to classify certain cigarettes as small cigars thereby avoiding higher cigarette taxes that have been implemented  at least in part  to deter children from smoking  Lincoln said  Research shows that increased tobacco product pricing reduces smoking among children  We must ensure that our laws intended to protect public health are not being circumvented  and this provision closes that loophole   Lincoln cosponsored additional amendments to the SCHIP bill  including the   Express Lane amendment  provides states the option to use income eligibility information from other federal programs  such as school lunch programs  to speed the enrollment of eligible children into SCHIP or Medicaid  and   Mental and dental health amendments  expands the mental and dental health care provided tothousands of children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP   The overall SCHIP bill includes an additional  35 billion   60 billion in total funding  over five years  preserving coverage for the 6 6 million children currently enrolled  including those who would have lost coverage without this investment  and will reach an estimated 3 2 million additional uninsured  low income American children    As a result of federal funding and other initiatives  Arkansas has been a national leader in reducing the number of uninsured children in our state  from over 20 percent in 1997 to 10 percent today  Now  nearly 65 000 of Arkansass children receive coverage through SCHIP
