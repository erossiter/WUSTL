Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Growing up the son of a hardrock miner in tiny Searchlight  Nevada  and the daughter of a rice farmer in Helena  Arkansas  shaped our love for rural America   That love and respect for rural values and the rural way of life motivates us to support small town communities in any way we can       There are a lot of myths about America   s rural communities  but none of them are bigger than the one about Red States and Blue States  This is the myth that suggests Republicans love and respect rural America more than Democrats   Nothing could be further from the truth       While final tallies showed that the majority of rural Americans supported President Bush in both of his elections   the current state of rural America today suggests he forgets about farmers and other rural Americans when he goes back to Washington  DC  The fact is  from higher energy prices to crumbling schools  rural America is suffering from neglect      Look at our economy  We have economic policies that give large tax breaks to multi millionaires  but have ordinary families working harder and saving less       Look at health care  At the President   s urging  the Republican controlled Congress obediently cut  137 million from rural health programs   And  the Bush Administration   s mismanagement of the Medicare prescription drug program has unnecessarily left poor seniors and rural pharmacies in crisis since January 2      Look at our energy policy  Last year  this policy helped Big Energy companies make  100 billion in profits  but in 2004  it forced farmers to spend nearly  30 billion more for natural gas  diesel and gasoline than they did in 2002     We believe it   s time for our government to get its priorities straight  and for everyone in Washington to renew their commitment to putting progress ahead of politics  Unfortunately  we didn   t hear anything in the President   s State of the Union Address that suggests he shares our commitment        Instead of making farmers pay for our dependence on foreign oil  we believe it   s time they were paid to make America energy independent  That   s why we have unveiled our vision to make America energy independent in the next 15 years  Our vision relies on the know how of America   s scientists and the growing capacity of America   s farms to fuel a more stable and sustainable energy future with biodiesel  ethanol  windpower  biomass resources and other forms of renewable energy         In addition to energy  the President talked to Americans about the health care crisis Tuesday night  Unfortunately  his main solution     Health Savings Accounts     will provide a windfall to the financial services industry  but do nothing to help average Americans         Here   s what the President is asking Americans to do  pay more for less  His plan is not a credible solution for most Americans  and it certainly won   t work in rural America  where citizens have less services and health facilities to choose from       Instead of unrealistic solutions  we should be finding ways to help Americans get the health care they need  In rural America  that means closing the technology gap and encouraging the use of telemedicine  which uses the latest technology to link residents in remote communities with the best doctors  anywhere in the world     A third issue Americans heard the president talk about was education  It just was not credible to hear this president talk about strengthening our schools  when his main policy        No Child Left Behind        has been under funded by his budgets for the last four years and has left behind children all over America      Many rural school districts have difficulty finding and keeping qualified teachers     and when they do  these teachers often must teach multiple subjects  It was nice to hear the President   s plan to train 100 000 new teachers in math and science  but we can   t forget to do something about rural districts that are still understaffed in the basics      Another challenge rural schools face is transportation  In some rural counties  school buses travel a million miles in a year  The buses wear out quickly  but school districts do not always have the money to replace them  Instead of shortchanging our rural schools  we need to give them the tools they need to meet the incredible challenge of educating our students   The President must work to address all the needs of rural school districts  including transportation needs       The facts are clear   President Bush   s policies have put a terrible strain on rural America   We believe that our leaders in Washington should be working together on some of the solutions we   ve mentioned   All it takes is commitment to put people  not politics and special interests  first       Honest leadership isn   t a partisan goal   It is the key to a stronger union  When leaders work together in a bipartisan manner  our government can make a difference for all Americans  not special interests and a well connected few   We believe that America can do better
