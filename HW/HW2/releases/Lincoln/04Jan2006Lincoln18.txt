Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Senator contacts Bush Administration on behalf of seniors and pharmacists across Arkansas NATIONAL CALL BETWEEN CMS AND PHARMACISTS TO OCCUR THURSDAY Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today contacted the top Bush Administration official in charge of the nation   s new Medicare prescription drug program to determine why so many low income seniors have encountered problems when trying to fill their prescriptions at local pharmacies this week     After hearing from a number of concerned Arkansans  Lincoln called Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  Administrator Mark McClellan to demand answers  Lincoln said that CMS will host a national phone call with pharmacists tomorrow  Thursday  January 5th  2006  to address concerns with the program  Lincoln said the phone call is open to all pharmacists in Arkansas and nationwide and the following are details for that call      What  National call with Larry Kocot of CMS and interested Arkansas Pharmacists    When  Thursday  January  5th  2006  11 00 a m  Central time    How interested Pharmacists can Participate Call toll free 1 800 798 2796 to join call  when prompted  enter code 51906156  All the confusion and uncertainty that pharmacists and seniors are experiencing today was predictable and the Administration has no one to blame but themselves   Lincoln said   The tragedy is that some seniors may not obtain life preserving prescriptions while this mess is straightened out      Lincoln said all of the problems that have occurred could have been avoided if Republicans had not blocked a crucial amendment she cosponsored during federal budget debates last month  Lincoln   s bill would have added six months to the transition period to ensure that pharmacists are reimbursed under Medicaid until each eligible senior is assigned to a new drug plan under Medicare  Her amendment was uniformly opposed by Republicans in the Finance Committee and during budget debates on the Senate floor last month     As of January 1  2006  seniors who were eligible for prescription drug coverage under Medicaid were transferred to a new prescription drug plan under Medicare  However  a mere six week transition period did not allow enough time for the change for 6 2 million people  Lincoln said CMS is reporting numerous computer glitches in the transition of these seniors from Medicaid to Medicare  but she called the problem entirely predictable       It is not enough to say that    we are working on the problem      she said   The urgency of this situation cannot be underestimated      Most large  private employers allocate at least six months to transition their employees    drug coverage from one pharmacy benefit management company to another  Dual eligible seniors were given only six weeks      Lincoln fought for automatic enrollment when the Administration originally planned to honor only those seniors who voluntarily enrolled in a plan  However  many low income seniors are hard to reach and some are not aware that their coverage has changed until they visit their local pharmacy  In addition  some seniors who were automatically enrolled in a prescription drug plan have switched to another drug plan  and the CMS computer system does not reflect that change      Lincoln said instances are too numerous to count where seniors whose Medicaid coverage stopped on January 1 are not currently recorded in the Medicare computer system  Efforts to verify their coverage by phone are usually unsuccessful because the phone lines at CMS and at the drug insurance plans are jammed     Those low income seniors who did not voluntarily select a Medicare coverage plan during the sign up period were to be automatically enrolled in a plan by January 1  They were supposed to receive letters notifying them of the change  Seniors who received prescription drug coverage under Medicaid and are automatically eligible for Medicare coverage are referred to as  dual eligible       Arkansas has approximately 60 000 low income seniors that qualify as  dual eligibles   She said pharmacists are faced with no good options in cases where there is no record of Medicare coverage for dual eligible seniors   Either they honor the prescription on faith or turn some of our most vulnerable citizens away   Lincoln said     Last October  Lincoln conducted information forums before packed houses in eight cities across Arkansas in an effort to publicize the sign up period which began on November 15  2005  Almost 3 000 seniors attended the meetings
