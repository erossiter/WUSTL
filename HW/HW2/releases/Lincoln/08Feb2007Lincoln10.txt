                    Lincoln  Bill to Restore Fair Process Moves One Step Closer                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln  Bill to Restore Fair Process Moves One Step Closer  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 08  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   released the following statement upon the Senate Judiciary Committee s passage of a bill which would eliminate a provision in the Patriot Act  Currently  a specific Patriot Act measure gives the U S  Attorney General the power to fill U S  attorney vacancies with indefinite appointments  The Judiciary Committee Tuesday approved an amended version of legislation Lincoln cosponsored  which would allow the Attorney General to appoint an interim U S  attorney for 120 days  not indefinitely  If after that time an individual has not been nominated and confirmed by the Senate  the district court would appoint an interim U S  attorney   With the abrupt dismissal of Bud Cummins and the use of an unnecessary  interim appointment of Tim Griffin as U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas  we have seen the circumvention of the Patriot Act as it was intended   Lincoln said   The Patriot Act provision was instituted to give the Administration a tool to fill vacancies in a time of emergency  Clearly  this was not the situation in Arkansas and in other states where it has occurred  It is unfortunate that the Bush Administration used this provision against its original intent and denied the people of Arkansas a transparent nominating process  I am pleased by the steps made today to rebuild the American people s trust in their public servants
