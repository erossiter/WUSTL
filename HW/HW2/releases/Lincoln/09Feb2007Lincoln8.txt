                    Lincoln s Rural Report Card  Bush Budget Fails Rural America                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln s Rural Report Card  Bush Budget Fails Rural America  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 09  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington    U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today said President Bush s FY 2008 budget request to Congress does not reflect a strong commitment to the people of rural America      Lincoln  Chair of Rural Outreach for the Senate Democratic Caucus  released her third annual report analyzing the impact of the President s budget proposals on rural America  Lincoln s  Rural Report Card  highlights seven areas where the President plans to cut deep into programs important to the quality of life in rural America  health care  education  law enforcement  economic development  agriculture  Social Security  and veterans      Unfortunately  the President has once again sent Congress a budget which relies too heavily on working families and small businesses in rural America to make sacrifices  while at the same time he continues to push for permanent tax cuts for the ultra wealthy   Lincoln said   Reducing our record deficits is a goal we all share  but it should not rest disproportionately on the backs of those living in rural America  By forcing some to shoulder this national burden and not others  this budget reflects at best an unfair and misguided approach to our spending priorities and at worst a real neglect of rural America      Lincoln s  Rural Report Card  focuses on seven areas where President Bush s budget cuts deep into rural America  including     1  RURAL HEALTH CARE Lincoln said that overall  the Rural Health Programs budget would receive an 87 percent cut  representing  104 million  in funding under the President s proposal  down to  17 million  Further  the President s budget would eliminate funding for 21 important rural health programs  including the Area Health Education Centers  AHECs  which provide vital health care and education services to rural areas  Arkansas has six AHECs which provide medical care to almost 160 000 individuals each year       Lincoln said the elimination of resources like the Geriatric Education Centers will hurt rural communities in particular because they already face a lack of qualified health care providers  The Geriatric Education Centers have trained approximately 9 200 health professionals in geriatrics in Arkansas  Lincoln said that our nation s health care system will face an unprecedented strain as our population grows older  and geriatricians will be in great need  At present  our nation is simply ill prepared and faces alarming shortages among geriatricians     In addition  Lincoln pointed to the elimination of the Alzheimer s Disease Matching Grants to States Program   Currently  more than 56 000 Arkansans live with Alzheimer s disease  That number will grow to 76 000 by 2025  Lincoln said this federal program is necessary to ensuring that the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer s and their caregivers are being met     Arkansas would lose  500 576 if the Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant Program is eliminated  This program supports hospitals with 25 beds or fewer and serves 28 critical access hospitals in Arkansas      Arkansas would lose  294 822 if the  Small Rural Hospital Performance Improvement Grant Program  SHIP  is eliminated  Thirty three hospitals in Arkansas who participate in SHIP would lose this federal support     The  20 million proposed cuts in Senior Nutrition programs  would result in approximately 100 000 fewer meals to elderly Arkansans  most of whom live in rural communities     Medicare   Medicaid  The President s budget includes  78 billion in Medicare and Medicaid cuts and billions in new premiums  endangering the ability of Arkansas  464 000 Medicare patients to obtain the care they need to lead healthy  independent lives  The President s budget proposes to reduce spending for Medicare and Medicaid by about  100 billion over five years  In doing so  the President proposes saving  13 7 billion over five years from legislative changes to Medicaid that are largely considered a cost shift to states  The President also proposes  12 7 billion in regulatory changes to Medicaid  These changes will add new administrative burdens to states and providers  affect the state s ability to reimburse providers  undermine access to school based services  and undermine the quality of physician education     State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   The President s Budget proposes increasing funding for SCHIP by about  5 billion over the next five years in SCHIP reauthorization  It is unclear at this point whether these funds are new or redistributed from other sources  including savings from Medicaid or redistributed SCHIP allotments  The  5 billion amount is only about one third of the amount states are estimated to require over the next five years to maintain access to services for those now covered under SCHIP  Lincoln said further cuts will undermine a program critical to raising healthy and economically secure children and risk adding to the ranks of Arkansas s nearly 68 000 uninsured kids     Hospitals  Lincoln said the President s proposed cuts to hospitals are estimated to cost Arkansas providers  730 million over five years     Nursing Homes  Lincoln said the President s proposed cuts to nursing homes are estimated to cost Arkansas providers  6 million in 2008      Home Health   Lincoln said the President s proposed cuts in home health payments would cost Arkansas providers approximately  89 53 million over the next 10 years      Hospice  Lincoln said the President s plans to cut hospice payments would cost Arkansas providers approximately  11 6 million in hospice payments over five years     2  EDUCATION Lincoln said the President s budget proposal would cut U S  Department of Education discretionary funding by  1 5 billion  or 2 6 percent  from last fiscal year s level  Overall  the President s budget would eliminate 44 federal education programs  including Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  education technology state grants  arts in education programs  and school counseling  The budget proposal includes large cuts to numerous other programs including career and technical education and safe and drug free schools state grants     No Child Left Behind  NCLB   The President s budget under funds NCLB by  14 8 billion  for a cumulative shortfall of  70 9 billion since enactment of the law      After School Programs  The President s budget leaves behind 2 million students who would receive after school services if the program were funded at the level promised last year in NCLB  Lincoln said this could mean that more than 19 000 Arkansas children could be denied after school services      Career and Tech Education  The President s budget proposes a  687 million reduction in funding for career and technical education programs  This will result in a potential loss of approximately  14 million for Arkansas  As a result of this cut  thousands of secondary and post secondary students  as well as more than 2 million students enrolled in Tech Prep programs  could see their courses reduced or eliminated     Head Start  The budget would cut Head Start by  100 million  Since 2002  the Head Start program has been underfunded by  6 79 billion  The President s budget will result in cuts  in hours  transportation  and educational instruction  that threaten the quality of the program  The program currently only serves about one half of the children eligible for the pre school program  much fewer in Early Head Start     Higher Education  The President s budget again freezes funds for key college programs like work study and zeroes out Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  SEOG   In 2006  Arkansas received  7 5 million in federal college work study funds and  4 9 million in SEOG grants  As tuition and fees increase at state colleges and universities  the administration s cuts in student aid will put higher education further out of reach from many Arkansas students      Perkins Grants  These funds are used to serve students in traditional high schools  vocational technical high schools  and in post secondary institutions providing technical programs such as community colleges  technical institutes  skill centers and other public and private two  and four year colleges  The President s budget would result in an estimated  7 092 053 cut for Arkansas students     Special Education  For the third year in a row  the President has proposed cuts for special education  The President proposes to cut  291 million for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA   which requires public schools to offer special education programs for students with special needs  This would provide just 16 5 percent of the average per pupil cost   the lowest percentage level of support since FY 2002  The federal government s commitment to states is 40 percent of total funding     The President also plans to reduce Medicaid based reimbursements related to services for special education students by  615 million in FY 2008 and  3 645 billion over the next five years  Together with the proposed cut in IDEA State Grants  this amounts to more than  900 million less in FY 2008 for schools to serve students with disabilities     3  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   HOUSING Lincoln said the President s budget would once again cut economic initiatives relied on by Arkansas  rural communities      Economic Development Administration  EDA   The President s budget would eliminate the EDA Public Work programs  Since 2001  EDA Public Works programs have invested in 31 Arkansas projects for a total of  40 5 million  That investment has leveraged more than  1 4 billion in local and private investment and has created or saved 8 807 jobs in Arkansas      Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program   CDBG is once again on the President s chopping block  Lincoln said  The CDBG program is a signature program for Arkansas  cities  counties and local communities to create jobs  spur economic development and small business opportunities  and expand home ownership  Arkansas  CDBG funding would be reduced by  8 1 million from its 2006 funding level of  27 7 million      Lincoln said that by cutting CDBG  the President s budget would undermine the economic well being of Arkansas  communities and the future generations that live there  This move would directly impact the 14 cities that receive CDBG funds  cities include  Bentonville  Conway  Fort Smith  Jonesboro  Rogers  Texarkana  Fayetteville  Hot Springs  Jacksonville  Little Rock  North Little Rock  Pine Bluff  Springdale  and West Memphis   CDBG funds have been used for a variety of projects in Arkansas  including senior citizen centers  public health facilities  childcare facilities  affordable housing rehabilitation and construction projects  and rural fire stations     USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant Program  RBEG  and Rural Business Opportunity Grants  RBOG    President Bush proposes to eliminate these programs which help emerging businesses grow and develop  Arkansas has benefitted from the RBEG program and stands to lose millions in economic development dollars if this program is eliminated  Lincoln pointed to Arkansas based Winrock International  an international non profit corporation  which uses RBEG funding to assist businesses throughout the state  Winrock has assisted over 2 825 Arkansas businesses over the last 10 years using RBEG funding      USDA Rural Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Community Grants  The President provides no funding for these grants in this fiscal year s budget  The goal of these grants is to help revitalize rural communities by attracting private investment to these areas  Lincoln noted two  Rural Enterprise Communities  in Arkansas   East Arkansas and Mississippi County  Together  these Rural Enterprise Communities cover approximately 1 500 square miles in five counties in the Arkansas Delta  Mississippi  Cross  Lee  Monroe  and St  Francis counties  with extreme levels of poverty      Elderly and Disabled Housing Programs  The President proposes to cut federal dollars for elderly housing by nearly a quarter and housing for the disabled by nearly half  Lincoln said that in 2006  Arkansas grantees received a total  7 2 million in elderly and disabled housing grants to fund the construction of 33 affordable housing units for the elderly and disabled in Little Rock and Monticello      4  RURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT First Responders  The President s budget includes a 50 percent cut  totaling approximately  1 7 billion below the 2007 level adjusted for inflation  in first responders funding  Arkansas  state formula grants would be funded at  187 million  a cut of  348 million below the inflation adjusted 2007 level  Lincoln said these cuts would hinder critical state and local efforts to protect our communities by making less funding available for the preparedness of first responders and citizens  public health  infrastructure security and other public safety activities  Lincoln said she was particularly concerned with how these cuts would effect the amount of federal Homeland Security funding provided to small and rural states such as Arkansas      Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program  Last year  Congress saved this important law enforcement program after the President proposed to eliminate it  In this year s budget  the President proposes to fundamentally restructure the program into a competitive grant system  The President proposes  350 million for the program this year  a cut of  170 million below the last fiscal year s funding level  Lincoln said she was deeply concerned about how changing the program from formula funding  which guarantees assistance to all states  to a competitive process that favors large  urban communities could affect small  rural states like Arkansas     Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS   The President s budget cuts  510 million from last fiscal year s funding of the COPS program  The President s budget allows for only  32 million for this critical program which are important to law enforcement agencies throughout rural America  In 2006  the COPS program awarded  63 million in grants to rural communities across the country to fight the growing methamphetamine problem  Since Congress created this successful initiative with Lincoln s support in 1994  the COPS program has assisted Arkansas law enforcement agencies in reducing violent crime across the state  In doing so  it has helped counties throughout Arkansas hire additional officers for community policing and homeland security activities by helping provide for their salaries and benefits     5  AGRICULTURE Lincoln said the President s Farm Bill proposals and his budget request for the U S  Department of Agriculture could disproportionately impact Arkansas  farm families  Specifically  the President proposes elimination of the  three entity rule  and tighter eligibility restrictions for farm programs  Additionally  the President proposes to ultimately lower the marketing loan rates for some commodities and modify the counter cyclical program  Lincoln is concerned that these proposals would weaken the safety net for southern producers      Food Stamps  The President s budget would eliminate food stamp eligibility for individuals and working families with children who are low income but not receiving certain Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits  The Congressional Budget Office estimates this change would eliminate food stamp eligibility for approximately 225 000 individuals nationwide  Over 372 000 Arkansans currently receive food stamp benefits      6  SOCIAL SECURITY S IMPACT ON RURAL AMERICA Lincoln noted that once again  President Bush has included a Social Security privatization plan in his budget that  if enacted  would result in millions of middle income workers receiving little or no Social Security benefits in retirement  Lincoln said that 380 000 beneficiaries in Arkansas could be subject to an annual benefit cut of  6 319 under the President s private account plan  according to an analysis by the House Ways and Means Committee     Lincoln said privatizing Social Security would have a devastating effect on a rural state like Arkansas  where 58 000 seniors live in poverty  Seniors who live in rural areas are disproportionately low income and thus are more dependent on Social Security  Rural Americans also have a greater need for Social Security s disability safety net  Due to the physical nature of their jobs  it is more likely that they will need either disability benefits or early retirement benefits      7  VETERANS Lincoln pointed to the fact that the highest concentration of military veterans live in rural communities  yet the President s budget falls short of meeting its commitment to these brave service men and women  The President s budget proposes a six percent increase over last fiscal year s funding level  short of the 13 14 percent the Veterans Administration has testified it needs to meet the demands from a growing number of troops returning home from military service overseas and the rising cost of health care      Under the President s VA budget  much of his proposed increase will be paid for with new enrollment fees that will force many middle income veterans to pay substantially more for their care  These three tiered enrollment fees   250   500 or  750 depending on family income  would be imposed upon approximately 30 000 veterans in Arkansas      The President s budget also calls for almost doubling the cost of prescription drug co payments for our nation s veterans from  8 to  15  Additionally  it would attempt to freeze enrollment for thousands of middle class veterans that would prevent them access to VA hospitals  clinics and medications  This provision would affect approximately 260 000 veterans across the country  and 7 363 from Arkansas     Lincoln said that while our veterans have sacrificed so greatly on our behalf  the least a grateful nation can do is provide them the quality care and assistance they need after they return home  Lincoln said the VA needs adequate resources to address such problems as the increasingly long waiting lists for VA hospital appointments  the unnecessarily long benefits applications process  and the delay of concurrent payment of military retirement and pension benefits for disabled veterans
