                    Lincoln Introduces Bill to Address Nursing Shortage                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln Introduces Bill to Address Nursing Shortage  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 18  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843  Washington  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   recently introduced legislation that would help address Americas growing nursing shortage and would focus on training more geriatric nurses  Lincolns bill  the Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act of 2007  would provide grants to nursing schools to help increase enrollment and graduation from nursing doctoral programs  The bill would also establish the Geriatric Academic Career Awards program to promote the career development of geriatric nurse faculty  In order to address our nations nursing shortage  we must first address the low number of faculty  said Lincoln  Across the country  nursing programs are turning away qualified applicants simply because they do not have enough faculty to teach them  This bill will increase the number of nurses who complete nursing doctoral programs and seek employment as faculty members and nursing leaders in academic institutions  As the average age of the workforce is nearing retirement  the nationwide nursing shortage is growing rapidly  A 2006 Health Resources and Services Administration report estimated that the national nursing shortage would more than triple  to more than one million nurses  by the year 2020  The report also predicts that all 50 states will experience nursing shortages by 2015   Lincoln was instrumental in crafting a section of the bill that establishes a program to provide Geriatric Academic Career Awards to promote the career development of geriatric nurse faculty   Less than one percent of practicing nurses have a certification in geriatrics and three percent of advance practice nurses specialize in geriatrics  Research indicates that older persons receiving care from nurses trained in geriatrics are less frequently readmitted to hospitals or transferred from nursing facilities to hospitals than those who did not receive care from a nurse trained in geriatrics   The shortage of nurses with geriatric training is especially critical  said Lincoln  Many of our older adults have multiple health conditions that can be better treated by professionals with advanced training in geriatrics  This program will encourage nurses to specialize in helping our aging population  Lincolns bill also authorizes a distance education pilot program to improve access to educational opportunities for nursing and physical therapy students  Finally  the legislation calls for a study by the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences which will recommend how to balance education  labor  and immigration policies to meet the demand for qualified nurses and physical therapists  The Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act of 2007 is cosponsored by Senators Jeff Bingaman  D N M    Norm Coleman  R Minn   and Ben Nelson  D Neb
