Immediate Passage of Emergency Relief Package                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 27  2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     In an impassioned debate on the floor of the U S  Senate last night  Senator Blanche Lincoln demanded that the Senate take immediate action to pass a much needed emergency health care relief package to help those who have been affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita         Earlier this month  Lincoln introduced the    Emergency Health Care Relief Act of 2005     which has the bipartisan support of the Senate Finance Committee   s top two ranking members  Chairman Charles Grassley  R Iowa  and Ranking Member Max Baucus  D Mont     Lincoln said she introduced the emergency package to address the national health care crisis created by Hurricane Katrina   She said her measure would help the hundreds of thousands of people that were displaced by the storm and as a result  have placed excessive demands on our health care system               Last night in an impassioned debate on the Senate floor  Lincoln said that now is the time to ensure that hurricane survivors have quick access to health care  and to ensure that states have the peace of mind to know that they will not be shouldering the financial burden alone   The following is a complete transcript Lincoln s remarks on the Senate floor last night which followed speeches by Senators Grassley and Baucus  and Senator John Ensign  R NV       Mrs  LINCOLN  If the Senator from Nevada is worried about the dollars FEMA received  why did no one object to that  Why did no one object to the  60 billion being sent to FEMA  which has been so inefficient in the wake of this disaster      Now we are going to ask  as the chairman of the Committee on Finance points out  the disproportionately low income  disproportionately disabled individuals to pay for this      I am here today to speak in support of the Emergency Care Relief Act of 2005 and to compliment the chairman of the Committee on Finance and the ranking member  Senator Baucus  for making this important issue a priority  for working hard and bringing people together to recognize it is not only a natural disaster but a national disaster  We as Americans have to come together to help our neighbors      I find it odd that here we are talking about  8 billion   7 5 billion   8 billion compared to the  60 billion no bid contracts  Maybe my colleagues who want to object to this are willing to jump in and help provide the bipartisan nonpartisan commission we need to review the response to the natural disasters that happened on the gulf coast  Maybe they want to join in saying we need somebody who can review what is going on  not just what happened then but what continues to happen in FEMA      Our Nation s health care providers and States have been there at a time when vulnerable Americans needed them the most  The moment Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast  they jumped into action without being asked  No one asked them to get in their cars and drive to the gulf coast to provide medical care  to get in their helicopters and go rescue those people off those rooftops  States all across the country opened their doors to welcome Katrina survivors  Hospitals sent helicopters to the gulf coast to evacuate those who needed immediate attention  Doctors  nurses  and other health care providers have come together to provide much needed health care to thousands of Katrina survivors  And they did it all with no questions asked  They exemplify what it means to be a good neighbor and what it means to be a part of this American family      Our own Arkansas Children s Hospital is one of the many hospitals around the country that immediately jumped into action to provide health care for Katrina survivors  Even before the worst of the storm hit  they were evacuating young patients to safety  One patient  in particular  was a 9 year old boy  Let me tell you  that hits home with me  I have twin boys who are 9 years old  This young man had a severe heart condition that required a complicated heart pump to be flown in from Germany  Arkansas Children s Hospital evacuated this child from Louisiana  and he received the necessary pump  saving this 9 year old boy s life  Does that mean anything to anybody in this body  It meant something to his parents  And for once  we as a Senate should stand up and take notice      Arkansas Children s Hospital did  And they have already provided  1 7 million in uncompensated care to Katrina survivors      There are health care providers all around the country doing similarly inspiring work  In Arkansas  our pharmacists have been filling prescriptions as fast as they can  paying special attention to those who have chronic conditions or were in the middle of their cancer treatment  Senator Baucus mentioned one of those cancer patients      Hospitals have deployed medical teams to approximately 60 camps and shelters around our great State to address the medical needs of these evacuees  I have always been proud of the people of Arkansas  I have always recognized them as our greatest asset  And I am enormously proud of the countless providers and volunteers in Arkansas and all around this great country who have given their time to make sure that the health care needs of Katrina survivors are met      By passing the Emergency Health Care Relief Act  we in this Senate have the same opportunity to give Katrina survivors  health care providers and States  the relief they so desperately need      We are not talking about walking away and closing the doors  We are talking about a temporary relief for people who jumped in there and provided care  without being asked  without being mandated  but because that is what human beings do when other human beings need that kind of care      Medicaid is our Nation s health care safety net  That is what we are talking about  a safety net for some of the most vulnerable of Americans who have been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster  This crisis has shown just how important this safety net is to our Nation  We need to make sure it does not unravel in the face of this national emergency      Our home State of Arkansas  per capita  has taken in unbelievably disproportionate numbers of evacuees  not because we had to  but we believe that is what it means to be a part of the American family      This place is paralyzed because too few are willing to recognize how important it is to not only reach out to our neighbors but to also follow up and back up those who have been there in these emergencies  to provide the health care needed      I said earlier that it hit home for me  While I was on vacation this summer  one of my 9 year old sons did get sick  I was in a strange State  in a strange town  never been there before  I found a clinic  and I went  I was so grateful  I felt so blessed to have Federal employee health insurance  to be able to access health care for my child while on vacation  Think about the mothers  the fathers  the families  the elderly who find themselves in a strange place  in a church  a makeshift camp out of a church or maybe in a church basement or maybe in some evacuated housing that has been made a makeshift place for the evacuees to stay  What happens to them when they go to get health care  What happens to that provider who has to look them in the eye and say  I don t know where you are going to get health care  That is not what we are about in this country      We talked about billions of dollars we have directed to FEMA  We have talked about tax cuts we provided to low income people who may or may not even know if they can access those tax cuts  But here we are talking about the elemental part of being a good neighbor  a fellow human being  looking to make sure the essentials of providing health care to our brothers and sisters in this country  and we are going to sit here and twiddle our thumbs over red tape  We are going to talk about the possibility of waivers that would cause us to have to petition the devastated States to pay back or to look at these waivers that do not have the funding so we give them a false sense of security so they can provide these services and then find they do not get reimbursed after all      What is our Federal Government for if it is not to provide a safety net at a time such as this  to give peace of mind to the hard working men and women who provide health care day in and day out  I have been to these evacuee camps  I have watched the red tape  I have watched the Red Cross volunteers argue with the volunteering physicians and health care providers on whether they can even give a tetanus shot to somebody who had to swim out of New Orleans      We have an opportunity to stand up and be counted  to provide temporary peace of mind to the medical providers who are reaching out to provide the much needed services to the disproportionately low income  disproportionately disadvantaged and handicapped      I offered an amendment almost 3 weeks ago  As the chairman mentioned  it probably did go a little bit further than what is being talked about here  I am not ashamed of that  But I didn t give away the barn  It was still temporary just to make sure that these evacuees  these fellow Americans  could get the services they need at the most vulnerable time of their lives  I was asked in good faith to withdraw my amendment because nobody wanted to vote against it  Withdraw your amendment and we will work out a good bipartisan deal  Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus did just that      I say to my colleagues who want to object to what we are trying to do  if you have a better answer or you want to say of that  60 billion that every one of us voted for to go to FEMA  maybe you are willing to look to FEMA and make sure that happens   8 billion out of  60 billion is a small piece of the overall pie      I withdrew that amendment in good faith  I hope my colleagues will recognize that we are talking about the American spirit that I hope we produce in the Senate      For a complete transcript of last night   s debate  please contact Drew Goesl in Senator Lincoln s office at  202  224 6436
