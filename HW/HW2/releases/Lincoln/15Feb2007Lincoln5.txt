                    Lincoln Floor Statement on U S  Attorneys Legislation                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln Floor Statement on U S  Attorneys Legislation  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 15  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today submitted the following statement in support of legislation regarding the interim appointment of United States Attorneys for the Congressional Record    Mr  President  I rise today to state my support for the legislation put forward by Senator Feinstein on the interim appointment of United States Attorneys  This legislation represents a compromise between Senator Specter and Senator Feinstein and I commend them for the bipartisan example they have set in addressing this issue       Senator Pryor and I came to this debate because of the interim appointment of a U S  Attorney in Arkansas  but the importance of this issue goes beyond the qualifications of Tim Griffin for that position  The founding fathers created this government around a system of checks and balances  with three co equal branches  As we all know  one of those branches is filled with officials who are not elected  such as Mr  Griffin  The founding fathers knew that if the executive branch was allowed to appoint all of the members of the judiciary without any consultation with the legislative branch  it would make the judiciary branch simply an extension of the executive        What we are talking about today is another in a long line of attempts by this administration to undermine the system of checks and balances by expanding the authority of the executive branch  These abuses of power have almost always related to provisions that are necessary for the smooth operation of government  Of course we need the ability to appoint a U S  Attorney in a time of crisis when Congress is not in session  but do we need that authority extended to a point where a sitting President can make a judicial appointment with no set termination  Absolutely not  The law the administration changed in the Patriot Act was well structured to provide the ability to appoint in times of emergency  while respecting the Senate s role in the process  The compromise put forward by Senators Feinstein and Specter seeks to restore that       The Senate s role in the confirmation process is vital as it provides a second review of the qualifications of a nominee and allows constituents a better opportunity to evaluate a nominee and state their support or opposition  I fear that this effort to diminish the Senate s role in the confirmation process is indicative of this Administration s general attitude toward a vital provision of our Constitution and to the system of checks and balances in general  If given the choice  it would appear that this Administration clearly favors less transparency in government  not more  If allowed to continue  I feel certain that it would result in the average constituent having much greater difficulty getting their voice heard on the appointment of non elected officials  The power of our democracy rests with the people and that is something we must never forget  It is for that reason that I support Senator Feinstein and Senator Specter and urge my colleagues to join with them in order to pass this legislation  Thank you Mr  President
