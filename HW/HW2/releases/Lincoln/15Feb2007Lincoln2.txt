                    Lincoln Leads Bipartisan Legislation     To Modernize Montgomery G I  Bill                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln Leads Bipartisan Legislation     To Modernize Montgomery G I  Bill  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 15  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D AR  and U S  Representative Vic Snyder  D AR   along with original cosponsors Senator Susan Collins  R ME  and Representatives John Boozman  R AR  and Stephanie Herseth  D SD   today introduced legislation that seeks to make adequate and equitable benefits for the Guard and Reserve components of our Armed Forces  The  Total Force G I  Bill  aims to better reflect a comprehensive  total force  concept that ensures members of the Selected Reserve receive educational benefits that match their increased service to the nation          The lawmakers were joined at the announcement by the  Partnership for Veterans  Education   a coalition of military  veterans  and higher education groups who have endorsed the legislation          Members of the Guard and Reserve components of our Armed Forces continue to make an essential contribution to support our missions in Afghanistan  Iraq and elsewhere around the world  Although more than 500 000 of these brave men and women have been called up since September 11  2001  and more than 70 000 have pulled two or more tours of duty  they are denied educational benefits that are commensurate with their service   Despite our nation s increased reliance upon our Selected Reserve  the value of their standard Montgomery G I  Bill  MGIB  benefits has fallen over the last 20 years from 47 percent to 29 percent of Active Duty benefits  In addition  they continue to be the only benefits that members of the Selected Reserve who serve activated duty in the Global War on Terror cannot access once they separate from service           Since the tragic events of September 11  an increasing number of our country s Selected Reserve members have been called upon for activated duty   Lincoln said    Currently  1 756 Arkansas reservists serve on activated duty   Thousands of others have been called to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan   Despite our nation s increased reliance upon our citizen soldiers  their benefits have not increased proportionately with their sacrifice   The Total Force GI Bill is an important step in addressing this inequity for these brave men and women who serve with distinction in hostile environments to defend the freedoms we cherish as Americans           Said HASC Military Personnel Subcommittee Chairman Rep  Vic Snyder   We now have a Total Force  and the Guard and Reserve are no longer just a strategic reserve to be called up in case of a global war  they have become an operational force on whom we rely constantly  It is necessary to modernize the Reserve Montgomery GI Bill to reflect a changing military            Since World War II  the GI bill has provided educational benefits to millions of service members returning from duty   The GI Bill has been a critical tool to help veterans readjust to civilian life   said Senator Collins    But we need to recognize that the role of the National Guard and Reserve has evolved in the years since the September 11th attacks   It is only fair that we allow National Guard and Reserve members who are serving side by side with their active duty colleagues to earn the same GI benefits that all our citizen soldiers deserve            The Guard and Reserve are our friends  neighbors  and co workers  and it is imperative that we do right by them   Boozman said   The current situation is where you have different benefits for the same service  The contribution from our reservists and Guard members is the equivalent of those of our regular military and we need to reward these citizen soldiers as we do their active duty counterparts  I am proud to be working with fellow Arkansans and a bipartisan group in both houses to pass a bill which is as common sense as you can get           Rep  Herseth  Chairwoman of the Veterans  Affairs Economic Opportunity Subcommittee  said   In South Dakota and across the nation  National Guard and Reserve units have served with honor and distinction   This bill will better reflect the reality of today s military and ensure that the enormous contribution and sacrifice of Guard and Reserve servicemembers are more equitably recognized           The Total Force GI Bill would do the following                    Consolidate the Active Duty and Selected Reserve MGIB programs under one authority by transferring them into the jurisdiction of the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Veterans Administration   This would provide a cleaner  simpler arrangement of MGIB benefits that would put an end to inconsistent and inequitable structuring of benefits                      Ensure that Selected Reserve MGIB benefits would rise in proportionality with Active Duty MGIB rate increases   This would help address the growing inequity of benefits between the two                       Provide a 10 year portability for Reserve Educational Assistance Program  REAP  benefits   Unlike Active Duty servicemen  members of the Selected Reserve must forfeit all of these benefits  which are earned on activated duty in the Global War on Terrorism  once they separate from service                     Provide an accruable month per month Active Duty rate for mobilized members of the Selected Reserve   Individuals can accrue Active Duty MGIB benefits up to the maximum allowable in law  36 months at  1 075 per month  currently
