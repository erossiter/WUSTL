Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today proclaimed the Senate passed farm bill a victory for U S  producers and all Americans who rely on the safe food they supply here at home and around the world   This bipartisan bill includes the most significant reform in the history of any farm bill while maintaining the strong safety net relied upon by all American producers  said Lincoln  Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committees Subcommittee on Production  Income Protection and Price Support  I am proud of the investment this bill makes in our countrys nutrition  conservation  rural development  and energy priorities  This farm bill is a victory for the diversity of American agriculture  a victory for all farm families who contribute to the safety and affordability of our food  and a victory for all Americans who rely on that production   The farm bill passed the Senate Friday by a large bipartisan vote of 79 14  the largest vote in favor of a farm bill since 1973  A conference committee of Senators and Representatives is expected to meet early next year to negotiate the differences between the Senate and House farm bills to produce a final piece of legislation to be voted on by both chambers   During debate  Lincoln protected the current safety net relied upon by Southern farmers  Lincoln said the original farm bill written by the Agriculture Committee included a great deal of payment reform  but an amendment to further reduce support payments to Southern row crop farmers would have hindered their ability to compete in a global marketplace and threatened our domestic source of food and fiber  Priorities in the Senate farm bill include the following  Nutrition  The legislation commits at least  4 2 billion for nutrition programs to continue the fight against hunger  Lincoln  co founder of the bipartisan Senate Hunger Caucus  said this represents the largest amount of funding for nutrition programs ever  Lincoln worked closely with several anti hunger organizations in Arkansas while developing the nutrition title of the farm bill   Conservation  The legislation invests an estimated  4 billion in conservation programs  such as the Wetland Reserve Programpopular in Arkansasthat would otherwise expire   Rural Development  The bill provides  400 million to promote economic growth and create jobs in rural communities  This investment will help improve access to broadband in rural America  as well as provide loans to rural hospitals so that they in turn can provide the best care for patients living in rural areas   Energy  The bill provides farmers  ranchers  and small businesses in rural America the support they need to continue their drive toward greater energy efficiency and developing renewable sources of energy   In addition  Lincoln  a long time advocate of renewable fuels  secured incentives for biodiesel and other renewable energy sources in the farm bill  Lincolns tax initiatives  secured through her positions on the tax writing Finance Committee and Agriculture Committee  include the following   Biodiesel incentives  This provision extends tax incentives to encourage the production and use of biodiesel through 2010  Current law calls for these tax incentives to expire at the end of 2008  making it difficult for businesses engaged in biodiesel production to manage their future plans  Lincoln haschampioned biodiesel  a clean burning  biodegradable fuel  as an alternative market for soybean oil  cottonseed oils  and other types of agricultural oils to benefit Arkansass farmers  Lincoln was successful in placing incentives to encourage its production in the 2002 Farm Bill  the 2004 JOBS Act  and the 2005 comprehensive energy bill    Renewable diesel tax credit  This incentive encourages the production of renewable diesel  which potentially has an average carbon dioxide reduction of 50 percent over the lifetime of the product compared to conventional diesel  The increased growth of renewable diesel would help lower demand for oil and increase production of fuel from renewable domestic sources    Timber tax incentive  This provision helps level the playing field for Arkansass family owned timber companies and integrated timber companies that currently suffer from inequity in our tax code  It would create a deduction for qualifying timber gain and modernize Real Estate Investment Trust  REIT  rules for timber property   Lincoln is a cosponsor of two bills that were included as provisions in the farm bill   Food Employment Empowerment and Development Act  FEED   Provides local governments and organizations with funding to carry out food rescue and job training programs  Food rescue programs collect food from restaurants and businesses and turn it into nutritional meals for seniors  children and low income families  These meals are distributed and served at homeless shelters  community and youth centers  children s after school programs and senior citizen facilities  Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Extension Act of 2007  Amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the tax deduction for charitable contributions of food inventory by allowing a fair market valuation of the contributed food and by making such deduction permanent
