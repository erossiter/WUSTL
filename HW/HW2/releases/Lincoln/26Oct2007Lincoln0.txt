2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington DCIn an effort to ensure all veterans receive the educational assistance they deserve  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark  joined withSenatorNorm Coleman  R Minn   todaytointroduce the Veterans Upward Bound Improvement Act  The bill wouldcorrect a provision in current law whichhaspreventedmany National Guard and Reserve troops who have served in post 9 11 contingency operations  such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from qualifying foreducationalservices provided through the Veterans Upward Bound program  By eliminating an arbitrary 180 day service requirement in the current Veterans Upward Bound program  the Veterans Upward Bound Improvement Act rightly recognizes sacrifices of National Guard and Reserve troops contingency service regardless of their time served    As the daughter of a Korean War veteran  I have tremendous respect for the sacrifices made by American soldiers and their families  and I know how important it is for us to provide them the benefits they deserve when they return home  said Lincoln  Our nation is increasingly calling on our citizen soldiers to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  and it is vital that we ensure they are not being shortchanged because of flaws in the benefits system  This bill would allow more of our courageous members of the National Guard and Reserveto accessUpward Bound  a valuable federal program which has expanded educational opportunities for thousands of low income and first generation college students and helped them to reach their full academic potential   Upon their return home from combat  Reserve Component troops and their families often face a myriad of challenges a quality education could help address  said Coleman  Upward Bound is a program that has provided support and guidance to many of our veterans as they have transitioned into institutions of higher education and beyond  It is our responsibility in Congress to ensure that all our veterans  many of whom have served in contingency operations in every corner of the world  qualify for programs like Upward Bound  This bill honors the sacrifice of our returning National Guard and Reserve troops by enhancing their access to this important program and the skills and resources it provides   Over the past few years the U S  has deployed thousands of Reserve and National Guard troops in support of our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  said Julia O Dell  President  National Association of Veterans Upward Bound Project Personnel  It s crucial that we ensure that these troops are given the same educational opportunities as their active duty counterparts  The Veterans Upward Bound Improvement Act sponsored by Senator Coleman  R MN  and Senator Lincoln  D AR  provides an opportunity for these veterans to participate in TRIO Veterans Upward Bound  a valuable educational program that is specifically tailored to the needs of veterans   Our job is to assist veterans in entering and succeeding in post secondary programs including universities  community colleges and technical vocational schools  said Carol Altom  Arkansas Director of Veterans Upward Bound  Although most of our veterans have at least 180 days  there are reservists and National Guard members who fall short of this requirement  They may leave active duty for a number of reasons and although they are entitled to many Department of Defense and VA benefits  such as the Reserve Educational Assistance Program which only requires 90 consecutive days of active duty service  they are not eligible for our program  This bill would allow Veterans Upward Bound to enhance educational benefits already in existence and bridge the gap between VA benefits and Department of Education benefits for veterans   Operating since 1972  Veterans Upward Bound is a federally funded TRIO program that provides veterans with resources to prepare for college entrance  The program offers veterans a variety of courses   free of charge   including  writing  reading  math  science  computer literacy  foreign language  and study skills  Theyalso canreceive career  personal  and financial aid counseling  tutoring  mentorship  enrollment assistance  GED training and text books free of charge  Studentsalso can begin to draw on their Veterans Affairs education benefits while they are enrolled in Upward Bound  Senator Lincoln has ahistory of fighting for our nations veterans  Earlier this year  she introducedthe Total Force GI Bill S 644  which wouldallow Reserve component troopsto access their educational benefits forup to 10 years aftertheir separation from service while also ensuring those benefitsare more commensurate with their increased service  Provisions of the bill have been included inSenate and House versions ofthe 2008 National Defense Authorization Act
