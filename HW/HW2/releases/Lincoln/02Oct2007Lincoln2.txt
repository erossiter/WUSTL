Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Lincolns National Guard  Reserves Proposal Advances  Washington  The United States Senate late Monday passed the National Defense Authorization Act  NDAA   the annual authorizing bill for Department of Defense and military personnel spending  which included several provisions authored by Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark      Lincoln fought to include one of her top legislative priorities on behalf of our countrys citizen soldiers in this years defenseauthorization bill  Originally part of Lincolns Total Force GI Bill  which she introduced with U S  Representative Vic Snyder  the provision would allow members of the National Guard and Reserve who have been called to active duty in Iraq or Afghanistan to use their educational benefits for up to ten years after their service    Currently  active duty service members have up to ten years after their service ends to utilize their educational benefits  while our citizen soldiersthe National Guard and Reservists whom they are fighting alongsidemust forfeit all of the educational benefits they have earned once their service ends  Lincoln said  Our country has come to rely on these citizen soldiers at unprecedented levels  and it is time their benefits better reflect their increased sacrifice  I am proud the U S  Senate has recognized this need   Lincolns proposal has earned the endorsement of more than 40 military  veterans  and higher education groups  including the Military Officers Association of America and the American Legion    In addition  Lincoln helped lead efforts to add several amendments to the NDAA  These provisions include the following   Benefits  Concurrent Receipt  An amendment allowing those categorized as 100 percent unemployable because of their service connected disability to draw full and immediate concurrent receipt of their disability and retirement pay   Survivor Benefits  An amendment providing concurrent receipt of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation  DIC  and Survivor Benefit Plan  SBP  annuity payments for spouses and children of service members killed in action  It would also allow 70 year old military retirees who have paid SBP premiums for at least 30 years to stop paying premiums and retain their coverage  and would advance the full restoration of SBP annuity benefits for those age 62 or older  These are provisions of S 935  the Military Retiree Survivor Benefit Equity Act  which Lincoln cosponsored    Health Care  Disability Rating  An amendment ensuring that once a disability rating is assigned by an informal physical evaluation board  the Secretary of Defense may not reduce such rating upon appeal  It is a provision of S 1682  the Servicemembers Healthcare Benefits and Rehabilitation Enhancement Act of 2007  which Lincoln cosponsored    Mental Health  An amendment placing a temporary moratorium on the use of personality disorder discharges for service members who have already served in combat until it is assured that the process by which the diagnosis is prescribed is absolutely thorough  Since 2001  approximately 22 500 active duty service members have been discharged as Chapter 5 13  a separation because of personality disorder  The Army defines this diagnosis as a pre existing condition  and as such  the veteran does not qualify for VA disability benefits Many veterans advocacy groups fear that the military is using this diagnosis instead of other combat related afflictions  such as PTSD  in order to avail themselves of the financial responsibility of long term treatment    TRICARE  An amendment giving the Secretary of Defense the flexibility to change reimbursement rates for TRICARE  the militarys health care system  if access to mental health services is threatened  The amendment would also require the Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the adequacy of access to mental health services under TRICARE    National Guard and Reserve  TRICARE  An amendment prohibiting increases to TRICARE military health insurance premiums  deductibles  and co payments for one year for those in the National Guard and Reserves who are enrolled in TRICARE  It would also protect beneficiaries from an undue financial burden by ensuring that increases in health care fees cannot exceed the rate of growth of their military pay  It is a provision of S 604  the Military Health Care Protection Act  which Lincoln cosponsored   Retirement  An amendment lowering the retirement eligibility age for members of the National Guard and Reserve  For every 90 days spent deployed  the age 60 threshold is reduced by 90 days  retroactive to September 11  2001    National Guard Empowerment Act  An amendment which empowers the National Guard in Guard related decision making within the Pentagon by  among many provisions  giving the National Guard the ability to budget and purchase equipment related to homeland defense  and offering governors greater input on domestic defense related matters through the National Guard  It would also make the National Guard Bureau Chief the chief advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on National Guard matters  having a straight channel to our most senior defense leadership  These are provisions of S 340  the National Guard Empowerment Act of 2007  which Lincoln cosponsored    Military Operations  MRAPs Funding  An amendment adding  23 6 billion to allow the Army to replace all of its up armored humvees with Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles  MRAPs   Lincoln received an MRAP demonstration during her visit to Iraq in September   Federalism  An amendment which states the Sense of Congress that the U S  should actively support a political settlement among Iraqs factions based upon the provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions  It also calls on the international community to support an Iraqi political settlement based on federalism and to more actively engage in Iraqi assistance and debt relief
