                    Arkansas Delegation Calls on FEMA to Explain Burdensome Levee Certification Policies                                                                              Both                                                    Arkansas Delegation Calls on FEMA to Explain Burdensome Levee Certification Policies  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 05  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington  DC     Today the entire Arkansas delegation  Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor  along with U S  Representatives Marion Berry  AR 01   Vic Snyder  AR 02   Mike Ross  AR 04   and John Boozman  AR 03   sent a letter to David Paulison  Director Under Secretary for the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   asking him to explain what process was put in place to implement a new study to update the Flood Insurance Rate Maps and to also provide a time extension for communities to comply           During the past several weeks  FEMA has requested numerous county  municipal  and levee districts throughout Arkansas to comply with Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations  Section 65 10  44CFR 65 10    If communities can not meet compliance  FEMA has given the following three alternative community options          1  The community can coordinate with the United States Army Corps of Engineers  USACE  about the design and construction certification of a particular levee   2  The community can hire a licensed professional engineer to evaluate and certify the design and construction of the levee  or  3  The community can advise FEMA that certification will not be possible and to proceed with the revised maps with uncertified levees removed from the maps                     FEMA correspondence has made it clear that due to lack of funds the USACE is unable to conduct the extensive certification as requested   In addition  the inspections that it does perform should not be relied upon for levee certification   Therefore  the financial burden for compliance will be placed on the local governing entity   The economic hardships faced by the local community are not only the cost for certification but also the risk of non certification          The letter states          While we all support levee protection and understand the importance for enduring assurances that our levees will continue to meet certain standards  it is also important that these standards be equally applied and the cost is bourne by the appropriate entities    As such  we request that you allow an extension of time for those communities to comply with your requests and that you provide the following information to our offices          1   All details regarding the study to update the Flood Insurance Rate Maps  including  but not limited to  a list of any and all other communities that are a part of the study  including all communities in and outside Region 6   a statement as to whether any other community is being afforded any other alternatives  opportunities  or options as opposed to what is outlined above  and please include time lines for compliance                      2   Whether or not the study applies to FEMA Region 6 only  If so  please explain          3   Please state if  prior to this study  this compliance has been sought in the past and if so  please provide details regarding the manner of certification required by FEMA and please state whether all other communities are subject to the deadlines imposed in Arkansas  and          4  Whether  aside from this study  FEMA has any other national plan for compliance with 44CFR 65 10          The Arkansas delegation looks forward to an answer from FEMA Director David Paulison and will continue to ensure that Arkansas communities are given fair and balanced treatment            A copy of the letter is provided below              Dear Director Paulison          As you are aware  your Agency has initiated a study to update the Flood Insurance Rate Maps in many areas of Arkansas   During the past several weeks your Agency has submitted requests to numerous county  municipal  and levee districts throughout the state requesting compliance with Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations  Section 65 10  44CFR 65 10           As outlined in these requests  the Agency has provided three alternative community options that exist in order to be in compliance  These are               The community can coordinate with the USACE about the design and construction certification of a particular levee          The community can hire a licensed professional engineer to evaluate and certify the design and construction of the levee  or         The community can advise FEMA that certification will not be possible and to proceed with the revised maps with uncertified levees removed from the maps          In addition  your correspondence has made it clear that the USACE maintains that it is both unable to conduct the extensive certification as requested  due to a lack of funds  and that the inspections that it does perform should not be relied upon for levee certification   If this is accurate  then the financial burden for compliance is being placed on the local governing entity   In addition  the economic hardships faced by the local community are not only the cost for certification but also the risk of non certification          While we all support levee protection and understand the importance for enduring assurances that our levees will continue to meet certain standards  it is also important that these standards be equally applied and the cost is bourne by the appropriate entities    As such  we request that you allow an extension of time for those communities to comply with your requests and that you provide the following information to our offices          1   All details regarding the study to update the Flood Insurance Rate Maps  including  but not limited to  a list of any and all other communities that are a part of the study  including all communities in and outside Region 6   a statement as to whether any other community is being afforded any other alternatives  opportunities  or options as opposed to what is outlined above  and please include time lines for compliance          2   Whether or not study applies to FEMA Region 6 only  If so  please explain          3   Please state if  prior to this study  this compliance has been sought in the past and if so  please provide details regarding the manner of certification required by FEMA and please state whether all other communities are subject to the deadlines imposed in Arkansas  and          4  Whether  aside from this study  FEMA has any other national plan for compliance with 44CFR 65 10          We thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter   Please have your staff contact our offices directly   We await your response                Sincerely                      Blanche L  Lincoln                                            Mark Pryor
