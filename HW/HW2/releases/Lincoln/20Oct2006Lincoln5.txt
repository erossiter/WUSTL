attention yet  These are just a few of the experiences that victims of domestic violence encounter everyday in our country      Each October  we pause to draw awareness to this all too common problem in our society  Though our observation of Domestic Violence Awareness occurs during this month  combating this crime requires our efforts throughout the year      Today  domestic abuse remains one of the most serious issues facing the foundation of our communities     the family  The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 32 million Americans  more than 10 percent of the U S  population  are victims to this type of crime and that one in four women will experience domestic abuse in her lifetime  In economic terms the cost of this violence is also staggering and annually exceeds  5 8 billion  including  4 1 billion in direct health care expenses   900 million in lost productivity  and  900 million in lifetime earnings  When considering the costs of direct property loss  ambulance services  police response  pain and suffering  and the cost to the criminal justice process  the total annual cost exceeds  67 billion      Unfortunately  this crime does much more than cost our country financially  There is an incalcuable cost to the families and friends of domestic violence victims  especially the children who are often themselves witnesses to these crimes  These lifelong emotional burdens can not be measured nor are they easily reversed and despite the desire and efforts of many like myself in Congress  we are still not meeting the mental health needs of this country  When left unaddressed  the sad reality is that the emotional trauma experienced by young witnesses of abuse increases the likelihood of they will also carry on this cycle of violence      In the most tragic circumstances  victims and witnesses are not given the chance to recover from abuse  In 2000  1 687 victims had their lives taken by an individual with whom they had placed trust  For Arkansas the number of confirmed domestic violence homicides has escalated each of the last three years  from 15 deaths in 2003  to 18 deaths in 2004  and 26 deaths in 2005  For these victims  we can only remember the time we were able to share with them and the brutal circumstances that took them from us      There is hope  Because these crimes occur within a protected environment for the perpetrator  awareness of this crime and knowledge of assistance programs plays a unique role in combating and eliminating this type of violence  While prevention of the first instance of domestic violence may not be possible at this time  programs are available to intervene and prevent the recurrence and escalation of abuse  Local  state and national programs are currently in place to provide housing and assistance to victims of domestic violence and their children  These programs have saved thousands of lives every year  and their assistance and expertise is a mere phone call away      We must renew our commitment to combating this crime and bring hope and healing to those affected by it  If you are a victim of domestic violence or know some who is  you are not alone  During the first six months of 2006  approximately 3 605 women and 967 children sought and received services from domestic violence shelters in Arkansas by calling the Arkansas Coalition Against Domestic Violence hotline at  800
