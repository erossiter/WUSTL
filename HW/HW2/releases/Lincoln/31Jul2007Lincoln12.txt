                    Lincoln Calls on Senate to Pass Bipartisan Proposal for Children s Health Insurance                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln Calls on Senate to Pass Bipartisan Proposal for Children s Health Insurance  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 31  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today urged her colleagues to support the bipartisan proposal that would deliver health insurance to more than three million additional children while preserving coverage for the 6 6 million already enrolled in the Childrens Health Insurance Program    Calling childrens health insurance an investment in our nations most precious resource  Lincoln urged her fellow Senators to pass the Finance Committees bipartisan compromise that would provide  35 billion in additional funding for CHIP  The proposal passed the Finance Committee earlier this month  Highlights from Lincolns speech delivered today on the Senate floor are below    Health insurance coverage is critical  not only to the lifelong health of a child but also to a familys peace of mind  But that peace of mind should not only belong to those families who can afford private health insurance  it should also belong to the working families who are struggling to make ends meet   The CHIP reauthorization package that was overwhelmingly approved in the Finance Committeeby a vote of 17 to 4applies the lessons of the past 10 years and builds upon the success of the program by giving states more of the tools they need  while preserving their flexibility to strengthen their programs and ultimately cover more kids  In doing so  it would provide an additional  35 billion over five years that will allow states to preserve coverage for the children currently enrolled while reaching an additional 3 2 million uninsured  low income children    We should all agree that providing health care for our children is certainly one area where partisan politics should be placed aside  After all  it is a moral issue    an investment in our nations most precious resource  our children  Who could disagree with that    It is unfortunate that the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services feel differently  In fact  their proposalto increase CHIP funding by only  5 billion over the next five yearsfalls well short of the funding needed to simply maintain coverage for those currently enrolled in the program  To justify their proposal  the Administration actually claimed that the number of uninsured children in our nation was only 20 percent of the estimates calculated by the non partisan Congressional Budget Office    Some of my colleagues have raised concerns about our efforts to expand this successful program  They have argued that the  35 billion compromise that was reached in the Finance Committee is too much money  Well  you know what  Its going to cost more money to cover more kids  And lets take a step back and get some perspective on how much money we are actually talking about  Our current proposal to reauthorize CHIP provides a total of  60 billion over five years 25 billion in the baseline with an increase of  35 billion   In contrast  our operations in Iraq are now estimated to cost taxpayers  10 billion per month  So  for the amount of moneynon budgeted moneythat we now spend in Iraq every six months  we can cover an estimated ten million lower income children with much needed health care for five years  And were talking about money that is completely off set  a program that is completely paid for    How you spend your moneythis goes for families and for governmentstends to reflect your values and your priorities  I ask my colleagues todaywhat could be a bigger priority than the well being of our nations most precious resource  our children
