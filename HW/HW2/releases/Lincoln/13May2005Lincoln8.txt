                                                                                                                                                        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 13  2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843  WASHINGTON D C     U S  Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor  along with Fourth District U S  Representative Mike Ross  Friday reacted to Secretary Rumsfeld s recommendations to the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission  issued in a comprehensive report earlier today  The report which was last issued in 1995 includes the Defense Department s recommendations to close or realign U S  military facilities  All three lawmakers cautioned that today s BRAC report contains recommendations only  which are still subject to approval by the BRAC Commission  President Bush and Congress before becoming law      The report recommends the closure of the Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Ammunition Plant  located near Texarkana  Texas  and that employs hundreds of Southwest Arkansas residents  In fact  according to the Department of the Army  the Red River Depot employs 2 500 directly and 1 676 indirectly  and the Lone Star Ammunition Plant employs 149 directly and 80 indirectly for a grand total of 4 405 jobs      We ve worked extremely hard over the years to strengthen Red River and Lone Star and we re certainly not going to accept these recommendations without a fight   Lincoln said   We re currently in the middle of a war  and it makes no sense to close these two facilities which are providing vital services to aid our men and women in uniform who are stationed abroad  These two facilities support thousands of jobs in Southwest Arkansas and Northeast Texas and are critical to the economic well being of the region  Not to mention that they are strategically located in the center of the country  allowing them to serve a number of bases in a cost effective and timely manner  As the BRAC process moves forward  I look forward to making sure this message is heard loud and clear        I am disappointed that Secretary Rumsfeld has not seen the obvious value and potential of the Red River and Lone Star Army Depot   said Pryor   They provide support and maintenance for some of our most critical weapons systems and vehicles including the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Multiple Launch Rocket System  both of which have been key to our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq       I have talked to BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi and he has agreed to meet with the delegation next week  This is the beginning of a process   the BRAC Commission has until October to revise this list and the President will not certify it until November  In the next few months I will continue to work with my fellow delegation members as we scrutinize the DOD s recommendation and work to make sure the BRAC Commission understands all that Red River and Lone Star have to offer        The Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Ammunition Plant are both vital military facilities   said Ross   The Red River Depot is one of the premier sites in the world for making protective armor for Humvees  I would have hoped that during a time of war  the Department of Defense would have erred on the side of keeping military facilities that provide important functions critical to carrying out our mission in Iraq and that provide important protections for our brave men and women in uniform open       Fortunately  the Defense Department s recommendations for base closures are just what they are   recommendations  This is the first step in a long and lengthy base realignment process  and I will be working closely with Arkansas s congressional delegation  as well as Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison  John Cornyn and Representative Ralph Hall   whose district includes the Red River and Lone Star Depots  and the Texarkana community to fight to keep the Red River Army Depot open  I have already talked with Congressman Hall and Texarkana community leaders  and have pledged to assist them in any way I can concerning this effort  In fact  I will be in Texarkana at 1 30 p m  this Sunday to meet with local officials as we develop a plan to get these military facilities off the list      Despite the report s recommendation today to close the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Ammunition Plant  the state of Arkansas as a whole stands to have a net gain in jobs based on BRAC s recommendations      The three Arkansas lawmakers said that they would pursue all possible options to reverse BRAC s recommendation to close both Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Ammunition Plant  The three vowed to work with the independent BRAC Commission to demonstrate the value of the facilities to our national defense  submit testimony in support of the two facilities throughout the BRAC process  and seek all available alternatives to ensure the long term sustainability of Red River and Lone Star
