                    Honoring Martin Luther King  Jr  Through Community Service                                                                              Both                                                    Honoring Martin Luther King  Jr  Through Community Service  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 12  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  once said that we should not  judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles  but rather by the quality of our service and relationship to humanity       At the age of thirty five  Dr  King became the youngest man to receive the Nobel Peace Prize and when notified of his selection announced that he would turn over the prize money to the furtherance of the civil rights movement he championed  This gesture was demonstrative of the life he led  A life dedicated to lifting up those individuals who are not as fortunate as we are  A life he ultimately gave to advance tolerance and good will toward mankind        Every year since 1994  Arkansans have joined Americans across the country to celebrate the King holiday as a day of community service  I cannot think of a better way to honor Dr  King   s memory than for each of us to dedicate our time  energy and compassion to help our neighbors and give back to our community     As we celebrate his life this month  we should not only remember his legacy of service but also live it out every day  Instead of committing only one day to community service  why not make it two  Or even better  why not sign up as a regular volunteer     By working together  we recognize our similarities and appreciate our diversity  I encourage all Arkansans to search out volunteer opportunities in your communities  There are many wonderful organizations throughout our state performing outstanding work on behalf of children  battered women  and other disadvantaged groups  Check with your church  your neighbors  your friends or your family members to learn of ways you can get involved        You could brighten a child   s day at a Children   s Advocacy Center or help a young woman in crisis at The Florence Crittenden Home in Little Rock  You could even speak up for abused and neglected children in court by becoming a volunteer for the Court Appointed Special Advocates  CASA   You could go to the Department of Defense website  www americasupportsyou mil AmericaSupportsYou send_packages html  to send a care package to the men and women of our nation   s military serving our country bravely overseas  Like Dr  King  the individuals working at these organizations saw a challenge and rose to the occasion  Now it   s up to us     Together  we must rededicate ourselves to Dr  King   s unfinished task     to preserve human and civil rights for all people  no matter their differences  I urge each and every Arkansan to view the King holiday as not just another day off from work or school  but as an opportunity to seek out ways to serve your community throughout the year  As Dr  King said   The true neighbor will risk his position  his prestige  and even his life for the welfare of others       Let   s start the new year with a resolution to discover ways to volunteer and thereby reinforce the community spirit that will help us all build a brighter and stronger future for tomorrow
