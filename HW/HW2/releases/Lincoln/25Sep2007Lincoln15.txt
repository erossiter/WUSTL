2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 WASHINGTON  The U S  Senate has approved legislation that will fund fifteen vitally important water resource projects in Arkansas  members of the Arkansas congressional delegation announced today  The House of Representatives passed this legislation on August 1  The bill now awaits President Bushs signature    The six members of the Arkansas Congressional Delegation who fought for the projects announced today are as follows  Senators Blanche Lincoln  D  and Mark Pryor  D   Representatives Marion Berry  D 1st   Vic Snyder  D 2nd   John Boozman  R 3rd   and Mike Ross  D 4th    With the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007  WRDA   Congress has authorized more than  23 billion for U S  Army Corps of Engineers  Civil Works programs to design  construct  operate and maintain water resource projects across the nation  WRDA has traditionally been used to authorize projects such as dredging  flood control  stream bank erosion  and dam safety   Passage of this legislation is long overdue  Lincoln said  One of the lessons of Hurricane Katrina is the importance of having properly maintained and structurally sound water infrastructure  This legislation will provide funding for projects throughout Arkansas that will assess flood safety  rehabilitate levees  stabilize river banks and channels  and study additional navigation options on our waterways   This legislation provides an important framework for infrastructure projects that promote economic growth in Arkansas  Pryor said  The entire delegation has worked closely  in conjunction state and local community leaders  to address needs that will reduce flood damage  improve navigation systems and enhance environmental protections along Americas waterways  I believe the final product will improve the standard of living in Arkansas and make our state more competitive in regard to commerce   Maintaining the safety and security of our water resources is essential for job growth and development  said Berry  This money will authorize millions of dollars into regions that are in need of assistance for projects such as the expansion of harbor capacities  restoring and rebuilding levees to prevent flood damage  and studying water levels to ensure Arkansans have clean water for drinking and adequate supplies for farming  The Water Development Resources Act can greatly benefit our state and I encourage the President to sign it and help continue economic growth for Arkansas   I am pleased that our state projects within the Water Resources Development Act have all been authorized  said Congressman Snyder  This funding is much needed and Arkansas will greatly benefit from these projects   As Arkansas continues to grow  it is important to do all we can to develop water resources that we can count on in the future  Boozman said  WRDA will raise the standard of living in Arkansas by ensuring clean water for our citizens  protect their homes and businesses from flooding  and increase commerce with new navigation routes  I am proud of the efforts of the Arkansas delegation to work together to ensure these important Arkansas projects remain in the WRDA bill   These projects are vital to the economic well being of numerous communities and businesses throughout South Arkansas  Ross said  I am hopeful that the President will recognize the critical importance of this legislation and sign it into law  so that we can ensure the continued impact of the Ouachita Black Rivers Navigation Project and the McClellan Kerr Arkansas River Navigation Channel   The bill includes the following projects   Cache River Basin In recent years  floods in this area have caused concern  The bill will authorize a feasibility study for flood damage reduction along the Cache River in Grubbs   Des Arc Levee This project will provide for protection of Des Arc from White River floodwaters  The authorized features of the project include an earthen levee  a sewage pump  a storm water pump  two 60 inch culverts with floodgates and a sump area of 92 acre feet   East Arkansas Enterprise Community The East Arkansas Enterprise Community  EAEC  is located in parts of Cross  Lee  Monroe and St  Francis Counties  an economically depressed area in eastern Arkansas  This bill would authorize the Corps to support flood control  drainage and water development projects in the area   Little Red River Irrigation District  The Little Red River Irrigation District includes southern and eastern areas of White County  Arkansas  The project will provide a sustainable water supply for irrigation  fish farming and waterfowl enhancement   Little Rock Port WRDA authorizes a feasibility study concerning dredging and the beneficial use of dredge material at the Little Rock Port  Should the Secretary of the Army find this project feasible  the Corps of Engineers is authorized to carry out the project   May Branch  Fort Smith  AR May Branch flows through a covered conduit within the city limits of Fort Smith and into the Arkansas River  This project would help alleviate flooding in Fort Smith that has caused an estimated  1 7 million in average annual damages    McClellan Kerr Arkansas River Navigation Channel  MKARNS   WRDA authorizes funding to deepen the navigation channel to a minimum depth of 12 feet throughout the navigation channel   Osceola Harbor  AR The bill will authorize the construction of new docks to enhance the ports capability and create new jobs and economic opportunities in an area with high unemployment rates   Pine Mountain  AR The project was initially authorized in the Flood Control Act of 1965  for a dam site at mile 35 7 on Lee Creek 12 miles north of Van Buren  Arkansas  in Crawford County  This bill will authorize construction of a lake for flood control  water supply  recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement   Red Ouachita River Basin Levees WRDA will authorize the Corps of Engineers to reconstruct and stabilize banks along the Ouachita and Black Rivers in Arkansas and Louisiana  This will provide flood control  drainage and power improvements for surrounding counties   St  Francis River Basin Land Transfer  The bill will authorize channel stabilization and sediment removal on the St  Francis River and tributaries  In addition  it will transfer land in the St  Francis Basin from the Corps to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission   White River  Augusta to Clarendon Levee  This project is located along the White River in White and Prairie Counties  The bill will authorize the rehabilitation of levees on the White River between Augusta and Clarendon  AR    White River Basin Comprehensive Study The White River Basin comprises approximately 28 000 square miles in northeastern Arkansas and southern Missouri  This study will identify opportunities to optimize reservoir operations and address water resource needs for water supply  flood control  waste water management  navigation  recreation  power generation  and other water resources related improvements identified in the comprehensive study  The bill authorizes a federal funding level of 75 percent for this study   White River  Operation  Maintenance  General  WRDA will authorize additional scouring and bank stabilization along the White River   The Army Corps of Engineers performs as one of the Army s major commands and is assigned three broad missions  Military Programs  Civil Works  and Support For Others  The Civil Works mission  overseen by the Committee on Environment and Public Works  is established and modified on a regular basis by the Congress through WRDA
