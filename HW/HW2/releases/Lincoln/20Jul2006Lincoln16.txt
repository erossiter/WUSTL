Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today praised the passage of legislation reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965  a historic law which protects the right of every American to participate fully in our democracy       In a speech delivered on the floor of the United States Senate earlier today  Lincoln stressed the need to build on the progress this groundbreaking legislation started in 1965   Lincoln noted that our democracy will only work when those who are governed are able to participate and that many individuals have fought for this right which we take for granted today       The following is the text of Lincoln   s floor speech  as prepared for delivery     I rise today to speak in support of re authorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965   No act has done more to change the course of our nation   s history than this one   And I am pleased to see both sides of the aisle set aside their differences to ensure its passage today      I would first like to offer my thanks to Senators Leahy and Specter for their work in getting this legislation to the floor   I also want to thank Senators Reid and Frist for their efforts in bringing all sides together to renew this historic law     This act protects and preserves our democracy by ensuring that every citizen is given the same opportunity to participate in the political process   Without this assurance  our democracy could not exist     Without the right to participate freely and equally in elections  a citizen   s ability to affect change in his or her community is highly limited      I think that it is important to really remember what we   re voting for today   Men and women not much older than I am made great sacrifices to be able to perform that most basic right of free men and free women     the right to vote       It   s easy to take for granted  but we cannot forget that this document represents the pain and hope of millions of Americans   It represents their efforts and their prayers       The things that we do without giving them much thought were not so for many of our fellow Americans   When we go to eat lunch we sit wherever we like   When we go to the movies we sit wherever we like   When we ride the bus we sit wherever we like   And when we go to the polls we take our ballot and we cast it     It   s easy to forget that it has not always been so   By way of example  the mother of one of my staff members became deeply involved in voter registration as a young college student in the early 60s   She was determined to secure the right to vote for herself and for her community     It was a life or death decision   She and her fellow students were told that if they tried to encourage African Americans in the community to register that they would be killed   They had every reason to take that threat seriously  but it didn   t matter to them       They knew that this right     the right to vote     was worth the cost and they continued to encourage people to register and to vote   By the grace of God no one was killed  but we know that others around the nation were not so lucky       These are the stories that we must remember  and we must ensure that no future generation of Americans will ever have to endure second class citizenship again      As elected officials  we are charged with representing and protecting the interests of our states and our districts   It is of utmost importance that we are elected by a fair representation of our constituents   The Voting Rights Act has played an enormous role in making that happen     Since becoming law in 1965  the number of African Americans and other minority voters who are registered and able to vote has increased dramatically   As an example  my home state of Arkansas saw an increase of more than 33 000 African American registrants immediately after the act was passed        Extending the provisions of this legislation will ensure that we continue to build on the gains we have made since it first passed     We have men and women spread across the globe fighting for democracy and freedom  They are fighting for the right of citizens to hold free elections in which all  regardless of race  gender  or creed  can participate     In many cases  this cannot be achieved without violence  And truth be told we are not so far removed from our own violent past  but  by the mercies of God  we today will extend the blessings of liberty to all Americans with the recording of a vote and the swipe of a pen      And that is a miracle that we dare not forget        Because of what we do today  the men and women who marched and stood still and sat down and stood up and rejoiced and cried and ultimately overcame can be proud that their legacy will be carried on
