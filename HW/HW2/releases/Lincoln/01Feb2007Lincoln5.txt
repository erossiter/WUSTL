                    Lincoln  Administration Farm Bill Proposals Harmful for Southern Agriculture                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln  Administration Farm Bill Proposals Harmful for Southern Agriculture  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 01  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   released the following statement in response to the Bush Administration   s proposals for this year   s farm bill   Yesterday  the Bush Administration released its proposals for the new farm bill  and while I have not had the opportunity to closely scrutinize all 65 of the President s proposals  I do know that many of them could disproportionately impact our Southern growers      The 2002 farm bill provided our farm families and the rural communities who depend on a strong agricultural economy with the safety net they needed  My view remains that we need a strong farm bill in 2007 that looks a lot like the bill we have today  If anything  we need further investment in rural America      We learned a valuable lesson after the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill  which I did not support  about what happens when we roll the dice with the security of our farm economy and assume that high commodity prices are here to stay       The agricultural community has no control over a whole host of variables  from devastating weather conditions to input costs  Our producers also continue to face an uncertain global marketplace with our foreign trading partners supporting their farmers at far higher levels than we do in the United States       Fortunately  Congress will write the next farm bill  not the President  and I plan to use my seat on the Senate Agriculture Committee to provide a strong voice for our producers in Arkansas as we work to reauthorize the farm bill this year
