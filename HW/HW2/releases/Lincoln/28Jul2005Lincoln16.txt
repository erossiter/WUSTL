                                                                                                                                                              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 28  2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   announced today that the final Energy bill contains all of her renewable energy measures and authorizes the federal government to clean up a former nuclear reactor in Northwest Arkansas            This bill is a significant step towards our overall goal of becoming less dependent on foreign sources of energy     Lincoln said      It will encourage the development of our domestic resources to help meet our energy needs and will give our agricultural producers the incentives they need to use alternative forms of clean burning energy  like biodiesel   I   m also pleased to once again secure funding to clean up SEFOR  which has threatened public health and the environment in Northwest Arkansas for too long        The comprehensive energy conference report  the Energy Policy Act of 2005  emerged yesterday from a committee of Senate and House negotiators who forged the final legislation   The bill now enters its final stages and must be approved by the full Senate and House before heading to President Bush to be signed into law      In June  Lincoln worked in the Finance Committee to ensure her package of energy tax incentives included in the tax portion of the Senate Energy bill   She said her measures would encourage the development of alternative fuels  promote more energy efficient consumption  expand access to natural gas  and give our farmers the incentive to turn their agricultural commodities and waste products into renewable fuels  such as biodiesel     Lincoln has fought to enact several of the same measures  or variations of them  for the last three years  but partisan politics has stood in the way of a comprehensive national energy policy   Today is the farthest a comprehensive energy bill has advanced in Congress since that time   Lincoln got the following energy provision in the final Energy bill        SEFOR clean up     Lincoln has worked for six years to secure federal help to clean up the Southwest Experimental Fast Oxide Reactor  SEFOR   a former experimental nuclear reactor located near Strickler in Northwest Arkansas   The site is contaminated with residual radiation  liquid sodium  lead  asbestos  mercury  PCBs  and other environmental contaminants and explosive chemicals   Lincoln   s measure authorizes federal funding to clean up the site  and costs associated with the clean up have been estimated at approximately  16 million      SEFOR was built by the Southwest Atomic Energy Associates  a consortium of investor owned electric utilities  and the U S  Atomic Energy Commission for testing liquid metal fast breeder reactor fuel  SEFOR began operations in 1969 and was permanently shut down in 1972   After the reactor   s useful life  the ownership of the site was transferred to the University of Arkansas   During her six year Senate tenure  Lincoln has maintained that the federal government helped build SEFOR and should thus bear the cost of cleaning up the environmental blight      In addition  Lincoln worked to get the following Energy tax provisions included to promote the development of renewable fuels       Biodiesel incentives  Would extend tax incentives to encourage the production and use of biodiesel through 2008   Biodiesel is a clean burning alternative fuel produced from renewable sources such as soybean  cottonseed  rice oils or animal fats  Lincoln said that farmers in Arkansas and other farm states will benefit from increased production of this environmentally friendly  biodegradable fuel       Energy efficient appliances  Would create tax incentives to encourage appliance manufacturers to produce super energy efficient washing machines  dishwashers and refrigerators   Lincoln said this bill would encourage the development and production of these appliances and allow consumers to benefit from cost and energy savings          Expanded access to natural gas pipelines  Would encourage companies to construct new natural gas delivery pipelines through tax incentives   Lincoln   s legislation would help ensure that more rural Arkansas consumers have access to natural gas to heat their homes and fuel cooking appliances         Renewable Diesel Tax Credit  Would encourage the production of new renewable liquid fuels   This would expand the production of non alcohol based biofuels and allow them to receive the a similar tax credit as those received by traditional biodiesel     Turning landfill gas into energy  Would encourage the production of energy from landfill gas   This legislation would establish tax incentives for the additional collection and use of methane gas generated by decomposing garbage from landfills  which can be developed into energy to fuel clean burning vehicles and power generators to produce electricity              Municipal trash combustion  Would encourage the production of clean  renewable energy from municipal solid waste  while helping communities meet the challenge of trash disposal   This bill would provide tax incentives to produce energy from municipalities    waste and would save valuable land while significantly reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere     Small producer incentives  Would offer incentives to small producers of biodiesel and ethanol   These producers are primarily participants in farmer owned ethanol and biodiesel processing cooperatives   The small producer tax credit would extend tax credits to reflect the growth of these two renewable biofuels  This is the first tax credit ever extended to small producers of biodiesel
