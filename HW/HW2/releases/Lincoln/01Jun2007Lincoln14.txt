                    Making the Dream of Home Ownership a Reality                                                                              Both                                                    Making the Dream of Home Ownership a Reality  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 01  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Home ownership is the pinnacle of the American dream  representing for most families a measure of financial security  independence  and stability  During the housing boom earlier this decade  low interest rates and tax incentives helped make home ownership more widespread  However  for far too many American families  that dream has now become a nightmare  This past April  mortgage lenders foreclosed on 62 percent more homes than in the same period one year ago  There are a variety of factors causing this trend to grow  By far  the biggest problem is that too many people take on more than they can afford  New loan options  like adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs   open up home ownership for more Americans  However  if the housing market stagnates when those type of loans adjust upwards  individuals may find it more difficult to refinance to offset the higher mortgage payments which can cause them to default on their loans  Other loan options  like zero down loans or subprime loans  have also been a blessing and a curse  On one hand  they make home ownership possible for millions of Americans who otherwise would not have the resources to save and purchase a home  On the other hand  these loans require higher interest rates and can be subject to predatory lending and hidden fees by unscrupulous individuals  As policymakers  I believe we should examine lending practices in the subprime market to ensure borrowers are protected against predatory practices  To combat this growing problem  I believe we should take a three pronged approach to create a partnership between individuals  the public sector and the private sector  First  those who need affordable housing must take the initiative and begin educating themselves about ways to access affordable housing  Far too often  individuals are not prepared to take on the responsibility of owning a home because they lack the financial literacy necessary to adequately navigate around pitfalls in the marketplace  Second  the public sector must create opportunities for individuals to expand their knowledge of ways to access affordable housing  We must also help to expand the availability of affordable housing  The mortgage interest deduction and the mortgage insurance deduction are two examples of public policy that Ive worked on through the Senate Finance Committee to encourage and improve access to affordable housing  And thirdly  we must create incentives for private companies to build more affordable housing  These private companies should take advantage of those incentives and increase the affordable housing stock  It isnt just good public policy  its good business  As a policymaker  I will work to encourage public private partnerships that expand the stock of affordable housing  spur economic development  and promote home ownership opportunities  But individuals should work to take personal responsibility and seek out resources to help them make smart decisions about their financial future  It is our hope that as part of the American dream  home ownership is within the grasp of all Americans Home ownership creates safer neighborhoods  improves energy conservation at home  and enhances school districts  It is a good plan for savings  but above all  it is a tremendous part of strengthening our communities  a goal that is important for us all
