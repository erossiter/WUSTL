                                                                                                                                                          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 09  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     President Bush   s FY 2007 budget request to Congress relies disproportionately on cuts to programs that directly affect the quality of life in rural America  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   said today as she released an analysis of the Bush budget     For the second year in a row  Lincoln issued a  Rural Report Card  to illustrate the impact of President Bush s budget cuts from a rural perspective  Later today  Lincoln  the Chair of Rural Outreach for the Senate Democratic Caucus  will lead a Capitol Hill press conference to highlight six areas where she said the President plans to cut deep into rural America  They are  rural education  rural law enforcement  rural health care  agriculture  economic development and Social Security       The President   s annual spending plan would severely cut programs vital to working families  farmers  small businesses and local economies across the heartland   Lincoln said   These are good people who play by the rules and are more than willing to pay their fair share to balance the budget  However  by any measurement  the President   s plan is not fair to rural America  If the President is truly serious about reducing our record deficits  he should propose a plan that asks all Americans to share this burden  Rural America wants desperately to be a part of making our nation the strongest it can be  yet time after time  we see the President letting our small towns dwindle and leaving them behind       Lincoln   s Rural Report Card focused on five areas where President Bush   s budget cuts deep into rural America which include     1  RURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  First Responders  The President   s budget includes a 24 percent cut  totaling approximately  244 million  in first responders funding  Lincoln said these cuts would hinder critical state and local efforts to protect our communities by making less funding available for the preparedness of first responders and citizens  public health  infrastructure security and other public safety activities      Lincoln said she was particularly concerned with how these cuts would affect the amount of federal Homeland Security funding provided to small and rural states such as Arkansas  The President   s budget would further cut the minimum guaranteed funding to states to  1 58 million  down nearly 78 percent from  7 13 million in FY 2006     FIRE Grants  The President   s budget includes a  355 million cut or 56 percent in Firefighter Assistance Grants  Lincoln said this program provides direct assistance for fire departments to better protect firefighters and the public  The President   s budget eliminates funding for the rural fire assistance program in the Department of the Interior  which supports rural fire departments like those in Arkansas  The President also eliminates the state and local fire assistance program  which supports cost shared grants to local and rural fire protection districts that protect small communities     COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES  COPS  Methamphetamine Initiative  This year   s budget requests  40 million  falling short of the  63 million Congress provided for the COPS program last year  Last year  Lincoln fought to increase funding for the COPS Meth program after the President slashed the program   s funding in his budget to  20 million  Her amendment to raise funding for this COPS program from the President   s request of  20 million per year to  52 million per year successfully passed Congress in 2005     Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants   The President recommends elimination of the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Program  Last year  the program provided  2 9 million to 16 Arkansas counties  These funds went to vital law enforcement efforts  such as tracking sex offenders in our state  Lincoln also said that this move by the President would significantly hinder the ability of Arkansas law enforcement to combat the state   s growing meth problem      Lincoln said these law enforcement programs are more important in rural America because in many cases  these funds provide critical assistance rural communities need to keep the people who live there safe     2  RURAL HEALTH CARE Lincoln said that the President wants to eliminate 21 important health programs  which total  1 047 billion  These include nutrition services and preventative health services for seniors  The President plans to eliminate the Preventive Health Services Block Grant  which Arkansas depends on to fund a variety of health care needs state wide  The President also wants to renege on federal support for Area Health Education Centers  which provide vital health care and education services to rural areas  The President targets Children   s Hospitals for a cut of  198 million or 67 percent of last year   s funding  His budget also plans a cut of  94 million or 73 percent of last year   s funding for rural health care programs     Medicare  The President proposes to cut Medicare by  36 billion over 5 years and  105 billion over 10 years  This would come as his Administration  due to under funding and poor planning  has already botched the implementation of a prescription drug plan for seniors under Medicare     Hospitals  Lincoln said the President   s proposed cuts to hospitals are estimated to cost Arkansas providers  360 million over five years     Nursing Homes  Lincoln said the President   s cuts to nursing homes are estimated to cost Arkansas providers  5 7 million in 2007      Home Health  Lincoln said the President   s proposed cuts in home health payments would cost Arkansas providers  3 57 million in the first year   36 million over five years  and  92 2 million over 10 years  These cuts would come on top of the home health cuts in the just passed Deficit Reduction Act  which cut home health spending in Arkansas by  3 78 million over one year  and  20 million over five years  Adding them together  over five years Arkansas stands to lose  56 million in home health payments     Hospice  Lincoln said the President   s plans to cut hospice payments would cost Arkansas providers approximately  5 1 million in hospice payments over five years  Most experts agree this benefit already falls short of the need and a cut would further exacerbate this problem     3  EDUCATION Lincoln said that the President has proposed cutting education funding by  2 1 billion nationwide  which would be the largest cut to federal education funding in the 26 year history of the U S  Department of Education  She said this would hurt rural school districts in Arkansas that rely on federal dollars such as Title I  which is the cornerstone of No Child Left Behind law  The funding is intended to be used specifically for children most at risk of being left behind      Lincoln said the President   s proposed cuts to Title I will affect more than 34 000 Arkansas children  She noted that Arkansas school districts are already struggling to meet the demands of the new No Child Left Behind law  which the President and his allies in Congress have never fully funded  She pointed out that the President   s budget proposed extending the No Child Left Behind law to high schools at the expense of eliminating 42 programs  including all the vocational and technical education programs  education technology state grants  GEAR UP  Safe and Drug Free Schools initiatives  TRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound programs      Title I  The President   s budget only proposes funding Arkansas    program at a little under  124 million  but the No Child Left Behind Law promises that Arkansas would receive  238 million  This under funding means that over 34 000 Arkansas children will be denied promised Title I funding      After School Programs  The President   s budget only proposes funding Arkansas    program at a little more than  9 million when the state should receive over  23 million  Lincoln said this could mean that more than 19 000 Arkansas children could be denied after school services     Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act  IDEA   Lincoln said the President   s budget continues to retreat on America   s commitment to students with special needs  proposing that  for the second year in a row  the federal government provide a smaller share of states    total costs for special education  Arkansas should receive  162 million and yet the President   s budget would only provide just over  104 million  under funding Arkansas special education by almost  63 million     Overall  the President   s budget would eliminate 42 federal education programs  4  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   HOUSING Lincoln said the President   s budget would once again cut economic initiatives relied on by Arkansas    rural communities  His proposal would cut funding for housing programs for the elderly by 26 percent and for the disabled by 50 percent      Delta Regional Authority  The President wants to cut funding for the Delta Regional Authority  DRA  in half to  5 94 million  Congress appropriated  12 million for the DRA in FY 2006     USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant Program  RBEG   President Bush proposes to eliminate this important program which helps emerging businesses grow and develop  Lincoln said that Arkansas has benefitted tremendously from the RBEG program and stands to lose millions in economic development dollars if this program is eliminated  Lincoln pointed to Arkansas based Winrock International  an international non profit corporation  which uses RBEG funding to assist businesses throughout the state  Winrock has assisted 2 825 Arkansas businesses over the last 10 years using RBEG funding     Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program  The President   s budget once again proposes to reform and cut  1 billion  or 26 percent  of this important program that serves to strengthen rural communities  Lincoln said these cuts could severely impair Arkansas    ability to provide affordable housing and economic development grants  In addition  this move would directly impact the 14 entitlement cities that receive CDBG funds  cities include  Bentonville  Conway  Fort Smith  Jonesboro  Rogers  Texarkana  Fayetteville  Hot Springs  Jacksonville  Little Rock  North Little Rock  Pine Bluff  Springdale  and West Memphis       CDBG funds have been used for a variety of projects in Arkansas  including senior citizen centers  public health facilities  childcare facilities  affordable housing rehabilitation and construction projects  and rural fire stations  In 2005  Arkansas received approximately  21 million in CDBG funds  and is scheduled to receive  19 million in FY 2006  representing a  2 million cut in economic development funding     Rural Conservation and Development Districts  The President   s budget proposes consolidation of Resource Conservation and Development  RC  councils  RC councils provide the necessary tools and support to help rural communities work together to solve problems and promote quality of life  The proposal would reduce the number of council coordinators from 350 to 50 nationwide  Arkansas has 7 RC Councils and 7 Coordinators      Manufacturing Extension Partnership  MEP   The President plans to cut  67 million from last year   s budget of  113 million  representing a 60 percent cut  The MEP helps American small businesses improve productivity and compete in the global marketplace  The Arkansas Science and Technology Authority receives approximately  1 million each year in MEP funding to assist 240 small and medium sized businesses in Arkansas      Rural Housing  The President   s budget would eliminate the Rural Housing and Economic Development program  RHED   Arkansas received grants for projects in Fayetteville  Brinkley  and Little Rock in 2005     5  AGRICULTURE Lincoln said the President Bush   s budget request for the U S  Department of Agriculture would devastate Arkansas    farm families  Specifically  Bush proposes a five percent across the board cut to commodity programs  lower payment limitations  elimination of the  three entity rule   and the further consolidation of Farm Service Agency  FSA  offices across the country     Lincoln said the President   s proposals would severely alter the nation   s current agriculture policy as established in the 2002 Farm Bill  which Lincoln helped write and eventually pass  In that comprehensive law  which dictates U S  agricultural policy for a six year period  Lincoln fought to establish payment limitations that didn   t disproportionately impact southern farmers  whose crops require a more costly capital investment to grow than those produced in other regions  like the Midwest      Lincoln said Bush wants to impose unreasonable payment limitations and drastically reduce the level of support promised to farmers in that 2002 law  Lincoln said the President   s misguided proposals in agriculture break a firm promise the federal government has made to American farmers and ranchers  Lincoln cited a University of Arkansas study completed last year that found that proposals to cut farm and commodity programs     identical to this year   s budget proposals     would cost Arkansas farmers  165 million per year      Food Stamps  The President   s budget proposes to restrict eligibility for food stamp benefits which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could bump 225 000 from the rolls nationwide  Over 372 000 Arkansans currently receive food stamp benefits     Telemedicine  The President proposes to eliminate funding for loans for the USDA   s Distance Learning and Telemedicine program  citing lack of interest  Lincoln noted that the Ozark Health Foundation received a grant of  420 505 through this program last year to integrate the electronic medical records of a number of local health care agencies  Additionally  the White River Rural Health Center received a grant of  341 297 to acquire advanced telecommunications equipment that will enhance the health care available to residents in Cleburne  Craighead  Cross  Jackson  Lonoke  Monroe  Prairie  White and Woodruff counties     6  SOCIAL SECURITY   S IMPACT ON RURAL AMERICA President Bush slipped a plan into his budget to privatize Social Security by diverting  700 billion from the Trust Fund beginning in the year 2010 to pay  voluntary private accounts   Lincoln said that she was appalled that the President would again try to privatize Social Security by inserting a line item into his 2007 budget  She called such a move  outrageous  considering his privatization schemes were rejected last year by an overwhelming majority of Americans  including Members of Congress in his own party  She said that privatizing Social Security would be tremendously harmful to rural America  as it would affect small town businesses and their employees      Lincoln singled out one Arkansas county as an example  She said that Social Security brings  100 million a year into Union County  That   s more than construction  healthcare and retail  She said that if Social Security were privatized the way that President Bush wanted  Union County would lose more than  33 million a year which is equivalent of 7 out of every 10 stores in Union County going out of business      In addition  Lincoln said that Arkansas ranks 2nd among the 50 states in percentage of income from Social Security  Furthermore  Arkansas has the 3rd highest rate of citizens who receive Social Security benefits  In 2003 alone  more than  5 billion flowed into Arkansas   s economy through Social Security
