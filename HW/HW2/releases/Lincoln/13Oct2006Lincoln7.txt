                    Lincoln  Congress Leaves Behind Unfinished Business                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln  Congress Leaves Behind Unfinished Business  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 13  2006Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today said that the 109th Congress will be remembered more for missed opportunities than accomplishments due to the lack of progress on critical issues for America   s working families  As Congress has now moved into a six week recess  Lincoln noted that several priorities and necessary reforms have been left unaddressed      Unfortunately  this Republican leadership chose political gamesmanship over addressing several real priorities important to most Americans   Lincoln said   When Congress comes back to Washington after the November elections  I hope these same leaders will see it as one last opportunity to get results for the American people      Lincoln noted the 109th Congress    lack of progress on several issues critical to America   s working families     HEALTH CARE As an example of Congress    ineffectiveness  Lincoln pointed to the country   s growing health care crisis  The number of uninsured Americans rose to 46 6 million in 2005  an increase of almost seven million people since 2000  In Arkansas  approximately 448 000 people  or 16 4 percent of the state   s population  are uninsured  Yet the Senate dedicated a mere two days of debate to this health care crisis and blocked a Lincoln proposal that would allow self employed individuals and small businesses to offer insurance to themselves and their workers      MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF During this Congress  Republican leaders placed a priority on cutting taxes for dividends and capital gains while neglecting the renewal of tax extenders important for working Americans  teachers  and businesses     provisions such as the Research and Development tax credit which is critical for businesses to remain competitive in the global marketplace and the college tuition tax deduction which has been an effective tool for providing more Americans access to college      Congress has also let lapse the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and the Welfare to Work tax credits which provide businesses with tax incentives for hiring individuals from targeted groups  such as veterans and welfare recipients  These tax credits are important tools for placing economically disadvantaged individuals into jobs      In addition  Congress has failed to extend tax deductions for teachers    classroom education expenses  More than 23 000 teachers in Arkansas who purchase classroom supplies with money from their own pockets will be without this important deduction this year      In the months before and after these important tax incentives expired  Lincoln helped lead efforts to renew them  saying that they would provide much needed immediate relief for middle class Americans  In fact  her vote against the Tax Reconciliation bill in May was the direct result of the Republican leadership   s decision to ignore these incentives in favor of extending capital gains and dividend reduction provisions which were not set to expire until 2009      ENERGY INDEPENDENCE Many individuals and organizations across the country are exploring development and refinery of renewable fuels  They only need capital incentives to bring the best of these technologies to market  Since 2003  Lincoln has twice introduced legislation that would encourage long term investment in alternative energy by extending existing tax credits to 2010  Additionally  Lincoln co sponsored legislation that would put in place a comprehensive plan for reducing dependence on foreign oil  Lincoln said that the United States has fallen behind other nations with respect to our alternative energy policy and our government must make energy independence a priority      However  the 109th Congress missed a golden opportunity to establish a true plan for the development of renewable fuels when it enacted a national energy plan  While the bill did include tax credits and other mechanisms to develop renewables  these measures fell woefully short of what is currently achievable and  in some cases  they were reduced in order to allow for more funding of oil and gas exploration     MINIMUM WAGE During her tenure in Congress  Lincoln has consistently supported efforts to raise the minimum wage  yet the Republican controlled Congress has rejected each attempt  Lincoln said that no American worker should have to live in poverty     IMMIGRATION REFORM Congress has also fallen short on reforming our nation   s broken immigration system  Lincoln said  While consistently voting to secure the borders  Lincoln has remained an outspoken advocate for the bipartisan compromise reform passed by the Senate earlier this year  Lincoln said that the compromise requires a two pronged approach that secures our borders first  then establishes a system to identify undocumented workers  penalize them and place them on a path to permanent residency  Republican leaders in the House and Senate failed to agree on a comprehensive plan      DISASTER ASSISTANCE America   s farmers have suffered severe economic losses due to devastating weather conditions and record high energy prices during the past two years  Unlike other industries  farmers are unable to pass on higher input costs to consumers  which means that higher energy costs directly hurt farm income at the local economy      Last September  Lincoln introduced an agriculture disaster assistance package in the Senate and has continued to work in a bipartisan fashion to push a comprehensive assistance package for over a year  Lincoln said that if Americans want to continue to enjoy an affordable and abundant food supply produced safely at home  Congress and the Administration must provide the support our farm families need to remain competitive in the global marketplace  However  the Bush Administration has repeatedly blocked every attempt to provide adequate disaster aid to farmers      The experiences of the last two years were essential for my twin  ten year old boys   Lincoln said   In fact  I am disappointed that the Republican leaders of the 109th Congress are not more like parents who treasure every moment of their child   s growth and development        As it is  two years have been lost in the fight to ensure that every American has access to health care  Even while the clock expired on several  important middle income tax cuts  these leaders were unable to muster the will to extend them  And  two more years have passed without addressing the fate of 12 million or more undocumented workers living in this country  Each Congress has two years to make a difference for the American people  The Republican controlled  109th Congress largely stood still on numerous critical issues  I shudder to think of my children standing still and losing two years in their growth and development  We simply cannot afford to continue this pattern of failure  We owe it to the American people to bring them real results
