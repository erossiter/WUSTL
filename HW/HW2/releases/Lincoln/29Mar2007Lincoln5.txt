                    Lincoln  Senate Passes War Funds for Troops                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln  Senate Passes War Funds for Troops  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 29  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington   U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   Thursday released the following statement upon the Senate s passage of an emergency spending bill that includes more than  100 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan           The Senate has passed legislation that includes necessary funding requested by the President for our troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan  plus billions of dollars above the President s request for their combat equipment and housing and health care needs  including mental health care and brain trauma treatment   The legislation also lays down measurable benchmarks for the Iraqi government  such as assuming control of their own security operations  containing sectarian violence  and more equitably distributing oil revenue             The President has repeatedly said that American forces will stand down when Iraqis stand up  but his current strategy has proven to be a disincentive for the Iraqis to make the tough decisions that need to be made toward reconciliation   As Iraq slides deeper into an increasingly violent civil war  I believe these benchmarks are critical to ending our open ended commitment and to provide a new direction that better reflects the reality that progress ultimately lies with Iraqis taking responsibility for their own future             Our troops deserve a strategy that is worthy of their commitment  and I strongly believe this bill offers the necessary guidelines to bring them home safely and as soon as possible
