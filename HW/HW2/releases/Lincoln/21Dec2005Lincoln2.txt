2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   today voted against the Republican backed budget reconciliation conference report  calling the legislation    irresponsible    for America   s working families   The following is Lincoln   s floor speech on the misplaced priorities of the bill  as submitted to the Congressional Record     M  President  at a time when America   s working families face so many challenges     rising gas prices  unaffordable health care  and out of control child care costs     I am deeply disappointed that we are considering such harsh spending cuts that directly impact millions of hard working American families  This budget reconciliation bill contains nearly  40 billion in cuts over five years and burdensome program changes to Medicaid  child support enforcement  Supplemental Security Income for the elderly and poor  foster care  and other programs  It also places new  inordinate burdens on states administering the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program while providing sorely inadequate child care funding  Additionally  it fails our nation   s farmers by delaying commodity program benefits     I understand the need to tighten our belts  Our nation   s deficit is exploding  and I am committed to addressing it  However  I don   t believe that we should make middle and lower income Americans  children  and individuals with disabilities foot the bill  The entire burden of reigning in our nation   s deficit should not fall on their shoulders  It is unconscionable that Congress would make it harder for working families to get child care so they can go to work  for single parents to get child support checks so they can afford to feed their families  for children to get physical therapy to lessen the impact of a disability  or for a middle class family to afford nursing home care for their elderly parents struggling with dementia or other chronic illness     The cuts to Medicaid would force families to pay more for their health care and would provide them with fewer health care benefits  Children would no longer be guaranteed complete health care  potentially leaving them without proper vision screenings  therapy services  or medical equipment that would allow them to attend school  New  overly punitive asset transfer policies would penalize the elderly for not accurately anticipating their future health care needs  leaving them with few  or no  options for long term care  Community pharmacists also are at risk  particularly those serving rural communities     I have long been involved in the reauthorization of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  One of my priorities has been to reward states for getting people into good jobs instead of rewarding states for pushing people off the welfare rolls  This bill takes the absolute wrong approach  telling states that getting people off the welfare rolls is more important than helping them get good paying jobs  The most blatant example of this    get them off the rolls    approach is reflected in the horribly inadequate child care funding     M  President  this bill also includes  8 3 billion in cuts to Medicare over five years  Seniors  individuals with disabilities  and health care providers bear the burden of these enormous cuts  Even though the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  MedPAC  strongly recommended to eliminate the so called    stabilization fund    for health insurance plans  the conferees decided to maintain this large subsidy to insurers   Ending this subsidy for insurers would have saved taxpayers and Medicare seniors  5 4 billion over five years     But the conferees of this bill did not want to take money away from health insurance plans  Instead of obtaining Medicare savings from a common sense policy  this bill cuts payments to home health care by  2 billion  It cuts hospital quality improvement by  300 million  It cuts Medicare disproportionate share hospital payments by  1 2 billion  durable medical equipment by  2 9 billion  and imaging services by  2 8 billion     On top of all that  it increases Medicare premiums by  1 6 billion and fails to hold premiums harmless from the temporary payment fix for Medicare payments to physicians  This hits seniors right in the pocketbook  While I support ensuring that physicians do not receive a cut in Medicare payments  seniors in Arkansas are already struggling to pay their monthly Medicare premiums  and we should not be adding to that burden     In 2005  premiums increased by 17  to  78 20 per month  This marked the second consecutive year of double digit increases  In 2006  the Medicare premium will rise to  88 50 per month  And these provisions will increase it even more  Right now  millions of seniors are choosing a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan  In Arkansas  they are deciding between at least 40 different plans  all with different premiums and benefit packages  An increase to their Part B premium may dissuade them from signing up for a prescription drug plan  They may decide they simply cannot afford it  And that is a tragedy     Additionally  farmers should view this reconciliation effort as a clear indication that the commodity provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill are in jeopardy  Commodities  unlike conservation programs  were not extended in this bill and will likely face a considerable push from the Administration to make drastic changes  if not  wholesale elimination of the programs as they currently exist when the Farm Bill reauthorization occurs in 2007  Specifically  the Budget reconciliation will cut commodity programs by  1 4 billion through a reduction in the advance direct payment to farmers  This will result in farmers facing uncertain futures with respect to  receiving their commodity title support payments   This is especially troublesome in light of the Administration   s refusal to give farmers emergency disaster relief funding during one of their most difficult years     M  President  in conclusion  this budget reconciliation spending bill is irresponsible and shows some the misplaced priorities of this administration and some of my colleagues   We should be talking about ways to help our fellow Americans who are working hard to provide for their families  to keep their families healthy and happy  and to take care of their aging parents  We shouldn   t be tearing them down and making their lives more difficult  This bill is filled with misplaced priorities and I wholeheartedly oppose it
