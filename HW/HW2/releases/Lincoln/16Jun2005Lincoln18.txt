                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 16  2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln announced today that her package of legislative initiatives to encourage the domestic production of renewable energy sources cleared a significant hurdle in the Senate today            Lincoln   s initiatives were included in the tax portion of the comprehensive Senate Energy Bill which she helped pass out of the Senate Finance Committee earlier today   She said that initiatives such as hers are needed to reduce our nation   s dependence on foreign oil  revamp our nation   s outdated energy policy and help reduce prices at the pump        We   re one step closer today to giving our country an energy policy that will encourage the development of our domestic resources to help meet our energy needs  so that we can begin to curb our reliance on foreign sources of energy     Senator Lincoln said      This package of tax measures is a necessary step in the right direction to give our agricultural producers the incentives they need to use alternative forms of clean burning energy  like biodiesel   If we pursue incentives for conservation  energy efficiency  and that encourage a greater use of alternative fuels  we can create new markets for our producers and make these new technologies more affordable for American consumers                Lincoln   s entire package of energy incentives that she unveiled earlier this year  was included in today   s tax package  She has been successful at getting several of the same measures  or variations of them  included in both the 2002 and 2003 Senate Energy Bills   However  both of these bills were mired in partisan politics and never passed   Yet in 2002  Lincoln was successful at securing  incentives for biodiesel and other renewable energy sources in the  450 million energy title of the Farm Bill   Lincoln   s energy package  which could convert Arkansas into a significant source of renewable energy  includes the following        Biodiesel incentives  This legislation would extend tax incentives to encourage the production and use of biodiesel  a clean burning alternative fuel produced from renewable sources such as soybean  cottonseed  rice oils or animal fats  Lincoln said that farmers in Arkansas and other farm states will benefit from increased production of this environmentally friendly  biodegradable fuel       Energy efficient appliances  This legislation would create tax incentives to encourage appliance manufacturers to produce super energy efficient washing machines  dishwashers and refrigerators   Lincoln said this bill would encourage the development and production of these appliances and allow consumers to benefit from cost and energy savings          Expanded access to natural gas pipelines  This legislation would encourage companies to construct new natural gas delivery pipelines through tax incentives   Lincoln   s legislation would help ensure that more rural Arkansas consumers have access to natural gas to heat their homes and fuel cooking appliances         Animal wastes  This legislation would encourage the production of energy from animal waste and rendered fat  which would benefit Arkansas    poultry producers   Lincoln   s bill would create tax incentives for energy production from alternative sources which include liquid fuels  while at the same time reducing the amount of animal wastes generated in agricultural production       Turning landfill gas into energy   Lincoln   s bill would encourage the production of energy from landfill gas   This legislation would establish tax incentives for the additional collection and use of methane gas generated by decomposing garbage from landfills  which can be developed into energy to fuel clean burning vehicles and power generators to produce electricity        Municipal trash combustion  This legislation would encourage the production of clean  renewable energy from municipal solid waste  while helping communities meet the challenge of trash disposal   This bill would provide tax incentives to produce energy from municipalities    waste and would save valuable land while significantly reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere     Small Producer Incentives  In addition  Lincoln was successful at including an amendment that would offer incentives to farmers who have invested in farmer owned ethanol and biodiesel processing cooperatives   The small producer tax credit would extend tax credits for biodiesel and ethanol to reflect the growth of these two renewable biofuels
