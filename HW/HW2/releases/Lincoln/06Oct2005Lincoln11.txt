Katie Laning  202 224 4843 WASHINGTON D C      U S  Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor today announced that the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Defense  DOD  Appropriations Bill includes significant funding for Arkansas    military instillations  research institutions and defense contractors  The Senators said the legislation is expected to pass the Senate Thursday evening or Friday      Lincoln and Pryor said that the  440 billion defense appropriations bill includes essential funding for military personnel  operations and maintenance and equipment procurement  In addition   50 billion is allotted to finance the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first part of fiscal 2006  The Senators said they are pleased with the amount allotted toward Arkansas projects  given this year   s particularly tight budget restrictions        In today   s environment  military preparedness is critical for long term stability   said Lincoln   Our communities and industries in Arkansas have long played an important role in building a strong national defense  and I will fight to ensure these projects for Arkansas remain intact throughout the appropriations process        Arkansas is home to top notch military installations  as well as cutting edge research and development that will better protect our soldiers and expand our nation   s defense capabilities to new levels     Pryor said     It   s among my top priorities to ensure these projects remain in the final bill  which will help our military meet emerging challenges       The following Arkansas projects were included in the FY 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill      Russellville  AR    Mobile Medical Shelter    8 3 million was secured to allow the design and manufacturing for two sets of prototypes for mobile medical shelters  The shelters would provide medics with a more modern and sterile environment in which to treat patients on the battlefield  Development of the prototype would be contracted out to several companies  including European Aeronautic Defense and Space  EADS  North America  which has agreed that if the Army selects the EADS prototype and buys the mobile units  then final assembly  testing and maintenance will take place in Russellville   AR      Pine Bluff  AR    Pine Bluff Arsenal and Red River Data Equipment  Pine Bluff    10 million was secured to modernize and expand the automatic data collection capabilities at the Pine Bluff Arsenal  as well as arsenals in Annistan  AL and Rock Island  IL  This will reduce workload and better able the Army to track the manufacturing and distrbution of supplies  including chemical and biological protection equipment      Jonesboro  AR    Standoff Sensor Radionuclide Program  Arkansas State University    8 million was secured to invest in smart technologies  called Standoff Sensor for Radionuclide ID  to detect nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  ASU  The University of Hawaii  and Florida A will work collaboratively to advance these technologies  and expedite their research on sensors and techniques that may detect Improvised Explosive Devices  IEDs   which have emerged in Iraq as a deadly threat to United States forces      Standoff Hazardous Agent Detection and Evaluation System  SHADES   Arkansas State University    4 million was secured to assist ASU  in conjunction with industry  to further research for early detection of weapons before chemical or biological threats can hurt troops or citizens      Wolverine Mountain Climbing Boots  Jonesboro    1 million was secured  to be shared by companies in Arkansas  Hawaii and Florida  to establish a U S  production base for high performance boots for use by all special operations warfighters from all services  Most current cold weather boots used by special operations forces predominately employ materials and designs consistent with 1980   s technology and lack characteristics necessary for crampons  snowshoeing or movement on skis      Technology in the outdoor research mountaineering climbing field  most often foreign companies  has provided substantial advancements in every category of technical innovations and construction techniques to meet the increasing demands of extreme mountaineer  climbers and hikers  as well as the military  Faced with the dilemma of wearing outmoded and inadequate boots and the lack of commercially available  US manufactured items  some unit leaders have elected to purchase foreign off the shelf items for their personnel while others have relied on personal gear  purchased at their own expense  and considered better suited for their needs      Fayetteville  AR    The Center for Ferroelectric Electronic Photonic Nanodevices  University of Arkansas    4 million was secured to continue the Center   s research to help the Army achieve information and communication supremacy on the battlefield and protection from biological weapons through ferroelectric and electronic photonic nanodevices  Nanotechnology is a newly emerging field of science where scientists and engineers are beginning to manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic level in order to develop materials and systems with revolutionary properties      The Logistics Institute  University of Arkansas    1 million was secured to continue research aimed at developing new technologies to enhance logistics and improve design  deployability  performance and support of current and future weapons systems    Three Dimensional Packaging  University of Arkansas    4 million was secured for the Three Dimensional packaging program  a consortium research effort between the University of Arkansas  the International Technology Center  North Carolina State University  and the University of Florida  This is a third year program working on 3 D microcircuit packages to help the military lower the size and weight and improve thermal and electrical performance of radio communications equipment      Space Photonics Intelligent Free Space Optical Satellite    3 million was secured to help the Air Force improve the performance  reliability and security of its space communications capability  Space Photonics in Fayetteville has demonstrated an edge for developing technologies that are a priority for the Air Force      Wynne  AR    M49 M98 Fixed Installation Filter    4 million was secured for the procurement of M49 M98 fixed installation gas filters from Mueller Industries in Wynne  AR  The filters provide protection against chemical and biological agents at fixed sites  such as hardened underground shelters for command and control centers  medical facilities  and rest and relief areas  When combined with a pre filter and HEPA filtration  the M49 M98 fixed installation gas filter minimizes the infiltration of nuclear  biological  and chemical contamination  allowing personnel to perform their duties unencumbered by individual protective equipment to enable various fixed military installations both within the United States and abroad to support critical operations      Copper Antimicrobial Program  CAP     2 million was secured to support the use of copper products as preventative measures against infectious disease  The study will observe the antimircrobial properties of copper to inhibit dangerous microbes  This funding supports the copper manufacturing base in Wynne     Highland Park  Camden  AR     Standard Missile Improvements    7 5 million was secured to modernize the rocket motors on about half of the missiles that would otherwise expire by 2010 due to age  This funding ensures the return of state of the art missiles to the fleet     Hydra 70 70 mm  2 75 inch  Rockets    156 8 million was protected for the Hydra 70 rocket system used by Army  Navy  Marine Corps and Special Operations helicopters and Navy  Marine and Air Force jet aircraft  The system is an effective area suppression weapon which has seen use most recently in Afghanistan and Iraq  The Hydra 70 family of rockets includes seven different tactical warheads that provide combat overmatch and ensure a near term warfighting readiness posture for U S  aviation assets including the Army   s AH 64 Apache  the OH 58D Kiowa Warrior  and the Marine Corps    AH 1 Cobra      Tomahawk    355 million was protected for Tomahawk missile production
