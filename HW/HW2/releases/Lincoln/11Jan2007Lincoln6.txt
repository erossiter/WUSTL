                    Lincoln  Snowe Call on Congress to Expand Child Tax Credit                                                                              Both                                                    Lincoln  Snowe Call on Congress to Expand Child Tax Credit  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 11  2007Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington     U S  Senators Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  today reintroduced legislation to ensure that more of America   s low income  hard working families receive the benefit of the child tax credit  Currently  almost one third of children come from families that do not qualify for the credit because family earnings are too low  even though parents are working full time  every week of the year     Lincoln   s and Snowe   s measure  the Working Family Child Assistance Act  would correct inequities in the current law which have prevented thousands of working families from receiving the refundable child tax credit due to inflation      We have made great strides in ensuring that the Child Tax Credit is a useful tool for America   s working families  however it isn   t working for everyone   Lincoln said   It is wrong to provide some hard working families this relief  while leaving others behind  We must address this inequity and ensure that our tax code works for all Americans  especially those working parents forced to get by on the minimum wage        Congress must confront how to best provide tax relief to hard working American families  And we can do that by expanding the availability of the child tax credit  Unfortunately  low income families earning less than  11 750 are shut out of the child tax credit completely   said Snowe   That is why Senator Lincoln and I have introduced legislation that will enable more hard working  low income families to receive the refundable child credit this year  The Maine Department of Revenue estimates that 16 700 families in Maine alone would benefit from our proposal  Parents deserve their per child tax credit  and now is the time for the Congress to act      Low income working families must currently meet an income threshold in order to be eligible for the refundable child tax credit  However  when the child tax credit refundability law was written in 2003  it was indexed for inflation and has increased each year  Because the credit threshold is tied to inflation  many low income working parents do not meet the necessary income level to qualify for the relief      Lincoln and Snowe  both members of the Senate Finance Committee  worked to create the refundable child tax credit in 2001 and co authored legislation in 2003 to expand the refundable portion of the credit  When the child tax credit was signed into law in 2003  the income threshold was set at  10 500  Indexed for inflation  it has thus increased each year   11 750 for 2007  placing the threshold too high for many working families to meet  In 2006  a single parent working a 40 hour week every week of the year earning the federal minimum wage made  10 712  below the qualifying level      Lincoln   s and Snowe   s legislation would de index the income threshold and set the income threshold taxpayers must reach to receive the refundable portion of the child tax credit to  10 000  The Senators said their legislation would enable all working parents  including those making the minimum wage  to qualify for the credit
