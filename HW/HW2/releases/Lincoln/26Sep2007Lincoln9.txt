Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Washington  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln delivered remarks on the U S  Senate floor Wednesday regarding the renewal of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   The following is the text of Lincolns speech  as prepared for delivery   Mr  President  I rise this morning in strong support of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  Reauthorization Act of 2007 and want to urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan comprise we have negotiated    As a working mother  I know all too well of the importance of reliable health insurance coverage for children    I feel blessed that  as a federal employee  I have access to quality coverage and can call on a moments notice when I have a sick child at home    Having health insurance coverage gives me peace of mind    But that peace of mind should not only belong to those families who can afford private health insurance  it should also belong to the working families who are struggling to make ends meet   I commend my colleagues in this body and in the House of Representatives  from both parties  who have worked diligently to come to this agreement    Since the inception of CHIP ten years ago  or as we call it in Arkansas   ARKids First  the number of children without health care coverage has been reduced by one third    During that time  I am proud that Arkansas has become a national leader in reducing its number of uninsured children  from over 20 percent in 1997 to 10 percent today    Now  nearly 65 000 of Arkansass children currently receive coverage through the ARKids B part of ARKids First    The bill before us today is an important and responsible step forward in reaching the millions of children who remain uninsured    It applies the lessons of the past 10 years and builds upon the success of the program by giving states more of the tools they need  while preserving their flexibility to strengthen their programs and ultimately cover more kids    In doing so  it would provide an additional  35 billion over five years that will allow states to preserve coverage for the children currently enrolled while reaching an additional 3 8 million uninsured  low income children    This proposal would also provide much needed funding to states for outreach and enrollment efforts to reach many of those currently uninsured    In addition  it takes steps to ensure they get a healthy start by providing care for pregnant women and establishing pediatric quality measures to improve the effectiveness  safety and efficiency of the care they receive    Our plan would also invest in the development of evidence based quality measures for childrens health care  provide access to much needed dental care for lower income children  and ensure that children enrolled in CHIP would have access to mental health care that is on par with the level of medical and surgical care they are currently provided    Earlier this month  I hosted forums across Arkansas to discuss the renewal of this vital program and had a wonderful opportunity to meet with providers  parents  single working mothers and others who emphasized just how crucial this program is to Arkansans    They are anxious for us to get this program reauthorized    They know the clock is ticking  If we dont act in some form or fashion by September 30  we could endanger the coverage for 6 6 million children currently receiving care   Further  those I spoke to have little tolerance for the political posturing by the President  They are frustrated that he doesnt seem willing to budge in terms of cost when what we spend in Iraq in just 41 days would provide health care coverage for 10 million children each year    And they  like me  feel that providing health care to our children is not only an investment in our nations most precious resource  but that it is a moral issue and quite simply the right thing to do   In Washington  we often get in the business of debating policy specifics and losing sight on what it is all about    During my recent trip to Arkansas  I was reminded of what this will mean for real people    Its about a wonderful hard working  home based educator from Benton  Jennifer Brown  and her six year old daughter  Elizabeth    Because Elizabeth had a digestion problem that required treatment  her mother would have been forced into the position of choosing between care for her sick child or choosing to feed her family if CHIP wasnt available    Placing families in that position is completely unacceptable  They deserve so much more  I am proud that CHIP was there for Jennifer and Elizabeth    As Jennifer told me  Without ARKids First  I don t know how we could have done it   Its also about a young working mother and grandmother  Amy Main and Jackie Deuerling  who spoke to me about their daughter and granddaughter  Emily  a 4 month old blessing I got to hold in my arms    Without ARKids  Emilys family would be unable to provide Emily with the care she desperately needs    As Amy told me  The health care coverage provided by ARKids First allows me to feed the kids  afford diapers  and pay for Emilys brothers school supplies  I can make sure the kids have everything they need  If I was paying the medical bills  we wouldn t be able to afford those other necessities   We cannot lose sight of that   We should all agree that providing health care for our children is certainly one area where partisan politics should be placed aside    I am very proud that in the Senate  that has been the case  The Members of the Senate Finance Committee  which I am a member  worked hard in a bipartisan spirit to find a common ground to improve this program    Chairman Baucus  Ranking Member Grassley  Senator Rockefeller  Senator Hatch  and others held multiple meetings to produce a bill that everyone can be proud of    Their leadership and vision should be commended by this body    That is why it is unfortunate that the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services feel differently    In fact  their proposal  to increase CHIP funding by only  5 billion over the next five years  falls well short of the funding needed to simply maintain coverage for those currently enrolled in the program    That is not right  In fact  the message sent to me during my meeting in Arkansas was that moving backwards is absolutely unacceptable   Instead of forcing nearly 1 5 million children to be dropped from their current health insurance provider  shouldnt we all agree that   at the very least  absolutely no child should lose coverage as a result of reauthorization    The President has been adamant about leaving no child behind when it comes to their education  but shouldnt that also apply to their health care   How you choose to spend your money    for families and for governments  most definitely reflects your values and your priorities    I ask my colleagues today  what could be a bigger priority than the well being of our children    In a time when more and more Americans are struggling to find affordable health care  CHIP has been a success story and allowed us to make coverage more accessible for millions of children    I urge each and every one of my colleagues to explore your conscience  to set aside partisan influences  and to support this critical effort to invest in the health care of our children    Not only for the future of our nation  but for the well being of millions of children and working families  They are depending on us  and its time we fulfill our commitment to them   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting legislation to expand health care coverage for children    I thank you Mr  President  and yield the floor
