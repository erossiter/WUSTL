Rising Health Care Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 04  2005Contact  Katie Laning  202 224 4843 Little Rock     In recognition of    Cover the Uninsured Week 2005     U S  Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor along with Senator Tom Carper of Delaware today said that helping small businesses better afford health insurance for their employees should be a national priority         The three Democratic Senators held a press conference this afternoon in front of the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce to tout federal legislation introduced by Lincoln and cosponsored by Pryor and Carper to help small businesses with 100 employees or less provide health insurance for their workers   The Senators said that the legislation would give small businesses in Arkansas and nationwide a greater range of affordable health care options for their employees          This is the number one issue I hear about from small businesses in Arkansas and it   s something that our working families desperately need help with     said Sen  Blanche Lincoln  D Ark        I believe addressing the problem of the uninsured should be a national priority  because it   s getting worse and it will have lasting impacts on our economy if left unaddressed   Small businesses have been forced to drop or dramatically reduce health insurance for their employees  even though they desperately want to offer it    While this bill won   t address every health care need in our nation today  it   s a balanced  common sense approach to help our small businesses     the true backbone of our communities            Access to health care is becoming more limited every day as insurance premiums and prescription drug prices continue to skyrocket out of control   This problem has forced many businesses to drop employee health coverage altogether     said Sen  Mark Pryor  D Ark        This legislation is a positive step toward addressing our country   s health care problems and puts an attractive and affordable option on the table for small businesses struggling to do the right thing           As I travel around my home state of Delaware    and indeeed  across the country    the one thing I consistently hear from small businesses is that they can t keep up with the rising cost of health insurance     said Sen  Tom Carper  D Del        We need to be creative in finding new ways to help our small businesses maintain health coverage for their employees  despite double digit growth in insurance premiums  By granting small companies the ability to pool their resources  this bill should help keep employers in the game  while expanding opportunities for them to provide health insurance to full time and part time workers        Lincoln said their bill  titled the    The Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act of 2005     a modified version of legislation she introduced last year  does not promote government run health care but harnesses the power of market competition to bring down health insurance costs  using a proven government negotiator     The bill would provide the self employed and small businesses with up to 100 employees with choices among private insurance plans by giving them access to a larger purchasing pool and negotiated rates for health insurance   The approach would allow employers to cope with the rising costs of health care by pooling both their risk and their purchasing power in order to secure greater access to affordable care for their employees   The proposal is modeled after the proven    Federal Employees Health Benefits Program    that has successfully provided health care benefits to federal workers for over 40 years       Approximately 75 percent of businesses in Arkansas have fewer than 50 employees and less than a third of those businesses are currently able to offer health insurance for their employees  Arkansas ranks far below the national average in providing health insurance for private sector workers   Without employer coverage  most workers are unable to afford coverage in the private market   Since Arkansas    business community consists overwhelmingly of small businesses  Lincoln   s bill would help to make health care more affordable and more accessible for workers in Arkansas      45 million Americans have no health insurance   Eight out of ten uninsured Americans either work or are in working families   As the price of health care continues to rise  fewer small businesses are able to provide coverage for their employees  and those that do are struggling to hold on to the coverage they offer
