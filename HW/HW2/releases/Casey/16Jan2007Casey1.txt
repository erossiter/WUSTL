Sen. Casey Offers Amendment to Close K Street Project  January 16, 2007  WASHINGTON, DCToday, U.S. Senator Bob Casey took to the Senate floor to speak on his amendment to shut down the K Street Project and to make wrongfully influencing hiring practices a federal crime.  The Congress must restore the confidence of the people of Pennsylvania and of the United States that has been lost due to the ethics scandals of recent years, said U.S. Senator Bob Casey. My amendment to close the K Street Project and to make its coercive practices a federal crime will help to restore the public trust.  The amendment would prohibit a Member of Congress from influencing hiring decisions of private entities. Wrongful influence could include threatening or withholding official action. Those found guilty of such actions would be subject to fine, imprisonment, or disqualification from public office.  The Washington Post described the problem of the K Street Project as: researching the party affiliation and campaign donations of hundreds of lobbyists, as a way to deny government access and jobs to those who don't share their political views. These matters were discussed, in part, at private meetings on the Hill. [Washington Post, 8-2-02]  The amendment to close the K Street Project (SA 56) is the first amendment introduced by Senator Casey. His remarks today were also his first on the Senate floor. Closing the K Street Project was part of an ethics package Senator Casey announced in November 2005 and was a top issue in his Senate campaign.  Following Senator Caseys remarks, Senator Dianne Feinstein (CA) -- the floor manager of the ethics bill -- indicated her support for the amendment and her hope that the amendment could be agreed to by the other side of the aisle and adopted to the ethics bill without a vote.
