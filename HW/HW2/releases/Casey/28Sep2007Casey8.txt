Casey Applauds Senate Passage of CHIP September 28, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - Following passage of the childrens health insurance legislation, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement:  Both the Senate and the House have passed the childrens health insurance bill by wide, bipartisan margins. For the 10 million children, including 300,000 in Pennsylvania, who will receive coverage under this bill, it is imperative that President Bush sign this legislation into law before the program expires this Sunday.  A consensus in Congress, 43 governors and working families across America hope that the President will reconsider his intention to veto this bipartisan legislation.  This program gives peace of mind to mothers and fathers who worry about their childrens health and their future. The family of America must leave no one out and no one behind. Our children deserve the opportunity to have health care in the dawn of their life so they will learn more and earn more to help us build a strong economy years from now. President Bush should remember his own words when he ran for reelection pledging to cover the uninsured. When President Bush receives the bill and picks up his pen he should remember the words he spoke at the 2004 Republican Convention: Americas children must also have a healthy start in life.
