Sen. Casey Votes for Clean Minimum Wage Increase  January 24, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCToday, U.S. Senator Bob Casey voted in favor of passing a clean minimum wage increase that does not include an accompanying tax cut package. The vote came as a cloture vote on the House-passed minimum wage bill.  Workers have waited ten years for an increase in the minimum wage  that is far too long to wait, said Senator Casey. Passing a minimum wage increase without a series of tax cuts will help let hard-working Americans know that we have not forgotten about them and that Washington does not just listen to special interest lobbyists.  In a speech on the Senate floor yesterday, Senator Casey made clear that he thinks small businesses need help to lower costs and to provide health care for their workers. Reducing the cost of health care for Americans and small business is one of his top priorities. However, this assistance should not be tied to a long overdue increase in the minimum wage.
