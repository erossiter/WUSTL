Casey Joins Advocates To Rally Support For SCHIP  March 13, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today joined a bipartisan and bicameral group to rally support for reauthorizing and properly funding the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The rally took place in Russell Senate Park in Washington, DC.  Senators Casey and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) as well as Representatives Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Jim Ramstad (R-MN), spoke at a rally attended by health care advocates from the Children's Health Fund, Families USA, and the Campaign for Children's Health Care.  In 1992, my father Robert P. Casey, signed into law the Children's Health Insurance Program that was the model for the federal program, said Casey. The Bush budget underfunds the program and would cause 1.4 million children and pregnant women to lose coverage. Further, it attempts to prevent states like my home state of Pennsylvania from expanding SCHIP. We have a chance this year to protect and grow the program to give another generation of children access to health care. We must encourage progress to expand SCHIP, not stifle the efforts of states like Pennsylvania.  Protecting and growing the SCHIP program is one of Senator Casey's top priorities. He has spoken out in Pennsylvania and in Washington against the Bush budget that underfunds the program and attempts to prevent states like Pennsylvania from expanding SCHIP to cover more kids. The program originated as a Pennsylvania program signed into law by late Governor Robert P. Casey.
