Casey and Brown Wager on Steelers-Browns Game  September 7, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today made a friendly wager on the season opener between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns, which will be played in Cleveland this Sunday. The Senator representing the losing team will deliver a basket of hometown products to the winning team's Senate office wearing the winning teams jersey.  Even with the strong support of my colleague and friend Sherrod Brown, the Browns dont have a chance this weekend. I have no doubt the Steelers will continue their dominance over the Browns, said Senator Casey.  Pittsburgh is lucky to be represented by Bob Casey, but their luck is about to end in the Dawg Pound this Sunday, Senator Brown said.  Products from the Pittsburgh area include: Heinz products, Snyders chips, Sarris candy, Eatn Park cookies, and Mineos pizza.  Products from the Cleveland area include: Smuckers preserves, Chocolate-Peanut Butter Buckeyes, Stadium Mustard, Petersons nuts, Jones chips (from Browns hometown, Mansfield, Ohio), and Bob Evans sausages. The wager will be settled next week following Sunday's game.
