Casey on Iraq Progress Report  July 12, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC-U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement after the release of the White House report on progress toward 18 benchmarks in Iraq:  This Iraq progress report shows again that while our troops are doing their job, the Iraqi government is not holding up their end of the bargain. This is more evidence that the Bush policy is not working and we need to change course in Iraq. The report comes on the heels of other troubling news in a U.S. intelligence report that Al Qaeda has regained strength to 2001 levels.   ###
