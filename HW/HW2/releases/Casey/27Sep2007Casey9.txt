Casey Praises Hate Crimes Prevention Passage  September 27, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - Following Senate passage of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement:  The Senate today took a major step to give prosecutors and law enforcement the tools they need to prevent and prosecute crimes motivated by hatred and bigotry. I was proud to have voted for and cosponsored the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  I had the opportunity in September 2005 to meet Matthew Shepard's mother, Judy Shepard. She, obviously, will probably never fully recover from the loss of her son. I think we have to consider who speaks for that mother and the families of other victims of hate crimes.  The Senate today spoke with a loud and bipartisan voice to stand up for those who are victimized because of hatred and bigotry.
