Statement of Sen. Casey on Passage of Minimum Wage Increase  February 1, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCToday, U.S. Senator Bob Casey released the following statement on the passage of a bill to increase the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour.  I am proud that one of my first votes as a U.S. Senator is to increase the minimum wage. This is a matter of economic justice for workers. The U.S. Senate has today listened to the voices of voters across America who said in November that the Congress must, after ten long years, increase the wages of hard working men and women. Todays vote is also a victory for the six million children who will finally benefit from a wage increase.  This increase is a longtime coming: both that the minimum wage hasnt been increased in ten years and that a vote on final passage has been held up in the U.S. Senate.  I hoped that the minimum wage increase could have been passed without attaching tax provisions. Small businesses need help with health care costs, but the hard working men and women struggling to make ends meet earning $5.15 an hour have waited too long for an increase in the minimum wage.
