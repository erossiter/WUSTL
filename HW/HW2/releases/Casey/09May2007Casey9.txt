Casey calls failed drug bill a 'setback' May 9, 2007  U.S. Sen. Bob Casey lamented Tuesday the Senates failure to pass a bill that would have allowed the importation of prescription drugs from cheaper sources in other countries approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  The bill effectively died when the Senate passed an amendment, 49-40, to require U. S. health officials to certify the safety and effectiveness of drugs imported from FDA-approved sources in Canada, Australia, Europe, Japan and New Zealand. The officials have said they cannot meet the requirement.  Many drugs are cheaper in those five countries than in the U.S. The pharmaceutical industry had lobbied against the bill, and President Bush threatened to veto it.  Mr. Casey, D-Pennsylvania, said he voted against the safety amendment because it rendered meaningless an earlier amendment allowing imports without a way to certify safety. He said safety isnt a legitimate issue because the sources of drug imports are already approved by the FDA.  The Senate later voted 82-8 to table the bill. Mr. Casey said he voted against ending debate on the bill as a protest.  Were going to keep fighting for it, but I think it was a setback for the country and especially for senior citizens to have this go this way, Mr. Casey said in a telephone interview.  U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Philadelphia, voted for the safety certification and for ending debate. In an e-mail from his spokeswoman, Mr. Specter said the safety certification is necessary to protect consumers.
