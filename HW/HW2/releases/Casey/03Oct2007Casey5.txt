Casey Responds to Bush Veto of CHIP  October 3, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC-Following President Bushs veto of the childrens health insurance legislation, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement: With this veto, President Bush has turned his back on millions of children and their families.  President Bush ignored the bipartisan consensus among Congress, 43 governors, working families across America and groups ranging from doctors to law enforcement that support the continuation and expansion of the childrens health insurance program.  The childrens health insurance bill would provide health care for ten million children including four million who would not otherwise have coverage. The Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override the Presidents veto. For the sake of the ten million children who will have health insurance with this legislation, I hope that we can secure the additional votes needed in the House.  ###
