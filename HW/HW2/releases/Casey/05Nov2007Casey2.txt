Casey Applauds PUC and DEP on Power Corridor  November 5, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement after the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) appealed to the Department of Energy (DOE) for a rehearing on the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor. The PUC also filed suit against the designation in the U.S. District Court.  Im pleased that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and Department of Environmental Protection are continuing to take a stand against the designation of the power transmission corridor. I will continue to fight the power corridor designation in Washington, DC and I support the Commonwealth in their efforts. The Department of Energy exceeded their authority and disregarded the loud outcry of opposition from government officials and most importantly, the people of Pennsylvania. On October 31st, Senator Casey met with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Joseph Kelliher to discuss FERCs implementation of its authority to site transmission facilities in federally designated transmission corridors.  Senator Casey also voiced his opposition to the draft plan to the Department of Energy during their public comment period. Despite an outpouring of opposition in Pennsylvania, the final plan was unchanged. He is continuing to fight to prevent the NIETC plan from going forward until Pennsylvania is, at a minimum, treated equitably. Last month, Senator Arlen Specter joined with Senator Casey to express their disappointment in the Department of Energys final designation of NIETC in a letter to the Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman. During a meeting last month with Assistant Secretary of Energy Kevin Kolevar, Senator Casey expressed his opposition to the designation of 52 of Pennsylvanias 67 counties as part of the NIETC. ###
