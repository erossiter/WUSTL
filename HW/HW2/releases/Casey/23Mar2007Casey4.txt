Casey Authors Pre-K Amendment  March 23, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) spoke on the Senate floor tonight and offered an amendment to create a reserve fund for early childhood education. The amendment to the Budget Resolution follows his campaign plan to provide universal access to early childhood education for four-year olds.  Investments in early childhood education are not just good for the child or their parents; it will pay dividends for our economy and our Nation, said Senator Casey. This amendment will help pave the way for new efforts to expand access to early childhood education.  The amendment would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to open the door for future legislation to help states expand access to early childhood education. The fund would be used to provide assistance to states to offer free or subsidized preschool programs for low-income families.  Senator Casey is drafting separate legislation to increase access to preschool programs.  In March 2006, then a candidate for the U.S. Senate, Casey introduced an early childhood education plan in Philadelphia at a Delaware Valley Association for the Education of Young Children conference.  While in Pennsylvania state government, Senator Casey helped make child care more affordable. As State Auditor General, he uncovered a $400 million stockpile of child care and other funds for low-income working families.
