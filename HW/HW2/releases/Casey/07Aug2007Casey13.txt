Casey and Durbin Head to Iraq and Jordan on Senate Delegation  August 7, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Dick Durbin (D-IL), the Assistant Majority Leader, will travel to Iraq and Jordan. The primary focus of the trip will be on military, security and humanitarian issues.  This trip will allow me to see Iraq firsthand and continue to gather information, said Casey. I also look forward to meeting with troops from Pennsylvania who are serving in Iraq. The trip will give Senator Casey the ability to assess the situation on the ground and the challenges that still lie ahead. While in the Middle East, Senator Casey will meet with troops from Pennsylvania as well as other personnel. Casey will also have a chance to see the mounting Iraqi refugee crisis when he visits Jordan. The delegation will travel throughout the week. Due to security concerns, details of the trip will not be released in advance. Tomorrow morning around 6:50am EST Senator Casey and Senator Durbin will be on CNNs American Morning from Bagdad.
