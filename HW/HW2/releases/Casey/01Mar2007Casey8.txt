Senator Casey Names New Press Secretary  March 1, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCU.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) announced today that former Senate Democratic Leadership staffer, Kendra Barkoff, has joined his Senate office as Press Secretary.  I am thrilled that Kendra has agreed to join my communications team, Casey said. Her years of experience on Capitol Hill, as well as her work with television and radio reporters and producers will add a great deal to the work my office does representing Pennsylvania.  I am honored to work for Senator Casey, Barkoff said. In the short time Bob Casey has been in office, he has already established himself as one of the hardest working senators in Washington. He has helped secure funding for a coal-to-diesel plant in Schuylkill County, has helped to pass critical ethics reform legislation, and is asking tough questions about the war in Iraq in his role as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That's impressive for any senator whether they are a freshman or a veteran lawmaker.  Barkoff, who joins Communications Director Larry Smar in Senator Casey's press office, served as the Democratic Media Coordinator for the Senate's Assistant Majority Leader, Dick Durbin (D-IL). In her role as Media Coordinator, Kendra dramatically increased the number of Democratic senators who appeared on radio and TV nationwide.  Prior to her work for Senator Durbin, Barkoff worked at KRON-TV in San Francisco where she produced election coverage for the 2004 presidential election. Barkoff also worked in the press offices of Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA).
