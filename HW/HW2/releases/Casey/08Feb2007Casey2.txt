Senator Casey Presses Bush Administration on Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Plant Funding  February 8, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC  Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey sent a letter to the Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Robert Portman, urging the Bush Administration not to rescind a $100 million award promised to help build the nation's first coal-to-liquid fuel plant in Schuylkill County.  Senator Casey said: At a time when energy security is becoming even more connected with national security, the global war on terrorism, and the war in Iraq, we should be using every incentive and tool at our disposal to promote clean coal-to-liquid technology in the U.S. rather than withdrawing awards to support alternative energy goals.
