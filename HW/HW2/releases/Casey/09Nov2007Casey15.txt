Casey on Mukasey Nomination  November 9, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC-Following his vote to oppose the nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney General, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement: Judge Mukasey is an honorable man who possesses the experience and ability to serve as Attorney General. But I question his ability to be the strong, independent leader that is required now at the Justice Department. He is the nominee of an administration which has too often put politics and ideology ahead of principle and the rule of law. The former Attorney General was not independent from the White House and his tenure eroded public confidence in the top law enforcement agency of the federal government. During the confirmation hearings, Mr. Mukaseys refusal to state clearly that waterboarding is torture caused me to seriously question his commitment to the rule of law in the face of White House pressure. A November 2, 2007 letter sent to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy from four retired generals and admirals, each of whom has substantial experience as Judge Advocates in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps stated: Waterboarding is inhumane, it is torture and it is illegalAll U.S. government agencies and personnel must abide by both the spirit and letter of the controlling provisions of international law. Cruelty and torture  no less than wanton killing  is neither justified nor legal in any circumstances. [emphasis original] At stake is not just the vitally important matter of ensuring the United States has a strong top law enforcement officer who can put the Justice Department back in order. As I considered this nomination, I gave weight to the signal this nomination sends to the world, especially to the allies this Administration has alienated. I am also concerned that American troops who are captured could be subjected to this type of torture.  ###
