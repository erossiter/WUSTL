Casey on Bush Iraq Speech  September 13, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - Following President Bushs prime-time address on his Iraq plan, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement:  Weve heard this speech before. In President Bushs previous prime-time addresses, he has given the same speech and offered the same Iraq policy. Under the Bush plan, we will have the same number of troops in Iraq next summer as we had in Iraq last year. That isnt a new policy; it is an attempt to put a positive spin on more of the same.  Since Mission Accomplished President Bush has refused to level with the American people, admit his policies in Iraq arent working and change course. Our brave men and women are paying the price for those mistakes. Over 3,700 American troops including 177 Pennsylvanians have already lost their lives in Iraq. The Iraqi government leaders must take responsibility for their country. They need to know that the U.S. will not continue to fight and die for them indefinitely. The troops have done their job. Now is the time to responsibly redeploy. As the Senate prepares to debate our Iraq policy next week, it is my hope that the growing number of Republican senators expressing doubt about the Bush policy in Iraq will join me in pushing for a change of course.
