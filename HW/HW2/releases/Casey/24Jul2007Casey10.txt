Casey Introduces Resolution on Russian Suspension of Arms Control Treaty  July 24, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today introduced a bipartisan resolution in the Senate expressing disappointment and urging President Vladimir Putin to reconsider his decision to suspend the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. Putin made the announcement on July 14, 2007 and the suspension of compliance goes into effect in 150 days.  President Putins announcement that Russia intends to suspend compliance with the CFE Treaty is disappointing and a step backwards for the security of Europe and U.S.-Russian relations, said Casey. This suspension is only the latest in a series of alarming steps taken by the Putin Administration. We need to send a strong message to President Putin that the United States does not condone his actions. The announcement made by President Putin follows a series of threats on the treaty made by Russian officials in response to proposed U.S. plans to deploy missile defense systems in Eastern Europe and the construction of U.S. training facilities in Bulgaria and Romania.  The CFE Treaty, signed in 1990, has served as an important force for stability and transparency in Europe and is widely recognized as one of the most successful arms control treaties in modern era. It established comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment in Europe and mandated the destruction of excess weaponry. Casey added, A Russia that seeks to build a permanent partnership with the West cannot act this in this manner.  The resolution is cosponsored by Senators Gordon Smith (R-OR), Chris Dodd (D-CT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Jim DeMint (R-SC).
