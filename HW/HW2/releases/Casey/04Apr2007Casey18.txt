Casey, local doctor press for CHIP funding  April 4, 2007  A strong health-care program for children brings one of the best-known returns on investment, Johnstown Dr. Matthew Masiello says. Masiello joined U.S. Sen. Bob Casey on Tuesday in calling for continued federal funding for state Children's Health Insurance Programs.  The federal budget proposed by President Bush would cut funding for state CHIP coverage and Head Start preschool, Casey said during a press conference at the Cambria City Head Start center.  About 1.5 million children in the U.S. receive free health insurance through CHIP, but another 9 million are uninsured, Casey said.  The moral obligation of this country is to re-enact the CHIP program and get to work real fast on the 9 million children in this country who are not covered.  Prevention is one of the greatest benefits of good health-care plans, Masiello said. Prevention is key to life, Masiello said. This program really speaks of prevention. It helps children get to their pediatricians and learn about health issues that affect them. They get vaccinated and all the preventive things.  In Cambria County, Masiello said, reports show about 500 children have no insurance. Within Conemaugh Health System's expanded service area, there are thousands more. Establishing good medical care and health practices will pay dividends in job productivity and health-care savings in the future, Masiello said.  These children are going to be the economy of the future, Casey said.  Democrats, with support from many Republicans, have proposed setting aside billions to promote health and education for children. Casey criticized the Bush administration for cutting children's programs such as CHIP and Head Start while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.
