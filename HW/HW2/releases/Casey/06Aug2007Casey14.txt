Casey Statement on FISA Votes August 6, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - Following the votes on the temporary FISA bills, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) issued the following statement:  I voted for both versions of the temporary FISA fix in order to ensure that U.S. intelligence has the tools they need to target terrorists while a larger review of the FISA law is conducted.  The Bond-McConnell version supported by the White House is far from ideal and I deplore the tactics employed by the Bush Administration to push its agenda through the politics of fear.  A thorough review when cooler heads can prevail is needed for a permanent FISA fix that keeps the United States safe from terrorists while also safeguarding the rights of American citizens.
