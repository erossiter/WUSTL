Casey Statement on National Peace Officers' Memorial Service  May 15, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement on the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service:  I join the Nation in paying tribute to the 147 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty last year including three who ended their watch in Pennsylvania: Police Officer Scott A. Wertz of the Reading Police Department, Police Officer Gary Skerski of the Philadelphia Police Department, and Investigator David Petzold of the Upper Saucon Township Police Department.  They made the ultimate sacrifice as they protected our communities. Today we remember their service and honor their memory. My thoughts and prayers are with these fallen law enforcement officers and their families.
