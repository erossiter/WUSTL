Caset Disappointed By Failure Of Homeland Security Funding Vote March 6, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement today on the Senate's failure to pass the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment which would have recalculated how homeland security grant funding is distributed to place more of an emphasis on risk assessment. Senator Casey is a cosponsor of the amendment. I am very disappointed that the Senate failed to pass the risk-based Homeland Security Grants Amendment which I cosponsored. Pennsylvania would have stood to gain more than a million dollars this year to strengthen the state's preparedness and to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Today Pennsylvania's ports, transit system, stadiums, and historic sites are all vulnerable to terrorism; it is no wonder why both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have been included in the 50 most at-risk urban regions. I will continue to stand up for Pennsylvania during the appropriations process to insist our homeland security programs are adequately funded.
