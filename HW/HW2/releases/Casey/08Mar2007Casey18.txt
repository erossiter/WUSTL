Casey on Afghanistan Hearing  March 8, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCU.S. Senator Bob Casey released the following statement on today's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Afghanistan:  I am glad the Foreign Relations Committee is holding a hearing today to assess the current strategy in Afghanistan.  Largely owing to the war in Iraq, the Bush Administration has lost focus on Afghanistan. Last year, we saw a resurgent Taliban, growing violence -- including an alarming rise in the types of suicide bombings and IED attacks so common in Iraq --and a ballooning opium trade.  There is also a need for greater cooperation with Pakistan to ensure that Taliban and al Qaeda elements are unable to use border regions for sanctuary and cross border attacks into Afghanistan.  Because we have failed to complete the job, we risk allowing Afghanistan to once again become a terrorist haven.  At today's hearing, Senator Casey relayed his strong concern to Assistant Secretary of State, Ambassador Richard Boucher, the Administration's point person on Afghanistan, that both the United States and its NATO allies are not providing adequate troop levels to prepare for the Taliban's expected spring offensive.  While a military solution is necessary, it is not sufficient. Senator Casey called on the Administration to work with other international donors in accelerating reconstruction work in Afghanistan to help secure a functioning democracy and provide Afghan citizens with a clear alternative to a return to life under the Taliban.  In his opening statement General James L. Jones, Jr., USMC (Ret.), former Commander, United States European Command and Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, referred to Senator Casey's questioning of Ambassador Boucher on Pakistan when he commented on the need for improvement in the Pakistan-Afghanistan relationship.
