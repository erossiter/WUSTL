Casey: Troops have won their war August 9, 2007  On his first visit to Iraq, Sen. Bob Casey Jr. said Wednesday that while a good argument could be made that the troops ''have won the war,'' the political progress there remains the big obstacle to success. ''The [Bush] administration and the political leadership in Iraq have to begin to have progress such that it matches or has a corresponding intensity that our troops have displayed on the battlefield,'' Casey, D-Pa., said in a conference call with reporters. ''The troops have met every assignment.  You could make a good argument that they have won the war.'' Casey, who voted in July to require a redeployment of troops by April 2008, flew into Baghdad early Wednesday with Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, had lunch with troops from Pennsylvania and Illinois and later met with with Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker. He was expected to spend today in Iraq before flying to Jordan. The last of the more than 20,000 additional troops sent to Iraq through Bush's build-up strategy arrived in June, and the military is expected to give Congress a full progress report in September. An interim report on the progress of the troop surge in July found that Iraq's new government had failed to meet several political benchmarks established by Congress.
