Casey Disappointed By House CHIP Vote  October 18, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC-Following the failure of the U.S. House of Representatives to override President George Bushs veto of childrens health insurance legislation, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement: President Bush and a minority of House members who today upheld his veto are jeopardizing the health care of millions of children. The only thing worse than the veto itself has been the misleading rhetoric used by the President to make ideological arguments.  This program has worked well to provide insurance coverage for 6.6 million children and the bipartisan legislation would add another 3.8 million. Why is President Bush against health coverage for 10 million kids? The fight is not over. I will continue to join with bipartisan majorities in Congress, 43 governors, groups ranging from hospitals to law enforcement and the vast majority of the American people who support an expansion of the childrens health insurance program.  ###
