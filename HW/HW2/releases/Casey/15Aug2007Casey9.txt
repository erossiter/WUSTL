Casey Visits Bellefonte Pre-K Center  August 15, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today visited a pre-kindergarten education program in Centre County where he observed the classroom activities, read a book to the children and discussed education and health care issues with local educators. This pre-k program in Bellefonte is lucky to be a recipient of funding through Pennsylvanias Pre-K Counts program, said Senator Casey. Unfortunately, there are still many children in Pennsylvania and around the country who do not have access to quality pre-k education. That is why I introduced my Prepare All Kids Act to build on the commitment of the Pre-K Counts program in Pennsylvania to provide more assistance for early childhood education and to help other states who arent fortunate enough to have a Governor who recognizes the irreplaceable value of investing in children. Senator Casey also discussed the importance of expanding the childrens health insurance program to cover an additional 3.2 million uninsured children, including over 100,000 children in Pennsylvania. Senator Casey said: The childrens health insurance legislation passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support. The President has threatened to veto this legislation. I hope that the President will abandon his opposition and think of the six million children currently enrolled in the program and the more than three million children who stand to gain coverage under this bill.  During his visit to the program at the Bellefonte Family YMCA, Senator Casey read the Berenstain Bears Go to the Doctor to the children and talked to them about what they have done over the summer.  Senator Caseys stop in Bellefonte is a continuation of a series of visits he has made to schools and hospitals to highlight the importance of quality education and health care for children. He will continue to make similar visits around the Commonwealth during August.
