Casey Statement on Four Years in Iraq  March 19, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today released the following statement:  As we mark the four year anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq, we honor the brave men and women who have served in Iraq and pay tribute to the 3,200 U.S. troops -- including 156 Pennsylvanians -- who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  For the 24,000 U.S. troops injured, we must reestablish our commitment to them and pledge to do better in providing them the quality care that they deserve.  Looking forward, we also owe our troops and the American people a better policy in Iraq. We need a new policy that does not repeat the same mistakes of the last four years.
