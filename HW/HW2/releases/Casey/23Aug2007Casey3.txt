Casey reflects on Iraq August 23, 2007  COLLIER TWP. - People are missing the point when they debate whether the surge of U.S. troops in Iraq has worked, according to U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Scranton. Casey recently returned from a trip to Iraq, where he had an opportunity to see whether things are progressing and what troops are facing each day. He spoke Wednesday about his thoughts on the war after he toured the Charles E. Kelly Support Facility in Collier Township. Casey said he was protected with body armor, helmet and armed escorts during his time in the Baghdad area, where he met with Iraqi officials and U.S. troops from Pennsylvania. The experience gave Casey what he called a limited but revealing sense of what the troops are going through. Casey, who voted against sending more troops to Iraq, said the objective of the surge was to create conditions where the Iraqi government and forces would take control of their own country. The measurement of success in Iraq is based on whether the Iraqi government can govern itself, whether the Iraqi army can protect the country, and whether the Iraqi police force is incorruptible and can enforce the law. None of that has happened, and the Iraqi government isn't getting the job done, Casey said. Casey said there are anecdotal successes one could point to in Iraq, but that's not the point. U.S. troops have done their jobs, and there is a long way to go until the objective is met, Casey said.
