Casey Urges Passage Of Bipartisan Hate Crimes Bill April 13, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC]- U.S. Senator Bob Casey [D-PA] today joined senators from both sides of the aisle in introducing legislation to strengthen and expand the federal hate crimes law. In addition to strengthening the enforcement and prosecution of hate crimes based on race, ethnicity, national origin, and religion, the legislation would expand the definition of hate crimes to cover crimes motivated by gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability.  Crimes motivated by hatred and bigotry are especially grievous and must be vigorously prevented and prosecuted, said Casey. The values I live by call on me to do all I can to ensure that not one more son or daughter become the victim of a hate crime.  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act (LLEEA), also sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Gordon Smith (R-OR), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and others strengthens state and local efforts by enabling the Justice Department to assist them in the investigation of hate crimes. It also provides grants to help state and local governments meet the expenses involved in hate crimes.
