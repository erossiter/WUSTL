Casey Statement On U.S. Airways Pittsburgh Announcement  February 21, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC-- Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey issued the following statement on the announcement by U.S. Airways on their plans to build their Operations Control Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania:  This is great news! I applaud today's decision by U.S. Airways to build the Operations Control Center in Pittsburgh, said Casey. The city of Pittsburgh beat out two other cities for control of the center. Today's decision means that more than 600 new jobs will be created and once again shows U.S. Airways has a strong commitment to the city of Pittsburgh. I look forward to working with the airlines to help facilitate the process.
