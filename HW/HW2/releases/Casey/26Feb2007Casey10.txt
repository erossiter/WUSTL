Casey To Introduce Rendell At Amtrak Hearing February 26, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCU.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) tomorrow will introduce Gov. Ed Rendell (D-PA) who will be testifying at the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing on Amtrak revitalization and the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007. The hearing will take place at 10:00am in Russell 253.  Casey is a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation to address Amtrak's funding shortfall. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 will authorize almost $20 billion in federal funds for Amtrak by authorizing $3.2 billion per year for six years. This legislation aims to assist Amtrak in providing better service for its customers including reducing delays, refinancing its debt, creating a new financial accounting system, and improve the overall security for all its passengers.  Casey opposes the cuts to Amtrak funding proposed by the Bush budget. He will join his colleagues in the U.S. Senate to ensure these cuts do not become law.
