Casey And Specter Introduce Resolution To Celebrate National Agriculture Day  March 21, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC-U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Arlen Specter (R-PA) today introduced a bipartisan resolution to designate March 21, 2007 as National Agriculture Day.  Pennsylvania has a long proud history and agriculture has been its foundation from the beginning, said Casey. Farmers and agricultural workers are the unsung heroes of the Commonwealth and the nation. This resolution is just one way for America to thank them for their efforts.  Agriculture is the backbone of Pennsylvania, said Senator Specter. I am pleased to join Senator Casey in recognizing the contributions agricultural producers make to the Commonwealth and the nation.  Agriculture is Pennsylvania's number one industry and has contributed more than $45 billion to its economy. The state is home to more than 58,000 farms, covering more than 7.7 million acres of land, and is a leading producer of mushrooms, eggs, pumpkins, apples, milk, chickens and many other agricultural products.  National Agriculture Day is celebrated annually on the first day of spring. Its goal is to recognize and celebrate the abundance provided by agriculture. Every year, producers, agricultural associations, corporations, universities, government agencies and countless others across America join together to recognize the contributions of agriculture. The Casey-Specter resolution creates the designation of National Agriculture Day for calendar year 2007.
