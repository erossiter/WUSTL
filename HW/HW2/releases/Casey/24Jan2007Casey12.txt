Statement of Sen. Casey on Committee Passage of Iraq Resolution January 24, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCFollowing passage of the Biden-Hagel-Levin resolution on Iraq by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Senator Bob Casey released the following statement:  I strongly supported, and voted for, the bipartisan resolution passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today.  The Foreign Relations Committee has held hearings over the past three weeks  sometimes two hearings a day  to ask questions of the Administration and of experts on Iraq. I hope the President was listening. While the President has ignored the views of the Congress in his recent Iraq address and in last nights State of the Union, I hope he will now listen to the Congress and to the bipartisan opposition to an escalation in Iraq.
