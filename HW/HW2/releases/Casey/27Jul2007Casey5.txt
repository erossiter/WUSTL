Casey: Passage of Homeland Security Bills Will Help Secure PA  July 27, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - Following Senate passage of the Homeland Security appropriations bill and a bill to finally implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement: Both homeland security bills represent a major step forward in protecting the United States from a terrorist attack. Implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations was one of my top priorities when I was running for the U.S. Senate. And the Homeland Security appropriations bill adds vital resources to improve security around the nation.These bills will help secure Pennsylvania in a number of ways including by restructuring the homeland security grant program to allocate more funding based on risk and will result in more funding for Pennsylvania, creating a new grant program to fund interoperable radio projects like the one sought by SEPTA in Philadelphia and increasing funds available to help protect ports, rails systems and airports.It is unconscionable and a disservice to the security of the United States that it has taken three years and a change of leadership in Congress for the 9/11 Commission recommendations to pass the Senate. The urgency in passing these bills was further emphasized by the recent National Intelligence Estimate showing that Al Qaeda has regained strength to 2001 levels. I hope that President Bush will finally put aside his opposition to these recommendations and swiftly sign them into law when they reach his desk.Senator Casey joined Senators Barack Obama (D-IL), Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) in introducing an amendment passed as part of the Homeland Security appropriations bill to reduce the abuse of the tax system by contractors receiving homeland security grants. The Government Accountability Office has found that a number of contractors have repeatedly failed to pay taxes despite receiving millions of dollars in federal contracts. The amendment will require recipients of DHS grants in excess of $5 million to certify that they do not have unpaid federal taxes.
