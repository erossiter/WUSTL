Casey joins freshman lawmakers in Democratic power shift  January 4, 2007  Bob Casey Jr., Pennsylvania's second Democratic U.S. senator in four decades, took the oath of office today using a Bible given to him by his father, the late Gov. Robert P. Casey Sr. As Vice President Dick Cheney swore in Casey and other Senate colleagues, Casey's wife, Terese, watched from above, sitting in the visitor's gallery near Bill and Chelsea Clinton.  Casey was among five new members of Congress from Pennsylvania. Patrick Murphy, a Bucks County Democrat who served in the Iraq War, took the oath at noon on the U.S. House side of the Capitol.  Casey, 46, of Scranton, helped by a national anti-Republican wave, defeated U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., to jump from a state Cabinet post to Capitol Hill. Murphy defeated U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick.  It's a day of change, but  also a day of renewal, Casey said. Because when you take the oath of office, you renew your commitment to public service  (and) to get the people's business done.  It's very emotional, his wife Terese said at a pre-oath reception. It's incredible.  We're very excited, said 18-year-old daughter Elyse, a high school senior. He's worked so hard the last few years, and now he's actually got to what he worked for.  Democrats Jason Altmire, Chris Carney and Joe Sestak round out the state's new congressional crop. They defeated Republican lawmakers in Pittsburgh, Scranton and Delaware County, respectively, to reach the U.S. House.  Congress today gained 52 new House members and 10 new senators. Democrats regained control of both houses for the first time in 12 years. Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco liberal, became the nation's first female Speaker of the House.
