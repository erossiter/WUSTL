Casey Meets With Assistant Energy Secretary to Discuss Power Corridor October 17, 2007  WASHINGTON, D.C.- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today met with Assistant Secretary of Energy Kevin Kolevar to discuss his opposition to the designation of 52 of Pennsylvanias 67 counties as part of the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC).   While I support the goal of providing reliable electricity to consumers, I am extremely concerned that the benefits of the NIETC only help other states, said Casey.  There are too many issues at stake here including the negative impacts to property values, electric rates, and quality of life. I am going to continue to do everything in my power as a U.S. Senator to fight to make sure that all Pennsylvanians are heard.   During todays meeting, Senator Casey raised his many concerned over the high voltage power line to the Assistant Energy Secretary.  Senator Casey also mentioned that any effort to increase reliability in Pennsylvania should complement the Commonwealths goals to increase the use of renewable power sources and reduce greenhouse gas and other air emissions Last week Senator joined local Greene and Washington County officials and residents to discuss the planned power line known as TrAIL.  At the event, Senator Casey and the rest of the participants gave an overview of the proposed project as well as discuss the economic and residential impact the power line will have on the community.  Senator Casey has written two letters to the U.S. Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman, expressing his opposition to the Department of Energys final decision to build the (NIETC) through 52 of Pennsylvanias 67 counties and has yet to hear back from Secretary Bodman.   ###
