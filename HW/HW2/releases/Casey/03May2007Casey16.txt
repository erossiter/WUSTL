Casey Votes for Safe Prescription Drug Reimportation  May 3, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC-U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) applauded today's Senate vote to invoke cloture on an amendment to save consumers money by allowing the reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs.  When a working family is paying for food or child care or health care, or when an older citizen is having trouble paying the rent or buying food, they often have to make the terrible choice between these necessities and their prescription drugs.  These are people who lead lives of struggle -- not lives of privilege -- and they don't have high-priced lobbyists working for them. These are people who have to struggle just to make ends meet.  So when the Congressional Budget Office tells us that the same FDA-approved brand name drugs cost 35 to 55 percent less in other countries than they do here in the U.S, the federal government should give Americans the ability to import these drugs in a safe manner.  I urge the Senate to think of their constituents and quickly pass this legislation.  Senator Casey spoke out in favor of this legislation on the Senate floor yesterday. He is also cosponsoring the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act (S.242) that would allow reimportation.
