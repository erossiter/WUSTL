Casey Statement on Global Warming Amendment  May 15, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement after the vote on an amendment to require the Army Corps of Engineers to consider the impact of global warming on water projects:  Today, a majority of the U.S. Senate went on record recognizing the effect that global warming will have on water infrastructure in the United States. While it did not receive the 60 votes required under Senate procedures, it made a strong statement in the larger, ongoing debate on the very real problems posed by global warming. A number of man-made factors are contributing to global warming and the warming impacts many aspects of our environment and our daily lives.  We should take into account the impact of global warming -- the rising water levels caused by melting, droughts caused by changing weather patterns -- on our water infrastructure just as I have said we need to assess the impact of global warming on our national security.  At a Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week, Senator Casey discussed a recent Department of Defense-funded study that found global warming poses a serious threat to national security. The report by the Center for Naval Analyses was released last month.  He is a cosponsor of the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act (S.1018), a bill introduced by Senators Durbin and Hagel that would require the Intelligence Community to produce a National Intelligence Estimate on the anticipated geopolitical effects of global climate change and their resulting consequences for America's national security.
