Casey Applauds Passage of 9/11 Commission Recommendations  March 13, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement on the passage of legislation to enact the 9/11 Commission recommendations:  Almost three years after the 9/11 Commission recommendations were issued, I am pleased to vote in favor of legislation to implement these much needed safeguards.
