Casey on Alberto Gonzalez Resignation  August 27, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC - Following the announcement of the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement: After months of refusing to step aside, Alberto Gonzalez has finally done the right thing to begin restoring confidence in the leadership of the Justice Department. The President's failure to make a change over many months eroded confidence in our system of justice. It is time for the appointment of a truly independent Attorney General, not another Administration loyalist.
