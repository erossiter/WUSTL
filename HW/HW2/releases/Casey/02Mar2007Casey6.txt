Casey: National Guard Stretched Too Thin March 2, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCAt a press conference today in the U.S. Capitol, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) addressed the report released yesterday by the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves on how thinly stretched the National Guard and Reserves troops. Senator Casey also released the following statement:  This report is one in a steady stream of bad news for not just the Guard, and certainly their families and our readiness. A full 88 percent of Guard units are not ready. The Guard is stretched too thin. This really is a question of national security. And it also impacts the abilities of the States to respond to natural disasters and emergencies. We must address this crisis in the appropriations process this year, make sure that the Pentagon now gives this lack of readiness immediate attention, and reverse this dangerous course.
