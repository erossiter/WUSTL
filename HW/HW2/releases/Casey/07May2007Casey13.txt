Casey Comments on Fruit Growers Following Adams County Visit  May 7, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - Following his visit to an Adams County apple orchard and processing facility, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement on his visit and federal policy affecting Pennsylvania apple growers:  Today, I was able to continue my tour of Pennsylvania agriculture to hear firsthand from farmers as the Senate begins debate on the farm bill.  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I will work to fully represent the interests of Pennsylvania apple growers in the upcoming farm bill. Specialty crops like apples make up more than half of American agricultural products. And Pennsylvania is the fourth largest grower of apples.  The farm bill should treat specialty crops equitably by providing increased support in important areas like research and development, marketing, and conservation. Also, to help apple growers and to provide better nourishment, federal nutrition programs should expand purchases of fruits and vegetables.
