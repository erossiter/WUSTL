Casey Pays Tribute to Pennsylvanians Killed in Iraq  July 11, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC- On the Senate floor today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) paid tribute to the 169 Pennsylvanians killed in Iraq and the sacrifices made by these troops and their families. In his remarks, Senator Casey read the name and hometown of all 169 Pennsylvanians killed.  A copy of his remarks is attached.  ### Remarks of U.S. Senator Bob Casey As Prepared July 11, 2007 Mr. President, the Senate is once again debating future U.S. policy in Iraq. I have long advocated a new direction for our policy. I will continue to vote in a manner consistent with changing course in Iraq.  However, today I rise to not speak about policy, tactics, or strategy. I will speak today only about our troops and their families. The numbers are important: 1) 3,609 Americans have lost their lives, including 169 from Pennsylvania  the third highest toll of any state; 2) Over 25,000 have been wounded, including more than 1,100 from Pennsylvania; 3) Approximately 156,000 Americans, both active-duty and reserve forces, are currently serving in Iraq, including more than 8,000 from Pennsylvania; Those numbers surely dont tell the whole story. Especially when we consider the traumatic effect the war has had on individual families. These fighting men and women were born into families, not into divisions and brigades. They are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, fathers and mothers. Their love for their families is matched only by their devotion to our country.  This war has impacted these families in different ways. We remember with gratitude and reverence those more than 3600 soldiers and marines who have died  who gave, as President Lincoln said, the last full measure of devotion to their country. Their families have loved and lost and the sharp pain of that loss may, we pray, diminish over time but the ache, the hurt, will long endure because someone they loved, someone whose strong and warm embrace gave them comfort, will not be there any longer. Theyre missing. Some families have a loved one who served in Iraq and returned home, but was one of the 25,000 wounded. Those families have paid a terrible price for the courage and dedication of their family members. The bravery of our fighting men and women is so inspiring! I met one of them in March who represents so many across this land of the brave, our America. His name is Joshua Humberger of Grapeville, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania  and he is 20 years old.  Like many of our troops, Joshua comes from a small town, in southwestern Pennsylvania; he is in the Army National Guard. He received the Purple Heart and other commendations after he was wounded when the vehicle he was riding in was hit by a bomb, killing his commander, Sgt. First Class Daniel Brozovich of Greenville, PA. Two others, Ryan Griffin and Robert Kaminski, both of Allegheny County, were injured. To say that Joshua was injured is an understatement. A newspaper article put it this way:   His left leg was amputated at the knee. His stomach was  pierced by shrapnel and surgeons had to remove part of   his lower bowel. Despite all of this pain that he and his wife, Jessica, have endured, he said during our visit, I want to go back, to continue serving. Where do these young men and women find their strength? I dont know, because its hard for me to comprehend or fully appreciate such courage. They must find it from a deep reservoir of faith, the love of their family, and an abiding allegiance to this nation. Other families have loved ones who are in Iraq now or had been there for a long time. Even if a soldier isnt killed or wounded, while theyre in Iraq, theyre missing. The great rock music icon Bruce Springsteens words come to mind, written in the aftermath of 9/11, but they help explain what our families have endured during this war. His song, Youre Missing says in part:  Your house is waiting, your house is waitingFor you to walk inBut you're missingYou're missing when I shut out the lightsYou're missing when I close my eyesYou're missing when I see the sun riseYou're missingChildren are asking if it's alrightWill you be in our arms tonight? And, so, to pay tribute to those who are missing from their homes and their families because they lost their life on a battlefield in Iraq, I want to take a few minutes to read the names and hometowns of the 169 Pennsylvanians killed in action: Shawn M.
