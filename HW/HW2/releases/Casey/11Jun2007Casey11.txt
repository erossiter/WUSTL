Casey Votes No Confidence in Gonzalez  June 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - After voting for a no confidence resolution on U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) issued the following statement:  Serious questions have been raised about the integrity and effectiveness of the nations top law enforcement officer. I had hoped and have called for Attorney General to resign months ago.  If the Attorney General will not resign, the President should show leadership and remove him from office. Unfortunately, neither the Attorney General nor the President has done what is necessary to restore confidence in the Justice Department.  Today, a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate went on record expressing no confidence in the Attorney General. It is my hope this vote will help to bring about a needed change in leadership at the Justice Department. Senator Casey is a cosponsor of the resolution. The vote was on a cloture on the motion to proceed to the no confidence resolution.
