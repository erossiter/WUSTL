Statement by Senator Casey on Bush Budget  February 5, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCToday, U.S. Senator Bob Casey released the following statement on President Bushs budget proposal:  I have completed my initial review of President Bushs proposed FY 2008 budget and in my judgment, it contains the wrong priorities. The Bush budget cuts programs important to Pennsylvanians in order to pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy.  The Presidents proposal extends lavish tax cuts to the top one-percent while cutting programs for working families, the poor, and Pennsylvania. Funding for education, childrens health care, Medicare, Medicaid, law enforcement, and Amtrak is either cut, eliminated or does not keep up with need.  The President is using the funding cuts to these vital programs to spend billions of dollars to finance tax cuts for the top one-percent.  The President proposes massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Education funding will be cut below FY06 levels. And funding for the State Childrens Health Insurance program will not even cover all children currently enrolled in the program.  At a time when violence in Philadelphia is at a high level and security is a top concern around the country, we need more funding for law enforcement, not an elimination of the COPS program. In FY2006, Pennsylvania received $5 million to fund police officers on the beat. Under the Presidents proposal, in 2008, our state will get nothing.  President Bush yet again slashed funding for Amtrak. This is shortsighted and harmful to the thousands of people and businesses which depend on Amtrak service. Earlier this year, I signed onto a letter calling for an increase in Amtrak funding above past levels. The Bush proposal goes in the opposite direction.
