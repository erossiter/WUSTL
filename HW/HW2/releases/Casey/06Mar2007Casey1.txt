Casey Reiterates Call for Libby No-Pardon Pledge March 6, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCAfter the guilty verdict in the I. Lewis Scooter Libby case, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement:  This was an unfortunate and troubling incident from the very beginning. I'm sure there will be an extensive appeals process. However, at the outset of the Libby case, I called on President Bush to pledge not to pardon Scooter Libby. President Bush should now make that pledge and not overturn the jury verdict.  In October 2005, then a Senate candidate, Casey first called on President Bush to take the no-pardon pledge.
