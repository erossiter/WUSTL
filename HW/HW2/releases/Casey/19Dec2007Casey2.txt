Specter and Casey Announce Senate Approval of Pennsylvania Housing and Economic Development Projects  December 19, 2007  Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senators Arlen Specter, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, and Bob Casey, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, announced today the Senate has approved funding for several Pennsylvania housing and economic development projects. The projects are contained in the Fiscal Year 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Bill. I am pleased my colleagues have agreed to provide federal funding to these projects which will revitalize and improve cities and towns across the Commonwealth, said Senator Specter. Rehabilitation and construction of these sites has the potential to be a great impetus for future cultural and economic growth. This money for housing projects is great news for Pennsylvania and I am grateful that my colleagues approved this funding, said Senator Casey.
