Casey Statement on Stem Cell Bill  April 6, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC-U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement on the stem cell research bill to be voted on by the Senate:  As I said throughout my Senate campaign, I support the current federal policy funding embryonic stem cell research. There have been several encouraging scientific developments that hold promise for the treatment of a number of diseases and conditions. In particular, advances in amniotic stem cell and adult-cell reprogramming research give new hope for scientific breakthroughs.  In addition, I support increased funding for research on umbilical cord and placenta stem cells as well as the possibility of embryonic stem cell research methods that do not destroy the embryo. I also support increased funding for basic health research through the National Institutes of Health.  I remain opposed to federal funding for research that involves the destruction of living embryos. That is why I cannot support S.5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.  Over the past several months, I have met with many people on all sides of this issue. I have listened carefully, especially to those whose loved ones are suffering from serious diseases and disabilities and who disagree with my position. I deeply respect their views and hope they can come to understand mine.
