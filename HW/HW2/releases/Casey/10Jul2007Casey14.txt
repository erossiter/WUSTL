Casey Announces $3 Million For Pennsylvania To Fight Emerald Ash Borer  July 10, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will give Pennsylvania $3 million in emergency funding to fight the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). Senator Casey requested the money after learning that the EAB had made its way into Butler County.  This is great news for Southwestern Pennsylvania, said Senator Casey. I spoke with Secretary Johanns on the phone and he assured me he would do everything he could to prevent the EAB from spreading throughout the Commonwealth. I really appreciate his prompt response to my request. This money will go a long way to help stop this invasive species from moving across Pennsylvania. Two weeks ago, Senator Casey sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns requesting immediate assistance to combat and prevent the spread of the EAB. The pest has been responsible for killing millions of ash trees in the U.S. It was found in Cranberry Township, Butler County at the end of June.  In the letter, Casey asked Secretary Johanns to take swift and comprehensive steps to prevent the species from spreading throughout the Commonwealth. Casey went on to write, I am extremely concerned about the ramifications EAB could have on Pennsylvanias ash trees and our commercial nursery industry. Senator Casey spoke with Secretary Johanns on Tuesday, July 3rd.  Pennsylvania can use the money for enforcement of the quarantines, surveying for the beetle, rapid response to contain the beetle and public education.  The Emerald Ash Borer is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches. Infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years. ###
