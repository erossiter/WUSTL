Bush Vetoes Labor-HHS Bill with Philadelphia Higher Ed Funding  November 13, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today announced that President Bush vetoed the FY08 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill which contains $500,000 for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Higher Education Consortium (SEPCHE). This project will fund math and science programs and is one of Senator Caseys top priorities in this years spending bill. The veto of this bill is just another example of President Bushs misplaced priorities, said Casey. Studies have shown that the more students are given access to high quality math and science educational programs, the more likely they will succeed. It is my hope that Congress can override his veto so that we can give our students access to quality math and science education programs. SEPCHE is a non-profit consortium of eight colleges and universities in the greater Philadelphia area. The colleges and universities include: Arcadia University, Cabrini College, Chestnut Hill College, Gwynedd-Mercy College, Holy Family University, Immaculata University, Neumann College and Rosemont College. The consortium was founded in 1993 to enhance the quality of educational programs through collaboration.  Funding will be used to support the SEPCHE Institute of Mathematics and Science, including a summer program for K-12 math/science teachers and development of instructional materials for dissemination to K-12 classrooms. Funding will also be utilized for ongoing professional development of the Institutes instructors.  The FY08 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill will now likely go back to Congress for a veto override. If two thirds of both Chambers of Congress vote to override the Presidents veto, the bill will become law.  ###
