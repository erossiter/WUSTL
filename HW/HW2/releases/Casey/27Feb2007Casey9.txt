Casey Introduces Rendell and Offers Strong Support for Amtrak Bill February 27, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCU.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today introduced Gov. Ed Rendell (D-PA) who testified at a Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing on Amtrak revitalization and the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007. In his introduction, Casey emphasized his support for the Amtrak bill.  Increasing Amtrak funding and opposing the proposed Bush cuts to Amtrak are two of my top priorities, said Casey. Amtrak service is vital to the Pennsylvania economy, especially in Southeast Pennsylvania. And with gas prices on the rise and traffic congestion increasing, Amtrak offers travelers and commuters more transit choices. I am honored to introduce Governor Rendell who shares my strong support for Amtrak.  Casey is a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation to address Amtrak's funding shortfall. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 will authorize almost $20 billion in federal funds for Amtrak by authorizing $3.2 billion per year for six years. This legislation aims to assist Amtrak in providing better service for its customers including reducing delays, refinancing its debt, creating a new financial accounting system, and improve the overall security for all its passengers.
