Casey votes in favor of resolution opposing Iraq plan  January 25, 2007  WASHINGTON - Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey was one of 11 Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to vote Wednesday in support of a resolution that said increasing the troop level in Iraq was not in the national interest of the United States. Casey, a freshman, said he strongly supported the resolution, which passed 12-9. The vote came the day after President Bush, in his State of the Union address, asked lawmakers to give the plan a chance. Two weeks ago, Bush announced he would order an additional 21,500 troops into Iraq.  While the president has ignored the views of the Congress in his recent Iraq address and in last night's State of the Union, I hope he will now listen to the Congress and to the bipartisan opposition to an escalation in Iraq, Casey said in a statement. For the past three weeks, the committee has had hearings on the Iraq war. Casey said he hoped the president was listening.  Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has said he is skeptical of the plan.
