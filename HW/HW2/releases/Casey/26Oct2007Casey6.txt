Casey Announces Senate Approval of $500,000 for Southeastern Pennsylvania Higher Education Consortium  October 26, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today announced that the Senate approved $500,000 for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Higher Education Consortium (SEPCHE) under the FY08 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill. This project will fund math and science programs and is one of Senator Caseys top priorities in this years spending bill. Studies have shown that the more students are given access to high quality math and science educational programs, the more likely they will succeed, said Casey. I applaud the Senate for recognizing the importance of funding math and science programs. I will continue to fight to make sure students are given every chance to succeed. SEPCHE is a non-profit consortium of eight colleges and universities in the greater Philadelphia area. The colleges and universities include: Arcadia University, Cabrini College, Chestnut Hill College, Gwynedd-Mercy College, Holy Family University, Immaculata University, Neumann College and Rosemont College. The consortium was founded in 1993 to enhance the quality of educational programs through collaboration.  Funding will be used to support the SEPCHE Institute of Mathematics and Science, including a summer program for K-12 math/science teachers and development of instructional materials for dissemination to K-12 classrooms. Funding will also be utilized for ongoing professional development of the Institutes instructors.  The bill must now be approved by the full Congress and the President, who has threatened to veto this legislation, before funding is final.  ###
