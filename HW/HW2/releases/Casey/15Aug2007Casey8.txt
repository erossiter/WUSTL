Casey Urges Swift SBA Action on Allegheny County Flood Relief August 15, 2007  WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) has called on the Small Business Administration to quickly approve disaster relief for residents of Allegheny County and the surrounding area. The declaration would make those affected by the flooding eligible for loan aid. Heavy rains across southwestern Pennsylvania over the last several days, and particularly over the period from August 6 through 9, produced flooding in portions of Allegheny County and surrounding areas, wrote Senator Casey. I write to request that you promptly review and approve Governor Rendells request for disaster loan authorization so that recovery relief can get to the residents and business owners as quickly as possible.  A copy of Senator Caseys letter to the SBA is attached. Governor Ed Rendell has formally requested that the SBA declare Allegheny County a disaster area. If the disaster relief is approved, homeowners would be eligible for loans up to $200,000 to repair or replace their home. Homeowners and renters would also be eligible for up to $40,000 in loans to cover losses to personal property. Businesses and non-profits can receive up to $1.5 million in loans to cover buildings, equipment and inventory.
