Casey Introduces Resolution Expressing Opposition to Contracting out of Mail Delivery  July 31, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced a resolution expressing that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) should discontinue the practice of contracting out mail delivery services.  The protection of our mail delivery services is vitally important to our personnel and national security, said Casey. Contracting out mail delivery services runs the risk of exposing mail delivery to identity theft, terrorism, or other criminal intent. This resolution will discourage the practice of contracting out mail delivery services and will save career jobs. Currently, the USPS delivers mail to more than 144,000,000 homes and businesses across the nation. The bulk of the work is done by career letter carriers who have undergone background checks. To cut costs, the Postmaster General is attempting to hire additional private contractors to deliver the mail. Often, these contractors are subject to no or minimal background checks.
