Bob Casey headed to Iraq August 7, 2007  Freshman Sen. Bob Casey Jr. is headed to Iraq, his office said late Tuesday. Casey was supposed to visit Iraq earlier this year but the trip was postponed. This trip will allow me to see Iraq firsthand and continue to gather information, said Casey, D-Pa., in a statement. I also look forward to meeting with troops from Pennsylvania who are serving in Iraq. Casey, who has been critical of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, and a congressional delegation was in or en route to the Middle East this afternoon, according to his staff, which did not release details of the itinerary because of security concerns. The focus of the trip will be on military, security and humanitarian issues. While in the Middle East, Casey and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., are scheduled to appear on CNN's American Morning program from Baghdad around 6:50 a.m. Wednesday.
