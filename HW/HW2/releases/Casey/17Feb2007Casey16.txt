Senator Casey Votes to Oppose Escalation and Stop Iraq Debate Obstruction  February 17, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCToday, U.S. Senator Bob Casey released the following statement on his vote to break the roadblock to debate the President's Iraq escalation plan. Senator Casey canceled a planned trip to Iraq in order to be in Washington for today's vote. The cloture motion failed 56-34 with seven Republicans voting for cloture.  Despite two weeks of obstruction and a refusal to allow a full and open debate on the Iraq war, a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate today voted to send a clear signal to the White House in opposition to sending more troops to Iraq. The American people don't understand why the Senate isn't debating this war when all of America expects us to do so.  Senator Casey also voted on February 5, 2007 to proceed to a full debate on the escalation. Yesterday, he delivered a speech on the Senate floor on the Iraq war and expressing his opposition to the escalation and giving his thoughts on the war in Iraq.
