Casey Announces Senate Appropriations Committee Approves $500,000 For Harrisburg Pre-K Program  June 22, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC  United States Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $500,000 under the FY08 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill for the Harrisburg School District Pre-K Program. This project is one of Senator Caseys top priorities in this years spending bill.  While this is just the first step in the process, I applaud the Appropriations Committee for approving this request for funding this critical project, said Casey. Decades of research have shown us that high-quality pre-kindergarten programs not only keep children out of trouble, they help children succeed academically. I will continue to fight for funding for early education programs for my legislation to fund programs nationally. The Appropriations Bill for Labor, Health and Human Services and Education passed the Appropriations Committee and will head to the floor for a full vote before the Senate. The bill will then proceed to the House-Senate Conference Committee, before final passage in both chambers, and it is expected to be signed into law later this fall.
