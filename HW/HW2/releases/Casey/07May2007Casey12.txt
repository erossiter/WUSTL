Casey Opposes Weakening of Drug Reimportation Measure  May 7, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC-To protest an amendment passed today in the U.S. Senate to gut a provision to allow the safe reimportation of lower cost prescription drugs, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) voted against an attempt to move toward passage of the FDA reauthorization bill. Senator Casey was one of 8 senators to oppose the measure.  Despite my vote in opposition, the Senate today approved a poison pill amendment that would effectively prevent Americans from buying safe lower-cost prescription drugs. The reimportation amendment could have allowed American consumers to buy prescription drugs that cost 35 to 55 percent less than they do in the United States.  I am extremely disappointed that the Senate effectively denied Americans the ability to buy lower costs prescription drugs. That is why I could not vote to move toward passage of the FDA bill.  In voting against the move toward passage of the FDA bill, Senator Casey joined Senators Byron Dorgan, Finance Committee ranking member Chuck Grassley, and Olympia Snowe, among others.  Senator Casey today voted in favor of the Dorgan amendment to allow for reimportation. He voted against the Cochran amendment that weakened and effectively killed the Dorgan amendment.  Senator Casey is cosponsoring the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act (S.242) that would allow reimportation. He also spoke out in favor of this legislation on the Senate floor.
