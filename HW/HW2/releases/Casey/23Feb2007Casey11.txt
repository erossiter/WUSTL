Specter & Casey Announce Northeast PA to Receive Disaster Relief  February 23, 2007 Washington, D.C. - Senators Arlen Specter and Bob Casey announced today that President Bush has declared a major disaster for Pennsylvania which triggers the release of federal funds to help communities recover from the severe thunderstorms, heavy rains and widespread flooding that occurred November 16-17, 2006.  The President's declaration makes the following counties eligible for assistance for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities: Bradford, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Wayne, and Wyoming.  In addition, all counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are eligible to apply for federal assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, a program whose goal is to prevent or reduce long term risk to life and property from natural hazards.  On February 1, 2007 Senators Specter and Casey and Congressmen Paul Kanjorski, Tim Holden and Christopher Carney wrote to President Bush urging him to provide federal assistance for Northeast Pennsylvania counties that were devastated by the severe storms and flooding.
