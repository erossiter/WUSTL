Casey: Senate Approves $2.5 Million for PA Emergency Communication  October 4, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) today announced that the Senate approved $2.5 million in the fiscal 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill to help improve communication between the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA), the Pennsylvania National Guard (PANG) and local first responders. Kimball Associates, located in Ebensburg, Cambria County, will assist the Pennsylvania Guard and PEMA in developing this network.  While this is just one step in the process, I applaud the Senate for approving this request to fund this critical project, said Casey. These funds will give the PA National Guard and PEMA the technology they need to communicate with local first responders in an emergency. Once this network is fully implemented, first responders across the state should benefit from this system. I will continue to fight to help ensure that Pennsylvanias first responders have the resources they need. Currently local responders are unable to effectively communicate with the Pennsylvania National Guard and PEMA in emergency situations. This technology will help alleviate this problem by strengthening the ability of local first responders to communicate with other agencies in the event of an emergency.  This project is one of Senator Caseys top priorities in this years spending bill. The Appropriations Bill for Defense passed the Senate and will now proceed to the House-Senate Conference Committee, before final passage in both chambers, and it is expected to be signed into law later this fall. ###
