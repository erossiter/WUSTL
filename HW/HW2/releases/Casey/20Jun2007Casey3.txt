Casey Urges Passage of the Employee Free Choice Act  June 20, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC - On the Senate floor today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) called for the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act (S1041) that will strengthen protections for workers forming a union. A vote in relation to this bill is expected this week.  We know that this legislation can help workers by raising the standard of living in wages and benefits and other parts of their compensation, said Senator Casey. The right to organize and to collectively bargain helped to build the American middle-class. I ask all of my colleagues respectfully as they consider this legislation to think not only of what this will do for our workers but what it does for all of America and for our collective interest in a stronger economy. Senator Casey is an original cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act. A copy of his entire statement is below.
