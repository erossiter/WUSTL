Sen. Casey Statement on Martin Luther King Day  January 15, 2007  As we honor the legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. we should not just remember the lasting effects of his work and his struggle. We should also reaffirm his mission and recommit ourselves to the goals of equality, justice, and freedom.  I would like to echo the words of Dr. Kings widow, the late Coretta Scott King when she said to: commemorate this Holiday by making your personal commitment to serve humanity with the vibrant spirit of unconditional love that was his greatest strength, and which empowered all of the great victories of his leadership.
