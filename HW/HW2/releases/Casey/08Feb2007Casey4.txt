Senator Casey Fights Cuts to SCHIP Coverage February 8, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCToday, U.S. Senator Bob Casey sent a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Michael Leavitt, urging the Bush Administration not to cut funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and questioning Secretary Leavitt on how Pennsylvania children will be affected by the proposed budget.  The President's budget does not include sufficient funds to cover children currently enrolled in SCHIP and would cut funding for states like Pennsylvania that have expanded the program to cover more uninsured children.  Senator Casey said: Providing affordable, quality health care for our children is an issue close to my heart and one of the most vital issues facing the United States. We must ensure that this program not only continues to thrive, but is allowed to grow so that all of our children in Pennsylvania and nationwide can lead healthy, long lives.
