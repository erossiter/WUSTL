Casey Statement on Medicare Drug Price Bill  April 18, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC-U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement after the U.S. Senate failed to achieve the 60 votes necessary to move forward to a bill that would allow Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices:  It is disappointing that a minority in the Senate is preventing consideration of legislation that stands to save taxpayer money and help seniors by lowering drug prices. The current law that prevents Medicare from negotiating drug prices makes no sense and is putting the interests of the drug companies ahead of our seniors and taxpayers. I am a cosponsor of the bill and am proud to have joined 55 Senators from both sides of the aisle to vote for this legislation.  Senator Casey was publicly thanked by the Pennsylvania AARP earlier this month in Pittsburgh for his support of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007.
