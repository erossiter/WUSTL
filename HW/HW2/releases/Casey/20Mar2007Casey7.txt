Casey Statement on U.S. Attorneys Vote  March 20, 2007 WASHINGTON, DC- U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement on the U.S. Attorneys legislation that passed the Senate today by a vote of 94-2:  Today the Senate took an important step to revoke the White House's ability to appoint U.S. Attorneys without Senate approval. The recent revelations of possible political retribution that led to the firing of U.S. Attorneys are deeply troubling and highlight the urgency in passing this legislation.  An investigation is required that gets to the bottom of the firings, the changing stories, and the involvement of White House political operatives. I am pleased that the Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating this matter and I hope that the White House fully cooperates. The possible existence or even appearance of the threat of White House reprisals against federal prosecutors poses a grave threat to the rule of law.
