Sen. Casey Statement on Scranton-New York Rail Line January 17, 2007 WASHINGTON, DCCoinciding with todays Scranton open houses on the New Jersey Transit environmental assessment of the restoration of rail service to New York and New Jersey, U.S. Senator Bob Casey released the following statement:  The restoration of rail service from Northeast Pennsylvania to New York and New Jersey will be an economic boon to the region and to the Commonwealth. Connecting the region to these centers of business and commerce will not only help the commuters already traveling on a daily basis, but will also encourage more economic development in Northeastern Pennsylvania.  I applaud the work of Senator Arlen Specter and Congressman Paul Kanjorski, who have worked on this project for years and helped to get us to this point today. As a new U.S. Senator, I will join them in their strong support and efforts to secure this much needed rail service.  I look forward to hearing the comments that come from the series of open houses and hope that the rail restoration will proceed in an environmentally sound manner.
