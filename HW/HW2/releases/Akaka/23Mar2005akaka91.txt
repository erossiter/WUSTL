Washington, DC - Senator Daniel K. Akaka, (D-HI) an originial cosponsor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Act of 2005, recently urged his colleagues to support the bill that amends the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990. Senator Akaka said, I am more convinced than ever that we need to move now to reauthorize the Matsunaga Act and to refine and enhance the Department of Energys responsibilities while maintaining strong oversight over the progress of the activities. We cannot delay the move to a hydrogen economy. The Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Act of 2005, S.665, is vital for the management of hydrogen programs in the Department of Energy because the bill: - Provides greater focus for the hydrogen fuel cell technology research and development programs without losing the focus on renewable sources of hydrogen. - Emphasizes factors that are critical to the development of hydrogen infrastructure and the supply of vehicles and electric power. - Directs the Secretary to carry out activities to improve technology with the goal of cost reduction, particularly for hydrogen production, the supply of hydrogen, storage of hydrogen, and the end uses of hydrogen. - Authorizes $200 million for hydrogen supply and $160 million for fuel cell technologies in Fiscal Year 2006. - Emphasizes the importance of enhancing sources of renewable fuels and biofuels for hydrogen production, a factor that is critical to remote areas and island states such as Hawaii where local sources of energy are needed. - Provides directions to the Secretary to address the development of safety codes and standards relating to fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen energy systems, and stationary, portable, and micro fuel cells. The bill is expected to be considered by the Energy Committee in the near future.
