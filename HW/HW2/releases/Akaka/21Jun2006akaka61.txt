Washington, D.C. - One of Hawaiis top volunteers met with Senator Daniel Akaka (D-HI) on Capitol Hill this week after accepting the Jefferson Awards for Public Service honor. This morning, Kauai residents Basilio Fuertes and his wife, Mildred, discussed the importance of volunteerism with Senator Akaka.I think everyone should take time to help others, Fuertes said. The kids I work with find self-worth and they are recognized by others in the school and the community for their achievements.Fuertes volunteers at Waimea High School on Kauai where he teaches students to grow and care for various vegetables. Aside from teaching agriculture, he also encourages students to contribute to the community. He says students donate portions of their crops to the elderly and churches.Fuertes is among five Hawaii residents who were recognized for their volunteerism. Fuertes is in Washington this week representing the group. He has visited Washington before but says he is excited to be here as a Hawaii representative. I find it unbelievable that Im in D.C. - from Kauai. Being in the Capitol is like a dream come true, Fuertes said.Senator Akaka thanked Fuertes for his tireless work. Basilio honors Hawaii by being one of Hawaiis heroes. Heroes is the word used here to describe volunteers because they give their time and resources for the betterment of others, said Senator Akaka. I am proud of all of the volunteers who have received an award that recognizes people who help their communities in a special way. Their contributions are invaluable and necessary to continue the true spirit of aloha throughout Hawaii.
