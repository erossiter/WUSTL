Kapolei, HI - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today made the following remarks at the opening of the Kama`aha Avenue and Manawai Street extensions:Knowing how much of a need there was in Kapolei for transportation improvements, I along with my friend and colleague, Senator Inouye, secured $40 million for Kapolei Road improvements in the Surface Transportation Authorization legislation that was enacted last year. Although building, expanding, and improving roads are important infrastructure projects essential to reducing the daily frustration and congestion that our drivers face, it is clear we need to further develop alternative means of transportation, including a rail system. We must all work together to develop a system that will increase mobility, reduce air pollution, conserve fuel, and reduce traffic congestion. I appreciate the leadership that the Mayor has shown on this issue. I will continue to work to support the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project. Senator Inouye and I secured $4 million for the project in the recent Transportation appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 07 that was approved by the Appropriations Committee. This is just a start. Much more federal support will be needed to help make this project a reality and provide some much need relief for our chronic traffic congestion. I am committed to obtaining as much federal support for the Honolulu High-Capacity Corridor Project as possible.Again, I want to thank Campbell Estate for all of their efforts to privately finance infrastructure projects intended to help meet the community needs in the area. Our infrastructure needs are so great, it is essential to have effective public-private partnerships to leverage as many resources as possible to find solutions for the traffic problems on this island. Mahalo for inviting me today and Aloha.
