Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka today issued the following statement regarding the Department of Justice (DOJ) concerns with the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act: The question of whether or not Congress has the authority to federally recognize a Native Hawaiian governing entity is an issue that has yet to be ruled on by the Courts. However, I believe firmly in Congress authority to extend the federal policy of self-governance and self-determination to Native Hawaiians, Hawaiis indigenous people. As it has for Americas other indigenous peoples, I believe the United States must fulfill its responsibility to Native Hawaiians.
