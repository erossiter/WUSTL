Washington, D.C. -- Today Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) participated in a closed briefing for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard. Senator Akaka said this is the first step in better understanding the role of the federal government in response to Hurricane Katrina. The Committee will hold an oversight hearing on the response efforts next Wednesday. After the briefing Senator Akaka remarked, The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for planning for the consequences of a catastrophic event. Clearly, the government was not prepared when such a disaster occurred. The American people need to know why. Earlier, Senator Akaka addressed the Senate saying, As the branch of government responsible for making laws and overseeing the federal government, it is Congresss job to get to the bottom of what went wrong and to do whatever is necessary to ensure that it never happens again. Senator Akaka reminded his colleagues that in 2002, he repeatedly expressed concerns that non-homeland security functions of the federal government, especially FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard, could be diminished if included in DHS. I stand before my colleagues today to ask that we look at the disaster that has befallen the people of the Gulf Coast as a reminder that preventing terrorism is not the only business of the Department of Homeland Security, said Senator Akaka. Senator Akaka today also joined his Democratic colleagues in introducing the Katrina Emergency Relief Act, which offers emergency aid to allow the victims of Hurricane Katrina to obtain the health care coverage, housing, education, and financial assistance they severely need. Senator Akaka is the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia.
