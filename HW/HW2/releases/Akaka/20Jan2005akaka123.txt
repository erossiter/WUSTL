Washington, D.C. - As I proceeded with my colleagues in the Senate to witness the swearing in of George W. Bush as the 43rd President of the United States, I expressed the hope that the President would reinforce his pledge to move the nation forward in unity. The nation and the world heard the President focus much of his speech on the themes of liberty and freedom. While many of our young men and women fight for those causes, it is my hope the President stays true to honoring the friendship of Americas allies and takes steps to mend our relationships with our brothers and sisters around the world toward promoting democracy abroad and foster improved relations and understanding of Americas role in the world. Regarding his domestic agenda, I am interested to hear the details of the Presidents goals to address problems that Americans face here at home. It is imperative that these issues be carried out with the same determination that he will employ in fighting for freedom outside our borders. Addressing these challenges will be best achieved in a bipartisan manner. There is much work to be done. We must strengthen education to maximize opportunity and achievement, ensure access to quality and affordable health care, and foster economic and social opportunities to empower individuals, communities, and the nation. We must continue to emphasize stewardship and responsible use of our natural resources and cultural heritage, and enhance the understanding of Hawaiis unique history and multicultural society. We must ensure an efficient and effective federal government and foster a skilled workforce. Finally, we must enhance the readiness of our Armed Forces, ensure services and benefits for veterans, and safeguard our nations security. I look forward to working with the President on these priorities in the 109th Congress.
