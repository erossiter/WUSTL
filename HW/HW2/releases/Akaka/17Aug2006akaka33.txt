Honolulu, HI - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today issued the following statement in response to the ruling by Judge Anna Diggs Taylor on the National Security Agencys warrantless wiretapping program:Once again, a federal court has rebuked the Administration  this time for violating both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the U.S. Constitution. Our laws have no meaning if the President can arbitrarily waive them. I hope that the Administration will reconsider this ill-advised program and work within our constitutional framework to keep our nation safe.
