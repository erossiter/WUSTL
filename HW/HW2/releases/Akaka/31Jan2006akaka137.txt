Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) issued the   following statement today in memory of Corretta Scott King who passed away last   night:I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Corretta Scott King, a   woman who spent her lifetime carrying the torch against discrimination and   bigotry.Immediately after the untimely death of her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King,   Jr., Mrs. King forged ahead contributing to the civil rights movement. She   helped change the face of America by working tirelessly to spread the message of   racial equality and nonviolent change. Mrs. King was a voice for those treated   unjustly in our country. I have long admired her leadership in fighting   discrimination based on gender, sexual preference, race and religion. As a staunch supporter of equality and nonviolent change, I have been   inspired by Mrs. King's ability to carry out her actions peacefully and   gracefully. I believe, Mrs. King leaves a legacy that all Americans can look to   and be proud of. We can honor her memory by continuing her cause. God bless Mrs. King and her family. May she rest in peace.
