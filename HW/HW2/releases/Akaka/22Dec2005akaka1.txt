Washington, D.C. -- Key legislation on veterans health care passed the U.S. Senate late last night. Veterans Affairs Committee Ranking Member, Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) relentlessly worked on getting his legislation through, particularly S. 716, the Vet Center Enhancement Act, which serves to enhance care and services provided at Vet Centers; and his mental health provisions in S. 1182, the Veterans Health Care Improvements Act of 2005. Senator Akaka said, This is great news for our veterans, especially servicemembers returning from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Many of these men and women will be struggling with readjustment issues and will need some form of treatment or assistance. The Vet Center Enhancement Act authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to hire more Global War on Terror Outreach Coordinators; gives VA authority to administer bereavement counseling at Vet Centers; and authorizes $180 million for Vet Centers. Included in the Veterans Health Care Improvements Act are provisions that mandate the VA to make numerous enhancements and improvements to mental health care programs, such as: expand the number of clinical PTSD treatment teams, improve and expand substance abuse treatment capacity; expand tele-mental health services for areas where veterans have to travel long distances to access services; improve education programs for primary care providers; and expand Community-Based Outpatient Clinics, among other things. It is imperative that we continue to fulfill the health needs of our countrys veterans, stated Senator Akaka. This legislation is a step in that direction.
