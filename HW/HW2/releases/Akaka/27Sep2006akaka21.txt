Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka is pleased to announce today that Hale Makua in Maui will receive $500,000 from the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services. The funding is made possible under the Rural Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) Provider grant program.Senator Akaka was instrumental in supporting Hale Makua during this grant process and stated that there is a demonstrated need to establish a long-term care infrastructure to address geriatric challenges of Hawaiis aging population.Hale Makua is a non-profit corporation that provides a nursing home for elders who had no one to care for them or the means to pay for needed services. Hale Makua, located in Kahului, is a recognized leader in the field of elder care and continues to grow to meet the expanding and changing healthcare needs of people of all ages. According to the State of Hawaii Department of Healths Executive Office on Aging, Hawaii, like other parts of the U.S., is facing an acute shortage of long-term care services to address the needs of an aging population. Proportionately, Hawaii has more elderly than in the nation as a whole. Between 1990 and 2000, Hawaiis population of those age 85 or older increased by 72 percent. With this grant money, Hale Makua clients will benefit tremendously because it will help to provide resources of other health and social service providers to bring greater efficiency to long-term care on Maui Island, Senator Akaka said.
