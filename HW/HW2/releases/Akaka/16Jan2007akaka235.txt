Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka todayjoined colleaguesintroducing legislation that will for the first time set the United States on a path to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007 was introduced by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA). Joining Senator Akaka as original cosponsors are Senators Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).The act calls for an 80% reduction - compared to 1990 levels - in global warming pollutants by 2050 and offers the most progressive and comprehensive solution to reduce greenhouse gasses across the nation. An identical bill introduced last year died in the Republican controlled Congress. The global warming debate began in Hawaii over 30 years ago when the Mauna Loa Climate Observatory first documented evidence of increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earths atmosphere, Senator Akaka said. The U.S emits the most greenhouse gases in the world. We must be accountable as a world leader in reducing emissions and combating the threats resulting from global warming.This legislation provides for standards and grants for sequestration of greenhouse gases, which includes requiring that power plants, automobiles and carbon intensive businesses reduce their global warming pollution. The bill would also place the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in charge of national programs to help stabilize global atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.Encouraging renewable energy technologies will play a crucial role in successfully meeting the objectives of this legislation. Under the guidance provided by this bill, I firmly believe the State of Hawaii along with the rest of the United States will be poised to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Senator Akaka said.
