Public Service Recognition Week recognizes the important contributions of public servants and honors the men and women who meet our nations needs at all levels of government, said Senator Akaka. Because of the outstanding work of public servants, federal, state, and local governments are more responsive, innovative, and effective. Joining Senator Akaka in this effort were Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), George Voinovich (R-OH), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Carl Levin (D-MI), Tom Coburn (R-OK), Thomas Carper (D-DE), John Warner (R-VA), and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). Senator Akaka stated, Public service is a noble calling involving a variety of challenging and rewarding professions. Given the impending retirement wave, it is imperative that we use this week to highlight the exciting careers in public service and show that the government is an employer of choice. Senator Akaka highlighted the work of military and civilian employees serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. Coast Guard for their bravery in rescuing those stranded by Hurricane Katrina, and NASA employees who worked on the Mars Rover Project. To kick off Public Service Recognition Week, Senator Akaka will deliver the keynote address at an event hosted by the Partnership for Public Service called Securing the Nation: Recruiting and Retaining Critical Foreign Language Skills in the Federal Government. It will be held in room 902 of the Hart Senate Office Building on May 1, 2006, at 2 pm.
