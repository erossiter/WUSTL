WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Senate Indian Affairs Committee has announced a hearing to consider S. 310, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. The committee is chaired by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND). The hearing will take place Thursday, May 3, at 9:30 a.m., in room 485 of the Russell Senate Office Building. I am extremely pleased that the Indian Affairs Committee has set a hearing date for this legislation that is of the utmost importance to all the people of Hawaii, U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) said today in reaction to the announcement. I thank Chairman Dorgan for scheduling this hearing in his Committee and for his continued support of federal recognition for Native Hawaiians. I remain optimistic about finally providing the parity between Native Hawaiians and our countrys other indigenous people that is long overdue. I look forward to hearing the thoughts and suggestions from interested parties at next Thursdays hearing.More information about the hearing will be posted prior to the hearing date on the committees website: http://indian.senate.gov/public/-30-
