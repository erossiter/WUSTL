Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today welcomed the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, announced by the President at the National Institute for Health this morning, but said he would like more details on the strategic implementation. The Administrations stated goal of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza is to coordinate federal government efforts to prevent and prepare for avian and pandemic flu. I am heartened the Administration acknowledges the serious threat posed by the avian flu and has begun to take steps to prepare for such an outbreak, Senator Akaka said. I hope that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing examining the Department of Homeland Securitys role in this National Strategy. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for the majority of non-medical response activities necessitated by a pandemic influenza outbreak. According to Senator Akaka, DHSs recovery role will be paramount because medical solutions are in their infancy. I believe we should pursue medical responses to the avian flu. However, it is unrealistic to rely on vaccines and antivirals alone. If a human version of the avian flu appeared in the United States in the next few years, effective non-medical response and recovery activities, such as border and transportation security, would be necessary to stop the spread of the disease, stated Senator Akaka. It remains to be seen how these response activities fit into the Presidents plan. Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia
