Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka today was named one of three Democratic conferees to S. 662, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent. 
"Today's action by the Senate is important to everyone in Hawaii who relies on the U.S. Mail," said Senator Akaka.  "Hawaii has over 628,000 delivery points throughout the state.  Providing the Postal Service with the ability to meet the demands of its customers in the 21st century is critical."	
As the former chairman of the Senate postal subcommittee, Senator Akaka worked with his Hawaii colleagues to make sure that air transportation of mail continued to the islands in the aftermath of 9-11, despite a ban on commercial flights.   

The U.S. Postal Service is the lynch pin to a $900 billion mailing industry which employs 9 million people in the United States.

Senator Akaka praised the bill's sponsors, Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Senator Tom Carper (D-DE).  He said, "The tremendous effort my colleagues put into moving this historic, bipartisan legislation deserves the appreciation of all who use the U.S. Mails.  I am proud to have cosponsored their bill, and I am equally proud to serve as a conferee as we negotiate the differences between our bill and H.R. 22, the House postal reform bill." 
According to Senator Akaka, this legislation provides the appropriate balance of rate flexibility for the U.S. Postal Service, while ensuring financial accountability and transparency of operations, and a strengthened postal regulatory commission.   The House and Senate bills protect postal employees' right to collective bargaining and employee benefits.
