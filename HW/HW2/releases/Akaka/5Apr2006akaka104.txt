It is frustrating that individual taxpayers completing their own returns are not able to file directly with the IRS, stated Senator Akaka. If a taxpayer takes the time necessary to prepare their returns by themselves, they must be provided with the option of electronically filing directly with the IRS. Currently taxpayers are dependent on commercial preparers to electronically file their taxes. The Hawaii Alliance for Community Based Economic Development wrote in support of Senator Akakas legislation stating that providing free universal access to electronic filing, low income working families would be able to keep more of their hard earned dollars in their pocket. According to Senator Akaka, the current Free File Alliance Agreement leaves out too many taxpayers. Taxpayers that make more than $50,000 are not eligible. Nearly 45 million returns prepared using software are mailed in rather than electronically filed. Senator Akaka said, Electronic returns help taxpayers receive their refunds faster than mailing them in. This would save the IRS resources and reduce possible errors that can occur when the mailed in returns are transcribed.
