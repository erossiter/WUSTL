Washington, D.C. -- United States Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) today offered an amendment to add $3 billion to President George W. Bush's Fiscal Year 2007 Budget for Title I funding within the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).  Seventeen Senators cosponsored the Akaka Amendment which failed by a vote of 49 to 51.  "It's still early in the budget process," says Senator Akaka.  "You haven't heard the last from me on this issue."
The NCLB Title I program focuses on disadvantaged children--those from lower-income families.  Under the President's budget proposal, 29 states will experience a drop in Title I funding, resulting in a loss of program services to 3.7 million students.
"Schools across the country struggle to comply with the requirements set forth by the No Child Left Behind Act, particularly for higher student scores and teacher qualifications.  It is unconscionable that we continue to fail to provide our schools with the resources they need to achieve the goals we set," says Senator Akaka.
Hawaii State Schools Superintendent Patricia Hamamoto praised Senator Akaka's efforts.  "State education agencies across the country are doing their best to fulfill the promise of No Child Left Behind," says Superintendent Hamamoto.  "Adequate Title I funding is necessary to ensure that those students who are most challenged gain access to every learning opportunity possible."
Although Hawaii receives an increase in funding under the FY 2007 proposal, it comes after several years of funding cuts.  "Students are not receiving extra help through tutoring in reading and math because funds are needed for other services that are also deemed essential," says Senator Akaka.  "Schools should not be put in a position of deciding between programs for teacher development, instructional support, parental involvement, equipment acquisition, school planning and curriculum development because of a lack of resources."
