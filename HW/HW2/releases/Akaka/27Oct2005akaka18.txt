I respect Harriet Mierss decision to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court. As we await a qualified nominee, I am grateful to Justice Sandra Day OConnor, who has agreed to continue serving on the Supreme Court until her replacement is nominated and confirmed, however long that may take. I am hopeful that President Bush will fill the Supreme Court vacancy with a well-qualified individual who embodies the diversity of America. I urge President Bush to use this opportunity to nominate an individual who will uphold our Constitutional rights and protect our individual freedoms.
