Today, I opposed the nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice to be the next Secretary of State. While I believe that she has impressive credentials, we must not forget that as the National Security Adviser, she played a key role in analyzing the threat that Saddam Hussein posed to our security. Although I have strong support for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are deployed around the world in defense of the principles of democracy and our great nation, critical mistakes were made with dire consequences which may have been avoided if Dr. Rice and the other members of the National Security Team worked more closely with the experts in the field. As Secretary of State, one of the Secretarys main responsibilities is to implement our diplomatic efforts which include addressing regional and civil conflicts. I do not believe, given her past decisions and comments on the reasons to go to war in Iraq, that Dr. Rice will be able to represent the United States without a predetermined bias from the war. However, as Dr. Rice has been confirmed by the Senate, I am hopeful that Dr. Rice will learn from past mistakes to improve our diplomatic efforts around the world. I look forward to working with Dr. Rice as the next Secretary of State.
