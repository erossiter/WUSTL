Washington, D.C.- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) and Representative Danny Davis (D-IL) introduced legislation today to reauthorize the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for three years and make other changes to the two agencies to improve performance and customer service. The Federal Merit System Reauthorization Act of 2007 would also legislatively establish a process for OSC employees to bring allegations of retaliation against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel to the Presidents Council on Integrity and Efficiency and clarify that federal employees are protected from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. Both OSC and MSPB must be free from allegations of wrongdoing and the appearance of any activity that would question their independence, Senator Akaka said. I believe that the provisions in this bill will make needed improvements in both agencies to build trust in the federal workforce and the American people.Chairman Danny K. Davis said, Employee rights have been weakened under this Administration. This bill sends a strong message that whistleblower protection and employee rights are key elements of the federal civil service merit system and must be enforced.Senator Akaka is Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia. Representative Davis is Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce, the Postal Service, and the District of Columbia.--30--
