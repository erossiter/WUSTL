CHAIRMAN CARL LEVIN:Senator Akaka?SENATOR DANIEL K. AKAKA:Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Let me add my welcome to all witnesses, and commend you for yourservice to our country.As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readinessand Management Support, Im extremely concerned, as you are, about thereadiness of the Army and Marine Corps, and also their ability torespond to the emerging threats not only of the war were in, but ofthe 21st century.And the challenges that were in are even more difficult, becausewe are simultaneously increasing the size of the force, and having torestructure our military posture to effectively deal with the threats,and as you mentioned, counterinsurgency operations.And theres noquestion we must do all we can to provide the training and theequipment and all that our troops need.Regarding this, I have some questions to Dr. Krepinevich andGeneral Scales. During the early 1970s, talking about history, theArmy was reorganized so that the regular Army could not conduct anextended campaign without mobilizing the Guard and the Reserves.Itsnot clear, however, that the Defense Department leadership at thattime anticipated the kind of protracted conflict we are facing todaywith the Global War on Terror and an Army that is comprised of 55percent National Guard and Reserves.I believe Dr. Korb is right in that the all-volunteer force wasmeant to be an initial defense against threats against our country.Now, in a prolonged war, I believe that the all-volunteer force ismeant to be a bridge for dealing with threats until a full-timewartime force is built.Now, Dr. Krepinevich or General Scales, with the current Armyorganization, is the Army too reliant on the National Guard to meetits global commitments?In other words, are we fighting as asustained war with a peacetime organization?And since our Army forcestructure consists, as I mentioned, of 55 percent National Guard andReserves to 45 percent active duty, how can the National Guardmaintain its capability to deal with security threats with naturaldisasters at home while we expect it to be providing extensive supportto our national interests abroad?Dr. Krepinevich?ANDREW KREPINEVICH JR., PRESIDENT, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND BUDGETARY ASSESSMENTSKREPINEVICH:As you noted, Senator, in the wake of the Vietnamwar, as weve mentioned here, General Abrams put a lot of the Armyscombat service support in the Reserves, with the idea that if youregoing to use the active Army in large numbers, youd have to call upthe Guard forces, Reserve forces as well.That has obviously begun tochange with the advent of the modular force.Now we have thesebrigades that can deploy on their own with much more regularity thanstripping out units from the division and so on.But when you ask, is the current Army too reliant on the Guardand Reserve, I think using the Armys own metrics, you have to sayyes.The Army strives for a six-to-one rotation rate for Guard andReserve forces, which is to say for every six Guard brigades you have,only one would be on deployment at any given time. And weve seen overthe last four or five years that the Army has fallen below that ratio.So by the Armys own definition, just as the active force isoverstressed, the reserve force is overstressed as well.And I thinkwhen you look at the fact that the Army has concentrated a lot of itssupport elements in the Reserve forces and in the National Guard, youalso -- if you believe as I do -- that a lot of the contingencieswere going to see the most likely, as the chairman points out, areirregular warfare, stability operations, counterinsurgency, then theseare the kinds of forces youre going to need more of.Not only that, but when you do talk about things like homelandsecurity disaster relief, as General McCaffrey said, its not a matterof if, its a matter of when were going to get hit here at home.Youre going to need those kinds of forces, not only for theseexternal operations that deal with irregular warfare, but also here onthe home front as well.So these forces are a lot more important.We have to think aboutthem a lot differently than we did between the 70s and 9/11.Andduring that period, as you know, the Guard and Reserve was kind ofthis bridge between the active force and mass mobilization of thecountry on a scale like we saw in World War II.Well, this is not the force for the occasional large war.As theDefense Department has said, the Guard and Reserve has reallytransitioned from being a strategic reserve to being an operationalreserve, which means We plan on using you folks a lot more, not onlynow, but I think in the future as well.SENATOR AKAKA:General Scales?MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT SCALES JR. (USA, RET.), PRESIDENT, COLGEN, INC.SCALES:Senator, thats a key question.One of the things I find interesting about this war is that inmany ways, the National Guard is threatened by its own success.Iremember in the 70s, the National Guard was always viewed as sort ofa follow-on force, as Andy says, or as an augmentation force.Butwhat I think has amazed many of my regular Army colleagues is thatthey have performed so incredibly well in Iraq and Afghanistan.Several reasons for that:number one is, theyre mature, and weknow that oftentimes more mature soldiers are better decision-makersin these types of crises.The second is, National Guard units, thebrigades that I visited are very tightly bonded.It simply is ahometown unit, and so their ability to know each other and to workwith each other intuitively, I think, is truly exceptional thanoftentimes in many regular units.But the result of that is that in many ways, perhaps the NationalGuard is being killed with kindness, that the Abrams doctrine is nolonger valid any more. And in many ways, the National Guard hasbifurcated itself into two forces.One is what I guess you could call a quasi-professional force, analmost professional force.I met a sergeant major from a MinnesotaNational Guard brigade thats on its way back over to Iraq.And hetold me, My unit consists of two types of people:those whovealready left because they have jobs, and those who are sticking aroundbecause they essentially have committed themselves over a lifetime toserve in the National Guard.Is that good or bad?I dont know.But were in a completelydifferent place now.The Guard has now become absolutely essential to our futuremilitary strategy, and frankly, I dont think -- and I agree withGeneral McCaffrey -- I dont think we have enough Guardsmen now toperform both of those functions, the governors militia as well asthis quasi-professional force.And we certainly havent given themthe equipment and the training and the education that they need, to mymind, to perform either one of those.By killing with kindness, the third danger is that they may beoverused.And I think that the force that is at greatest risk ofbeing harmed in the short term is the National Guard, because of allthose things that we just talked about.And I think it concerns usall greatly.SENATOR AKAKA:Thank you very much.My time has expired.CHAIRMAN LEVIN:Senator Akaka, thank you.
