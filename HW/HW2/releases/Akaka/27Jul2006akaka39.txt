Washington D.C.  Today the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved two measures introduced by Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) as part of legislation to strengthen the federal governments response to natural disasters. I support the Committees efforts to ensure that the failures of Hurricane Katrina are never repeated and believe that the provisions based on my legislation will make certain that FEMA has well trained employees and that the federal governments emergency response agency is run by well-qualified individuals, Senator Akaka said.The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, S. 3721, requires senior leaders at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to have executive leadership and crisis management experience as outlined in Senator Akakas bill, the Department of Homeland Security Qualified Leaders Act, S. 2040, and establishes a rotational program to allow employees at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to gain broad expertise throughout the Department as outlined in the Homeland Security Professional Development Act, S. 3476.S. 3721 codifies the FEMA Pacific Area Office, which was established in 1993 at Senator Akakas urging, but has never been required in law. Senator Akaka stated, I am committed to protecting the FEMA Pacific Area Office, which is vitally important to Hawaiis safety and security. Codifying the PAO in law will ensure its preservation.Senator Akaka pledged to work with the Committee to address the treatment of tribal governments in the Stafford Act and the Homeland Security Act and to ensure the availability of post-disaster hazard mitigation funding for natural disasters is not diluted prior to the bill being taken up on the floor. Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
