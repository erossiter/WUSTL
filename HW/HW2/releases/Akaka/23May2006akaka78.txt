The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported S. 2735, legislation introduced by Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) and Senator Christopher S. Bond (R-MO) to reauthorize the National Dam Safety Program Act. The National Dam Safety Program, established in 1996 and managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), provides grants to improve state dam safety programs through training, technical assistance, inspection, and research. I am pleased that the Committee has taken this necessary step because of the dire need to improve the safety of our nations dams. Our aging dam infrastructure needs to be evaluated and stabilized to prevent future dam failures.The Dam Safety Act of 2006 will reauthorize the National Dam Safety Program, at a cost of approximately $13 million over 5 years, with funds allocated as follows:$8 million per year split among the states, based on the relative number of dams per state, to make improvements in programs identified in the National Dam Safety Program Act;$2 million per year in research funds to identify more effective techniques to assess, construct, and monitor dams;$700,000 per year in training assistance to state engineers$1 million for the employment of additional staff and personnel for FEMA; and$1 million for the National Inventory of Dams.Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which conducts oversight of FEMA.
