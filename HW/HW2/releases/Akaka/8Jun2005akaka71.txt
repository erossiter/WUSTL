Washington, D.C. -- On Thursday, June 9th at 11:45 a.m. in Dirksen 608, the Committee on Veterans Affairs Ranking Member Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), along with Minority Whip Senator Richard Durbin, Senators Jay Rockefeller, Patty Murray, Barack Obama, and Ken Salazar will hold a press conference to discuss how Democrats are working to provide quality mental health care to Americas veterans and returning servicemembers. Republicans have repeatedly blocked attempts by Democrats to increase funding for mental health care in the face of burgeoning demand for such care. While Democrats strive to ensure proper and deserving health care to returning troops, the Republicans ignore Congresss responsibility to fully provide for Americas men and women who return after putting their lives at risk for freedom.
