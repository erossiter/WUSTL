U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka issued the following statement today regarding the passing of Office of Hawaiian Affairs Trustee Linda Dela Cruz.Linda Dela Cruz will be missed by many who knew her and who have been touched by her many contributions to Hawaii through her music and her service as an OHA Trustee.Linda was a cherished friend, who I was fortunate enough to kanikapila with in our younger days. Her falsetto voice and style of singing earned her a deserving place in Hawaiian music history. Through her dedicated service she worked to improve the lives of the Native Hawaiian people, especially in the Panaewa community. Lindas ability to make decisions with aloha truly brought people together, unified under a common purpose.Millie and I send our aloha to her ohana. May Linda rest in peace.
