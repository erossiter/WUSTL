Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to comply with information requests from four teams investigating the levee breaches in New Orleans. During todays Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Senator Akaka questioned representatives from each team about the accessibility of levee documents and access to Army Corps staff. Dr. Raymond B. Seed, leader of the National Science Foundation team, testified he was denied access to the Army Corps employees responsible for the New Orleans levee systems and has not received a number of documents he requested. The flooding of New Orleans was a preventable tragedy which is why it is imperative we find out what went wrong to make sure it never happens again, remarked Senator Akaka after the hearing. All relevant information must be made available to levee investigators. Senator Akaka noted Hawaiis contribution to the investigations. Dr. Peter Nicholson, a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, is leading the American Society of Civil Engineers team. Dr. Nicholson is an expert in his field, and Hawaii is honored that he is lending his expertise to this worthy cause. Other teams investigating the levee breaches in New Orleans that led to severe flooding in late August include: the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center - an investigative arm of the Corps - and the Louisiana State Forensic Data Gathering Team. Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is conducting an investigation into the governments response to Hurricane Katrina.
