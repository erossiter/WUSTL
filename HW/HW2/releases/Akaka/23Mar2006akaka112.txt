Head Start is a federal program that provides comprehensive early childhood development services to low-income children. Services provided to preschool-aged children include child development, educational, health, nutritional, social and other activities, intended to prepare low-income children for entering kindergarten. A significant number of patients at KMCWC are Medicaid beneficiaries. The Deficit Reduction Act mandated additional documentation requirements for Medicaid eligibility that will likely create barriers to health care, are unnecessary, and will be an administrative burden to implement. The requirements will disproportionately impact low-income, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous people and those born in rural areas without access to hospitals. Senator Akaka introduced S. 2305, a bill to repeal the additional requirements. Senator Akaka has worked closely with Senator Dodd who is a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the senior Democrat on its Education and Early Childhood Development Subcommittee.
