In response to a request from Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Acting FEMA Director R. David Paulison today promised that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Pacific Area Office, located in Honolulu, will stay open indefinitely. During questioning by Senator Akaka at Mr. Paulisons nomination hearing to be the permanent FEMA Director, Mr. Paulison stated that he believes that the PAO is important to FEMAs ability to respond to disasters in Hawaii and the Pacific and that FEMA already has budgeted funding for the PAO through 2010.The Pacific Area Office has served Hawaii and the surrounding Pacific territories well for the past 13 years, coordinating disaster preparedness and response efforts. I appreciate Mr. Paulisons commitment to maintaining this critical resource in Hawaii, said Akaka.The PAO was created in 1993 due to the efforts of Senator Akaka. Last year, he reversed an effort to close the office by securing a promise from former FEMA Director Michael Brown to keep it open.The importance of having a FEMA office in the Pacific was demonstrated in March when Hawaii endured 40 days of torrential rainfall and severe flooding. The PAO, whose staff have a longstanding relationship with Hawaii emergency managers, began coordinating with state and local officials immediately to survey the damage. It is unlikely this level of support would have occurred if the closest FEMA office was 2,500 miles away in California.
