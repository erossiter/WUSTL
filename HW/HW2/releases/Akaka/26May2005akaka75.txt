Washington, D.C. -- The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources today reported out a bipartisan comprehensive energy bill that strikes a balance in energy sectors. It contains provisions championed by Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) such as the Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Technology Act of 2005 that includes the reauthorization of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990. This is an historic vote for clean, renewable and alternative energy, said Senator Akaka. This comprehensive bill decreases our dependence on oil, and recognizes the unique differences that States or regions may have in their energy demands and use. The energy bill includes a study of Hawaiis dependence on oil. More than 90 percent of the States energy is from fuel oil. The study would assess the consequences of moving to alternative sources, such as more coal, liquified natural gas and hydrogen. The bill also includes an ethanol mandate. Senator Akaka stated, I supported the ethanol mandate because it guarantees that Hawaii will not be punished by higher gas prices. We dont have the capacity to produce ethanol right now. This amendment will help by authorizing a sugar cane and cellulosic ethanol program. It will create the capability to produce ethanol which we will share with other cane-growing States like Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, and provide incentives for new technology for sugar cane ethanol. Also included in the comprehensive measure is S. 711, a bill introduced by Senator Akaka to reauthorize the methane hydrates program at the Department of Energy. The program is important because of the enormous hydrate resources, perhaps as much as a quarter of the worlds gas hydrates. Tapping these sources will go a long way to relieve the projected natural gas shortfall in the future, said Senator Akaka. I am pleased that the bill includes several bills of great importance to me on future sources of energy.
