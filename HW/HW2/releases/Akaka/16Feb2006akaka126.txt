Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka and Congressman Neil Abercrombie today introduced joint legislation addressing the need for a comprehensive study and analysis of chemical munitions in and around Hawaii.  
The bills call for:
Â·	An underwater survey of sites where chemical munitions are believed to have been dumped; 
Â·	Monitoring confirmed dump sites and Hawaii coastal waters for possible release of harmful agents;

Â·	A research program to study the long-term effects of sea water on chemical weapons; and

Â·	Reporting to Congress on the public health and environmental risks posed by the dump sites, and the feasibility and estimated remediation costs.
Senator Akaka stated, "The Department of Defense has made tremendous strides in protecting the health and welfare of our citizens.  However, given the hazardous risks that these munitions may pose, it is important for Congress to send the right message, specifically in this case, and ensure that the Army completes its survey, monitors the sites, and provides a plan for remediation." 
Congressman Abercrombie added, "The presence of these munitions in island waters raises serious questions of public health and safety. We need to get a handle on locations, quantities and potential dangers.  Our goal is to get the facts, and then move to a well thought out plan of action. The Department of Defense will have to be deeply involved in gathering this information, and that's why we're using the annual National Defense Authorization bill as the legislative vehicle." 
Senator Akaka and Representative Abercrombie joined forces following an "information paper" by the U.S. Army that indicated a review of future research on identifying sea-disposal sites of Chemical Warfare Materiel.  
Senator Akaka is a senior member on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Ranking Member of Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support.  Congressman Abercrombie is a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, where he is the Ranking Member on the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.
