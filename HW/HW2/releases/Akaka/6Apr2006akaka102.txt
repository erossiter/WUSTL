Earlier this year, Senator Akaka wrote to the U.S. DOE in support of UH stating, Funding for the PAMI will enable stronger business and cultural ties among Pacific Island and Asian countries, which will benefit the United States. The PAMI program includes innovative efforts to educate the community on issues that impact the global economy, such as homeland security and intellectual property, and the relationship between sound environmental practices and profit motivations. Senator Akaka said, As a former educator, I applaud the accomplishments achieved by the PAMI in providing students with skills to meet the needs of companies doing business in Asia and the Pacific.
