Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today is pleased to announce that the Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) is providing Hawaii $400,000 for additional employment staff. Senator Akaka alerted the Department of Labor of Hawaiis need for additional attention because of its unique geography.VETS offers employment and training services to eligible veterans through the non-competitive Jobs for Veterans State Grants Program. Senator Akaka said, The labor rate for disabled veterans in Hawaii is low. But when our disabled veterans obtain employment, they stay in their jobs. The additional employment staff that will be hired will provide intensive services to help our disabled veterans, and veterans with barriers to employment, find gainful employment. VETS works to accomplish its mission primarily through the services provided two important VETS-funded programs. Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP) specialists provide intensive services to eligible veterans, with the maximum emphasis directed toward serving those who are economically or educationally disadvantaged, including homeless veterans, and veterans with barriers to employment. Local Veterans Employment Representatives conduct outreach to employers and engage in advocacy efforts with hiring executives to increase employment opportunities for veterans, encourage the hiring of disabled veterans, and generally assist veterans to gain and retain employment.These new positions will undoubtedly help many of Hawaiis more than 100,000 veterans, noted Senator Akaka. Senator Akaka is the Ranking Member on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
