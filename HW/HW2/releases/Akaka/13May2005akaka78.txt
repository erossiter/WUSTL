I support this round of base closures and realignments because I believe it is important to examine our military footprint to maximize efficiencies and to enhance our nations capabilities to confront the challenges and potential threats that we may face in the future. Many of the recommendations call for consolidation of certain military functions, while attempting to ensure that the United States continues to maintain military response capability and protecting our security and freedom. For the State of Hawaii, only one facility has been recommended for closure, a reserve facility in Honokaa. It is my understanding that this decision is based on the transformation of reserve forces in Hawaii and that unit will be accommodated in a planned facility in Hilo. Realignment of certain missions is scheduled to occur at Pearl Harbor and at Hickam Air Force Base. In some cases, we will be gaining assets in Hawaii. As we move forward with the BRAC process, it is important that all stakeholders have an opportunity to further discuss the impact that these recommendations will have on the affected communities. I will continue to monitor this process closely. U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka is the Ranking Member on the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support
