Washington, D.C. - Late last night, the U.S. Senate passed the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6). The bill included an amendment introduced by Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), The Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2007 (Amendment No. 1764). The amendment seeks to spur development of clean, non-greenhouse gas emitting renewable energy technologies. By harnessing the power of waves, rivers, tides, currents, and thermal power to generate electricity, we will strengthen our national security by increasing energy independence, while reducing our emission of harmful greenhouse gases, Akaka said. Energy is expensive in Hawaii. Our island state is particularly vulnerable to radical price fluctuations of oil. We also understand the necessity of environmentally-friendly solutions to our energy challenges. The ocean sits at our doorstep, providing us with sustenance, food, recreation, a cool break on a hot day, and now potential as a major source of renewable energy, Akaka said. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, 252 million megawatt hours of electricity representing 6.5 percent of U.S. energy demand could be generated by ocean energy technologies.The Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2007:Senator Akakas bipartisan amendment was cosponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR). The amendment was added to the bill on Thursday night by unanimous consent.-30-
