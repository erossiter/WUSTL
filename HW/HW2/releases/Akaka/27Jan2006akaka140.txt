Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) welcomed the first of two Government   Accountability Office (GAO) reports released today on the management of air   tours over national parks. Senator Akaka was among five Senators who requested   the study in 2004 after hearings by the Energy Committee and Commerce Committee   showed that there was no significant progress in implementing the National Park   Air Tour Management Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-181). Senator Akaka said, The law was enacted in 2000 following serious concerns   raised by visitors and residents about the noise and congestion over national   parks and nearby neighborhoods. The law mandated that the National Parks Service   and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) work together with air tour   operators to develop a managed approach to the number of air tours over national   parks. In a 2004 National Parks Subcommittee hearing, it was revealed that not one   national park had an air tour plan in place. Senator Akaka, the sponsor of the   air tour legislation in 2000, requested an assessment by the GAO of the   implementation of the national parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000. I am pleased to see that the process is moving faster. The Hawaii national   parks will be among the first of the national Parks to have plans, and others   will be starting their planning process soon. Air tour operators will be able to   make decisions about investments sooner with the plans and visitors to parks   will have relief from overhead noise, stated Senator Akaka. The report included recommendations for greater flexibility in determining   which parks should receive plans; the need for greater funding for the Park   Service to pay for its share of plan development costs with FAA; the need for   better data on the number of air tours flown over national parks; and greater   specification by FAA from headquarters to district offices on the flight safety   standards.
