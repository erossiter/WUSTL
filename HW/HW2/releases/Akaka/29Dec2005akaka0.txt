Honolulu, HI -- U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) issued the following statement today regarding the recess appointment of Julie L. Myers to be Assistant Secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security: I am deeply disappointed that the President has chosen to bypass the role of the Senate in the nomination process and appoint Julie Myers to be Assistant Secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Managing ICE, the second largest federal law enforcement agency with more than 15,000 employees and a budget of $4 billion, is a mammoth responsibility. I have serious reservations about Ms. Myers qualifications, specifically her lack of management experience, which is why I voted against her nomination when it was before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The DHS Inspector General identified ICE as having numerous management problems. The head of ICE should be an individual who has demonstrated extensive executive level leadership and the ability to manage a budget through reorganizations and budget cycles. Ms. Myers has not demonstrated this ability.
