Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senators Daniel K Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye are pleased to announce the approval of a new federal grant to assist the 180 workers laid-off from the Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii) Inc. processing plant, following its abrupt closure in November 2006. The project will provide employment readiness services (training), job placement, and career counseling and assessment, to help the workers get back on their feet.The workers were told by Del Monte in November 2006 that the company would be ceasing its pineapple farming operations immediately rather than in 2008, as the company had initially planned, leaving them jobless for the holidays.The award of $569,230 is a National Emergency Grant approved under the Workforce Investment Act. National Emergency Grants are discretionary awards by the Secretary of Labor that temporarily expand service capacity at the State and local levels through time-limited funding assistance in response to significant dislocation events. The program will be operated by the City  County of Honolulus Department of Community Services. Senator Akaka said: This is another step toward recovery for the former Del Monte processing plant workers. They worked hard and made important contributions to Hawaiis economy for many years, and we are pleased that this grant will help them continue to be productive members of our community.  Senator Inouye added: This grant is crucial in helping the workers who were laid off from their jobs at the Del Monte processing plant. It will help them begin a new and brighter chapter in their lives.Todays announcement comes exactly a week after Senators Akaka and Inouye announced that laid-off Del Monte workers would qualify for the U.S. Department of Labors Trade Adjustment Assistance and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. The programs provide laid-off workers with new job training and development, and support in finding new employment.
