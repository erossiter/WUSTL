Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today questioned former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director Michael Brown on the loss of mitigation funding when FEMA was folded into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Mr. Brown testified that FEMA had to pay a "tax" to fund the Department's shared services, such as the Secretary's office and the information technology system, and that the bulk of that tax came from the mitigation program within FEMA.    
"This Administration has a history of discounting the value of mitigation programs.  According to Mr. Brown, the Office of Management and Budget does not think mitigation activities are worth the investment.  I am shocked by this shortsightedness," stated Senator Akaka. 
"If it weren't for Congress, there would be little to no federal funding for disaster preparedness in Hawaii, such as repairing school buildings that serve as shelters and strengthening flood control projects.  Hawaii is vulnerable to hurricanes, torrential rains and flooding, tsunamis, droughts, earthquakes, and brushfires - this funding is critical."
The Administration sought to eliminate pre-disaster mitigation funding in 2002 and post-disaster mitigation funding in 2003.  In FY 02, Congress appropriated $25 million for mitigation programs and $150 million in FY 03.
In 2002, the Government Accountability Office issued a report at the request of Senator Akaka entitled, "Hazard Mitigation: Proposed Changes to FEMA's Multihazard Mitigation Programs Present Challenge."  GAO found that emergency management officials viewed pre- and post-disaster mitigation programs as successful and effective.
Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is conducting an investigation into the response to Hurricane Katrina.
