Washington, D.C. -- The U.S. Senate today passed by Unanimous Consent a bill introduced by Senator Daniel K. Akaka that names the U.S. Post Office at 1271 North King Street in Honolulu after Senator Hiram L. Fong, the nation's first U.S. Senator of Asian ancestry and a ranking member of what was the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee.  
"Senator Hiram Fong was a man of great integrity and a compassionate advocate for civil rights and workers' rights.  It is fitting that a U.S. Post Office near his home in Kalihi be named in his honor," Akaka said.  "During his 20 years of service in the U.S. Senate, Senator Fong personified the spirit of bipartisan cooperation.  He was instrumental in enacting landmark civil rights legislation in the 1960s; reforming U.S. immigration laws to end discrimination against Asian immigrants; improving job training programs for workers; and fighting for equal pay for women.  The people of Hawaii were truly fortunate to have been represented by Hiram Fong." 
The bill, introduced by Senator Akaka and cosponsored by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, now goes to the House of Representatives for consideration, where Representative Neil Abercrombie introduced a companion bill.  The measure was initially referred to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where Senator Akaka is the senior Democrat on the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia.
Senator Inouye, who served with the late Senator in the U.S. Senate, said: "Senator Fong loved Hawaii, and he always had its best interests at heart.  Having this Post Office named after Senator Fong will help to ensure that his legacy will never be forgotten."
