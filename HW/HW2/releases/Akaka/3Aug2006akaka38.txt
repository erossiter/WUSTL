Washington, D.C. - Increasing concern over sacred sites in Hawaii resulted in federal action by Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today who introduced the Hawaiian Sacred Sites Noise Reduction Act of 2006. This bill would prohibit commercial air tour operations over Kalaupapa National Historical Park, Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, Pu`uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park, and Pu`ukohola Heiau National Historic Site.In the last few decades, the growth of the air tourism industry has considerably interrupted the tranquility of Hawaiis National Parks, stated Senator Akaka. Sacred sites, including the airspace of the designated locales, are an important resource for the Hawaiian people and we must do what is necessary to ensure that the value of these sites is not diminished.According to Senator Akaka, prohibiting air tourism over these areas would allow residents and visitors to these sacred sites the tranquility and peace to enjoy them.Senator Akaka is Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on National Parks.
