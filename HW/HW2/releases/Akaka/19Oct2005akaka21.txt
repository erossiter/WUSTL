Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka made the following statement regarding the death of John Mink: John and Patsy were always good company and a fair match. John was Patsys strong right arm and avid supporter of the causes they believed in so deeply -- equal rights for all, excellence in education, childrens well being, protection of our environment and natural resources, and social justice. John, as a renown hydrologist, had a reputation that continues to extend beyond Hawaiis shores. He was as respected and as well known in his profession as Patsy was in hers. John always stayed fit. I have a vivid picture of him in my mind jogging up Capitol Hill, many times leading Patsys much younger staffers. His optimism was contagious. As I mourn Johns passing, I remember him as a beloved friend.
