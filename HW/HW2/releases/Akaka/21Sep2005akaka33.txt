Washington, D.C. -- President George W. Bush today signed into law S. 264, the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2005, which authorizes the Department of the Interior to participate in the design, planning, and construction of three separate water reclamation projects in Hawaii. Senator Daniel K. Akaka, sponsor of the bill, said, I am delighted the President has signed this bill into law. Hawaii can now begin to develop alternative sources of water and it will help us conserve the potable water that we already have. Federal funding will now provide for the implementation of three water projects in Hawaii. The first project authorizes a desalination project for reliable potable water on Oahu where water demands are outpacing the availability of drinking water. The second, fixes a problem that results in effluent being discharged into a temporary disposal sump from the Kealakehe Wastewater Treatment Plant in North Kona. The third project extends the County of Mauis main recycled water pipeline to reduce the use of potable water. It is vitally important for the State to begin working on these water reclamation projects to secure a supply of fresh drinking water for years to come, noted Senator Akaka. The law also authorizes an additional $1.7 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to complete its study of Hawaiis irrigation and delivery systems.
