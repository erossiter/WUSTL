Public Service Recognition Week draws needed attention to the valuable and often unrecognized contributions of federal, state, and local government employees. Each day, public servants work to make government more effective and perform vital services with enthusiasm and professionalism on which America relies. I urge all Americans to celebrate the achievements of public servants, look for some small or large way to honor these dedicated men and women, and find their own way to answer the call to serve, Senator Akaka said.Senator Akaka is the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on the Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.-30-
