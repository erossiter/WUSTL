Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today issued the following statement regarding the death of five soldiers who were based at Schofield Barracks.Today, while many reflect on the lives sacrificed in the attack on Pearl Harbor, my thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the troops that have been lost in Iraq. Eleven soldiers have paid the ultimate price this week, five of them were from Task Force Lightning and assigned to 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. I pray too for all our men and women who are serving our country to promote democracy and peace. It is my hope that a change of course in Iraq will occur in the near future, our soldiers deserve no less. May God bless our soldiers and their families.
