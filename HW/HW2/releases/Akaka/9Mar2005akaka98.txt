Washington, DC - The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs today voted to favorably report S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005. The Committee accepted an amendment offered by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) jointly with Senators Daniel K. Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye which clarified S. 147 does not authorize eligibility of Native Hawaiians for Indian programs and services. Native Hawaiians already have federal programs addressing matters including health, education, and housing which are separately authorized and appropriated. Senator Akaka said, I am very pleased that the Committee has voted for the fourth time to favorably report this bill. We have a challenging road ahead of us as we prepare for a debate and roll call vote on the Senate floor. I believe this bill is important to everyone in Hawaii because it provides the structured process we need to begin to resolve the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This bill will help us to resolve these issues and move forward as a state. Senator Inouye said, I am extremely gratified that the Senate Indian Affairs Committee has given its approval to the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, and that this measure is advancing to the full Senate for consideration and debate. Senator Akaka added, I appreciate Chairman McCains cooperation in expediting the favorable consideration of this measure. Senator Inouye stated, This legislation is of vital importance to the State of Hawaii as it reaffirms that Native Hawaiians are both citizens of the State of Hawaii and of the United States, and, like other indigenous, native people of America, have their own distinct status under the law. I am pleased that the Committee has shown its understanding and sensitivity in supporting this bill that allows Native Hawaiians to seek self-determination and the right to self-governance as federal policies have recognized for the last 35 years.
