Senator Akaka stated, The Commissions failure to give a fair and thorough review of my bill concerns me greatly. It is unfortunate that a body with such a noble mission has succumbed to a political agenda. At a minimum, the members of the Hawaii State Advisory Committee to the Commission ought to have been consulted about the briefing and asked to contribute to the report. Their decision will not deter me from my goal of having S. 147 heard on the Senate floor. I believe that majority of my colleagues will look at all the facts presented in making their decision whether or not to support it. Voting in strong opposition to the report were Commissioners Arlan Melendez and Michael Yaki, who said the report was inaccurate and biased. Voting for the reports publication were Commissioners Abigail Thernstrom, Jennifer Braceras, Ashley Taylor and Chairman Gerald Reynolds. Commissioner Peter Kirsanow abstained. After adjournment the Commission reconvened and voted unanimously to delete the findings section in the report.
