Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) earned a 96% score for his civil rights legislation from the nations oldest and largest civil and human rights coalition, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR). According to the LCCR, its Voting Record scored members of Congress on their support for, or opposition to, bills containing important civil rights provisions, hate crimes and immigration legislation, and judges hostile to civil rights, among other issues. The LCCR included in its report S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, noting its support. The report stated, While opponents have argued that S. 147 would create a race-based government, such an argument distorts the true purpose of the 14th and 15th Amendments, which were created in order to prohibit discrimination against individuals and were never intended to prevent the political empowerment of a class of sovereign, indigenous people.This report reaffirms that I am working to make life better for all people, especially those who are economically or politically disadvantaged, said Senator Akaka. I have always worked hard to protect our civil rights and am pleased to have been recognized by one of the countrys most diverse civil and human rights coalitions. Also highlighted in the report was Senator Akakas Amendment for Title I Grants (S. Con. Res. 83), which would have allowed for additional funding for Title I education grants.
