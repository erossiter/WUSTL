Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) was recognized today by the American Association of University Women (AAUW) as one of just over a dozen U.S. Senators who received a 100 percent voting rating in AAUWs Congressional Voting Record. Senator Akaka said, I have consistently voted in support of women because it is the right thing to do. I strongly believe that Congress must protect the rights of all Americans.According to the AAUW, the Senate votes covered in its Congressional Voting Record for the 109th Congress include: Pell grant funding, vocational education reauthorization, funding for higher education, judicial nominations, the federal marriage amendment, and reproductive rights.I know that women struggle to balance their obligations to parents, children, community, and themselves. They make difficult decisions every day about making ends meet, paying for health care, obtaining quality care for their children, accessing high quality education, fighting for personal justice and workplace rights, and saving for retirement, noted Senator Akaka. I honor the challenges they face by understanding whats important to them and doing all I can to support them.Since 1881 AAUW has been the nations leading voice promoting education and equity for women and girls. Hawaii is home to six AAUW branches. AAUW has posted its voting record on its web site at http://www.aauw.org.
