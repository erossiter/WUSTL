Washington, D.C. -- In a meeting with Senators Daniel Akaka, Dan Inouye, Jon Kyl, and Ted Stevens, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today said he will file a cloture motion to proceed on S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act. I am grateful that the Majority Leader has agreed to file the petition to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 147. While there is a long procedural road ahead of us, I am glad that this bill will finally be brought to action, said Senator Akaka. The timing of the cloture motion to proceed is yet to be determined as the Senate is scheduled to take up a motion to invoke cloture on another bill tomorrow. The Senate is currently set to adjourn at the end of the week. Senator Akaka said, I am pleased at the outcome of our meeting with the Majority Leader. However, right now, I am examining various strategies to be considered in order to get my bill the votes it needs for passage.
