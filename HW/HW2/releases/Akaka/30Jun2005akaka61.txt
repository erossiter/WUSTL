Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, today applauded members of the Appropriations Committee for their swift action to ensure that the House of Representatives is unable to shortchange veterans. The House leadership has indicated their intent to push forward with the Bush Administrations $975 million supplemental recommendation for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Senator Akaka said, It appears that House Republicans have succumbed to pressure from the White House and are pushing a number that fails to avert VAs funding crisis. The Administration has been less than forthcoming with both Chambers of Congress about this issue, and now our veterans are in danger of paying the price. Vet Centers, nursing homes, and other vital VA services could continue to be starved of resources unless we supply VA with all of the money it needs, he said. Yesterday, the Senate voted unanimously, 96-0, to provide VA with $1.5 billion in emergency funds via the Interior Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2006. Immediately following the vote, Senator Akaka stood with his colleagues in praise of the unprecedented bipartisan effort on behalf of veterans funding. At the press conference Senator Akaka stated, Our bipartisan effort proves that veterans are not victims of political warfare.
