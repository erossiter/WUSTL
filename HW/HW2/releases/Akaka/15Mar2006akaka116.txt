Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka today submitted the following statement for the Senate Record regarding the collapse of the Ka Loko Reservoir on Kauai.
Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere sympathy and deep concern for those affected by the collapse of the Ka Loko Reservoir on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.  This tragic flooding has caused loss of life and substantial property damage.  The people of Hawaii have shown exceptional resolve in assisting their fellow citizens as emergency personnel and other volunteers have rushed to provide assistance to people in need.  We continue to pray for those who are still missing and for those who are working tirelessly in search and rescue efforts and in additional emergency response.
As many of you know, several islands in my home state have been inundated by severe rainstorms over the past few weeks.  Flooding has caused substantial disruptions of life as schools and business have been forced to close and many roads have been damaged or have been washed out because of high water.  Property damage in cities and in rural areas has been severe.
Hawaii's Governor Lingle has called upon the National Guard and many state agencies to assist those who have suffered losses and to respond to immediate needs.  However, the damage caused by this flooding demonstrates the need to prepare in advance for adverse conditions and to be vigilant in examining vulnerable areas. 
I stand ready to offer any assistance to the state of Hawaii that I can, including securing emergency federal funding for the State.
Throughout this adversity, the people of Hawaii have shown the resolve that they are known for in times of crisis.  I am proud of my constituents as they help their neighbors and work to restore conditions around their homes, schools, businesses, and places of worship.  I know that their efforts will bring comfort and solace to those in need.
