Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) tonight strongly spoke against the FY06 Budget Resolution Conference Report citing funding cuts in areas that are needed most. I could support this measure if it provided enough funding for education. For veterans. For health care. For law enforcement. But it fails in many ways in these areas and, instead, gives priority to tax cuts largely for the well-off, stated Senator Akaka. I am deeply frustrated that we are no longer able to move legislation forward that expands access to health care. Instead, access is being reduced through poorly thought out arbitrary cuts that will have detrimental effects on working families across the country. Every time we work on a budget resolution I have to ask why education continues to be behind the curve, said Senator Akaka. The conference report does nothing to cover the funding shortfall for No Child Left Behind compliance or to restore funding to 48 education programs recommended for termination in the Presidents budget. The list of programs includes the Excellence in Economic Education Act, which I authored to combat economic and financial literacy in grades K through 12. Senator Akaka also noted the Budget Resolution leaves out recent war costs, estimated costs for the Presidents reform plan for Social Security, and costs for fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax that is extending into the middle class. It is clear to me that this budget conference report fails families and communities across this country, including in my state of Hawaii. For these many reasons, I am unable to support the conference report.
