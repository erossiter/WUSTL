WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka applauded the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees passage of the Accountability in Government Contracting Act of 2007, which included language from two amendments introduced by Senator Akaka. The Committee favorably reported the legislation to the full Senate yesterday.I hope that this bill will help curb the number of poorly planned and poorly executed contracts that we have seen in recent years, Akaka said. The amendments, agreed to by Chairman Joseph I. Lieberman (ID-CT) and Ranking Member Susan M. Collins (R-ME), would increase accountability for accuracy in federal procurement data systems, and will directly link award and incentive fees with positive contractor performance.During a June Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management hearing chaired by Senator Akaka, it was revealed that a Coast Guard contractor responsible for fleet modernization received over 80 percent of the available contract award fees, despite delivering cutters that were not up to the specifications of the contract and incurring severe cost overruns. This is one of many examples of the government awarding fees for substandard performance. Senator Akakas amendment is intended to curb such practices. This amendment, covering the entire federal government, expands on a similar provision that Senator Akaka was able to include in the FY2007 DoD Authorization bill targeting Department of Defense contracts.-30-
