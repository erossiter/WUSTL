Washington, D.C. - Today on Capitol Hill, Senator Daniel K. Akaka met with Miss Aloha Hula 2006, Bernice Alohanamakanamaikalanimai Davis-Lim and Kumu Hula Leialoha Lim Amina of Na Lei O Kaholoku. It was very exciting for me to come here and meet Senator Akaka, said Davis-Lim. I really appreciate the knowledge he shared and everything he does for Hawaii. Senator Akaka presented Davis-Lim with a Certificate of Recognition for her accomplishment in the 43rd Annual Merrie Monarch Hula Festival. During their meeting Senator Akaka asked Davis-Lim about her experience on stage and they discussed the legends of Poliahu, the snow goddess. At last months contest Davis-Lim performed dances in honor of Poliahu. This is a very important achievement in your life that will undoubtedly shape your future, you are a leader, Senator Akaka told Davis-Lim. Cherish these memories and pass them on to our keiki so that they too can learn from you. This past weekend, Davis-Lim and Amina gave a hula workshop attended by more than 50 participants. Davis-Lim also performed her award-winning dances for them. This is their first trip to Washington, D.C. and their first time meeting Senator Akaka. I got chicken-skin! When I came into his office I saw the existence of aloha, remarked Amina. Senator Akaka is certainly the ambassador of aloha. I am truly humbled by being here. After their meeting they toured the Capitol building and visited the Old Post Office in downtown D.C. where students of Na Pua Maeole from Pahoa High and Intermediate School were performing. In reflecting on the presence of hula in the area, Davis-Lim said, Its nice to see hula flourishing here. The folks here really have a passion for the hula and that makes me appreciate hula even more.
