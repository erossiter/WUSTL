Washington, DC -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), today welcomed the announcement of the nomination of Linda M. Springer as the new Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Senator Akaka said, I look forward to having the opportunity to meet with Ms. Springer and discuss the critical issues facing the federal civil service, especially with the Administrations push to extend the new personnel flexibilities granted to the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to the rest of the federal government. The OPM is the federal agency charged with building a high quality and diverse federal workforce that is based on merit system principles. Senator Akaka is the Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, which has jurisdiction over the federal civil service.
