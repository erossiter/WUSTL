Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) released the following statement today in reaction to reports of a possible earlier-than-expected deployment of the 29th Brigade Combat Team:It is my understanding that the Pentagon is considering a possible deployment for members of Hawaiis 29th Brigade Combat Team for fall 2008 but has yet to make an official notification to either Major General Robert G.F. Lee or the Hawaii Congressional delegation. I am concerned about the affect this quick redeployment will have on our soldiers and their families. It falls well short of the National Guard Bureaus goal of five years between combat deployments.We have asked the brave men and women in our National Guard to make great sacrifices in the service of this nation; in return, we need to make sure they receive sufficient periods of time to reconnect with their family and life between deployments. As Chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management, I am particularly concerned about the consequences of calling troops back to the war zone before they have adequate time to rest and train. As the reports have yet to be confirmed, it is my hope that the Department of Defense will further discuss the potential impact of early redeployment on military members and their families with General Lee and the other State Adjutant Generals, Akaka said. -30-
