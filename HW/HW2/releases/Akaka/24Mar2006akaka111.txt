I am pleased that Senator Dodd could see first hand the programs that he initiated, such as Head Start. We are doing all we can to make sure these types of programs will be funded so it can continue to create a healthy learning environment for our keiki, said Senator Akaka. Following their visit in Kalihi-Palama, Senators Akaka and Dodd met with staff, parents and children at the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children. Senator Akaka noted that 43 percent of patient discharges from Kapiolani are Medicaid-Quest beneficiaries. Senator Akaka has introduced legislation that would repeal requirements that would disproportionately impact low-income, racial and ethnic minorities. I met with a mother today who said if it wasnt for Medicaid benefits her special-needs child would not be able to receive the kind of care he is getting now at Kapiolani. Parents who are dealing with the hardships of having a sick child should not have an additional burden worrying about whether they qualify for Medicaid benefits, Senator Akaka stated. Senator Akaka has worked closely with Senator Dodd who is a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the senior Democrat on its Education and Early Childhood Development Subcommittee. Both Senators are continuing the fight to correct the inequities and failures of the recently passed budget.
