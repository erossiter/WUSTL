Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka issued this statement tonight in response to President George W. Bushs proposal to increase U.S. troop strength in Iraq by more that 20,000: I oppose President Bushs plan to increase U.S. troops in Iraq. The plan calls for increasing troop strength and providing additional funding, without measurable goals and without an exit strategy to complete our mission. This is a war that we should never have gotten into and I oppose putting more American lives in jeopardy.I am disappointed that the President did not take to heart the Iraq Study Groups recommendation that called for new and enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region. To date, more than 3,000 Americans have died. We owe it to both our honored dead and wounded to ensure that their sacrifices were not in vain, that we stabilize the Iraqi government and that we withdraw our troops as soon as possible. With approximately 135,000 troops presently in Iraq, an additional 20,000 soldiers represents a 15 percent increase in troop size. I am also concerned about our National Guard and Reserve members who may be asked to make up the bulk of the 20,000 plus increase in troops.It will also have repercussions relative to the recruitment and retention of our Guard and Reserve units.Senator Akaka, who is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, says he looks forward to hearing more about the Presidents plan from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Peter Pace during Fridays (Jan. 12) Committee hearing.
