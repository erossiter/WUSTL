I strongly support Net Neutrality. The Internet has transformed the way our society thinks and communicates in recent years. Today, people all across the country are able to share ideas and communicate, and this open communication has helped make our country a truer democracy. For this reason, I have serious reservations about S. 2686/H.R. 5252. As it is currently drafted, the bill gives network operators too much control over how the Internet will operate and what kind of content it will include. Everyone should be able to enjoy the Internet freely, and I will fight to preserve the Internet when this issue comes to the Senate floor.
