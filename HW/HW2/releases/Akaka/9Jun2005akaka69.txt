Washington, D.C. - Senators Daniel K. Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye today are pleased to announce Hawaii will receive $20,051,460 from the Department of Veterans of Affairs to construct a new 95-Bed State Veterans Nursing Home with Adult Day Health Care in Hilo. This federal grant represents 65% of the anticipated cost of construction. The state has guaranteed the balance of necessary funding. Senator Akaka said, This grant lays the foundation for a much needed facility that will provide Hawaii veterans with long-term care. In light of the Presidents proposals for State Veterans Homes, I will be fighting to make sure that the operating funds flow from the VA without interruption. I am pleased to see this facility becoming a reality, as it reflects the collaborative efforts of federal, state and county officials, as well as Hawaiis veterans community. Senator Inouye stated, This funding is a testament to our commitment to provide the excellent care our older veterans deserve. They willingly stepped forward to put themselves at risk when they were asked to do so, and now we can assist them in their time of need through this new facility. Senator Akaka is the Ranking Member on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee; Senator Inouye is the Ranking Member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Both Senators are World War II veterans.
