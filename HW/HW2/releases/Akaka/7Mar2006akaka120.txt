Washington, D.C. -- Today, Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) asked Admiral William Fallon, the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, on basing an additional aircraft carrier in Hawaii.
Last month the Department of Defense (DoD) released its Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) which stated the Navy will "adjust its force posture to provide at least six operationally available and sustainable carriers and 60 percent of its submarines in the Pacific."
Senator Akaka stated, "For years, I have said that basing an aircraft carrier in Hawaii, co-located with our nuclear capable shipyard, will prove to be the best option from an economic and quality of life standpoint, in addition to its strategic benefits."
During the Senate Armed Forces Committee Hearing, Admiral Fallon told Senator Akaka that the Navy is reviewing the various possibilities of basing a carrier in the Pacific.  He also noted there have been some discussions on home porting submarines in Guam.  Although the Navy is taking steps to increase the carriers, Admiral Fallon said no decision has been made.
Admiral Fallon assured Senator Akaka that an increase in the number of aircraft carriers in the Pacific will add flexibility and strike power.  
Following the hearing, Senator Akaka said, "I am pleased that Admiral Fallon recognizes the importance of having an additional carrier in Hawaii.  However, I am disappointed that the Navy has not yet determined the location of the carrier, and will continue to urge the Navy to finalize their plan for forward basing."
Senator Akaka is the Ranking Member on the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support.
