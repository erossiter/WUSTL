Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka and leaders of the Senates Committee on Energy and Natural Resources today returned from two and a half days on the Gulf Coast. Committee member Akaka joined Chairman Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Ranking Member Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) in assessing the damage to the Gulfs energy infrastructure incurred by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As we flew over some of the most devastated parishes of New Orleans to understand how the levees breached, it became even more apparent that what we are doing in Congress is not enough, stated Senator Akaka. We must carefully examine what must be done to prevent future disruptions in the oil markets, the supply of gasoline, and provision of electricity and natural gas. The leaders visited refineries, natural gas pipelines, petrochemical plants and electrical utilities in New Orleans, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Senator Akaka noted, Our nations energy infrastructure must be able to meet the challenges from acts that may disrupt our petrochemical and oil markets, electricity and natural gas. Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Both Committees will continue to review the federal governments role in its response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow, October 6, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. in SD 366 to discuss legislative options for dealing with our energy security.
