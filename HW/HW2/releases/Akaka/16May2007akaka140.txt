WASHINGTON, D.C. - In a response to a letter from U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, to VA Secretary James Nicholson, VA has announced it will be placing a Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialist in Hawaii. There are over 700 blind and low vision veterans in Hawaii. I am pleased VA is taking this action to improve care for blind and low vision veterans in Hawaii. The need for a specialist in our state was great. While community hospital facilities and social workers have worked to fill the void, that cannot substitute for dedicated VA care in the islands. This is an important step in the right direction to address the need for vision care for veterans in Hawaii, stated Akaka.-30-
