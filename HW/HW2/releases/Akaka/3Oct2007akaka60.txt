Senator Akakas floor statement following the vote appears below:Today, I was pleased to vote in favor of the FY08 Defense Appropriations Act. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my good friend and colleague from Hawaii Senator Inouye, and Ranking Member Stevens for their leadership in managing this bill with such impartiality and expediency. Not only does this bill fully support the facility, training and equipment requirements of our men and women in uniform, but it also provides a much needed increase in funds for military health over the Presidents budget request to ensure that members of our Armed Forces receive the care that they deserve. As Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I strongly supported the additional inclusion of $73 million to fund the programs authorized in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warrior Act which addresses shortfalls in the care provided to our injured or ill soldiers. I also applaud the inclusion in this bill of a provision which recognizes the dedication and sacrifices made by both the members of our Armed Forces and their civilian counterparts by providing a 3.5 percent increase in basic pay for all service members and civilian personnel, a 0.5 percent increase above the Presidents request. I was also pleased to support the addition of $1 billion to properly equip the National Guard and Reserve forces who risk their lives to defend our nation, Akaka said.The Defense Appropriations bill provides more than $34 million for Hawaii projects.
