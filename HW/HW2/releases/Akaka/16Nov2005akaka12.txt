Washington, D.C. -- The U.S. Senate today passed an Akaka Amendment that will allow pilots to receive their maximum pension benefits. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) offered the legislation to mandate the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to take into account that pilots are required to retire at the age of 60 when calculating their benefits. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Pilots Equitable Treatment Amendment passed by a vote of 58 to 41. My amendment corrects an injustice, stated Senator Akaka. Pilot pension plans have been some of the largest pension plan terminations in history. This is a step forward in giving pilots the retirement security they need. Passage of this legislation benefits US Airways and United Airlines pilots in addition to other legacy carriers whose pensions were absorbed by the PBGC. In Hawaii there are 91 United and US Airways pilots in the Air Line Pilots Association data base and 305 active or retired Aloha Airlines pilots. Aloha Airlines recently filed to terminate its pension plan. Cosponsoring of this amendment include: Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Ken Salazar (D-CO), and Dan Inouye (D-HI).
