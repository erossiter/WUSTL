Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today issued the following response to President Bushs recent signing statement for H.R. 5441, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for 2007, regarding the qualifications imposed for the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).I strongly disagree with the Presidents decision to ignore provisions I authored in the Homeland Security Appropriations Act for FY 07 on the grounds that it interferes with his authority to make personnel decisions. Given the failures of FEMA before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina, it is unconscionable for President Bush to oppose provisions in the law establishing minimum qualifications for the Director of FEMA to have emergency management and leadership experience. During hearings by the Homeland Security Committee last year, we found that leadership matters. The American people should be able to trust that the federal government has learned from the mistakes of the past and will do everything in its power to prevent and adequately respond to another catastrophe. FEMA should have the most qualified leaders possible. Unfortunately for the American people, the President doesnt agree.Senator Akaka is the Ranking Member of Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on the Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia. He introduced S. 2040, the Department of Homeland Security Qualified Leaders Act on November 17, 2005.
