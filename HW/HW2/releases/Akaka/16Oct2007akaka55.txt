FROM THE OFFICE OF SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID:With the vote to override President Bushs veto fast approaching in the House of Representatives, the President and his allies in Congress continue to repeat myths about the program. But the facts are clear. The bipartisan compromise Childrens Health Insurance bill will provide coverage for 3.8 million more uninsured low-income children. The President has decided to use this heartless veto to make a political stand, rather than putting kids first.White House Myth #1: Bipartisan Compromise CHIP Bill Does Not Focus on Poor Kids. The problem is that the current program -- and by the way, theres about a half a million children who are eligible who arent signed up.So I said, Why dont we focus on the poor children rather than expand the program beyond its initial intent? [President Bush Speech to Lancaster, PA Chamber of Commerce, 10/3/07]White House Myth #2: Bipartisan Compromise CHIP Bill Would Cover Children From Families Earning Up to $83,000 Per Year. It is estimated by -- well, heres the thing, just so you know, this program expands coverage --- federal coverage -- up to families earning $83,000 a year. That doesnt sound poor to me. The intent of the program was to focus on poorer children, not adults or families earning up to $83,000 a year. [President Bush Speech to Lancaster, PA Chamber of Commerce, 10/3/07]White House Myth #3: Bipartisan Compromise CHIP Bill Would Move Millions of Children With Private Health Insurance to Government Health Care. The proposal would move millions of American children who now have private health insurance into government-run health care. [President Bush Press Conference, 9/20/07]White House Myth #4: Bipartisan Compromise CHIP Bill Would Federalize Health Care. And the policies of the government ought to be, help people find private insurance, not federal coverage. And thats where the philosophical divide comes in. I happen to believe that what youre seeing when you expand eligibility for federal programs is the desire by some in Washington, D.C. to federalize health care. [President Bush Speech to Lancaster, PA Chamber of Commerce, 10/3/07]White House Myth #5: Bipartisan CHIP Proposal Would Be Too Expensive and Raise Taxes. The proposal congressional leaders are pushing would raise taxes on working Americans and would raise spending by $35 to $50 billion. Their proposal would result in taking a program meant to help poor children and turning it into one that covers children in some households with incomes of up to $83,000 a year.
