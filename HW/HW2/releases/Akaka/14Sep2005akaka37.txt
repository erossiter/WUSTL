Washington, D.C. -- Today Senator Daniel K. Akaka, (D-HI), a senior member on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, participated in the first of a series of Committee hearings on the response to Hurricane Katrina. Senator Akaka underscored his disappointment over the governments role in preparing for and responding to this disaster. According to Senator Akaka, Congress has given considerable attention to making Americans more safe, since September 11, 2001. Yet, he said, there are disturbing similarities between Hurricane Katrina and 9-11, including similarities in what was known beforehand and how the government reacted to pending dangers. Hawaii is also threatened by hurricanes and has been badly battered in the past by them. It is the hurricane season now, stated Senator Akaka. My constituents want to know how their government can do better. They want to be assured that if Hawaii is hit again that they will be helped. All Americans want that assurance. Senator Akaka added, When I think of the devastation along the Gulf Coast, accountability comes to mind. There are a lot of tough questions that have to be asked. We have a Department of Homeland Security which has multiple tasks - including protecting us against natural disasters. Tomorrow, Senator Akaka questions the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) nominees, Stewart Baker and Julie Myers, as he works to ensure those leading DHS have the necessary experience and qualifications. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold the nomination hearing on Thursday, September 15, 2005, at 10:30 a.m. EST.
