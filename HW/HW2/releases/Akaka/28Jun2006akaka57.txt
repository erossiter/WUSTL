Washington, D.C. - Tomorrow, Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) will highlight the immediate need to delay and fix Medicaid documentation requirements that will be implemented on July 1, 2006; and the urgency to enact legislation to protect access to health care for people dependent on Medicaid.The additional documentation requirements will create barriers to health care, are unnecessary, and will be difficult for state Medicaid programs to administer. More than 51 million individuals in this country will be burdened by having to produce additional documentation. Greatly affected will be minority and indigenous communities, and individuals with disabilities, seniors, and foster children. Senator Akaka will be joined by other concerned lawmakers including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and a broad coalition of health organizations.
