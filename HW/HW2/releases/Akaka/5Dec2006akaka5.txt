Washington, DC -- Following todays ruling on John Doe v. Kamehameha Schools, Senator Daniel K. Akaka made the following statement:Todays decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit sends a clear message reaffirming the values of Kamehameha Schools. While it was my alma maters admission policy that was in question, there is no doubt that todays ruling recognizes the special circumstances of Native Hawaiians.As we progress into the 110th Congress, I remain committed to working with the Hawaii Congressional delegation to enact legislation that will formalize the existing legal and political relationship Native Hawaiians have with our federal government.
