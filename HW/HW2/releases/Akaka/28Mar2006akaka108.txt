Commenting on the news, Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Ranking Member on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, thanked Congressman Evans for his service. Lane Evans is a champion for veterans, said Akaka. I have long admired his unshakeable commitment to those who have served in our Nations Armed Forces. I will miss serving with him but wish him much aloha in the future. Congressman Evans championed the Millennium Act, which ensures that veterans will be provided with long-term care, something that those eligible for Medicare are not even provided. He also was a proponent for eligibility reform that allowed all veterans to enroll in the VA health care system.
