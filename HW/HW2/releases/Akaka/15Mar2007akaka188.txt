Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, met today with the Co-Chairs of the Presidents Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors, Bob Dole and Donna Shalala. Akaka praised the Presidents selection of Dole and Shalala, and has offered his assistance in support of their work. But Akaka again expressed his concern about the limitations placed on the Commission, which is charged with investigating shortcomings in medical care for troops returning from war, including the poor conditions reported at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.I continue to be deeply impressed by the commitment of Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala, and Im glad theyre on the job working to improve conditions for our wounded warriors, Akaka said. I was also pleased to hear that several Iraq war veterans are on the commission. Their first-hand insight will be invaluable.I will help the commission in any way I can, and Ive directed my staff to do the same. But I remain concerned that they need far more time than theyve been given, if they are to have the practical impact that I know they wish to have, Akaka said.
