Washington, DC - Today Senators Larry Craig (R-ID) and Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Chairman and Ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, sent a letter to its appropriations subcommittee urging an increase in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and Prosthetics Research Program.The letter states: The proposed level of direct funds does not keep pace with inflation and will compel VA to cut numerous projects. Therefore, we support a FY07 funding level of $432 million, in order to cover inflation, sustain current VA research and development commitments, and allow critical new research initiatives to move forward. Craig and Akaka joined forces in hopes to save VA research programs which are instrumental in developing innovative and effective methods of treatment. Modern warfare has unfortunately resulted in many wounded servicemembers in need of prosthetic limbs, extensive physical therapy, or have endured traumatic brain injuries. 41 Democrats and 21 Republicans signed on to the letter addressed to the Subcommittee on Military construction and Veterans Affairs Committee on Appropriations Chairperson Kay Bailey Hutchison and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein.
