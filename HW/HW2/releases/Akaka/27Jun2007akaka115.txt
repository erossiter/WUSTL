WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, held a hearing on the nomination of Charles L. Hopkins III to be the Department of Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary for Operations, Security, and Preparedness. This is a new position, established on October 1, 2006, that has never been filled. Mr. Hopkins experience as Director of the Office of National Security at FEMA, combined with his prior emergency preparedness background at other federal agencies and his many years military service, suggests that he is well qualified for taking on the challenges of this new office, stated Senator Akaka. Charles Hopkins was appointed as Director of the Office of National Security Coordination within Federal Emergency Management Agency in November 2005 and has over 30 years of service in the US Navy. --30--
