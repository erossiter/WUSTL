Washington, DC - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today offered the Hawaii Energy Assessment bill to help Hawaii and potentially other insular areas grapple with the difficult choices ahead with respect to energy independence. Senator Akaka said, The State of Hawaiis per capita energy use is well below the national average. In part, this is due to the fact that Hawaii is blessed with comfortable climate and short driving distances. Nonetheless, we have been paying some of the highest prices in the nation for our energy and continue to have the highest gasoline prices in the country. The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to assess the short- and long-term prospects of oil supply disruptions and price volatility and their impacts on Hawaii. It also directs the Secretary to assess the economic relationship between oil-fired generation of electricity from residual fuel and refined products consumed for transportation needs of Hawaii. Consistent high energy prices affect the economic vitality of the state. Before we invest in a different energy mix and infrastructure, we need to make transparent all the relations between fuels and the consequences of the directions we choose. Hawaii is dependent on oil for both transportation and electricity in ways that are without parallel in continental states. Hawaii also has an abundance of renewable energy resources, said Senator Akaka. It is the intent of this bill to assess these challenges and opportunities, and to help us develop a suitable roadmap for Hawaiis energy future.
