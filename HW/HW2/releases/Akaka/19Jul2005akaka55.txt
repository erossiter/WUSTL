I am pleased that President Bush has announced a nominee to fulfill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. I am familiar with Judge John G. Roberts, Jr. who is currently serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. However, this is a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Supreme Court and should receive greater scrutiny to ensure that he will represent justice.
