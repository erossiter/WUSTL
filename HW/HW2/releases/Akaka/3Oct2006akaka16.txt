Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) is pleased to announce the Hawaii County Economic Opportunity Council will receive $700,000 in Community Economic Development funding. This funding is critical for the Big Island as it continues to recuperate from the closing of its major sugar plantations over a decade ago, stated Senator Akaka. This money will go toward the creation of new agricultural industries for Hawaii Countys economic development and growth. In 2005, Hawaii County established the Orchid Tissue Culture Laboratory which now employs 25 individuals. The laboratory is one of several horticultural projects that will benefit from this award. The award is made possible through the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Community Services.
