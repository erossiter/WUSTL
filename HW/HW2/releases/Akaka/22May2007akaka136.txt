WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, announced that the Committee today approved the nomination of Michael Kussman, M.D., to serve as the Under Secretary of Health for the Department of Veterans Affairs. There were no dissenting votes. If confirmed by the full Senate, Dr. Kussman would manage the VA health care system, which has a budget of approximately $32 billion and delivers care to more than 7.7 million enrollees. He would oversee 198,000 health care professionals at more than 1,400 sites of care, including hospitals, community and facility-based clinics, nursing homes, domiciliary care facilities, and readjustment counseling centers. VAs Undersecretary of Health is one of the most important public servants, especially at this challenging time. With each passing day, more and more servicemembers are returning with serious injuries which, for some, will mean a lifetime of care from VA, stated Akaka. I am satisfied that Dr. Kussman is committed to making VA care the very best, and I am pleased that the Committee has approved this nomination.-30-
