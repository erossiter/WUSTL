U.S. Senators Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) and Daniel K. Inouye (D-HI) are pleased to announce that the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration has awarded the Oceanic Institute with a $400,000 National Marine Aquaculture Initiative grant.I commend the Oceanic Institute, an innovative and recognized community partner, in being awarded this grant, said Senator Akaka. This project is crucial in advancing our ability to develop the knowledge and infrastructure necessary for Hawaii to thrive as a global leader in offshore aquaculture.The Oceanic Institute, an affiliate of Hawaii Pacific University and a not-for-profit research and development organization, successfully competed with more than 200 proposals submitted by individuals, universities, nonprofit and commercial organizations, as well as federal, state, local and Indian tribal governments, to conduct one of 11 sustainable marine aquaculture demonstration projects.I am particularly pleased that funds will be utilized to address the critical scientific and regulatory issues related to managing offshore cultured fish stocks. This is a wonderful opportunity to showcase the talent of our Hawaii researchers and promote economic development and sustainable resource initiatives, said Senator Akaka.Senator Inouye added: Aquaculture and its related businesses have demonstrated direct economic benefits to many coastal communities, and Hawaii is uniquely suited to develop both open-ocean and onshore aquaculture capabilities. The state already has approximately 130 farms valued at $25.2 million supporting approximately 630 jobs. I believe we can be a leader in developing a highly successful aquaculture industry, and I am very pleased the Oceanic Institute was selected as the recipient of this important National Marine Aquaculture Initiative grant.
