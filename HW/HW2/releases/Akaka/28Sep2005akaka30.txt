Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today introduced legislation to ensure the humane slaughter of nonambualtory livestock, more commonly referred to as downed animals. The Downed Animal Protection Act prohibits inspectors to approve any nonambulatory livestock. This bill would declare downed animals in interstate and foreign commerce to be immediately and humanely euthanized when such livestock become nonambulatory. Now is not the time to lower our defenses on downer livestock, Senator Akaka stated. American consumers should be able to rely on the federal government to ensure that meat and meat by products are safe for human consumption. Downed animals are severely distressed recumbent animals that are to sick to rise or move on their own. Once an animal becomes immobile, it must lie where it falls, often without receiving basic assistance. The suffering of downed animals is so severe that the only humane solution is immediate euthanasia. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is looking to revisit its ban on downed cattle. This possible action contradicts public opinion as illustrated in a 2003 Zogby poll that showed a more than three-fourths of the U.S. population believe it is unacceptable to use downed animals for human consumption. The poll showed even more Americans are concerned about the risks of mad cow disease as a result of sending downed animals to slaughterhouses. Senator Akakas legislation would restore American confidence in our meat industry by setting a uniform national standard. Passage of this act would send the right message to consumers here in the United States and around the world, that our meat industry is serious about ensuring the health and well being of all consumers, said Senator Akaka.
