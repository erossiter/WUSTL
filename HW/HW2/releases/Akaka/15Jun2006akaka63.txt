Washington, D.C. - Today Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) joined President George W. Bush at the White House to hear the Administrations proclamation establishing the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve as a National Marine Monument. Senator Akaka, Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks, has requested a hearing to ensure that the unique cultural and natural resources are preserved.Following the Presidents announcement, Senator Akaka made the following statement: Although this is a departure from the National Marine Sanctuary process, I commend President Bush for recognizing the ecological value and unique native species of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. For years, Senator Inouye and I have worked with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and community groups to ensure proper stewardship of this tremendous island chain. It is my hope that the Administration will continue these relationships to properly incorporate the cultural traditions that are of great importance to Native Hawaiians and careful traditions of fishermen.This is a great day for the preservation of our ocean and coral reef ecosystems. But I firmly believe all stakeholders must have input in the future of this precious resource. I will be vigilant in making sure that effective oversight over this National Monument is provided.
