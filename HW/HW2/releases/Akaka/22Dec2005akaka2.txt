Washington, D.C. -- Senate leaders last night reassured Senator Daniel K. Akaka they will work on getting S. 147, Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, on the calendar when the session resumes next year. Majority Leader Bill Frist and Minority Leader Harry Reid both pledged to work with Senator Akaka on taking appropriate steps to assure Senate action on S. 147 in the second session of the 109th Congress. Senator Akaka said, I commend the Majority Leader for his diligent efforts to proceed to consideration of this measure that is so important to the citizens of Hawaii. I look forward to working with him to bring S. 147 to the Senate floor at the earliest possible time. In the 108th Congress, the Leaders agreed that S. 147 would be brought before the Senate on or before August 7, 2005. The Senate was scheduled to vote on a procedural motion related to S. 147 on September 6, 2005. However, the tragic devastation of Hurricane Katrina clearly demanded the Congress immediate action and delayed consideration of S. 147. My discussions with the Leaders were very positive. This is welcome news as we break for the holidays, Senator Akaka stated.
