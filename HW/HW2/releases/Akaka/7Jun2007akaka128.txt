WASHINGTON D.C. --In a series of procedural votes today that required the approval of sixty members, the U.S. Senate was unable to end debate on the substitute amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform bill (S.1348). U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) released the following statement in response:I am disappointed that the immigration reform our country needs is on hold for now. The bills momentum was killed by opponents who could not agree on what amendments to offer and vote upon. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did indicate that we will revisit this important legislation at a later time.As a result of setting aside the legislation, my Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, included in the bill to exempt the children of certain elderly Filipino World War II veterans from the numerical limitation on visas, is unfortunately on hold as well. I will continue to work for overall immigration reform that focuses on family reunification and legalization, and I will fight to allow these brave veterans to be cared for by their sons and daughters as they move through their golden years, Akaka said.--30--
