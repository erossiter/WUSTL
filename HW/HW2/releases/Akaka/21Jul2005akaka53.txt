Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka tonight continues to pursue Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist in hopes of moving S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, to the floor for debate before the August recess. Following the last Senate vote this evening, Senator Akaka said, I was unable to speak with Senator Frist, who unexpectedly did not come to the last vote. I learned that the Majority Leader left on a trip and will not be returning to the Capitol tomorrow or Monday. Although I am disappointed, I am making every effort to reach him by phone tonight and throughout the weekend. Senator Akaka seeks to lay down the petition to invoke cloture, which would end the filibuster and require 60 votes for passage.
