I am deeply concerned about this situation, both as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and, given that many of these wounded troops will soon be classified as veterans, as Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. I intend to hold a hearing next month on cooperation between VA and the Department of Defense on the treatment of injured service members, and I will pursue the situation at Walter Reed and other military treatment facilities that are handling the bulk of returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans to ensure that the government is helping those who have been injured in service to our country, and their families, Senator Akaka said. Im pleased to see that Walter Reed has begun some immediate work on the one residence facility that sounded the worst in the report. There is a solemn compact between the nation and those who wear its uniform and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is honored.
