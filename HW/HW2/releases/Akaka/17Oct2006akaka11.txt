Honolulu, HI - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today applauded President George W. Bush for declaring a major disaster for the State of Hawaii. This declaration provides the release of federal funds to help communities recover from the earthquake that struck Hawaii on October 15, 2006. I am pleased that the President recognizes the urgent need for federal assistance to Hawaii as we continue to assess the damage that has been caused by Sundays earthquake, stated Senator Akaka. The Presidents declaration gives a green light for federal funding in certain areas of reconstruction, however I will continue to push for Individual Assistance funding which has not yet been granted.This morning Senator Akaka sent a letter to the President asking for federal assistance in support of Governor Linda Lingles request to declare a major disaster in the State of Hawaii.
