U.S. Senators Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) and Daniel K. Inouye (D-HI) announced today that Hawaii will receive $12.9 million in State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in fiscal year 2006. Honolulu was selected as one of 46 Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) cities. UASI cities are considered high-threat, high-density urban areas needing protection against acts of terrorism and catastrophic events. The $12.9 million includes $4.76 million in UASI program funding.This allocation underscores the importance of Honolulu being a UASI city and our states unique geographical location,said Senator Akaka, senior member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It is important for Hawaii, with no neighboring states, to be self-sufficient if disaster strikes.The Hawaii State Civil Defense will use the $12.9 million for such critical activities as emergency communications equipment, special needs shelters, and mass casualty care, said Senator Inouye, senior member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. I have fought continually to maintain a baseline homeland security funding allocation for each state - which this Administration opposes, said Senator Akaka.My priority as a member of the Homeland Security Committee is to ensure that Hawaiis needs are met.Senators Akaka and Inouye say they will work with state officials to ensure that Hawaii is not disadvantaged in the grant award process because of population size and geographic location.
