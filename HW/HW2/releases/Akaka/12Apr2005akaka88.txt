Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) announced today the Bureau of Primary Health Care has awarded $650,000 to the Koolauloa Community Health and Wellness Center, Inc. and $650,000 for the establishment of the West Hawaii Community Health Center. This award is a big step to provide West Hawaii with a much-needed community health center, said Senator Akaka. The community center will be located in Kailua Kona and meet the health care needs of people in a region that has experienced rapid population growth over the past two decades and a growing number of uninsured residents. The Koolauloa Community Health and Wellness Center, Inc. is located in Kahuku where more than 38 percent of its residents fall below the federal poverty level. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders comprise 61 percent of the regions population. More than 40 percent of the centers clients do not have health insurance. Senator Akaka said, Given the limited access to health and dental care services for residents of this region, the funding KCHWC will receive is important and timely.
