Washington, D.C.--"Today the US District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed what I have long believed to be true about the National Security Personnel System -- that NSPS strips key employee rights and protections. Judge Emmet Sullivan found that the system does not ensure collective bargaining, that the National Security Labor Relations Board is not independent, and that the new appeals process is not fair. This ruling affirms my contention that the NSPS is a no-win situation for Hawaii and the nation's DoD civilian employees."Hopefully the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management will now engage in meaningful discussions with employee representatives and really listen to their suggestions to develop a personnel system that preserves collective bargaining and appeals in both name and substance. Our nation and our employees deserve no less."Senator Akaka is the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Ranking Member of the Readiness Subcommittee on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  He was one of three Senators to vote against legislation creating NSPS in 2003.
