WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akakas amendment to S. 1642, the Higher Education Bill, to make Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders eligible for the federally-funded McNair Scholars Program, was approved by the Senate today. The McNair Scholars Program prepares low-income, first generation, and underrepresented minority students for graduate studies. The amendment would ensure the inclusion of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders as underrepresented groups eligible for McNair scholarships.According to the U.S. Census, only 14 percent of Pacific Islanders earn a bachelors degree and just four percent earn a graduate degree. They are certainly underrepresented in higher education, and it is only right that programs for underrepresented minorities, such as the McNair Scholars Program, include Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, said Senator Akaka. My amendment simply recognizes that Pacific Islanders are an underrepresented group, which will give them the opportunity to apply to the McNair program. Senator Akaka is a leader on Pacific Islander issues, especially in the area of higher education. The Higher Education Bill, which now includes Senator Akakas amendment, is currently being debated on the Senate floor. If passed, the Higher Education Bill will ensure that Pacific Islanders will have the opportunity to apply for the McNair Scholars Program. -30-
