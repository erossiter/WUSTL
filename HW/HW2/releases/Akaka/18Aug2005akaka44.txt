Honolulu, HI - Senator Daniel K. Akaka announced today the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, S. 147, addresses the legal and political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States within federal law. Senator Akaka is not a proponent of independence or secession of the State of Hawaii as was indicated in a broadcast by the National Public Radio on August 16, 2005. Senator Akaka said, S. 147 has nothing to do with independence or secession of the State of Hawaii from the United States. I support addressing the legal and political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States within federal law. I do not support independence or secession of the State of Hawaii from the United States. S. 147 authorizes a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized government-to-government relationship with the United States. Senator Akaka said, My bill is criticized because it provides a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity and the resolution of longstanding issues. Opponents of the bill seek to predetermine the outcome of this process, whereas I believe the people of Hawaii need to have the flexibility to address the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow. After the Native Hawaiian governing entity is recognized, these issues will be negotiated between the entity and the Federal and State governments. This is an inclusive and democratic process that cannot be predetermined by those who seek to influence the outcome of the process before its even started. When asked by NPR about the outcomes of the process authorized in S. 147, Senator Akaka stated that the outcome will be determined by future generations of the people of Hawaii - including his children and grandchildren.
