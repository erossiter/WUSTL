Inouye and Akaka strongly supported the grant in a letter sent to the agencys Seattle Regional Office in January. The Senators said the project has the ability to enable the economic self-sufficiency of the residents and communities in Leeward Oahu. The center will house classrooms for job training and development, as well as a Goodwill retail store and donation center. The facility would assist an initial 1,600 clients with literacy training, as well as counseling in resume writing and job interviews. The center would enable Leeward residents to get job training without untaking a 3-hour round trip to access training programs in urban Honolulu.
