Washington, D.C. - Today Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) delivered a letter to Senate Appropriators calling for an increase of $100 million for operations funding for National Parks (ONPS). The letter is a bipartisan effort to support and restore Americas National parks, including Hawaiis six National Park units. Thirty-seven Senators, over a third of the Senate, signed the bipartisan letter. Our National Parks are cultural and natural treasures that need proper care and interpretation. We cannot sit idly by while the funding for National Parks stagnates, said Senator Akaka. Senator Craig Thomas (R-WY) joined Senator Akaka in initiating the request. The letter states: While the National Park Services operating budget has increased in recent years, it has failed to keep pace with the increasing demands placed on our parks ... The public expects Americas national parks - our nations heritage - to be adequately protected and maintained so that visitors are educated and inspired by these natural and cultural wonders. Although the Administration requested an increase for ONPS for FY 2006, 80 percent is allocated to fixed costs but leaves no room for operation and personnel costs and new programmatic needs. Senator Akaka is the ranking member of the National Parks subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Energy and Resources.
