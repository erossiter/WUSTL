Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today voted against the nomination of Julie Myers for the Department of Homeland Security head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE is the second largest federal law enforcement agency with more than 15,000 employees and a budget of $4 billion. The DHS Inspector General identified ICE as having numerous management problems. The head of ICE should be an individual who has demonstrated extensive executive level leadership and the ability to manage a budget through reorganizations and budget cycles - experience already in hand to do the job, stated Senator Akaka. Ms. Myers tenure at previous positions has never been long enough to see an entire budget cycle - a critical function because of the serious financial issues at ICE, added Senator Akaka. The recent events surrounding the Administrations reaction to Hurricane Katrina demonstrate that the most qualified and experienced people should lead the Department of Homeland and Security. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) reported out Myers nomination by a 7 to 2 vote. Her nomination has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Akaka is the Ranking Member on the HSGAC Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia.
