WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, today applauded the recently announced Department of Veterans Affairs pilot programs to improve support for families and other caregivers of veterans. These programs, which will receive nearly $5 million in grant monies this year, stem from legislation championed by Senator Akaka which was included in the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006. Families and other caregivers are on the front lines of our efforts to care for veterans who have served this nation bravely. I applaud the development of these new pilot programs which will provide caregivers with education and training on furnishing care to veterans who are receiving care outside of hospitals or long-term care facilities, as well as with other resources that will support the caregivers, said Senator Akaka. -30-
