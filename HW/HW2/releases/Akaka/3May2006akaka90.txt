Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today released the following statement regarding the release of the White Houses National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan. I am pleased the President has now clarified the Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) role in pandemic planning, since DHSs insufficient involvement in federal avian flu planning has concerned me. While the Department of Health and Human Services has the public health lead, DHS is responsible for such critical activities as border inspections, infrastructure protection, and continuity of operations in the event of a pandemic outbreak. I wrote to the President expressing this concern on March 29, and have yet to receive a response. However, I hope we will see a renewed sense of urgency from DHS as a result of this plan. The Administration has had years to plan for an event that it estimates could result in 2 million deaths. Frankly, Im worried that there is the same lack of urgency and effectiveness in preparing for such a possible catastrophic event as we saw in the Administrations response to Hurricane Katrina. My main concern is that Hawaii, a key tourist and business destination for visitors from Asia, could be at the front lines of an avian flu outbreak. And with our remote location, medical assistance from the Mainland may be slow to arrive. The DHS Chief Medical Officer (CMO), who has only a skeleton staff, is responsible for DHSs pandemic plans, a mammoth challenge. Yet, the CMO recently was tapped to be the Acting Undersecretary for Science and Technology, a directorate with a budget over $1 billion. I raised this issue with Secretary Chertoff in March, and he assured me that the President would nominate a permanent Undersecretary for Science and Technology soon. However, a nominee has not yet been named. Senator Akaka serves on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
