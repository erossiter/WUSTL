Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senate Resolutions introduced by Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) congratulate three Hawaii youth baseball teams which won world championships earlier this summer on the mainland. The teams are: the Ewa Beach Little Leaguers, Little League World Series Champions; the Oahu All-Stars, Cal Ripken World Series Champions; and the Hawaii Warriors, Continental Amateur Baseball Association World Series Champions. Senator Akaka noted that all three teams persevered through difficult tournament competition to become world champions. I am proud not only of the impressive wins but also the humility and sportsmanship that the teams displayed as they won with aloha, says Senator Akaka. All teams represented the State of Hawaii, and the United States, very well. The Senate Record includes each player and coach by name and position. The Resolutions also call upon President Bush to invite the teams to the White House in honor of their championships.
