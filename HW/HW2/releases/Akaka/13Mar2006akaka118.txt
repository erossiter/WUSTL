Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka made the following statement on the Senate floor today regarding the death of Mrs. Maggie Inouye:
"Mr. President, on behalf my wife Millie and my entire family, I rise to express our sincere sympathies, deepest condolences, and our warmest aloha to my dear friend, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, for the loss of his wife, Maggie, who passed away this afternoon.  
"Over the past year, I have often asked Dan about Maggie.  He's always said, 'she's a trooper, she's doing the best she can.'  That really sums it up well -- Maggie was definitely a trooper.
"She was a wonderful lady who served our country as a Senate spouse for the past 40 plus years.  Maggie was a classy woman who was well-respected everywhere she went.  She had a heart of gold and will definitely be missed by the people of Hawaii and in Washington, D.C.
"My thoughts and prayers go to Senator Inouye, his son Kenny and his wife, their extended family and all of the Inouye staff here in Washington and in Hawaii.  We stand ready to do whatever we can to help in this difficult time.  We will miss Maggie, may her soul rest in peace."
