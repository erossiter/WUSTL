WASHIGNTON, D.C. - U.S. Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia, expressed concern today about news accounts describing political briefings provided for Administration officials involved in foreign policy. The White House already has acknowledged that officials working in domestic policy received semi-regular political briefings over the past six years. The Hatch Act is an indispensable tool to ensure that Federal government works for the American people rather than for a partisan agenda, Akaka said. The Hatch Act is intended to shield federal employees from partisan politics. The Hatch Act forbids executive branch officials from even implicitly soliciting partisan activity from federal employees. The White Houses briefings about the Republican Partys prospects in specific elections, conducted during the work day in federal buildings, seem designed to encourage federal officials to engage in partisan activities. These briefings clearly seem to violate the spirit - and perhaps, the letter - of the Hatch Act. I plan to review the Hatch Act to determine if its scope is sufficiently clear and to hold a hearing regarding Hatch Act compliance. We need to reassure the public that their government acts impartially, Akaka said. --30--
