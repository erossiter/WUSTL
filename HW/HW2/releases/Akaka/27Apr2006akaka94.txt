Washington, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today introduced legislation to promote the rights and freedoms of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages. The bill, the Native American Language Amendments Act (NALA) of 2006, is cosponsored by Daniel K. Inouye (D-HI) and Max Baucus (D-MT).This bill is of particular importance to me because as a young child, I was discouraged from speaking Hawaiian and practicing Hawaiian customs and traditions because I was told that it would not allow me to succeed in the Western world, stated Akaka. Through this legislation I am working to ensure that our children and families in Hawaii and across the country are never put in a position where they are forced to relinquish their language or culture.According to Senator Akaka, Native Hawaiian Language Immersion schools in Hawaii are achieving great success by shaping our youth who are steeped in not only the language, traditions, and knowledge of their ancestors, but who are also empowered and equipped with the tools to combat contemporary challenges that confront our communities.Senator Inouye added: Language is the heart of all cultures. When a language withers, so, too, does its culture. Hawaii has shown that when there is renewed interest in the native language, the native culture flourishes. This legislation will ensure that native languages and native cultures will have the opportunity to thrive and flourish. It also encourages elders to teach our future leaders about their unique cultures.The NALA Amendments Act of 2006 will:Action and investment in the preservation of Native languages is needed, said Senator Akaka.
