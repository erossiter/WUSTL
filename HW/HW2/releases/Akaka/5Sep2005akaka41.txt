Washington, D.C. -- The motion to invoke cloture on motion to proceed to S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, will not occur tomorrow as scheduled. Senator Daniel K. Akaka learned today Majority Leader Bill Frist vitiated (removed) the cloture vote from the Senate calendar. Majority Leader Frist announced this afternoon the Senate instead will act on legislation relating to judicial emergencies in states affected by Hurricane Katrina. I understand the extremity of this state of emergency left by Hurricane Katrina. My Senate colleagues and I must do all we can to address the dire needs as a result of this disaster in the Gulf region, said Senator Akaka. It is of the utmost importance that this emergency be addressed immediately. The Majority Leader has not specified when the cloture vote will be rescheduled. Senator Akaka, who arrived in Washington D.C. this afternoon, said, I look forward to the cloture vote occurring as soon as possible.
