With the passing of Hawaiis last territorial governor and first elected governor, I am reminded of a time in our history when we became the 50th state in the union. Governor Bill Quinn was a very friendly person who worked in bi-partisan fashion. I fondly remember Governor Quinn at various functions where he would sing one of his favorite songs When Irish Eyes Are Smiling. Millie and I extend our aloha and prayers to the Quinn ohana. May they find comfort in knowing he served Hawaii well.
