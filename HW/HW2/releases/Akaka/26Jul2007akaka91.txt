SENATOR AKAKA COMMENTS ON WOUNDED WARRIORS REPORTWASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka made the following comments on the release of the report from the Presidents Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors, headed by former Senator Bob Dole and former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala:While I continue to believe that Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala and the other members of the Commission were given too little time to look at the many issues relating to those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, I am impressed by their commitment in addressing matters relating to these servicemembers and new veterans. I am pleased that the Commission has produced a report with concrete suggestions for some specific activity. As both Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee and a senior member of the Armed Service Committee, I looked forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to promote a greater collaboration between VA and DoD. The two Departments must together create a seamless transition for our wounded warriors, Akaka said. -30-
