MR. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to say a few words of a dear friend, Henry Giugni, who passed away this morning. Henry enjoyed an illustrious career both on and off Capitol Hill. He began his career in Washington as Senator Inouyes Chief of Staff and continued until he was appointed Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate. In both positions, he enjoyed the confidence and respect of all and he served them well. He was a well-recognized presence on the Hill, particularly in the Senate. After leaving the Hill, Henry joined one of the largest consulting firms in Washington where he was serving his clients effectively. I will remember Henry as one of the first friends who welcomed me and my family to Washington when I was elected to Congress nearly 30 years ago. His kindness continued over many years and we knew him to be a loving husband and father. Millie and I always appreciated his visits whether for business or a social call. It was only a few weeks ago that Millie and I chatted with him and we were extremely saddened to hear of his passing. Millie and I express our warmest aloha to his wife Lani and their family. Henry was our dear and cherished friend and we will miss him greatly. God bless Henry and his family. May he rest in peace. Thank you, Mr. President.
