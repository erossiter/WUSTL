WASHINGTON, D.C. - Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, issued the following statement today in response to the Department of Veterans Affairs creation of an advisory committee for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans and their families. I applaud Secretary Nicholson for forming this new advisory committee. I am encouraged by the inclusion of OIF/OEF veterans and their families and survivors. It is very important for the Secretary to be able to hear first hand what the newest generation of veterans and their families are going through when the servicemembers return from service overseas. It is my hope that this advisory committee will be listened to, so that they can help the Secretary in his efforts to improve VA services for returning combat veterans, Akaka said. The Advisory Committee on OIF/OEF Veterans and Families will be chaired by retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, and will be composed of OIF and OEF wounded veterans and their family members, survivors, leaders of major veterans organizations and veterans advocates. Their first meeting on Monday, May 14, 2007, will begin a three-day inaugural meeting in Alexandria, Va. before setting out on a series of site visits to VA facilities around the country. -30-
