Unless FEMA has a direct line to the President, the people of Hawaii and the nation are at risk. We must ensure that the head of FEMA has access to the President not only in times of crisis but during the budget process. This report recommends a dual reporting system that will likely be confusing and ineffective. FEMA must be restored as an independent agency in order to serve the American people effectively, remarked Senator Akaka.Last November, Senator Akaka introduced S. 2040, the Department of Homeland Security Qualified Leaders Act, which requires that Senate-confirmed leaders throughout DHS, including FEMA, demonstrate executive level management experience and significant expertise in their field.Senator Akaka praised Chairman Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) for agreeing with him that FEMAs senior leadership should possess management and emergency response experience, and looks forward their support of his legislation.Senator Akaka has also strongly argued that DHS regional offices should be established throughout the country, which was one of the reports key recommendations.My first priority is ensuring the lessons of Katrina are applied to help protect Hawaii and that means establishing a DHS regional office in the Pacific, said Senator Akaka. I am pleased that the Committees report agrees with me that DHS needs regional offices for effective preparedness and response.
