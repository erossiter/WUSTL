Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) issued the following statement regarding todays nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court: I am concerned about President George W. Bushs nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to fill Justice Sandra Day OConnors seat. For over two decades, Justice OConnor served as a pivotal swing vote and as a voice of moderation on the Supreme Court. In contrast, Judge Alitos extremely conservative views threaten to lead the Court in a new and hostile direction on privacy rights and civil rights. Judge Alito will be given a fair opportunity to explain his record at his nomination hearing, and I am approaching my duty of advice and consent with an open mind. I look forward to learning more about Judge Alito, and I am hopeful that he will demonstrate Justice OConnors commitment to protecting the important individual rights and freedoms granted by our Constitution. In order to get a full picture of Judge Alitos record, it will be important for the White House to provide the necessary records and for Judge Alito to be candid in his hearing.
