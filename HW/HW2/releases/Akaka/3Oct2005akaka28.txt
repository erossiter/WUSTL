Washington, D.C. -- Today President George W. Bush announced his nominee for the Supreme Court, Harriet Miers. U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka made the following statement regarding her nomination: I look forward to learning more about Harriet Miers in the days and weeks to come. If confirmed, this nominee will replace Justice OConnor, the key vote on many crucial 5-4 decisions on the Court, and I am hopeful that careful scrutiny of Ms. Mierss record will reveal a woman whose understanding of the Constitution is that of a moderate rather than that of an extremist. In order to effectively review Ms. Mierss credentials, it will be essential for both the White House and Ms. Miers to be forthcoming in providing the Senate with access to relevant information.
