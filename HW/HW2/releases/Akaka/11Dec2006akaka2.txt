Senators Daniel K. Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye announced today that they were able to secure $10 million in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act to help Hawaii hospitals struggling to meet rising health care costs and an increase in uninsured patients.The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, H.R. 6111, one of the last pieces of legislation passed by the 109th Congress, was approved in the Senate by a 79-9 vote early Saturday morning, December 9.The $10 million is a Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotment for 2007. These payments are designed to provide additional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. Approximately 120,000 people in Hawaii are without health insurance.This is the first Medicaid DSH allotment for Hawaii since the implementation of the QUEST demonstration program.This funding will help meet the rising health care needs of our communities and reinforce our health care safety net, said Senator Akaka.Senator Inouye added: I am pleased that Senator Akaka and I have again secured federal funds that will benefit Hawaii. Health care is a crucial issue facing Hawaii and our country, and we, as a nation, must continue to do our best to ensure that the health care needs of all Americans are met.
