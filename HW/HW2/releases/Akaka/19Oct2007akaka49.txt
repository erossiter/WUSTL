WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka issued the following statement regarding the deployment of Hawaiis 29th Brigade Combat Team to Kuwait.I still have concerns about the rapid turn around for National Guard troops deployed, however, I was pleased to learn from General Lee that the National Guard Bureau intends to send members of the 29th Brigade Combat Team to Kuwait rather than Iraq and Afghanistan. I was also pleased to learn that the National Guard Bureau is working in close cooperation with General Lee and the other State Adjutant Generals with regard to the mobilization, deployment and post-mobilization process. I will continue to work with General Lee to ensure the safe return of these men and women. If the final determination is that these troops must deploy, it is imperative that each and every member is adequately equipped and properly trained to fulfill their mission.
