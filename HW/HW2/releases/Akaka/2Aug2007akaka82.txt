WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka (D-Hawaii) voted to support the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which passed the full Senate 83-14. The following is a statement from Senator Akaka on his vote: Today, I joined 82 of my Senate colleagues in passing historic legislation that will reform the way we conduct our business here in Congress. The bill provides greater transparency for lobbyists, requiring that they disclose bundled campaign contributions for any federal elected official, candidate, leadership Political Action Committee or national political party, and requiring that they detail their own campaign contributions, and payments to Presidential libraries, Inaugural Committees or entities controlled by or named for Members of Congress. The bill also honors the will of the American people by providing greater transparency for me and my colleagues, requiring that Senators requests for projects and programs be identified on the Internet at least 48 hours before voting on the measure, requiring Senators to certify that they and their immediate family members have no financial interest in these requests, ending the practice of secret Senate holds on legislation, and making conference reports available for public review on the Internet 48 hours before the vote.It is important that we, Members of Congress, hold ourselves to the highest ethical standard, and passing the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 is a historic step in that direction, Akaka said.
