Senator Inouye, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee who helped to secure the funding, said: Nine months ago, Hawaii was shaken violently by the earthquakes, and fortunately no lives were lost. But our transportation infrastructure suffered much damage, isolating communities and making travel difficult. The funds from the Federal Highway Administrations emergency relief highway fund will help to make our recovery complete. Senator Akaka added: These critical resources will help repair essential roads in Hawaii, Maui, and Honolulu counties that were damaged by the earthquakes and aftershocks. This funding will help strengthen and improve vital portions of our transportation infrastructure.--30--
