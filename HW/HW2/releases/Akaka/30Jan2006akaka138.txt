Dr. Bernanke is well qualified to lead the Federal Reserve and I look   forward to his confirmation as Chairman, said Senator Akaka. We share a   commitment to improving the financial literacy of our students and consumers. I   look forward to working with the new Chairman to encourage better economic and   financial literacy, which, in turn, will result in stronger families,   better-functioning markets, and a more secure future for our nation.
