Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka today introduced an amendment to H.R. 2360, the FY 06 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, to ensure that the men and women on the front lines of a U.S. terrorist attack are not unduly jeopardized by budget cuts. The Akaka amendment would restore funding to the FY 05 level by adding a total of $587 million to the homeland security first responder grant programs. Joining Senator Akaka were Senators Joe Lieberman, Tom Harkin, Mary Landrieu, Barack Obama, Patty Murray, Jon Corzine, Frank Lautenberg, Jeff Bingaman, Richard Durbin, and Charles Schumer. The amendment would allocate $467 million to state and local grants, which include the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative. It would also direct $20 million to the Metropolitan Medical Response System and $10 million to the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program commonly known as FIRE Act grants. Our country cannot afford to take resources away from its first responders at a time when we rely on them more than ever, said Senator Akaka. In Hawaii, the growing discrepancy between first responder needs and funding will be acutely felt as state emergency responders must be self-sufficient because there are no neighboring states to rely upon for assistance. Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia. *** Senators Akaka, Joe Lieberman, Joseph Biden, John Kerry, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, and Jon Corzine will discuss this amendment and other Democratic initiatives to improve the Homeland Security Appropriations bill TOMORROW, July 12th, in the LBJ Room, S-211, Capitol Building at 10:00 a.m.***
