Washington, D.C. -- The Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday approved $517.5 billion in its National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2007. Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, helped guide the Subcommittee to support working and housing facilities, and enhance Department of Defense (DoD) operations. Senator Akaka also secured a provision requiring a review of records to determine the number, size and probable locations of sites where the Armed Forces disposed of military munitions in coastal waters. I commend my colleagues on the Committee for their cooperation to ensure that DoD is keeping track of the status of these dangerous dump sites and what actions may be necessary to address any health risks that these sites may pose, Senator Akaka said. Once potential sites are identified, the public will be made aware of possible hazards. This will include information on the long-term effects that seawater exposure has on these munitions, and the feasibility of its removal. Senator Akaka also secured his legislation to establish a National Language Council to develop a long-term and comprehensive language strategy. We must focus on learning different languages to develop long-term relationships with people all across the world, whether or not the languages they speak are considered critical. As 9/11 showed us, the failures of communication can do swift damage, he stated. Hawaii military projects totaling $57.3 million, secured by Senator Akaka are: High Frequency Acoustic Signal Processor system, $2.5 millionMan Overboard Identification System, $3.9 millionAutonomous Unmanned Surface Vessel, $4.0 millionCorrosion Prevention and Control Program-USMC, $5.0 millionCorrosion Prevention and Control Program-USA, $5.2 millionSelf-Deploying Infrared Streamer, $4.0 millionInformation sharing for ISRTE of Mobile Targets, $2.0 millionCorrosion Prevention and Control, $2.0 millionElectro-optic Passive ASW System, $6.7 millionDry Dock Ship support Services, $22.0 million
