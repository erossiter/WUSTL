Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today questioned Marty Bahamonde, the only Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) representative sent to New Orleans prior to Hurricane Katrina making landfall, about apparent communications gaps within FEMA. During a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Senator Akaka questioned whether former Undersecretary of Emergency Preparedness and Response Michael Brown acted in a timely manner on reports that the 17th Street Canal levee had been breached. Marty Bahamonde, the only FEMA representative in New Orleans until Tuesday, August 30th, briefed FEMA headquarters on the levee breach on Monday morning at 11:00 a.m. Eight hours later, he personally briefed Undersecretary Brown on the levee breach. Only after that 7:00 p.m. briefing did Undersecretary Brown contact the White House and issue a public announcement about the broken levees, remarked Senator Akaka after the hearing. There was an eight-hour lag between when Mr. Brown should have known about the levee breach and when he acted upon that information, according to witness testimony, said Senator Akaka. I want to know what happened in those eight hours. Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is conducting an investigation into the governments response to Hurricane Katrina.
