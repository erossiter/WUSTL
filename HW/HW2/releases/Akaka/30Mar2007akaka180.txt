RELEASED BY SENATOR INOUYES OFFICE:WASHINGTON --- U.S. Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Daniel K. Akaka issued the following statement today after Navy Secretary Winter informed them that the Navy has decided to base in San Diego the USS CARL VINSON, an aircraft carrier previously homeported at Bremerton, Washington:We are disappointed that the USS CARL VINSON will not be coming to Pearl Harbor. The cost of sending a carrier to Hawaii was interpreted as too high when the carrier could be more easily accommodated in San Diego and when compared to Hawaiis advantage of its much closer proximity to potential trouble spots in Asia that threaten our national security.The Navys decision does not change Hawaiis strategic importance. Hawaii remains a key fleet location for the Navy, and will continue to be so into the foreseeable future. We look forward to other opportunities in the future to expand the Navys presence in Hawaii.Senator Inouye is Chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator Akaka is Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management.-30-
