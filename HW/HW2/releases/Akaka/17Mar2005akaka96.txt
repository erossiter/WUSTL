Washington, DC -- Growing concerns about the use of pre-packaged news stories by the Bush Administration has prompted action by Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI), Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia. The law forbids the use of appropriated funds for publicity or propaganda purposes, said Senator Akaka. Senator Akaka yesterday sent a letter to Secretary Michael Chertoff requesting a report on the public relations activities conducted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over the past two years; and that the subcommittee be provided with information on any appropriated funds paid to reporters or public relations professionals for government-produced news segments. In these times of rising deficits and a growing national debt, it is imperative that the Administration and the Congress work closely to ensure good stewardship of taxpayer dollars, Senator Akaka said. Senator Akaka questioned Secretary Chertoff on the use of government funds for public relations purposes at Chertoffs confirmation hearing on February 2, 2005. Chertoff replied that he was unaware of any such activities at DHS, and provided his assurance that this would not occur under his leadership. On March 13, 2005, The New York Times reported that the Transportation Security Administration, an agency within DHS, produced a segment on aviation security. The reporter was a public relations professional working under a false name.
