Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka is pleased to announce that the Waimea Family YMCA is receiving $214,145 from the U.S. Department of Education. The grant derives from the Carol M. White Physical Education Program, which supports local education agencies and community-based organizations in their efforts to initiate, expand or enhance physical education programs for students in kindergarten through the 12th grade. The grant will fund the Waimea Family YMCA Physical Activity Readiness or PAR Excellence! program. Senator Akaka stated, The Waimea Family YMCA, located in the rural community of Waimea on the Big Island, has served an important role in providing physical activities for youth in a geographically large area stretching from the northeastern coast of East Hawaii to the northwestern shores of West Hawaii. Since 1995, the Waimea Family YMCA has filled a void in the Waimea Elementary School physical education program by providing a fitness specialist for children. Continued funding for PAR Excellence! will provide important continuity of physical education activities at Waimea Elementary School. Equally important is the long-term goal of PAR Excellence! to create a model for school health programs in Hawaii, establish opportunities for teacher training, and maintain a positive focus on physical education for youth, said Senator Akaka.
