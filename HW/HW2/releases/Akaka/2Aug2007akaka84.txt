Mr. President, I support the Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Childrens Health Insurance Program has reduced the number of uninsured children by one-third since its enactment in 1997. The Administrations opposition to this legislation is a vital mistake that threatens the health and well being of our nations children. This program is not partisan and debate on this issue should not be ideological. We simply want children to have access to health care. Making investments in the health care of children will help ensure that they grow up into healthy adults. In order to learn and lead active and healthy lives, children must have access to health care. As of June 2007, 17,512 children were enrolled in Hawaiis Childrens Health Insurance Program. An estimated five percent of children in Hawaii do not have health insurance. This is approximately 16,000 children that do not have health insurance. I am proud that my home state, Hawaii, has continued to develop innovative solutions to help increase access to health care. This year, Hawaii enacted legislation establishing the Keiki Care program. The Keiki Care program is a public-private partnership intended to make sure that every child in Hawaii has access to health care.Mr. President, now is not the time to cut federal resources provided to states to provide health care for children. The legislation currently before the Senate will preserve the access of health care for the 6.6 million children currently enrolled in the Childrens Health Insurance Program. It will also expand health care access to an estimated 3.2 million children.The Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act must be enacted. This Administrations opposition to this program is shortsighted and threatens the well-being of our nations children. Thank you, Mr. President.
