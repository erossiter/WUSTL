Washington, D.C. -- Committed to working with Senate colleagues, Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today once again stated his goal to get veterans the health care they deserve. In a Committee hearing and before the full Senate to discuss the veterans health care funding crisis, Senator Akaka said: This is not simply about data or planning models; this is about providing vital health care services for our nations veterans. Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced a budget shortfall of $1 billion. In April, Senator Akaka and others raised the specter of serious shortfalls, but the Administration denied that trouble was ahead. Senator Akaka stated, In light of this funding crisis, we need to take a fresh look at the proposal to guarantee full funding for VA health care. If we cannot put faith in the current process, perhaps we need another approach. I am truly committed to working with my colleagues to ensure that existing veterans and returning servicemembers get the health care they deserve, said Senator Akaka. I have no doubt that we will restore the funding. In fact, Senators Murray and I are moving to add these funds to the Interior Appropriations bill currently on the Senate floor.
