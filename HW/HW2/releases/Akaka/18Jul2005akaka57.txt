Join Senator Akaka, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), the Hawaii Commissioner of Securities and the Hawaii Council on Economic Education as we discuss ways investors can protect themselves and what federal, state and local entities are doing to help. Investor education seminars are scheduled for: August 29 on Maui and August 30 on Oahu (locations to be announced). Dinner and registration begin at 5:30 p.m. The formal program runs from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. There is no charge for the program or dinner. NASDs mission is to protect investors and support market integrity. By federal law, every securities firm in the United States doing business with the public is overseen by NASD. Senator Akaka is cosponsoring the seminars because he believes that education is often the best form of investor protection. A leading proponent of financial literacy, Senator Akaka recently introduced the Mutual Fund Transparency Act of 2005 (S. 1037) which requires greater disclosure of mutual fund fees, commissions and costs. If you are interested in learning smart investing techniques, please call (877) 586-2737, toll free, for more information. Or email NASD at investorforum@nasd.com.
