Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka, the Ranking Member of the U.S.   Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, sent a letter to President George W. Bush   today urging him to give appropriate attention and priority to the needs of our   nation's returning servicemembers and veterans in the Fiscal Year 2007 budget   proposal. The President is expected to submit a budget proposal soon to Congress.   Forty-one Democratic Colleagues joined Senator Akaka in signing the letter to   President Bush. Senator Akaka also reminds the President of the Administration's mistake last   year for not having enough resources to keep pace with demand. That mistake   caused a crisis situation and the U.S. Senate swiftly acted to provide emergency   funding to fix the problem. Please click here to view the letter
