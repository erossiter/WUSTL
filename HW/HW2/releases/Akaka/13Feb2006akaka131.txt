Washington, D.C. -- Today the American Bar Association passed a resolution "that urges Congress to pass legislation to establish a process to provide federal recognition for a Native Hawaiian governing entity."
U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka issued the following statement:

"I welcome the support of the American Bar Association as we continue to work to ensure parity in federal policies for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.  The validation of our efforts by such an esteemed legal organization is a significant step forward in our efforts to enact a process to extend the policy of self-governance and self-determination to Native Hawaiians.
"I continue to work with Senate leaders to secure a date for prompt consideration of S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act."
