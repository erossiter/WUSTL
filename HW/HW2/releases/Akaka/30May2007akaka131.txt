WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) sent a legislative proposal to Congress that would phase-out the Non-Foreign Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) and phase-in locality pay for federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, Territory of Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Since 1948, federal employees in the non-contiguous areas of the U.S. have received Non-Foreign COLA to ensure that their pay reflects the high cost of living. Non-foreign COLA is not subject to federal or Social Security/Medicare taxes. In 1990, the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA), included provisions for locality pay, paid to federal employees in the contiguous United States. Non-foreign COLA vs. locality pay:-30-
