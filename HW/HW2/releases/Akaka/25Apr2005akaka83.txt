Washington, D.C. - The Web site of U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka (D-HI) now features an Akaka Bill section that includes a PowerPoint presentation and the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act in its entirety. The development of this legislation has been an open process that has relied on the input of many individuals, said Senator Akaka. We began drafting this bill in 1999 with more than 100 individuals who were members of five working groups providing guidance and input. The bill was modified in 2001 to reflect the input received during Congressional hearings in Hawaii in 2000. Since that time I have reviewed all suggestions that I have received on the legislation. I have negotiated provisions with the officials within the Executive Branch and Members of Congress. The current bill reflects all of this input. The purpose of S. 147 is to clarify the legal and political relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians, Hawaiis indigenous peoples. Senator Akaka said the bill provides a structured process, following the reorganization and recognition of the Native Hawaiian governing entity, to begin to resolve the many issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. I hope my Web sites improved accessibility to information on S. 147 will help individuals and groups to learn the facts about this important bill, said Senator Akaka.
