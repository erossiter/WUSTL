Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) today continued his questioning of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on the stalled effort to establish Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regional offices across the country.  During a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on DHS's fiscal year 2007 budget request, Secretary Chertoff committed to Senator Akaka that DHS would finalize a regional structure within the next month.  		
"Some may think that regional offices would create an extra level of bureaucracy.  However, I want you to understand, Mr. Secretary, that from the perspective of Hawaii -- which is 2500 miles from the mainland, has no contiguous states to rely upon in the event of a disaster, and has a six hour time difference with Washington, D.C. -- the benefits of regional offices outweigh the potential costs," Senator Akaka stated.

"I am pleased to finally receive some concrete answers from the Department on the issue of DHS regional offices.  However it was unclear from the Secretary's comments what the regional structure will look like and whether it will include a Pacific office.  I look forward to reviewing the Department's proposal," Senator Akaka said after the hearing.  "I am meeting with Secretary Chertoff next week to discuss Hawaii's homeland security needs and I intend to continue to pursue this issue with him." Senator Akaka is a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
