 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Ashley Sagisi Moser, Miss Teen World United States, for her achievements in the 2007 Miss Teen World pageant. She placed first runner-up in the pageant and won the Miss Congeniality Award. The pageant was hosted in Queensland, Australia where representatives from 14 countries competed for the title of Miss Teen World 2007. In addition to winning the Miss Congeniality Award, Ashley placed in the top five in every category, which included Miss Talent, Miss Photogenic, Best Costume and Best Swimsuit.  I am proud of Ashleys accomplishments, especially because she was one of the youngest contestants in this international pageant. Her stage presence and wit has allowed her to excel in pageants. She embodies the spirit of Aloha, which was noted by the judges and her fellow competitors. She represented the state of Hawaii and the United States very well. I also want to acknowledge Ashleys impressive leadership qualities, which are evident through her involvement in one of the states most prestigious preparatory schools, Punahou School, and in her involvement in community activities. I encourage her to aspire to make a difference in the world by continuing to cultivate her leadership skills.  I look forward to hearing more about her successes as she continues to pursue her education and personal goals. Congratulations to her parents Kendall and Sandra Moser, who have raised their daughter to be an exemplary representative of the United States on the international stage. I wish Ashley and her family the very best in their future endeavors. Thank you, Mr. President.
