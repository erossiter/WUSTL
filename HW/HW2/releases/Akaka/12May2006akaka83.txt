Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Senate will consider S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, when it returns from its May recess. Today, Senator Daniel K. Akaka announced on the Senate floor that during the first week in June, the Majority Leader will file the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 147. A vote on the motion will occur 48 hours after it is filed.Senator Akaka stated, I want to express my sincerest appreciation to our Majority and Democratic Leaders for working with me and Hawaiis senior Senator on scheduling the Senates consideration of S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005.I look forward to this opportunity to finally discuss S. 147. As my colleagues have heard over the past week, this is an issue of importance to all of the people of Hawaii, and this is not a native versus non-native issue in Hawaii. Rather, this is about authorizing a process for the people of Hawaii to be able to address longstanding issues resulting from a tragic, poignant period in our history. This is about establishing parity for Hawaiis indigenous peoples in federal policies. This is about clarifying the existing political and legal relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States.Again, I express my deep appreciation to our Majority and Democratic Leaders andto the cosponsors of this legislation for helping to work out this agreement. I also want to express my deep appreciation to Hawaiis senior Senator who has stood firm with me as we have sought to do what is right for the people of Hawaii. Passing this bill will make it right.
