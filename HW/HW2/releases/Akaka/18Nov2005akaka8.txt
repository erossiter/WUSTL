Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI) last night introduced legislation, S. 2051, to provide certain federal public benefits for citizens of the Freely Associated States (FAS) who reside in the United States. This includes citizens from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and the Republic of Palau. The Compact of Free Association established these nations as sovereign states responsible for their own foreign policies. The FAS is dependent upon the U.S. for military protection and economic assistance. Many FAS citizens reside in the State of Hawaii, stated Senator Akaka. Since 1997, when Hawaii began reporting its impact costs, the state has identified more than $140 million in costs associated with FAS citizens. It is time for the federal government to take up some of the financial responsibility that until now has been carried by the State of Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa by restoring public benefits to FAS citizens, said Senator Akaka. The bill introduced by Senator Akaka and co-sponsored by Senator Dan Inouye would restore eligibility of FAS citizens for non-emergency Medicaid. It would also reinstate eligibility for various Federal programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income, and Food Stamps. This legislation is supported by the State of Hawaii Department of Human Services (DHS). A department official noted that in 2004, the department spent over $26.6 million to provide services to more than 10,800 migrants in the States financial assistance, medical assistance, vocational rehabilitation, and youth services programs.
