SEN. HUTCHISON CONGRATULATES TEXAS' NEWEST INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE MEMBERS
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today congratulated six Texans on their election to the national Institute of Medicine (IOM), a prestigious organization of America's top researchers in the medical sciences. The institute's highly selective nomination process emphasizes professional achievement and commitment to service. 
   "I am proud to help recognize these outstanding researchers for achieving this high honor," Sen. Hutchison said. "Their accomplishments highlight the excellence of medical research in Texas and the vital work being done in our state."
   The IOM announced the election of the following six new members from Texas today:
   * Dr. Nancy Dickey, M.D. is president of the Texas A&M University Health Science Center and vice chancellor for health affairs for the Texas A&M University System. Her research focus is family medicine.
