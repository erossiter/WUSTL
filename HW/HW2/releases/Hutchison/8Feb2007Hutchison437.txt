SEN. HUTCHISON COSPONSORS HISPANIC MUSEUM COMMISSION BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, has signed on as an original cosponsor of a bill to establish a commission on the National Museum of the Latino. The legislation, S.500, creates a 23 member commission and authorizes funding to help establish a national museum honoring Hispanic heritage. 
   "Since the very founding of our great nation, American society has benefited from the contributions of myriad cultures and backgrounds," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation to honor the heritage of our many Hispanic citizens. The museum would also serve as an educational resource for people interested in learning about Latino history and traditions." 
   The legislation introduced today establishes a 23 member commission with appointments from the president and bi-partisan leaders from both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. It calls for the development of a fundraising plan with a national conference, and a report to determine location and governance for the museum. In addition, the legislation authorizes funds for use by the commission.
