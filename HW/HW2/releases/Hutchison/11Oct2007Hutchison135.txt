SEN. HUTCHISON CUTS RIBBON FOR COLUMBIA REGIONAL GEOSPATIAL SERVICE CENTER IN NACOGDOCHES
  Texas' senior senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) cut the ribbon today at the opening of the Columbia Regional Geospatial Service Center in Nacogdoches. 
   "By utilizing satellite and mapping technology, the Columbia Center System will help our response to disasters," Sen. Hutchison said. This new facility will aid our recruitment of new employers and jobs who can use the resources here to analyze the infrastructure and resources in the area. "This concept already proved valuable after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster and Hurricane Rita, and it will serve as an important resource in the future."
   Dr. James C. Kroll of the Columbia Center and Dr. Rick Berry of Stephen F. Austin State University also participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
   The Columbia Center System provides significant tactical and planning support to regional emergency planners and first responders, as well as supporting economic development and natural resources management. As a prototype for the nation, the Columbia Center System ultimately will include service centers in seven geographic regions of Texas. Each center will provide support to solve geographic and socio-economic problems unique to each region.
