SEN. HUTCHISON HOLDS CONFERENCE CALL WITH TEXAS COMMUNITY LEADERS ON HURRICANE KATRINA RELIEF
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today organized a conference call with leadership from Texas communities severely impacted by Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.  
 The call was coordinated to formulate legislative remedies to cut federal red tape that might slow down relief efforts. 
   "Texas communities have graciously opened their facilities, as well as their hearts, to the victims of this devastating hurricane," Sen. Hutchison said. "We are in the process of determining where the red tape exists that is impeding swift relief efforts. Our leaders on the ground can help us assess where the problems are and how they can best be addressed in all of the communities helping our neighbors in need." 
   Sen. Hutchison's conference call dealt mainly with pinpointing immediate legislative fixes to bureaucratic roadblocks. 
   "I met with my fellow members of Senate leadership today and I am confident Texas and other states helping during this challenging time will be reimbursed," Sen. Hutchison said. "However, our first priority must be emergency relief efforts. I will work with Congress to find legislative fixes to allow our communities to help those in need."
