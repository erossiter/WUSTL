SEN. HUTCHISON PROTECTS CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELDS
  Texas' senior senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today co-sponsored S.1921, the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2007, which extends funding authorization for the Civil War Battlefield Protection Program (CWBPP) for an additional five years. 
   "Historic Civil War battlefields are important sites that help us better understand an important chapter in our nation's history," Sen. Hutchison said. "It is our duty to preserve them for the benefit of future generations, and I am proud to support this program."
   Almost twenty percent of the nation's 384 principle Civil War battlefields are estimated to have been lost, and sixty percent are fragmented by development. The CWBPP provides matching grants for the preservation and enhancement of the remaining sites and is financed through the U.S. Department of the Interior. Sen. Hutchison helped to secure $3 million for the program in the Senate version of the Fiscal Year 2008 Interior Appropriations bill.
   Original cosponsors of this legislation are Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Jim Bunning (R-KY), Richard Burr (R-NC), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), John Cornyn (R-TX), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Blanche Lincoln ((D-AR), Trent Lott (R-MI), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), John Warner (R-VA) and Jim Webb (D-VA). Lamar University $679,471 
   Lamar Institute of Technology $144,288 
   Lamar State College-Port Arthur $75,951
