CONGRESS APPROVES LEGISLATION TO DESIGNATE EL CAMINO REAL DE LOS TEJAS NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL
  After a three-year effort led by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), the U.S. Congress passed legislation designating El Camino Real de los Tejas, the oldest trail in Texas, as a National Historic Trail.  
 The U.S. House of Representatives today approved the legislation, which was authored by Sen. Hutchison and passed by the Senate earlier this month.
   "Preserving El Camino Real de los Tejas helps protect an important piece of our Texas heritage. This legislation grants the legendary trail the status it deserves and secures the rights of private property owners. It will also help the surrounding communities attract more tourism and boost the region's economy. I look forward to working with the Texas Historical Commission and local officials to promote awareness of the Lone Star State's newest National Historic Trail," Sen. Hutchison said. 
   El Camino Real de los Tejas was a corridor of trails used by settlers, immigrants, Indians and the military. The trail is a combination of routes totaling almost 2,600 miles from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo to Natchitoches, Louisiana. It also served as a path for such Texas heroes as Davy Crockett and Sam Houston, who fought in the struggle for Texas independence from Mexico. 
   Previous attempts to grant the designation failed because of concerns for the rights of private property owners. Sen. Hutchison worked to achieve the designation in a way that gives landowners the right to opt in or opt out of those portions of the trail that are not public property.
   "I am proud that we have finally been successful in saving this great trail for future generations to enjoy," Sen. Hutchison added. 
   The legislation will now be sent to the President for signature.
