SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH MEMBERS OF TEXAS SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today held a meeting with members of the Texas Sheriff's Association in her Washington, D.C. office. They discussed increased cooperation between state, local and federal officials to strengthen law enforcement efforts. Drug interdiction issues, including the National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006, were also addressed during the meeting with sheriffs representing Bell, Bexar, Dallas, Rockwall and Val Verde Counties discussed.  
   "It is important to meet with law enforcement officers who are dealing directly with the challenges on the ground and to discuss what support can be provided at the federal level," Sen. Hutchison said. "Breaking down cooperative barriers and proving new resources for drug enforcement will help their efforts to improve the safety of our cities, towns and neighborhoods." 
   Sen. Hutchison supported passage of the National Drug Control Policy Authorization Act which was signed into law December 2006. The legislation allows coalitions of law enforcement agencies to petition for High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) designation. In addition to authorizing appropriations, the law provides an additional $7 million to improve neighborhood safety and to combat illegal drug distributing problems.
