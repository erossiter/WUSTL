SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION FOR TEXAS AIR QUALITY STUDY
  Today Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) praised House and Senate passage of $2 million in the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Interior appropriations measure for a study of Texas air quality.  
 The funding was added at the request of Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. 
   "Earlier studies have had a significant impact on the state of air quality in Texas," Sen. Hutchison said. "This study will cover a much broader region yielding new policies that will lessen the economic burden as we strive to clean our air." 
   The Houston-based study will be based on the successful 2000 study that has advanced air quality science in Texas. Texas must develop plans to control eight-hour ozone for the state's major urban areas as well as reducing haze in the state. The study will provide scientific investigations into these air quality issues. It will lead to successful clean air policies over the next decade that are expected to significantly reduce the economic burden of the ozone plan. The study will cover the eastern half of Texas and will involve the major Texas universities. 
   The legislation will now be sent to the White House to be signed by President Bush.
