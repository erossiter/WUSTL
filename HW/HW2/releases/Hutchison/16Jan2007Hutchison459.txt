SEN. HUTCHISON LAUDS REPUBLICAN EARMARK DISCLOSURE AMENDMENT PASSED BY SENATE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today praised passage of Sen. DeMint's amendment which requires increased disclosure of earmarks.  
   "Sen. DeMint's amendment will expand the scope of the original earmark reform legislation. This Republican initiative requires broad disclosure of earmarks to improve transparency for taxpayers," Sen. Hutchison said.
   The DeMint amendment enhances disclosure requirements for congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits. The original Senate bill narrowly defined earmarks as targeted funds for "non-federal entities." Sen. DeMint's amendment requires full disclosure of earmarks, including federal projects, targeted tax and trade benefits, and all earmarks contained in committee reports.
