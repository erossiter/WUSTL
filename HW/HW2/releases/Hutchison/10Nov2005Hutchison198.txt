SEN. HUTCHISON HOLDS HEARING ON WEATHER MODIFICATION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space, today held a hearing on her Weather Modification Research and Technology Transfer Authorization Act of 2005. Sen.  
 Hutchison's legislation is an effort to promote the research and development of weather modification. 
   "It is critical that we determine if weather can be modified to the extent that lives are saved and property damage is limited," Sen. Hutchison said. "This work is vital, especially as we near the end of such a devastating hurricane season." 
   Sen. Hutchison's legislation would develop a comprehensive and coordinated national weather modification research effort through federal and state programs. It would also establish a Weather Modification Advisory and Research Board within the U.S. Department of Commerce. This board would work to promote and expand the practical and verifiable understanding of weather modification. 
   "Hurricanes Rita and Katrina and the recent tornado in Indiana took many lives and destroyed both property and the environment," Sen. Hutchison said. "By developing sustained research we can provide answers to the issues of predictability and reliability of weather modification research."
