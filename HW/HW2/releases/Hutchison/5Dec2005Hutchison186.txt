SEN. HUTCHISON SPEAKS ON WIND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AT AMERICAN WIND POWER CENTER
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today addressed an audience of Lubbock and West Texas community leaders along with representatives of Texas Tech University about the significant progress being made in the area of wind measurement and analysis. She discussed the research potential of the Texas Tech Great Plains Wind Power Test Facility and the improvements that will be made with the support of $1.5 million Sen. Hutchison secured for the facility in the Fiscal Year 2006 Water and Energy Development Appropriations bill. 
   "Funding for this new facility will support existing wind research initiatives at Texas Tech University," Sen. Hutchison said. "Wind is a renewable power source and our state will benefit from the expanded resources developed through this research. Texas has the second highest potential for wind energy in the nation and this renewable source of energy will help address our future energy needs." 
   The funds allow expansion of the facility's resources for testing, characterization and improvement of wind turbines and wind-driven water desalination systems.
