  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior Senator, today addressed nearly 500 business and civic leaders from Dallas-area communities at the Best Southwest Chamber luncheon in Duncanville. Sen. Hutchison, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, outlined the economic challenges facing the nation and pressed for continued business leadership in Texas to keep the state's economy growing. 
   "Thanks in no small part to the leadership of the business community in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area, the economy of Texas - and the national economy - are stronger than ever," said Sen. Hutchison.
   "To keep our economy going strong, we must address growing challenges like increasing energy supply, preserving tax cuts and extending necessary tax relief, and bolstering education to keep America competitive," Sen. Hutchison said.
   In her remarks to the Best Southwest Chamber Luncheon, Sen. Hutchison gave an economic report from Washington, D.C. on business issues, including taxes, energy, and education. Sen. Hutchison was joined by Duncanville Mayor, the Honorable David Green, as well as 500 business and civic leaders from Cedar Hill, DeSoto, Duncanville, Lancaster and Dallas.
