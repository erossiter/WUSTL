SEN. HUTCHISON HIGHLIGHTS NASA CHALLENGES AT BUDGET HEARING WITH ADMINISTRATOR GRIFFIN
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Ranking Member on Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space, today addressed the challenges facing NASA during the Fiscal Year 2008 Senate hearing on NASA's budget request. Specifically, she questioned NASA Administrator Mike Griffin on the shortfall in the Fiscal Year 2007 Continuing Resolution and how that will impact completion of the International Space Station, the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle to replace the shuttle. She released the following statement after the hearing: 
   "Administrator Griffin's estimate today that the flat funding in the continuing resolution will delay CEV completion by four to six months is disturbing and must be corrected. The funding shortfall has comprised NASA's goal of completing the Crew Exploration Vehicle to close the space gap window. I look forward to working with Administrator Griffin to provide the funding levels needed to put the CEV back on schedule which is integral to our nation's future as a leader in space exploration."
