SEN. HUTCHISON HONORED FOR SUPPORTING TEXAS WATER
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) was honored with the "Friend of Rural Water Award" by the Texas Rural Water Association (TRWA), for her "valuable legislative service." Sen.  
 Hutchison's commitment to address water concerns in the state reflects her overall strategy to address particular needs in Texas, where water is increasingly becoming a finite resource. The delegation included TRWA President Leahmon Bryant and TRWA Executive Director Tom Duck. Representatives from many Texas Water Supply Corporations (WSC) and Special Utility Districts (SUD) were also in attendance, including:
   * Able Springs WSC: Frank Palo, Lester Smith, and Toni Flanagan 
   * Birome WSC: Charles Beseda 
   * Zephyr WSC: Richard and Joan Gist 
   * Olmito WSC: Juan Ozano, Pete Rodriguez, Martin Cortes, Tommi Elium, and Jim Elium, 
   * Johnson County SUD: Terry and Holly Kelley 
   * Fort Davis WSC: Scott and Janet Adams 
   * Caddo Basin SUD: Leahmon and Sandra Bryant 
   Also a hearing was held today regarding S. 519, a bill introduced by Senator Hutchison to amend the Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Resources Conservation and Improvement Act of 2000. The bill would authorize work needed to conserve and enhance water supplies in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. 
   "Improving water conveyance infrastructure is a top priority for enhancing water conservation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Currently, unprecedented growth, coupled with Mexico's past failure to comply with the 1944 Water treaty, has led to a dire need for water conservation," said Senator Hutchison. "The Lower Rio Grande Valley, as any community, depends upon an adequate supply of water - yet studies show that water losses resulting from seepage, spills and evaporation exceed 68 billion gallons of water per year. This underscores the pressing demand for improvements which will ensure efficient conservation of water."
