SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today made the following comments on her vote in support of efforts to ensure if any votes are taken on non-binding resolutions that one to support the military personnel fighting the War on Terror is included:  
   "The question before the Senate today represents a clear choice between victory and defeat. The resolution does not contain a guarantee of troop support for all the troops who will be on the front lines in Iraq going forward. Passage of such a proposal would send a dispiriting message to the brave men and women who are carrying out their duties as we debate their mission. 
   "General Petraeus and the personnel under his command deserve the resources they need to carry out their mission and return home. The American people deserve a debate and a vote on a resolution that will ensure the troops protecting our security have the support and funds they need to succeed.
   "The Majority leadership's push for a resolution that undercuts the commander in chief and the troops sends the wrong message to our enemies and our allies."
