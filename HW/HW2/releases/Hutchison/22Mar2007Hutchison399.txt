SEN. HUTCHISON COSPONSORS BILL TO CREATE U.S. PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, today became an original cosponsor of bipartisan legislation to create a U.S. Public Service Academy modeled after the military academies.  
   "A Public service academy would provide new higher education opportunities for those with the honorable desire to serve their country. Training a new generation of leaders will benefit the nation by developing more candidates to fill the current void in qualified public servants," Sen. Hutchison said.
   The U.S. Public Service Academy Act of 2007 proposes to create an undergraduate institution offering an education with a commitment of five years of post-graduate civilian service. Students would be required to choose a public service concentration in a field to prepare them for service in governmental agencies at the local, state and federal levels which cannot find qualified candidates. It would be funded through a public-private partnership. 
   The bill, introduced by Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY), is supported by various volunteer organizations including the National Peace Corps Association, City Year and Americorps alumni. The project's founders are from Houston and Texas is a potential location for the academy.
