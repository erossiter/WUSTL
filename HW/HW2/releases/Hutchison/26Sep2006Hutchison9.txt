SEN. HUTCHISON BORDER FENCE AMENDMENT GIVES LOCAL OFFICIALS MORE AUTHORITY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced an amendment to the Border Fence Act which prevents Congress from dictating to states where border fencing will be built. 
   "I have consistently supported border security efforts such as the installation of reinforced fencing in strategic areas and installing physical barriers where necessary," Sen. Hutchison said. "My amendment mandates that border fencing decisions be made in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security and local and state officials. They have borne a heavy financial burden from illegal immigration on the front lines and should be part of the solution."
   The bill language requires that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consult with local authorities in determining where border fencing will be placed.
