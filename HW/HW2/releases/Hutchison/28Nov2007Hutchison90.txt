SEN. HUTCHISON CONGRATULATES BOEING ON $1.1 BILLION KC-135 CONTRACT, 700TH KC-10
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas' senior Senator, today delivered the keynote address at a celebration of the Boeing Company's $1.1 billion KC-135 Stratotanker maintenance contract award, and delivery of its 700th KC-10 Extender aircraft. 
   "I am so pleased to congratulate the Boeing Company on its success in our military's crucial KC-135 and KC-10 programs that keep our fighting forces airborne," Sen. Hutchison said. "Boeing's investment in San Antonio yields hundreds of vital jobs, contributes greatly to the Texas economy and helpes drive the growth of our inland port."
   Sen. Hutchison announced in September that the Boeing Company had been awarded a $1.1 billion contract to perform maintenance on the KC-135 Stratotanker. According to the U.S. Air Force, over 500 KC-135's currently in active and reserve service provide aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and allied nations' aircraft. In recent years, Boeing has reduced maintenance cycle times by 19 percent, resulting in more air assets ready for deployment. This record of success also includes the recent delivery of the 700th KC-10 Extender and the 500th C-17 Globemaster III.
   Boeing is a principal tenant of the Port San Antonio, a state-of-the-art industrial airport, railport and town center that Sen. Hutchison helped redevelop from the former Kelly Air Force Base, which closed in 1995. The port is rapidly moving toward its goal of becoming the largest inland port in Texas.
