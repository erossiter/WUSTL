CONGRESS PASSES EXTENSION OF SALES TAX DEDUCTION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that Congress has passed a two-year extension of the sales tax deduction. Extension of the state and local sales tax deduction ensures equitable tax treatment for Texans and all Americans until 2008. Sen. Hutchison has been a strong champion of this tax cut and a stanch advocate for a permanent deduction. 
   "All Americans should be treated equally and given the opportunity to deduct their state taxes, regardless of how those levies are assessed," Sen. Hutchison said. "Extending the tax cuts was a top priority of mine in the lame duck session, and I am pleased to provide this tax relief for Texans. This deduction is a matter of fundamental fairness and must be made permanent."
   Prior to 2004, residents of states with a sales tax could not deduct the amount they paid in sales taxes from their federal income taxes, while taxpayers subject to state income taxes could receive a deduction. As a result, citizens of Texas, Alaska, Florida, Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming paid federal taxes on the income they earned, and were then unfairly taxed a second time when they spent their earnings.
   Sen. Hutchison first helped secure the sales tax deduction in the 2004 tax relief bill. In February 2006, Sen. Hutchison introduced a motion to instruct conferees for the Tax Reconciliation Act to make the sales tax deduction permanent. The motion passed the Senate by a vote of 75-25.
