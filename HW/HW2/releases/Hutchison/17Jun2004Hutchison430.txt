SEN. HUTCHISON SPEAKS ON NOMINATION OF JANE BOYLE FOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
  MRS. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the nominee we are going to vote on, Jane Boyle, has served our country in so many positions: U.S. magistrate, where she had an outstanding record, as our U.S. Attorney, where she had an equally outstanding record. She has shown fairness, a judicial temperament, and great leadership in every position she has held. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to have recommended her nomination along with my colleague, Senator Cornyn, and before that, Senator Gramm. We have never been disappointed in Jane Boyle's performance, and know she will be an outstanding judge.
