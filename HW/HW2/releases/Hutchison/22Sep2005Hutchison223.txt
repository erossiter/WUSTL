The legislation appropriates funds for military construction projects for the Department of Defense for Fiscal Year 2006.  
   "Our servicemen and women deserve proper facilities in which to train and live. This budget is good for our military and our nation," said Sen. Hutchison. "I am pleased the Senate passed this legislation, which will add more than $1.8 billion to last year's funding level." 
   The legislation will provide more than $12.1 billion for better training capabilities, base facilities and family housing. Overall it includes:

   "This legislation will improve the facilities and training programs for military servicemen and women," Sen. Hutchison said. "Our troops and their loved ones make great sacrifices for our nation and deserve the best possible training and infrastructure to help them do their jobs correctly and safely." 
   The legislation passed the House of Representatives on May 26th. It will now be sent to the Senate Floor before going to President George W. Bush to be signed into law.
