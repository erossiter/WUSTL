SEN. HUTCHISON: UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS-SANDIA AGREEMENT TO BRING NEW RESEARCH, PRESTIGE TO TEXAS UNIVERSITIES
  Some of Texas' leading universities stand to gain new research projects and greater national prestige with a memorandum of understanding announced today in El Paso between The University of Texas (UT) System and the Sandia National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said. 
   Specifically, UT-Austin, UT-Arlington, UT-Dallas, UT-El Paso, UT Southwestern Health Science Center and UT Medical Branch in Galveston all can look forward to additional research opportunities as a result of the partnership.
   More than a year ago, the state's senior Senator arranged and hosted a meeting for UT officials that first opened the door to this partnership. She believed the highly regarded UT Engineering Department would contribute to the academic component of the Sandia mission and approached the manager of the lab to explore the possibility of a formal association. After several meetings, it expanded to other UT components.
   "This historic agreement will advance academic excellence both at UT schools and at Sandia," Sen. Hutchison said. "This partnership will provide a welcome infusion of new resources for research and afford Texas students and professors greater capabilities for learning. Across the country, UT is being recognized more and more as a pioneer in science. This endeavor will further enhance the educational experience of UT students and faculty."
   The projects expected to result from the agreement and schools doing the work are:
   * Simulated engineering - UT-Austin, UT-Arlington, and UT-Dallas
   * High energy density physics - UT-Austin
   * Energy and water security and sustainability - UT-El Paso
   * Health Security Program to further study infectious diseases - UTMB-Galveston
   * Bio-sensor programs, digital security, and bio-defense projects - UT Southwestern.
