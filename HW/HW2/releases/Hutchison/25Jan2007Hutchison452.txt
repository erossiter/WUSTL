SEN. HUTCHISON INTRODUCES BILL TO CREATE NEW JUDGESHIPS IN DISTRICTS OVERBURDENED WITH IMMIGRATION CASELOADS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today introduced legislation to authorize 11 new Federal judgeships for U.S. Districts in which more than 50 percent of their criminal cases are immigration cases. In the Southern District of Texas the immigration case rate is 65 percent.  
   "This bill will give these Southwestern Districts the resources they need to handle their overwhelming immigration caseloads," Sen. Hutchison said. "Often the offenders clogging the system have been caught multiple times or are wanted for other crimes. The backlog hinders our border security efforts and delays the swift delivery of justice to the accused and to their victims." 
   The federal judgeship legislation follows the 2005 Judicial Conference recommendation for the four U.S. Districts overburdened with immigration caseloads. The four Districts - The Southern District of Texas, the Southern District of California, the District of New Mexico and the District of Arizona - all share a border with Mexico.
   Along with Sen. Hutchison, original cosponsors of the legislation include Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and Pete Domenici (R-NM).
