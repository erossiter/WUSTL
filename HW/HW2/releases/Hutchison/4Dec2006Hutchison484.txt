SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON BOLTON'S RESIGNATION
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on the announcement that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton will resign when his appointment expires. 
 "I am greatly disappointed that the Senate has failed to confirm John Bolton as Ambassador to the United Nations. Throughout his career as a public servant at the Justice Department, State Department and the United Nations, John Bolton has tirelessly advocated American interests on the global stage. A strong defender of freedom and protector of human rights, Ambassador Bolton has championed desperately needed reform within the United Nations. He has done a fine job under difficult circumstances, and I thank Ambassador Bolton for his service to our country."
