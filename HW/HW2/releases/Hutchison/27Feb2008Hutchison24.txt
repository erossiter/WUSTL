  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator, released a statement on the passing of noted author, publisher, and conservative commentator William F. Buckley, Jr.:
   "I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of William F. Buckley, Jr. today. For over 50 years Bill Buckley made an enormous contribution to American culture and politics. He will be remembered as the father of the modern conservative movement. Thankfully, his legacy will continue in the National Review, the recognized standard bearer that he founded over 50 years ago."
