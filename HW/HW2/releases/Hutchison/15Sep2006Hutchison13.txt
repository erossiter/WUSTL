SEN. HUTCHISON, REP. PENCE HAIL AMERICAN FARM BUREAU SUPPORT FOR BORDER SECURITY, IMMIGRATION REFORM PROPOSAL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN) hailed a statement of support by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) for their no amnesty immigration reform proposal. The AFBF called the Hutchison-Pence initiative "a distinguished effort to hammer out a workable solution." 
   "The American Farm Bureau is playing a key role in the national debate over comprehensive immigration reform," Sen. Hutchison said. "Their support of the Hutchison - Pence framework is a powerful boost to our effort to secure the border and ensure that farmers and ranchers have the workforce they need to keep the United States agriculture industry strong. I am honored to receive the support of an organization representing so many hard-working Americans."
   "The American Farm Bureau is the gold standard of public policy in American agriculture and I am truly humbled by the support Farm Bureau is showing the Hutchison-Pence proposal," said Pence. "The support of Farm Bureau for the principles in Hutchison-Pence, which are border security first, coupled with a no amnesty temporary worker program, is of incalculable value as we work to solve this domestic crisis in a manner consistent with our laws and national character."
