SEN. HUTCHISON WILL VOTE AGAINST MOTION TO PROCEED
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today announced she will vote against bringing the immigration bill back to the Senate floor at this time. 
   In the coming days the Senate is expected to vote on Cloture on the Motion to Proceed to S. 1348, the immigration bill. Sen. Hutchison said today she will oppose the cloture motion because the current bill includes amnesty provisions and more time is needed to discuss ways to strengthen the bill through an open amendment process.
   "I have opposed the current immigration bill because I believe we can provide a workable guest worker program without amnesty, and this bill appears to be going in the opposite direction," said Sen. Hutchison. "Until major changes are made that reject amnesty and a more open, fair process emerges for debating one of the most crucial issues facing our nation, I cannot support this immigration bill.
   Sen. Hutchison has filed a "return home" amendment which would require adult illegal immigrants to return to their home country within two years of receiving their Secure ID, also known as their temporary "Z" visa.
   The amendment is co-sponsored by Senators Bob Corker (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN). Sen. Hutchison also opposes the provision added to the bill which would sunset the temporary worker program after five years.
