SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $115 MILLION IN IMMEDIATE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS AT TEXAS VETERANS' FACILITIES
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member on the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (Milcon-VA) Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced over $115 million in immediate funding for projects at VA facilities in Texas. 
   "Today we have great news from the VA that improvements to a number of our Texas veterans facilities will begin very soon," said Sen. Hutchison. "I have worked closely with the Texas delegation to increase funding for the VA for these projects and will continue those efforts."
   This U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding has been made possible by efforts in the Congress, led by Sen. Hutchison, to increase funding to the "Minor Construction Projects" account. Funding for this account totaled $1.156 billion for 2007 and 2008, a $723 million increase over the President's budget request.
