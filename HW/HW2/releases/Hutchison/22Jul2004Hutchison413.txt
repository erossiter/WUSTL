SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON 9-11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today on the final report of The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, commonly know as the 9-11 Commission: 
   "The commission's report documents in extraordinary detail that 9-11 was a wake-up call that has forever changed our nation. That we did not see the attacks coming is a collective burden that transcends political parties and falls on all branches of government, past and present.
   "Since that horrible day, we've made tremendous, bipartisan progress to make America far safer. Under President Bush's leadership, we've designated a new department with the sole mission of protecting our country, nearly tripled homeland security funding, completely revamped aviation security and crippled the terrorist organization that perpetuated the 9-11 atrocities.
   "However, we can never relent and we clearly have more to do. We are working to improve cargo and port security. We must continue to ensure our troops and law enforcement have the tools they need, including the PATRIOT Act. In Iraq, our enemies are making a desperate last stand. We will see this mission through and send a message to the world that freedom will triumph.
   "The central recommendation for a national intelligence director deserves serious consideration by both the Administration and Congress. Now more than ever it's critical that our commander-in-chief receive comprehensive and accurate national security data."
