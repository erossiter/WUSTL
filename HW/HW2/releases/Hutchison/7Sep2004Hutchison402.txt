SENATE APPROVES JUSTICE SCHNEIDER FOR TEXAS' EASTERN DISTRICT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison welcomed Senate confirmation today of Justice Michael Haygood Schneider, Sr. of the Texas Supreme Court to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas. Sen. Hutchison originally recommended him to the White House for the position, along with Senator John Cornyn, and she helped steer his nomination through the Senate, from introducing him at the first hearing in July to urging her colleagues to vote swiftly to approve him. The Eastern District includes Beaumont, Lufkin, Marshall, Paris, Sherman, Texarkana, and Tyler, among other cities. 
   "For more than 25 years, Justice Schneider has set a high standard for legal excellence. He has demonstrated superior judicial temperament and won the endorsement of Texas voters time and again," Sen. Hutchison said. "Justice Schneider will be an outstanding addition to the Eastern District bench. The region will benefit from his commitment to public service for years to come."
   Before joining the state's Supreme Court in 2002, Justice Schneider was chief justice of the Texas First Court of Appeals from 1996 to 2002 and the 157th District Court of Texas from 1990 to 1996. From 1978-1990, he served on the West University Place Municipal Court. He has also served as assistant district attorney for Harris County and performed legal work for Union Pacific Railroad and Bawden Drilling, Inc.
   Justice Schneider graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1965, earned a law degree at the University of Houston College of Law in 1971, and completed his Masters of Law degree at the University of Virginia School of Law in 2001. He has been honored as both "Trial Judge of the Year" and "Appellate Judge of the Year" by the Texas Association of Civil Trial and Appellate Specialists.
