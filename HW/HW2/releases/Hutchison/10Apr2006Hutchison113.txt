SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $20 MILLION FOR HURRICANE RITA, KATRINA EXPENSES
  Today, Texas' senior Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, announced that FEMA has approved three grants totaling $20.3 million for Texas in the aftermath of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. "This funding will provide support for Texas communities that were severely affected by Hurricane Rita as well as communities that provided support and shelter for thousands of Hurricane Katrina victims," said Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "I am continuing my work to obtain funding to help Texas rebuild and recover."  
   * A $17 million Public Assistance grant has been awarded to reimburse the city of Houston for the costs associated with providing temporary shelter for Hurricane Katrina victims. The reimbursement covers costs not previously claimed for the sheltering of evacuees from impacted states as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
   * A $1.5 million Public Assistance grant has been awarded to reimburse the city of Port Arthur for the cost of contract services to provide and maintain generators and light plants to keep essential services functioning following Hurricane Rita.
   * A $1.8 million grant has been awarded to fund safety and flood protection measures at Lake Gilmer. During heavy storm events, the existing stilling basin and exit channel at Lake Gilmer have been eroded by hydraulic forces, resulting in failure of the east exit channel levee and subsequent flooding.
