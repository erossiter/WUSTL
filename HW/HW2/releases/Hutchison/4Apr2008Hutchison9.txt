SEN. HUTCHISON CONTINUES SUPPORT FOR HURRICANE RITA VICTIMS
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas's senior Senator, today helped pass over $1 billion in tax relief for victims of Hurricane Rita by cosponsoring an amendment offered by Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA). The amendment survived a procedural attempt to defeat it by a vote of 74-5 and was accepted as part of H.R. 3221, the Housing bill. 
   Specifically, this amendment will eliminate an unintended tax burden on the thousands of Gulf Coast homeowners who received rebuilding grants after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
   "I will continue working to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Rita by ensuring the government does not unfairly penalize the recipients of rebuilding grants," said Sen. Hutchison.
   Gulf Coast victims who took a deduction on their 2005 tax return for hurricane damage, but then received a rebuilding grant, are considered by the IRS to be "double dipping" and therefore count the grant as additional income. For many people, this would put them in a higher tax bracket which could require a higher tax penalty than the benefit they received.
   Specifically, this amendment allows people to amend their 2005 returns to give back the casualty loss deduction to avoid the "double dipping" problem and not be penalized for receiving rebuilding assistance.
   Sen. Hutchison is the Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
