SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES TEXAS TO RECEIVE NEARLY $1 MILLION IN DOJ GRANTS TO PREVENT VIOLENT CRIME
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced two Texas organizations will receive a total of nearly $1 million in U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grants targeting the prevention of violent crime. 
   Texas State University-San Marcos will receive $911,639 in Edward Byrne Memorial grant funding to aid patrol officers in their effort to effectively respond to violent situations. Specifically, Texas State University will use the funding to support their Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Program, which provides high quality, affordable first responder training classes utilizing "force-on-force" techniques to stop active shooters.
   "Texas State University will receive significant federal funding for this advanced training program for first responders in the San Marcos area," said Sen. Hutchison.
   The Edward Byrne Memorial Grant program, according to DOJ, assists state and local jurisdictions in improving the criminal justice program and communities in preventing drug abuse and crime.
   Austin-based domestic violence nonprofit SAHELI, Inc., which does business as SAHELI for Asian Families, will receive $50,000 in DOJ Public Awareness in Underserved Communities funding. According to their website, SAHELI provides assistance to Asian families dealing with domestic violence and abuse. Specifically, DOJ says this cooperative agreement will support planning and development of a victimization-focused public awareness campaign targeted at underserved populations with Limited English Proficiency. 
   "SAHELI will utilize this federal funding to raise awareness of domestic violence and abuse in Austin communities where there may be language barriers," said Sen. Hutchison.
