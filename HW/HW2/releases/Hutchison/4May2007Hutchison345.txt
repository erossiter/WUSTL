SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN COMMENT ON DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY OUTREACH TO LOCAL BORDER LEADERS
  Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn today released the following statement regarding letters sent to local officials in border communities by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS): 
   "We are pleased that DHS listened to our requests for local input on implementation of the Secure Fence Act. America's borders must be secured, and no one understands that better than the people who live along the border. That is why it is imperative to involve local leaders and to respect private property rights."
   Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn requested in a November 17, 2006 letter that DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff meet with border community leaders and visit the border region. Secretary Chertoff met with local leaders and Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn in Washington on January 17. Secretary Chertoff and Sen. Cornyn also met with border mayors and county judges in Laredo on February 21. Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn released a statement on May 2 calling on DHS to involve local leaders and property owners in decisions about the construction of border fencing.
