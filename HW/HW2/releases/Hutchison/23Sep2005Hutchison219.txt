SEN. HUTCHISON\'S OFFICE TO STAY OPEN 24 HOURS TO HELP TEXANS DURING HURRICANE RITA
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas' senior senator, announced today her Washington, D.C. office will stay open 24 hours a day for the next two days to assist Texans affected by Hurricane Rita.  
   "We are working around the clock to ensure that communication lines between federal, state and local governments remain open and active," Sen. Hutchison said. "My office will serve as a constant point of contact for local officials as well as citizens who are in need of emergency assistance." 
   Sen. Hutchison today has spoken with the mayors of Houston, Galveston and Texas City, as well as county judges and other local officials. She is gathering on-the-ground intelligence for what is needed to assist local communities and relaying that back to officials at FEMA and the White House. 
   This week, Sen. Hutchison spoke with White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, FEMA Director R. David Paulison and Michael Jackson, Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to express her concern that emergency responders are ready to act swiftly if needed. 
   "We must be precise in our preparedness and rapid in our response," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am working around the clock to ensure the response on all levels will be swift and thorough."
