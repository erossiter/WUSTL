SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES FUNDING FOR EL CAMINO REAL DE LOS TEJAS HISTORICAL PROJECT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the committee has approved the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of the Interior Appropriations bill including funding requested by Sen. Hutchison for the National Park Service to begin a Comprehensive Management Plan for El Camino Real de los Tejas. The committee approved language providing the funding necessary for the management project but the exact amount has not yet been determined. 
   "These resources for El Camino Real's development as a National Historic Trail will help preserve our unique Texas heritage. It will serve as an educational tool for students and drive tourism throughout the state," Sen. Hutchison said. 
   The funding for the trail's development, planning and mapping will help communities and the National Park Service as they work to develop the trail as an educational and recreation tool and boost tourism in the various trail locations. The Interior Appropriations bill will now need to be voted on by the full Senate, reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill and sent to President Bush to be signed into law.
   Sen. Hutchison worked for three years to achieve the trail's historic designation - the only new trail approved in the 108th Congress. President Bush signed the legislation into law on October 18, 2004. From March 21 through 23 she led a three-day trail tour making 18 stops from Sabine County to Eagle Pass to announce the National Historic Trail designation and highlight its historic impact on Texas history. 
   "This trail is part of my family history. I visited many of these historical stops as a child with my family and was proud to bring my two children along the trail tour to help them learn about Texas' rich history," Sen. Hutchison said.
