SEN. HUTCHISON WINS APPROVAL TO RESTORE, MAINTAIN FIVE B-1s AT DYESS AIR FORCE BASE
  At the urging of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Pentagon officials have decided to fund and assign to Dyess Air Force Base (AFB) five of seven B-1 bombers returning to service in 2005.  
 Texas' senior senator advocated assigning all seven aircraft to Dyess AFB, but welcomed the decision as an important investment.
   "For months I have been working to convince the Pentagon that Dyess is ideally suited for this mission. Today those efforts paid off," Sen. Hutchison said. "This is great news for Dyess Air Force Base and the city of Abilene."
   In a number of contacts with the officials in charge of making the decision, the Senator contended the facility was the best choice due to its significant hangar space, extensive runways, and community support. Senator Hutchison, Chairman of the Senate's Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, has long been a staunch supporter of Dyess AFB, securing millions of dollars for improvements in recent years. Earlier this month the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the military construction appropriations bill she authored for fiscal year 2005, including her requests for $11 million to construct a new fire and rescue station near Dyess' runway and $28.6 million to replace 127 units of family housing.
   "Dyess' runways, hangar space and strong support in the community made it the perfect choice. These planes are an important investment in Dyess and will give the military additional assets for long-range bombing," Senator Hutchison added.
