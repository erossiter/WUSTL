SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUSTICE O'CONNOR
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement on the new vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "We will greatly miss Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. She has been a wonderful role model for young women in America and around the world. She is a good friend and I join countless others in thanking her for her service. 
   "As I wrote in my book, 'American Heroines,' Justice O'Connor and I both experienced the glass ceiling when we graduated from law school. Justice O'Connor overcame that barrier and became a superb jurist and a defender of the rule of law. Her tenure on the bench has set a new standard of jurisprudence. 
   "The Senate will now embark on a journey to fill a vacancy on the high court. This is a task so important to our nation that partisan politics must never enter the equation. I look forward to President Bush nominating a judge who will not make law from the bench. I will help shepherd his nominee through the Senate. 
   "While we still have many lower court nominees to confirm, there is no higher priority facing the Senate. We must make this process swift and free from partisan politics. The Senate should act quickly to ensure the new justice is in place by October."
