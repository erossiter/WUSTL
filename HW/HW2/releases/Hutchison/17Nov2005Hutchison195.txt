SEN. HUTCHISON'S WEATHER MODIFICATION BILL APPROVED BY COMMERCE COMMITTEE
  The Weather Modification Research and Development Policy Authorization Act of 2005, legislation introduced by Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space, was approved today by the full Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. The legislation develops a comprehensive weather modification program which will enhance the scientific understanding of weather modification. 
   "It is critical that we assess and evaluate the efficacy of weather modification research to the extent that lives are saved and property damage is limited," Sen. Hutchison said. "This work is vital, especially as we near the end of such a devastating hurricane season." 
   Sen. Hutchison's legislation will create a Weather Modification Subcommittee within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. And it will gather outside experts on a Weather Modification Advisory and Research Board to advise the subcommittee. This board will work to expand the practical and verifiable understanding of this science.
   "Hurricanes Rita and Katrina and the recent tornados and violent storms in the Midwest took many lives and destroyed both property and the environment," Sen. Hutchison said. "By developing sustained research we can provide answers to the issues of predictability and reliability of weather modification research."
