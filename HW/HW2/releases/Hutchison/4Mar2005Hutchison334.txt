SEN. HUTCHISON HONORS HISTORY OF TEXAS WOMEN
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today celebrated women's contributions to Texas history in remarks made at the Texas State Historical Society Women in Texas History Luncheon. 
   "When we celebrated our Independence Day this week, we honored both Texan men and women who persevered to help Texas become the proud and prosperous state it is today," Sen. Hutchison said. "Today's Texan women continue to lead in a changed society - at home, in the office, through public service and beyond. I look forward to the contributions future generations of women will make as they carry forward our Texas tradition." 
   Sen. Hutchison used the meeting with the Texas State Historical Society as an opportunity to inform them of developments in her work to designate the oldest trail in Texas, El Camino Real de los Tejas, as a National Historic Trail. President Bush signed into law Sen. Hutchison's legislation in October 2005 and the National Park Service is set to begin completion of a comprehensive management plan required for historic trail designation.
   Settlers, immigrants, Indians and the military used the corridor of trails extending from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo to Natchitoches, Louisiana. The National Historic Trail designation will support preservation efforts and help develop tourism in the region.
