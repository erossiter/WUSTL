SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) released the following statement today regarding the death of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto: 
   "Today we have witnessed a jarring act of brutality by terrorists in Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto, the first female Prime Minister of a muslim state, was a champion for democracy, and the world will miss her leadership. I was honored to meet with and host Benazir Bhutto in my office on several occasions where she spoke passionately about strengthening Pakistan's alliance with America and sharing a commitment to freedom.
   "Today's assassination is a somber reminder of the global threat posed by terrorists. More than ever, we must stand strong and unite with our allies to defeat terrorism wherever it exists and encourage Pakistan to remain on a path toward stable democracy."
