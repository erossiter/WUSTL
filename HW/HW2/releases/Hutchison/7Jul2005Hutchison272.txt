SEN. HUTCHISON TOURS WACO VA FACILITY WITH VA SECRETARY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today welcomed U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson to Texas for a tour of the Waco VA Hospital.  
   "It is an honor to welcome Secretary Nicholson to this outstanding Texas veterans facility. He will hear directly from the committed caregivers and veterans themselves who benefit from their services," Sen. Hutchison said. "We must fulfill our promise to America's veterans who fought for our freedom and ensure we have quality facilities for those coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan." 
   Sen. Hutchison extended an invitation to Secretary Nicholson for him to personally visit the Waco campus during an April 20 meeting with the Secretary in her Washington, D.C. office, to discuss the extensive resources and future of the Waco VA facility. 
   Sen. Hutchison has met several times with Secretary Nicholson and former VA Secretary Anthony Principi to discuss the importance of the Waco VA Hospital. Secretary Principi toured the facility with Sen. Hutchison in January of 2004.
