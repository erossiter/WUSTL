SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES RED RIVER DEFENSE DISTRIBUTION DEPOT SELECTED AS SITE FOR DEPLOYABLE DISTRIBUTION CENTER
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chairman of Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Department of Defense Logistics Agency has designated the Defense Distribution Depot at Red River as one of two sites for a Deployable Distribution Center (DDx). The Defense Distribution Depot at Jan Joaquin, California was selected as the second site. The sites will serve as deployable natural disaster response centers within the United States and military contingencies worldwide.  
   "Selecting Red River as the site for a deployable response unit will help our nation respond to future natural disasters. Red River has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to support our nation's military needs and I know it will meet our needs during a natural disaster as well," Sen. Hutchison said. "The Gulf Coast is still recovering from last year's severe weather. Locating the distribution center, ready to deploy at any time, at Red River will strengthen our nation's response and preparedness efforts in a region where it is needed most."
   The Defense Logistics Agency has directed the Red River DDx to begin operating by June 1, 2006. The program will result in 30 new full time positions along with new communications and life support equipment to provide relief during a natural disaster.
