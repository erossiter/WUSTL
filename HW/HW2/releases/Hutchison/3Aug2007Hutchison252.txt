SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $525,000 IN FUNDING TO FIGHT CRIME IN TEXAS CITIES
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced $525,000 in U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grants that will help improve safety in high-crime neighborhoods in Texas by curbing gang activity, violent crime and drug abuse. 
   "The Weed and Seed program will help make our communities safer by supporting local police in an innovative program," Sen. Hutchison said. "This funding brings federal government resources into targeted local communities to effectively fight crime."
   The following communities will receive first-time Weed and Seed funding:
   * Houston (West Houston) $175,000 
   * San Antonio (West End) $175,000 
   * Corpus Christi (South East) $175,000
   The funding will be directed from DOJ to local "Weed and Seed" programs to support community policing and improve neighborhood watch programs to reduce violent crime and drug trafficking. Programs in these cities will also focus on reducing juvenile crime through early intervention and adult guidance, and increasing economic and community development in target areas. These communities have agreed to allocate at least 50% of the funding to "weeding activities," including community policing.
