SENATE APPROVES SEN. HUTCHISON'S LEGISLATION TO REPEAL WRIGHT AMENDMENT
  The full Senate today approved by unanimous consent legislation introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) to implement an agreement to repeal the Wright amendment. The legislation is identical to the version expected to pass in the U.S. House of Representatives today. The parallel language will allow the bill to be sent to President Bush to be signed into law, by-passing a time-consuming conference to reconcile the two bills.  
   "Passage of our Wright amendment legislation today is an historic accomplishment for the leaders of the North Texas community acting in the best interests of consumers," Sen. Hutchison said. "My bill will repeal the Wright amendment in eight years and achieve a balance between Love Field and the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. More competition will bring lower fares to airline passengers and an influx of passengers will significantly benefit small businesses in North Texas." 
   Senator Hutchison's legislation relaxes restraints on flights to and from Love Field and repeals remaining provisions of the Wright amendment eight years after the date of enactment.
