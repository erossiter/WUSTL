SEN. HUTCHISON CONTINUES FIGHT FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN 109TH CONGRESS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) signed on as an original co-sponsor of Association Health Plan (AHP) legislation introduced this week on the Senate floor.  
 Based on a similar proposal she offered during the 108th Congress, the Small Business Health Fairness Act facilitates the ability of small businesses to offer health coverage to their employees, helping those businesses grow and compete.
   "More affordable healthcare options will foster small business success while improving healthcare options available to employees and their families," Sen. Hutchison said. "More than 99 percent of all employers are small businesses. Passage of this legislation will infuse momentum into our growing economy." 
   The bipartisan AHP legislation provides small businesses the opportunity to band together to purchase affordable health benefits. The provisions give employers greater buying power, resulting in more affordable healthcare options. The increased competition will level the benefits playing field, giving small businesses the same cost and benefit advantages as fortune 500 companies. 
   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates small businesses participating in AHP's will receive insurance premium reductions ranging from 13-25 percent. In addition, the federal regulation of AHP's will eliminate the costs of complying with separate benefits mandates in each of the 50 states, significantly reducing administrative costs for small business owners. 
   A coalition of organizations representing over 12 million employers and 80 million workers has endorsed the current AHP legislation, including the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
