SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $5.2 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR FLOOD PREVENTION IN COMAL COUNTY
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator, today announced $5.25 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Grants for Comal County flood control. 
    "We have soundly learned that preparation is the best protection against flooding and other natural disasters," Sen. Hutchison said. "These funds will help ensure that communities in Comal County have the resources to protect lives and mitigate damage to private property when disasters occur."
   According to DHS, the funding will go toward constructing a flood retarding structure which would be in an undeveloped area known as "Area 11," near New Braunfels. The construction is planned across a tributary of Dry Comal Creek and will control water flow in a 3,750 acre area.
