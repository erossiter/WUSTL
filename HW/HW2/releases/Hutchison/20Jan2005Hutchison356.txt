   "The beautiful ceremony today reminds us all that the United States is the envy of the world because we honor the people's will through the peaceful transfer of power. The inauguration was uplifting. It rightly emphasized how much we appreciate the men and women of the military who protect our democracy."
   "President Bush made a wonderful speech to America and the world, stressing the importance of freedom and our desire for every person on earth to enjoy liberty's blessings. Wherever freedom has a chance, it will prevail, which is why it is so important to see the War on Terror through to victory."

   "Finally, President Bush is committed to keeping our economic momentum by making tax relief permanent, and making fundamental changes to simplify the code and reduce its burden on America's families and businesses."
   "President Bush is demonstrating leadership on these and other critical issues. I share his vision and look forward to working in the Senate to make it a reality."
