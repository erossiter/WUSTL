SEN. HUTCHISON WELCOMES COMPLETION OF RIO GRANDE VALLEY VETERANS HEALTH CARE STUDY
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today welcomed the completion of an independent study that she requested be conducted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to suggest ways to improve veterans' health care in the Rio Grande Valley.  
   "This has been a long time coming, and I am glad that this study is finally complete," Sen. Hutchison said. "I look forward to reviewing the results of the study and have requested that officials from the VA brief the Rio Grande Valley's congressional delegation on those results next week in the Valley. After reviewing the results, I will continue to work with the delegation to ensure that our veterans in South Texas receive the best possible treatment."
   Valley veterans seeking care beyond what is available at VA clinics in the Valley have been burdened with hours-long bus rides to receive treatment at the VA hospital in San Antonio. Expanded health care resources in the region will allow more convenient access to a wider range of medical services without arduous trips to another facility.
   Senator Hutchison personally made a request to VA Secretary Jim Nicholson to have his department conduct a study to examine access to health care for veterans in the Rio Grande Valley in December 2005. The VA contracted with an independent consulting firm to conduct the study. Senator Hutchison wrote a letter to Secretary Nicholson on April 5, 2007, requesting a progress report on the study and inquired about it further at a hearing with the secretary on April 12.
