SEN. HUTCHISON NAMED LEGISLATOR OF THE YEAR BY EAST TEXAS COUNTIES
  Citing her efforts to create jobs and improve mobility throughout the region, the Deep East Texas Council of Governments (DETCOG) today named Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) its 2005 Legislator of the Year. 
   The DETCOG is comprised of scores of county, municipal and local authorities. Its members include a dozen counties throughout the region, including Angelina, Jasper, Houston, Nacogdoches, Newton, Polk, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Tyler. The two previous DETCOG Legislators of the Year were State Senator Todd Staples (R-Palestine) and U.S. Representative Jim Turner (D-Crockett). Sen. Hutchison's father and mother grew up in Beaumont and Nacogdoches, respectively, and she continues to have strong ties to the area.
   "As someone born and raised in East Texas, I am deeply honored to receive this distinguished award," she said. "I greatly respect the work of the Council, which labors tirelessly to make East Texas a better place to live and work. Winning this recognition from them is truly a highlight of my career. I will continue to make the region's economic growth, transportation and other needs a top priority."
   "Senator Hutchison has been a strong supporter of our region and we are grateful for everything she's done to advance our priorities," said Charlie Simmons, Nacogdoches County Commissioner and President of the Deep East Texas County Commissioner and County Judges Association, the primary sponsor of the award.
   DETCOG officials said the accolade comes in recognition of the Senator's work on several key initiatives, including:
   * Interstate 69 development and construction. Sen. Hutchison has secured $26.4 million in federal funds for the project since fiscal year 2001; 
   * Enactment of legislation designating El Camino Real de los Tejas, the state's oldest trail, as a National Historic Trail to promote historical preservation and generate new tourism and economic growth. Previous attempts to grant the designation failed because of concerns for the rights of private property owners. Sen. Hutchison worked to achieve the designation in a way that gives landowners the right to opt in or opt out of those portions of the trail that are not public property; 
   * Passing a ban on Internet Access Taxes, that ensures municipalities can continue to collect "franchise fees" to support local services; and 
   * Strong support for the well being of East Texas forestlands, including The Big Thicket.
