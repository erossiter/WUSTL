SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON RECORD DOW CLOSING
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on the Dow Jones industrial average closing at a new record high:  
   "The tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 have produced record economic growth, and have now helped the Dow close at a new record high. More Americans are employed today than at any time in our nation's history, and lower taxes allow hard-working Americans to invest more of their money back into our economy. In order to sustain this growth, we need to make the tax cuts permanent."
