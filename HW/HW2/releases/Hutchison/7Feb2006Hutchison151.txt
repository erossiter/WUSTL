SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES LOW-INTEREST DISASTER LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN TEXAS COUNTIES
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced 14 counties in Texas may apply for U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) low-interest loans for economic losses from adverse weather conditions. 
   "We must ensure that our state's small businesses receive adequate compensation for revenue lost from drought conditions," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am pleased that these loans will help to offset loses incurred by Texas businesses during this difficult time." 
   The loans issued by the SBA will qualify small business owners in Cooke, Falls, McLennan, Denton, Grayson, Montague, Wise, Bell, Limestone, Milam, Robertson, Bosque and Coryell counties to apply for low-interest emergency loans of up to $1.5 million.
