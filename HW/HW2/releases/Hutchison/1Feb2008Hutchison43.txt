SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA TRAGEDY
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior Senator, today commemorated the five-year anniversary of the Space Shuttle Columbia tragedy and released the following statement: 
   "Today our country salutes the seven brave astronauts who gave their lives in commitment to the noble national priority of space exploration. We must be reminded of their sacrifice as we pay tribute to the lives they lived and gave in service to this nation.
   "I believe these seven astronauts would agree that we must remain committed to maintaining America's role as the international leader in space travel because it is so important for our future.
   "Their families and friends are in our prayers and their example will live on in our memories."
   Sen. Hutchison has led efforts in Congress to pass legislation to create a Columbia memorial, introducing S. 242, the Columbia Memorial Space Shuttle Act of 2005, which passed the Senate that year. In this Congress, Sen. Hutchison has combined efforts to support H.R. 807, authored by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX). That legislation passed in the House and appears likely to pass the Senate early this year.
