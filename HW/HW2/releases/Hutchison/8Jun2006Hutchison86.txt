SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES RED RIVER ARMY DEPOT TO PARTICIPATE IN $175 MILLION BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE PROGRAM
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chairman of Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations conference report that has been finalized will include $175 million for production and upgrades of the Bradley Fighting Vehicles at the Red River Army Depot and in York, PA. 
   "Red River has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to support our nation's military needs, and is a natural site for further production of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle," Sen. Hutchison said. "These vehicles are proven assets for our troops in the field."
   The Bradley Fighting Vehicle is a long-standing component of the Army's active and reserve forces. The Bradley provides protected transport and support of infantry units on the battlefield.
