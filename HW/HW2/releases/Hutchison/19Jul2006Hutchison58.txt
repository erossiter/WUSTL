SEN. HUTCHISON CONGRATULATES VA ON 75TH ANNIVERSARY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today congratulated the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on its 75th Anniversary.  
   "I am proud to support America's troops and our noble veterans," Sen. Hutchison said. "Today the VA marks 75 years of steadfast service to our nation's heroes. I congratulate the department on reaching this significant milestone, and look forward to its continued commitment to meeting the needs of our veterans in the years to come." 
   Legislation authored by Sen. Hutchison and approved yesterday by the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee will provide more than $77.9 billion to fund the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for Fiscal Year 2007. This amount is a nine percent increase above the Fiscal Year 2006 enacted level and includes $28.7 billion for medical services, $3.6 billion for medical facilities, $399 million for medical facilities and $412 million for medical and prosthetic research.
