SEN. HUTCHISON COSPONSORS IMPROVE SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR FAMILIES OF VETERANS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, became a cosponsor of S. 935, legislation to eliminate the offset in veterans' survivor benefits when a surviving family member is eligible for multiple benefit plans. 
   The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) is issued automatically in the event a service member dies on active duty or can be purchased by military retirees. Surviving spouses of active duty or retired military who die as the result of an injury from their service are eligible for the Department of Veterans Affairs' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation program (DIC). 
   Currently, though, their SBP benefits are offset by DIC benefits.
   "This is a matter of doing what is right for those whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country," said Sen. Hutchison. "Veterans' family members deserve our support. Limiting SBP benefits is unfair and must be corrected."
