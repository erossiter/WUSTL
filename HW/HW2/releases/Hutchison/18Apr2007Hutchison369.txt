SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES TO PROTECT CHOICES FOR SENIORS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today voted to protect choices for seniors enrolled in the Medicare prescription drug program by opposing an effort that would undermine the success of the program.  
   "Since its launch in 2006, over 24 million seniors-including over two million Texans-have enrolled in the Medicare prescription drug program and many are enjoying drug coverage for the first time at lower costs," Sen. Hutchison said. "Eighty-eight percent of beneficiaries in Texas have access to coverage with lower premiums this year than they paid last year. 
   "Seniors also have more choices and added benefits. This year, Texans have access to 60 different plans, 27 of which offer enhanced benefits such as gap coverage and little or no deductible. That is 13 more plans than in 2006, including eight more enhanced coverage options. 
   "While options have increased, costs have decreased. The average plan premium this year is $22, which is 40 percent lower than was originally projected when the prescription drug program was created. 
   "Providing seniors with the right to choose their prescription drug plan allows seniors to select the plan that includes the prescriptions they need and not have to pay for costly drugs they do not need. This competition reduces costs for seniors and overall costs for the American taxpayer."
