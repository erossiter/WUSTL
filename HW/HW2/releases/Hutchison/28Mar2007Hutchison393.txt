SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH TEXAS FARM BUREAU
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today met with members of the Texas Farm Bureau to discuss the upcoming 2007 Farm Bill and important issues facing agriculture in the 110th Congress. Senator Hutchison is committed to continuing the positive advances made in the 2002 Farm Bill. 
   "Agriculture is crucial to the Texas economy and a vital part of our rich cultural heritage," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am proud to be an advocate for Texas agriculture and the thousands of farming and ranching families it supports."
   The 2007 Farm Bill will be one of the major pieces of legislation considered by the 110th Congress. The 2002 bill, set to expire this September, included many provisions that are beneficial to Texas producers.
