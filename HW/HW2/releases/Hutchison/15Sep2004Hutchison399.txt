SENATE VOTES TO DESIGNATE EL CAMINO REAL DE LOS TEJAS NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL
  The U.S. Senate today unanimously passed legislation authored by Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison designating the oldest trail in Texas, El Camino Real de los Tejas, as a National Historic Trail.
   "El Camino Real de los Tejas is an integral part of our Texas heritage. This designation will celebrate the trail's history, attract visitors and generate new economic development throughout the Lone Star State," said Sen. Hutchison.
   El Camino Real de los Tejas was a corridor of trails used by settlers, immigrants, Indians and the military. The trail is a combination of routes totaling almost 2,600 miles from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo to Natchitoches, Louisiana. It also served as a path for such Texas heroes as Davy Crockett and Sam Houston, who both fought in the struggle for Texas independence from Mexico. 
   The measure now goes to the House of Representatives. Senator Hutchison said her office has already contacted House leaders and expressed hope that the legislation could be enacted before Congress adjourns for the year.
   "In the past three years we have come so far. I am committed to seeing this through this year," Sen. Hutchison added. "I believe we have a sound compromise that can give this legendary trail the status it deserves while ensuring property owners aren't impacted."
