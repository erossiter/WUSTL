SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON HARRIET MIERS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement on Harriet Miers: 
   "Harriet Miers is a good friend and devoted to her nation. I remain confident that Harriet Miers would have made a superb Supreme Court justice. She is and will continue to be a trailblazer in the legal community. My admiration of her has only increased because of this action. She made this decision because she believed it was right for the president and the country. While I am disappointed she will not be on the bench, we must begin to focus on filling the vacancy to the high court. This is a task so critical to our nation that partisan politics must be set aside."
