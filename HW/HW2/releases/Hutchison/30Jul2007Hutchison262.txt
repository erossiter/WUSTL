SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES DHS SAFER GRANT ELIGIBILITY PERIOD OPEN FOR TEXAS FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is releasing grant guidance and application information for approximately $110 million in Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants for Fiscal Year 2007. 
   "I want fire departments all over Texas to know that they can apply for SAFER grants, which are intended to increase staffing and deployment capabilities," said Sen. Hutchison. "The goal of 24-hour staffing for each fire department will help ensure adequate protection from fire and terrorism-related hazards for all Texans."
   The period opened today and will close Friday, August 31 at 5pm EST. Sen. Hutchison has a dedicated website page for grant information, http://hutchison.senate.gov/grants.html. Additionally, DHS guidance and application materials are available at www.grants.gov.
   According to FEMA, "SAFER grants support two specific activities: the hiring of firefighters and recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. The grants pay a portion of the salaries of newly hired firefighters over the 5-year award performance period."
