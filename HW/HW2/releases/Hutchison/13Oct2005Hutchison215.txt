SEN, HUTCHISON LEADS SENATE MAJORITY LEADER FRIST ON TEXAS BORDER TOUR
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today led Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) on a tour along the U.S - Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley to highlight need for more agents, technology and funding to secure our borders. Sen.  
 Hutchison invited Sen. Frist on the tour after she introduced her immigration bill on October 5 to allow local and state authorities to augment immigration enforcement. 
   "Senator Frist has seen up close the front lines of our nation's border fight," Sen. Hutchison said. "I worked to secure funding in the appropriations process for 1,500 new Border Patrol agents this year but that is just a start. We must continue to work together to deliver bold action on this important national security issue." 
   Sen. Hutchison's legislation would give state and local officials expanded authority to arrest, detain and prosecute illegal aliens as well as create a Volunteer Border Marshal Program. She introduced the bill - which is voluntary, not mandatory - the same day she hosted a meeting with U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff in her Washington, D.C. office to discuss broad immigration reform measures and the new provisions outlined in her bill. 
   The authority of state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration laws has been limited. Apprehension and removal of deportable aliens who are found throughout the country has strictly been interpreted as a federal responsibility. 
   "I have stressed to Senator Frist the need for congressional action to secure our borders and improve safety in our communities," Sen. Hutchison said.
