SEN. HUTCHISON AMENDMENT ENCOURAGING MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN DOD, NASA PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space, today announced her amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization bill which encourages cooperation between the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and NASA on research, development, test and evaluation activities has passed the Senate.  
 The overall authorization bill today passed unanimously. 
   "A collaborative effort between DOD and NASA will eliminate overlap and strengthen research and development opportunities," Sen. Hutchison said. "The significant contributions these two agencies make to our national security will advance at a faster pace with a joint focus while protecting taxpayers."
   The amendment, which Sen. Hutchison cosponsored with Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH), requires the DOD and NASA to prepare a report for Congress on areas of mutual interest such as aeronautics research, facilities, personnel and support infrastructure, propulsion and power technologies, and space access and operations. 
   The DOD authorization legislation must now be reconciled with the House version and signed into law by President Bush.
