SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON PASSING OF ASTRONAUT WALLY SCHIRRA
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Space, Aeronautics and Related Sciences Commerce Subcommittee, today commented on the death of Wally Schirra, one of the seven Mercury Astronauts named by NASA in April 1959.  
   "As one of our nation's first astronauts, Wally Schirra is a proud part of U.S. history. Wally's brave contributions to our nation's space exploration should serve as a reminder of the practical and scientific benefits of the space program and why we must remain committed to supporting NASA. My thoughts and prayers are with his family."
