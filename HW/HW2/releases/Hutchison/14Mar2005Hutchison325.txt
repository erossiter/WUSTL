SENS. HUTCHISON, ROCKEFELLER INTRODUCE INDECENCY BILL TO PROTECT CHILDREN
  Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and John Rockefeller (D-WV) today introduced the Indecent and Gratuitous and Excessive Violence Broadcasting Control Act of 2005 - a bill aimed at curbing indecency on our airwaves and providing more family friendly programs on television.  
   "Our children have too many opportunities to see and hear gratuitous violence and sex on our airwaves and too few alternatives from which to choose," Sen. Hutchison said.
   This legislation will: 1) Require the Federal Communications Commission to assess the effectiveness of the V-Chip and other technologies and methods. If it is found that the V-Chip and other methods are not protecting children from excessive violence and sex, then the FCC will have to create a rule requiring broadcasters to do more to protect children, including changing programming times; 2) Double the amount - from three to six hours a week - of children's programming; 3) Mandate new and improved program labeling that, before any program is aired, a full screen warning of the specific content will appear for 30 seconds and reappear every 30 minutes after for programs in excess of 30 minutes; 4) Set fines for broadcasters that use obscene content as defined by the FCC at $500,000 an utterance, not to exceed $3 million in a 24-hour period; and 5) Give local broadcasters reasonable opportunity to review all recorded or scripted programming in advance so they can reject it if they feel it is too excessively violent or sexual. 
   "If our broadcasters are not willing to voluntarily protect our children, then it is the responsibility of Congress to step in," Sen. Hutchison added. "Broadcasters do not have a constitutional right to flood the airwaves with excessive violence and sex."
