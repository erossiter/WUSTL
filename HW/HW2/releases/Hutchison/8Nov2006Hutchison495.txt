SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on the announcement that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld will step down and former CIA Director Robert Gates has been selected as his successor: 
   "Secretary Rumsfeld leaves behind a long and distinguished career serving our nation during critical times. I thank him for his service and look forward to working with Bob Gates, whom I have spoken with today, during the confirmation process. I have had the opportunity to work with Bob during his tenure as President of Texas A&M University and believe he is an extremely qualified candidate to help lead our troops and nation in the War on Terror."
