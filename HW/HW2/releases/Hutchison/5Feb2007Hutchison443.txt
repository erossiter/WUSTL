SEN. HUTCHISON LAUDS MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS FUNDING LEVELS IN FISCAL YEAR 2008 BUDGET
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today lauded the increased funding levels for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs recommended by President Bush's Fiscal Year 2008 Budget request.  
   "The president's Fiscal Year 2008 budget for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs represents a commitment to meeting the health care needs of our veterans and providing for our active servicemen and women. The 206 percent increase for BRAC will ensure our bases and affected communities can move forward with the implementation of the BRAC recommendations," Sen. Hutchison said. "While I applaud this substantial increase, I intend to look at every option in the Senate to restore the BRAC funds not included in the Continuing Resolution passed by the Democrats in House when it is called up for consideration in the Senate."
   The Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Budget request includes:
   * $21.2 billion for Military Construction (including Military Construction, Family Housing and BRAC), a 61.4 percent increase** 
   * $8.4 billion for BRAC, a 206.2 percent increase**
   * $83.9 billion for Veterans Affairs, a 7.74 percent increase** 
   ** (Assumes FY 2007 CR in its current form)
