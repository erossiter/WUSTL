SURVEY FOCUSES ON IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE NATION, CONCENTRATES ON HOMELAND SECURITY
  Earlier this month, Chechen separatists carried out a gruesome attack on a Russian school, killing hundreds of children, teachers and parents. The episode was a particularly stark reminder of the despicable tactics terrorists of all stripes will use to advance their causes. That assault, and the recent third anniversary of the September 11th strikes on our soil, underscores the continuing vigilance we must show to protect our homeland. 
   This survey, the last of three focusing on important issues facing our nation, concentrates on Homeland Security. I thank you for your participation and look forward to reading your responses.
   Survey Part III - Homeland Security
   1. An estimated 400,000 people travel into the United States on a daily basis through our state's 11 border crossings. While our close proximity to Mexico has enriched us culturally and economically, the border also presents a security challenge. Under the recently adopted United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program, Canadian tourists can visit up to six months but a Mexican tourist on the same visa can only stay for one month. Many Texans are concerned this will negatively affect the state's economy by keeping foreign tourists from visiting. In your opinion, what is the best way to apply US-VISIT to the U.S.-Mexican border? 
   * Allow Mexican nationals to stay for 30 days on a visa, as allowed by present policy
   * Allow Mexican nationals to stay for 6 months, the same length for Canadian nationals under the US-VISIT program

   2. Since the attacks of September 11th, Congress has approved critical legislation I co-authored to improve aviation security, from enhancing baggage and passenger screening to expanding the air marshals program. We know there is more to accomplish. Which issue should be our next priority in transportation safety measures? (Choose all that apply) 
    * Expand the registered traveler program to airports nationwide, allowing frequent flyers to volunteer personal information in exchange for access to shorter security lines
   * Implement a computer database administered by federal security officials to check airline passengers' names against terrorist watch lists
   * Apply the same security standards to air cargo shipped on commercial airlines already in place for passengers and baggage
   * Overhauling security procedures for passenger train travel

   3. Since 2001, funding for homeland security efforts has nearly tripled. Budgets have increased for everything from aviation and port security to vaccinations and fire fighters. What further changes would you like to see in homeland security appropriations? (Choose all that apply) 
    * Better train and prepare first responders at the local level
   * Change the distribution formula to allocate a larger share of federal resources to states and cities facing a greater terrorist threat
   * Keep current spending levels; they are sufficient
   Additional Comments: 
   4. Following September 11th, Congress created the Homeland Security Department to address national security deficiencies and for the first time tasking a single government entity with defending U.S. soil. What do you believe should be our next top priority in improving our homeland security?
    * Tightening security at national borders
   * Upgrading screening of cargo on airplanes
   * Addressing weaknesses in port security
