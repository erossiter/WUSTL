SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON SECURITY FUNDING ELIGIBILITY FOR EL PASO
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today released the following statement on El Paso's new eligibility for homeland security funding: 
   "It is imperative to our homeland security efforts that we direct our resources to areas of greatest risk of terrorist threats," Sen. Hutchison said. "The El Paso community will now have new eligibility for funding to meet its specific security needs and improve the security of the community and our nation."
   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced today that the city of El Paso is now eligible to apply for Urban Areas Security Initiative program funding. The news comes as DHS opens its application period for the 2007 homeland security grants.
