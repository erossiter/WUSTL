SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION HONORING FORMER PRESIDENT JOHNSON
  Texas' senior Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, today announced passage of legislation that names the U.S. Department of Education building in Washington, D.C. after Lyndon Baines Johnson, the nation's 36th president and proud Texan. 
   "As a lifelong Texan, it gives me great pride to lead this effort on behalf of the first president to be elected from the great state of Texas. It would be a fitting honor for this small town Texas teacher who went on to become our "Education President," Sen. Hutchison said. "President Johnson signed a combined total of over 60 education bills. His commitment to education continued after office by teaching students while he wrote his memoirs." 
   The legislation was approved by the House of Representatives by a voice vote on March 6th. Sen. Hutchison ushered through final passage of the bill in the Senate which was approved by unanimous consent. The bill will now go to President Bush to be signed into law.
