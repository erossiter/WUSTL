SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES PLAN TO CUT OIL PRODUCTION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement on today's announcement that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may reduce oil production levels by one million barrels per day:  
   "The OPEC cartel's recent announcement underscores the urgent need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fully explore and develop domestic energy sources. I am proud to have co-sponsored the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which will make a potential 1.2 billion barrels of oil and over 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas available to consumers. Untapped resources in Alaska also hold vast reserves. In addition, alternative fuels such as BioDiesel and ethanol hold great promise for American energy independence, and I support their increased production and use. Opponents of our efforts to increase our domestic energy supplies continue to empower OPEC while jeopardizing our economic and national security."
