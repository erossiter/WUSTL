SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES AGAINST IMMIGRATION BILL, URGES NEW EFFORT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today voted against S. 1639, the immigration reform bill, in a cloture vote to end debate, which failed 46-53. 
   "I am disappointed that the Senate produced an immigration bill that I could not support," said Sen. Hutchison. "From the beginning I worked for a comprehensive immigration reform which secures the border and creates a workable temporary worker program without amnesty. But the Senate chose to rush a deeply flawed bill in a closed process, which I cannot support. Now, I believe we must start fresh and demonstrate to the American people that we can secure the border and create a sensible temporary worker program to supply the needs of our economy in an orderly way."
   On Wednesday, Sen. Hutchison offered an amendment to require adult illegal immigrants to return home within two years to apply for legal re-entry, but that amendment was defeated 53-45.
