SEN. HUTCHISON PHONE RECORD PROTECTION BILL MOVES FORWARD IN SENATE
  The Protecting Consumer Phone Records Act, a bill cosponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, was passed by the full committee today and is ready for a vote by the full Senate. 
   "Confidential phone records are easily being sold on websites for very small fees. It is private property and a privacy violation that, in the wrong hands, can threaten a person's safety," Sen. Hutchison said. "Making it illegal to buy and sell this personal information will give consumers the protection they deserve and expect. Americans' phone records should be private and protected like their medical records." 
   The bill, S.2389, would make it illegal to acquire, use, sell or solicit a person's confidential phone records without that person's consent. Sale of the personal records could result in identity theft and can place law enforcement personnel and public officials in danger by enabling criminals and terrorists to buy such information.
   The bill would also provide the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission with strengthened enforcement authority to ensure that confidential phone records are not accessible to impersonators seeking to obtain the information. The bill provisions cover wireless, wireline and IP telephone services.
   Following today's approval by the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, the bill will now be sent for a vote by the full Senate.
