SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION IN SCHOOL SAFETY GRANTS
  Texas's senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) awarded over $1 million in grants to Texas schools and law enforcement agencies through the COPS Secure Our Schools program. 
   "There is perhaps no more important place to keep safe than our schools," Sen. Hutchison said. "These grants will provide our school districts and law enforcement agencies the funding they need to ensure our children's schools remain safe."
   The following organizations will receive funding:
   ORGANIZATION - FUNDING 
   Johnson County Sheriff's Department - $210,150 
   Corpus Christi Independent School District - $201,065 
   Sulphur Springs ISD Police Department - $194,701 
   DeSoto Police Department - $157,500 
   City of El Paso - $116,445 
   San Benito Independent School District - $60,611 
   City of Jacksboro - $59,955 
   El Paso ISD Police Services - $37,680 
   TOTAL $1,038,107 
   According to DOJ, the Secure Our Schools program provides support to improve security at schools and on school grounds by funding up to 50 percent of the total cost for municipalities to install metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other equipment to help deter crime. The grants can also be used to pay half of the cost of security assessments, security training, and other measures that will provide a significant improvement in security.
