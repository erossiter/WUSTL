SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN RECOMMEND BECKY GREGORY FOR U.S. ATTORNEY FOR EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and John Cornyn (R-TX) today recommended that President Bush nominate Rebecca Ann Gregory to be U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas. 
   "We are pleased to recommend Becky Gregory to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District," said Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn. "We know Becky will serve our nation with honor and we are proud to recommend her to President Bush."
   Becky Gregory has served most of her career in the U.S. Attorney's office, including roles in the appellate, civil, and criminal sections, and she served as First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas from 2002-2005. In 2005, Gregory was appointed to the 283rd Judicial District Court in Dallas, where she presided over felony criminal cases. In 2007, she joined the law firm of Curran, Tomko, and Tarski.
   "Becky has considerable experience in the U.S. Attorney's Office and in the Eastern District of Texas, which will allow her to begin in this role and immediately show results," said Sen. Hutchison. "I am confident she meets the high standards of a U.S. Attorney and she will do an excellent job for the United States and the people of Texas."
   "Becky has made public service her life's work. Her extensive experience in federal law enforcement will benefit the residents of the Eastern District and the State of Texas," said Sen. Cornyn. "I look forward to helping see her confirmed by the Senate."
   The senators' recommendation will be delivered to President Bush for his consideration and the nominee must be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate.
