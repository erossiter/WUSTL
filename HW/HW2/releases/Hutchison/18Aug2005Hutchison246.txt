SEN. HUTCHISON CELEBRATES OPENING OF CHINESE COMMUNITY CENTER IN HOUSTON
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today celebrated the grand opening of the Chinese Community Center in Houston. Sen.  
 Hutchison cut the ribbon officially christening the Center's new location and toured the facility. Sen. Hutchison helped secure $300,000 in the Fiscal Year 2004 appropriations for capital improvements. 
   "The Chinese Community Center and its staff serve as wonderful ambassadors to the community and beyond. It offers adult education that provides GEDs, computer classes and job training," Sen. Hutchison said. "This newly renovated facility will help serve the needs of many Houstonians." 
   Established in 1979 as a Chinese Language School, the Chinese Community Center is a nonprofit social services organization. It has grown significantly as Houston's flourishing Asian and Pacific Islander population has increased. The facility includes a new playground, children's library, gymnasium, community room for meetings and events and an adult day center for Asian Senior Coalition members. 
   "This center is emblematic of the Asian Pacific American community in Southeast Texas. They are making advancements in every field of endeavor and enriching the cultural spectrum of Houston," Sen. Hutchison said. "Asian Americans have been making a contribution to our great nation for years and are helping build a better America today." 
   The Center collaborates with other agencies and faith-based organizations to provide a variety of social programs to the Asian, minority and immigrant community living in Southwest Houston and Fort Bend County. The Center receives funding and support from individuals, public and private sector sources and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast.
