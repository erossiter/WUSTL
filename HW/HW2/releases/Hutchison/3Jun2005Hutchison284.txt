SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN URGE SECRETARY RUMSFELD TO FULLY RELEASE BRAC DATA
  Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn today sent Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld the following letter urging him to fully and completely release data on how the department determined which bases were to be added to the Base Realignment and Closure list.  
 The letter follows:
   June 3, 2005
   The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld
  Secretary of Defense
  The Pentagon
  Washington, DC 20301-4000
   Dear Secretary Rumsfeld:
   Members of Congress were informed this week that critical information underlying the Department's Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) recommendations would now be available to Members of Congress and staffers with a SECRET clearance only. A "reading room" has been set up in the Washington, DC metropolitan area that allows the data to be viewed, but any classified information cannot be recorded or taken out of the room. This is of no value to us or the people we represent in the affected communities. This is not consistent with Congressional intent to maintain a transparent BRAC process.
   The BRAC law requires the Pentagon to turn over within seven days of its May 13 announcement of the BRAC decisions "all information used by the secretary in making the recommendations." Communities were promised an open and honest dialogue with full and unfettered access to all of the data. 
   Chairman Principi has already postponed one regional hearing because of a lack of data. The process continues to be jeopardized as long as the information is not available. We urge you to make all of the data available.
   Sincerely,
   Kay Bailey Hutchison 
   John Cornyn
