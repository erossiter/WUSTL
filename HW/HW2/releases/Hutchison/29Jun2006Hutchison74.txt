SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON SUPREME COURT RULING ON HAMDAN CASE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today released the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Hamdan case: 
   "Terrorists and enemy combatants who are responsible for the September 11 attacks and the brutal killing of American soldiers should not be tried in civilian courts where they would pose a security threat to American citizens. It is important that Congress take the avenue provided by the Supreme Court for the President to deal with these enemies of America in an appropriate way."
