SEN. HUTCHISON INTRODUCES LEGISLATION ADDRESSING WATER CONCERNS IN TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today introduced two bills - The Weather Modification Act and the Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Resources Conservation Improvement Act -, that are key pieces of legislation aimed at advancing Texas' statewide efforts to address water concerns. 
   "Conservation is a proven and effective strategy to ensure a reliable water supply is available for the long term," Sen. Hutchison said. "While some parts of the country can take this critical natural resource for granted, I remain focused on finding new and proven conservation methods so Texans can rely on a lasting water supply."
   The Weather Modification Act will encourage use of scientific advances to produce additional rainfall while the Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Resources Conservation Improvement Act authorizes $42.3 million in conservation funding for 19 irrigation districts in South Texas.
   The new legislation introduced today advances Sen. Hutchison's commitment to address water concerns in the state and reflects her overall strategy to address particular needs in Texas, where water is increasingly becoming a finite resource. Over the past three years, Sen. Hutchison has secured over $7.6 million for water conservation in South Texas.
