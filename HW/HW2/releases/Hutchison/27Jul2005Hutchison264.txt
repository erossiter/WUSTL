SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $22 MILLION AWARDED TO GOVERNOR'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIVISION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced the Texas Office of the Governor's Criminal Justice Division (CJD) will receive a $22,740,822 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to reduce drug use, trafficking and other crimes resulting from illegal drugs.  
   "The efforts of the Criminal Justice Division serve as a beacon for crime prevention and drug enforcement," said Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "Less crime means safer neighborhoods and communities in Texas." 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) is intended to assist state and local governments in a range of activities to prevent and control crime according to their needs and conditions. The CJD acts as the designated Texas JAG program.
