SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF PERMANENT REPEAL OF DEATH TAX
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of permanent repeal of the Death Tax. Her remarks are listed below: 
   "The Death Tax has been breaking up family farms and ranches all over this country for years. In fact, America has the highest death tax in the world. We say we are a country of small businesses, of family-owned businesses. Entrepreneurs have started with nothing and built something and yet, we do the very thing that hurts those small businesses. 
   "Thirty percent of family businesses today pass to the second generation. Thirteen percent make it to the third generation. The Death Tax walks away from the American dream. The American dream is that you can start with nothing and build something if you work hard and you have a good idea. But the Death Tax walks away from that because it breaks the family business."
