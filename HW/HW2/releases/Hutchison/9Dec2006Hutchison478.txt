CONGRESS APPROVES HISTORIC OFFSHORE DRILLING AGREEMENT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that Congress has passed a bipartisan agreement forged by the Gulf State Senators to open over eight million new acres for oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. The legislation will now be sent to President Bush to be signed into law. 
   "Neglecting our own oil and gas reserves has only increased our dependence on foreign sources of energy," Sen. Hutchison said. "Opening this new area to exploration will increase energy domestic supplies, strengthen national security and help consumers with the price of oil and gas." 
   The agreement makes available Lease 181 and the lease area south of 181, which are known to contain more than 1.26 billion barrels of oil, an amount equivalent to 50 percent of current annual domestic production. These areas are additionally expected to provide more than 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, more than six times the amount of liquefied natural gas that the U.S. imports each year and enough fuel to heat and cool 6 million homes for 15 years.
   Through federal royalty sharing, the Gulf Coast states will gain new revenues which will be used to protect important national ecosystems and prepare for unforeseen natural disasters. After 2007, Texas will receive 10 percent of an eligible 37.5 percent of oil production revenues from within Lease 181 and 181-South. Beginning in 2017, Texas will receive between 21 and 28 percent of the eligible 37.5 percent in revenues allocated for new Outer Continental Shelf production outside Lease 181 and 181-South.
