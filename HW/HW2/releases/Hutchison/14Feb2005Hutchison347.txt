SEN. HUTCHISON LAUDS INCREASE IN SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR MILITARY FAMILIES
  Following a Department of Defense request for an $82 billion supplemental package to fund the War on Terror, Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, praised the package which includes a historic increase in military death benefits from $12,000 to $100,000. Life insurance coverage would also increase from $150,000 to $400,000. 
   The funding increases will be retroactive from October, 2001, through January, 2005 for those killed in combat zones. While pleased with this major forward step, Sen. Hutchison stressed her hope the Administration will consider increasing benefits for soldiers who are killed during training as well. 
   "This increase represents significant progress in providing military families the compensation they deserve," said Sen. Hutchison. "I will work to ensure this funding is approved quickly to support our troops as they win this War on Terror. Extending the coverage to military personnel killed during training accidents should be considered as well."
