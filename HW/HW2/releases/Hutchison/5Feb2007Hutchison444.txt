SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS DART FUNDING IN PRESIDENT'S FISCAL YEAR 2008 BUDGET REQUEST
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today applauded the $86.3 million provided for Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) in President Bush's Fiscal Year 2008 Budget request.  
   "DART is integral to transportation in the greater Dallas area and continues to be a model of excellence," Sen. Hutchison said. "This funding will help support expansion of the system into the crucial Northwest/Southeast corridor and open up new options for thousands of commuters."
   In July 2006, Sen. Hutchison helped obtain a $700 million Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) between DART and the Federal Transit Administration of the Department of Transportation. Through her seat on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Sen. Hutchison has previously secured more than $21 million in New Starts funding for the Northwest/Southeast project. DART has consistently come in ahead of schedule and under budget in impact studies and other progress markers.
