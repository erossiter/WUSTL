SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON FOILED TERROR PLOT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement on the foiled terrorist plot to attack international airline flights:
   "Today, our counterparts in the United Kingdom have delivered a victory over terrorists attempting to murder innocent people. This latest plot is a stark reminder that we are engaged in an ongoing War on Terror and must remain vigilant. It is critical that Congress continues to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to disrupt and prevent such terrorist plots."
