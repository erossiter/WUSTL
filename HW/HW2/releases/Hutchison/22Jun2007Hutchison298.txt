SEN. HUTCHISON: RFS MANDATE REQUIRES IMPACT STUDY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, secured language in an energy bill, H.R. 6, which requires the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the impact of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) on the production of feed grains, livestock, pork, poultry, food and energy. Sen. Hutchison's language was included in the bill by unanimous consent. 
   "With this change, the federal government would be required to examine the impact this federal mandate will have on the prices of food that American families put on their dinner table every day," said Sen. Hutchison. "The increased use of renewable fuels is an admirable goal, but the heavy reliance on corn-based ethanol is creating a ripple effect of reduced supplies and increased prices for the food we eat. This study will ensure safety measures are in place to guide what I expect will be needed adjustments in the RFS to deal with the realities of a lack of sufficient feedstock sources for ethanol."
   Sen. Hutchison's legislation requires the input of producers of feed grains, livestock, poultry and pork products, energy, individuals and entities interested in issues relating to conservation, and the environment.
   "Despite progress on this point, I had no choice but to vote against the energy bill because it would do nothing to reduce prices at the pump," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am committed to improving this bill in conference and securing this language in the conference report."
   The overall Energy bill passed the Senate by a vote of 65 to 27.
