SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH EL PASO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  Texas' senior Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, today met with members of the El Paso Chamber of Commerce in her Washington, D.C. office. The group met to discuss local issues affecting the El Paso community. 
   "El Paso is an essential military community, trade hub and transportation nexus," Sen. Hutchison said. "Hearing directly about the issues and concerns confronting their community helps me address those issues here in Washington."
   Sen. Hutchison is working to restore $3.1 billion in funding for facilities for our troops and their families that was cut from the recently passed continuing appropriations resolution. The cuts will affect bases across the country, including Fort Bliss in El Paso. During floor debate on the resolution, Sen. Hutchison argued that cuts would delay the return of over 10,000 troops currently stationed at foreign bases. She introduced an amendment to restore the funding, but Senate Democrats refused to bring her amendment to the floor for a vote.
