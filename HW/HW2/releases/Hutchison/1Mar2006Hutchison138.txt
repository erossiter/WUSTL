SEN. HUTCHISON DISCUSSES PORT SECURITY WITH TEXAS PORT OFFICIALS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today met with Texas port officials to discuss the port security legislation she introduced, the Shipping Container Security Act, and the critical need for new initiatives at home and abroad to secure our ports. 
   "Texas is home to 29 ports including the Port of Houston which is in close proximity to a major chemical facility. Our ports cannot continue to be a weakness in our homeland security efforts," Sen. Hutchison said. "Passage of the Maritime Transportation Security Act in 2002 was a first step in port security. I have urged Sen. Frist to take action on my Shipping Container Security Act which will help us secure cargo before it leaves foreign ports and will also expand our inspection and tracking capability here in the U.S. until it reaches its destination."
   Sen. Hutchison sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) on February 24, 2006 urging him to hold a vote on her Shipping Container Security Act, S. 376, following the debate over a United Arab Emirates company planning to take over operations of several major U.S. ports.
   Key provisions of Sen. Hutchison's legislation include requiring all foreign countries shipping goods to the U.S. to grant access to U.S. inspectors so that containers headed to the U.S. are able to be inspected at their port of origin; developing and implementing a comprehensive plan to increase the number of containers inspected as they enter the U.S.; and monitoring the transport of cargo within the U.S. until it reached its final destination.
   Officials from the Port of Beaumont, Port of Houston, Port of Freeport, Port of Brownsville, Port of Galveston and the Port of Corpus Christi were present at the meeting. U.S. Army Corp of Engineers funding was also discussed.
