SEN. HUTCHISON RECEIVES NATIONAL GUARD AWARD
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, today received a 2006 Charles Dick Medal of Merit from the National Guard Association of Texas. She is the only U.S. Senator to receive this award for 2006. 
   "The men and women of our National Guard stand in harm's way, at home and abroad, to safeguard our way of life," said Sen. Hutchison. "I am honored to receive this award and proud to support their heroic efforts."
   The National Guard Association of Texas is comprised of current and former National Guard members in Texas. The Charles Dick Medal of Merit was established in 1988 to recognize the contributions made to the National Guard by elected representatives at the state and national levels. The medal is named in honor of Major General Charles Dick, president of the National Guard Association of the United States from 1902 to 1909 and a U.S. Senator from Ohio. Major Gen. Dick was responsible for the passage of the Dick Acts of 1903 and 1908 that established the foundation of the modern National Guard.
