  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, tonight made the following comments in response to President Bush's address to the nation on Iraq. 
   "The President tonight outlined a new strategy to achieve our objectives in Iraq. We must not allow Iraq to become a safe haven for terrorists who seek to harm America. He is working with the Iraqi leadership to implement this new approach and it is critical that the initiative be given a chance to succeed. I respect the President for admitting mistakes, correcting the course and recognizing that our nation's security is strengthened by defeating terrorists in Iraq."
