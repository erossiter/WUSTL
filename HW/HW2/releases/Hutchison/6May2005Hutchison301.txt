SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $34,300 FOR TEXAS FOREST SERVICE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced the Texas Forest Service will receive $34,300 for fire prevention programs from the Department of Homeland Security.  
   "Firefighters risk their lives to protect our homes and families. These funds will help ensure Texas Forest Service has the resources to promote fire safety," said Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they provide. For the 2004 program, $750 million was appropriated to give direct assistance to firefighters. The programs aim to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the nation. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   Operations and Firefighter Safety Programs may include public education and awareness activities, fire code enforcement activities, fire inspector certifications and other activities, purchase and installation of smoke alarms and fire suppression systems, wild land/wildfire mitigation and arson prevention and detection activities.
