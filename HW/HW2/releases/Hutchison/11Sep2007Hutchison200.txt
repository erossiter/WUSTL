SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES NEARLY $4 MILLION GRANT FOR WACO TRANSIT
  Texas's senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded a $3,887,113 grant to the City of Waco Transit system for the purchase of 13 ultra low sulfur, low floor buses. 
   "This grant will help modernize Waco's transit system with more environmentally friendly and more accessible vehicles," Sen. Hutchison said.
   The grant was awarded from DOT's Federal Transit Administration. According to DOT, these buses will replace the majority of the current fleet containing mostly 15 year old buses, some having as many as 500,000 miles. The new buses will provide passengers with access to low floor buses that comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
