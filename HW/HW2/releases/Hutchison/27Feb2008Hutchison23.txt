SEN. HUTCHISON NAMED CHAIRMAN OF BOARD OF VISITORS AT WEST POINT
  Today U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) was elected Chairman of the Board of Visitors (BOV) at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Sen. Hutchison was nominated to be Chairman by U.S. Rep John McHugh (R-NY), the outgoing BOV Chairman. 
   "I am honored to serve as Chairman of the Board of Visitors at West Point," said Sen. Hutchison. "For more than two centuries the Academy has been one of our nation's finest institutions, developing cadets for the challenge of national service. I look forward to working with the Board's members over the next year to continue their standard of excellence at West Point."
   "I am gratified that the Board recognized the dedication and achievements of Senator Hutchison in unanimously accepting her nomination," said Rep. McHugh. "She has clearly demonstrated by her past service that she will provide the dedication of duty and sound judgment that the Board needs at this critical time."
   Created by the Federal Advisory Act of 1972, the BOV meets quarterly to review and receive updates on the academic, physical and military programs at the Academy. Specifically, the BOV has oversight of the Academy's morale and discipline, curriculum, instructions, physical equipment, fiscal affairs and academic methods. The board consists of presidential appointees and members of Congress.
   Sen. Hutchison previously served as Chairman of the BOV from 1998-2000.
   Sen. Hutchison is the Ranking Member of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee and a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
