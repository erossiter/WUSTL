SEN. HUTCHISON CELEBRATES ANNUAL TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY TRADITION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today continued the annual Texas Independence Day tradition of reading a letter from Colonel William Barret Travis on the U.S. Senate floor.  
   Colonel William Travis, commander of the besieged Alamo, wrote the letter to the people of Texas during the fight for Independence. The tradition of reading this letter to the United States Senate on Texas Independence Day began with the late John G. Tower who served in the Senate between 1961 and 1985.
   "Mr. President, 169 years ago, a solemn convention of 54 men in a small Texas settlement took a momentous step which had a tremendous impact not only on Texas, but on the future of the United States," said Sen. Hutchison as she introduced Col. Travis' letter. "This is a reminder to all of us of the pride Texans share in our history and in being the only state that came into the Union as a republic." The letter follows:
   "Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged with a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly over the wall. I shall never surrender or retreat.
  Then I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, of everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due his honor and that of his country-Victory or Death.
   -William Barret Travis, Lt. Col. Commander. "
