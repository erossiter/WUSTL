SEN. HUTCHISON PROTECTS AMERICAN, CONTINENTAL PENSIONS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured language in the supplemental appropriations bill approved today by Congress providing equitable pension relief to airlines. 
   "The airline pension relief approved by Congress today will ensure that Texas carriers receive comparable treatment," Sen. Hutchison said. "The language I helped secure is the same language I introduced on the first day of the 110th Congress. Allowing all of the passenger carriers to operate on a level playing field was one of my top priorities and I am pleased Congress approved this measure."
   Sen. Hutchison introduced the legislation on January 4, the first day of the 110th Congress to address the inequity in the pension reforms passed by Congress in 2006. In that legislation, some carriers received preferential treatment for their pensions but Texas carriers did not. Today's provision reestablishes a level playing field for all carriers. The measure next goes to the president to be signed into law.
