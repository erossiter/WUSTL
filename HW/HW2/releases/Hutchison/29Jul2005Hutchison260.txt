REP. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $1.5 BILLION TO KEEP AMERICA'S PROMISE TO ITS VETERANS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, today announced the Senate passed legislation providing $1.5 billion for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that can be drawn upon immediately.  
 The funding was included in an amendment that passed as part of the Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations Bill. 
   Sen. Hutchison helped coordinate an agreement with the White House to provide $1.5 billion for the VA. The amendment she authored with Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) makes up for the VA's recently announced budget shortfall. 
   "The terror attacks in London and heightened security at home remind us of the sacrifices our soldiers are making to protect our freedom. We must assure our soldiers that they will not be short-changed when they return home," Sen. Hutchison said. "As Chairman, I want to recognize all my colleagues who worked with a bipartisan goal in mind of fulfilling our obligations to those who have sacrificed so much." 
   The legislation was created following a mid-year review of the VA's budget which concluded the department will be approximately $1 billion short in 2006. The legislation amends the Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill to provide an additional $1.5 billion to the VA. The VA will have the flexibility to use the funding to help it meet it's most critical needs.
