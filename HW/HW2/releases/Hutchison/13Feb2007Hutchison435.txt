SEN. HUTCHISON COSPONSORS AIR CARGO SECURITY BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation cosponsored the Air Cargo Security Bill, S. 509, which was reported out of committee today. 
   "The Transportation Security Administration has improved aviation security by intensifying passenger and luggage screening, yet adequate measures have not been taken to secure air cargo," said Sen. Hutchison. "This legislation further strengthens TSA's ability to reduce potential threats to our national security."
   The Air Cargo Security Bill will improve aviation safety by:
   * Establishing a system, within three years, to screen all cargo transported on passenger aircraft; 
   * Requiring TSA to develop and implement a threat and vulnerability assessment program for all general aviation airports; and 
   * Requiring TSA to study the feasibility of a grant program to assist general aviation airports with necessary security upgrades. 
   Sen. Hutchison, one of the principal authors of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), has consistently championed measures for greater air cargo security.
