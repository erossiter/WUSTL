SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $80 MILLION GRANT FOR DALLAS AREA RAPID TRANSIT
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) will award $80 million to Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) for construction of a 21-mile, two-segment extension of its light rail transit (LRT) system. 
   "DART is essential to Dallas' continued growth and development and this grant will help DART expand rail service," Sen. Hutchison said. "DART is a model transit agency and this federal funding is a further testament to its success."
   Sen. Hutchison wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters in support of the grant on March 5, 2007.
   In July 2006, Sen. Hutchison helped obtain a $700 million Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) between DART and the FTA for the Green Line. The first $80 million installment of that funding was provided this year. An additional $9 million in funding for the Red Line was announced in May. DART has consistently come in ahead of schedule and under budget in impact studies and other progress markers.
