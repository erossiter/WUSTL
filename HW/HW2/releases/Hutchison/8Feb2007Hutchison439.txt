SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH TEXAS AGRICULTURE LEADERS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today met with representatives of the Southwest Council of Agribusiness to discuss the reauthorization of the Farm Bill and other issues of critical importance to Texas farmers and ranchers. 
   "Agriculture is integral to our Texas economy and our way of life," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am always pleased to meet with leaders of the agricultural community to learn how we can help their industry continue to meet the nation's food and fiber needs." 
   The Southwest Council of Agribusiness is an alliance of agricultural organizations, financial institutions, and businesses located in the southwestern region of the U.S. who work together to further the goals of farmers and ranchers.
