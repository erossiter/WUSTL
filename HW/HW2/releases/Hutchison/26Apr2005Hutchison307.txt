SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today released the following statement on Social Security reform. Sen.  
 Hutchison was unable to be with President Bush today in Galveston, Texas, because of votes in the Senate. Her statement follows: 
   "President Bush has shown tremendous leadership in taking on Social Security reform. He understands that partisan politics should take a back seat to saving Social Security. 
   "We are facing a crisis in our Social Security system. I have long supported reform that includes personal accounts and the ability of young people to voluntarily invest a part of their taxes. 
   "I will not support any payroll tax increase of any kind. And I will lead the fight against proposals to balance the system off the backs of hard-working Americans. 
   "While we must always keep our promise to our seniors, we must never do so at the expense of hard-working Americans trying to save money and raise families. We must find a way to keep the system strong while not punishing current workers with higher taxes."
