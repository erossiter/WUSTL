SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNS BILL TO REPEAL WRIGHT AMENDMENT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison announced today that President George W. Bush has signed into law S. 3661, the Wright Amendment Reform Act of 2006, legislation that she introduced to repeal the Wright amendment. 
   "Now that the Wright amendment repeal legislation has become law, through-ticketing from Love Field can be implemented immediately. It has been a long process but North Texas consumers will benefit from more competition and significantly reduced airfares."
   The legislation introduced by Sen. Hutchison relaxes restraints on flights to and from Love Field and repeals remaining provisions of the Wright amendment eight years after the date of enactment.
