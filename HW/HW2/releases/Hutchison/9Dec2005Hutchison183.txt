SEN. HUTCHISON ADDRESSES TRINITY RIVER BRIDGE GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today delivered remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. Sen.  
 Hutchison secured $8 million for the first major signature bridge to be constructed across the Trinity River Corridor in the Fiscal Year 2002 Transportation Appropriations bill.
   "The vision of the Trinity River Corridor will transform and improve the Dallas landscape with a clear focal point centered around the river, park and recreational facilities," Sen. Hutchison said. "Securing resources for this downtown revitalization project has been one of my highest priorities to improve safety and ease congestion for workers, visitors and residents in the Dallas area." 
   Sen. Hutchison has been a leading advocate of the extensive downtown improvement project, securing nearly $60 million in funding for the Trinity River Corridor during her tenure in the U.S. Senate. In addition, she helped secure $65.8 million in federal transportation funding to fully fund the second of three I-30 bridges designed by architect Santiago Calatrava in the Surface Transportation reauthorization bill which was signed into law in August, 2005. She plans to pursue additional resources for the project through her seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
