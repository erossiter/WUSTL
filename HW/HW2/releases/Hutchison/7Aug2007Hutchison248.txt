SEN. HUTCHISON AWARDS PURPLE HEART TO IRAQ VETERAN AT BROOKE ARMY MEDICAL CENTER
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) awarded Private First Class (PFC) Sonny Weldon with a Purple Heart today at the Center for the Intrepid near Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) in San Antonio. Brig. Gen. James K. Gillman, Commander of BAMC, presided over the ceremony. 
   According to the military award citation, on March 14, 2007 while on patrol in Baghdad, Iraq, PFC Weldon's unit engaged in small arms fire with the enemy. His humvee performed evasive maneuvers which detonated a buried 82mm mortar round, leaving him unconscious and not breathing when he was found at the scene. His combat medic performed life-saving measures and saved his life, but the incident caused PFC Weldon to suffer the herniation of his cervical vertebrae (C-5, C-6, C-7), from which he is currently recovering.
   "It's an honor for me to present the Purple Heart to PFC Sonny Weldon for his bravery in defense of America and for the cause of freedom," said Sen. Hutchison. "Private First Class Weldon represents that best of his generation and we can all take inspiration from the dedication and service of soldiers like PFC Weldon."
   PFC Weldon is a native of Tomball, TX.
   Sen. Hutchison is a member of the Senate Republican Leadership as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and is the Ranking Member of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee.
