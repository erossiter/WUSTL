SEN. HUTCHISON, REP. PENCE IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL GAINS SUPPORT
  The Texas Association of Mexican-American Chambers of Commerce (TAMACC) has joined a growing list of organizations and coalition groups lining up to support the border security and immigration reform proposal introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN). 
   "There is no doubt; the Hutchison-Pence proposal is the last best hope our nation has to enact meaningful immigration reform this year," TAMACC wrote in a September 15 letter. "We feel strongly that our economic prosperity is directly linked to our national security and as such are pleased that the Hutchison-Pence proposal, as we have suggested, effectively addresses border security between the U.S. and Mexico, our coast lines, ports of entry, and our Northern land borders with Canada."
   The American Farm Bureau Federation last week released a statement of support for the Hutchison-Pence initiative hailing it as "a distinguished effort to hammer out a workable solution."
