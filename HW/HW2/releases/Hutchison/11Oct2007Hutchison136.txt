SEN. HUTCHISON TOURS UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH CENTER AT TYLER
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today toured the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler (UTHCT) to receive an update on the new research and training programs being performed by the Health Center. 
    "The history and future of UTHCT is as a major national resource in the research and treatment of chest diseases and related conditions," Sen. Hutchison said. "The amount of federal support UTHCT receives for research is a testament to the quality of work done here, and I will keep working in Congress to ensure it continues to have support."
   Sen. Hutchison was led on the tour by UTHCT President Dr. Kirk Calhoun and UTHCT Director for University and Community Affairs Kimberly Ashley.
   Sen. Hutchison secured $200,000 in the Fiscal Year 2003 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill for the Ambulatory Pediatric Asthma Project at UTHCT. The project, in collaboration with the Southwest Center for Pediatric Environmental Health, created a mobile facility for screening, diagnosis, treatment, and educational outreach to rural, minority and medically underserved populations.
