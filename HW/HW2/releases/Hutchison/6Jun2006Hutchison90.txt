SEN. HUTCHISON SECURES HURRICANE RECOVERY FUNDS FOR TEXAS IN FINAL EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, late tonight announced that emergency funds for areas devastated by Hurricane Rita have been included in the final Emergency Supplemental Conference Report bill.  
   "The hurricane recovery funds I secured for Texas in the Senate bill were based on emergency needs and received strong support from my colleagues in Congress," Sen. Hutchison said. "Hurricane Rita didn't discriminate along state lines and neither should the federal government. It is only fair that East Texas communities receive the same reimbursement rate as Louisiana parishes directly across the river recovering from the same hurricane."
   Sen. Hutchison introduced and passed an amendment to the Senate Emergency Supplemental bill which raised the federal reimbursement rate for Hurricane Rita damage claims in Texas to a 90 percent federal, 10 percent state rate. The new reimbursement rate will save Texas counties nearly $200 million. 
   The 23 Texas counties hit by Hurricane Rita still have not recovered. Some were even considering bankruptcy without federal assistance. "Different reimbursement rates would be unfair and I wanted to ensure Texas was treated fairly," Sen. Hutchison continued. 
   In conference negotiations tonight, she also secured $235 million for education costs associated with Hurricane Katrina victims who relocated to Texas. The final legislation will be voted on as early as June 9 and then sent to President Bush to be signed into law.
   "I am pleased the bill includes $235 million to help communities cover the educational costs of welcoming thousands or Hurricane Katrina victims into their schools. This funding will not fully cover their costs but it will provide much needed support."
