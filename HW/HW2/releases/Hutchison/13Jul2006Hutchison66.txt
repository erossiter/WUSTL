SEN. HUTCHISON INTRODUCES WRIGHT AMENDMENT LEGISLATION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced legislation to implement the agreement reached in June to repeal the Wright amendment. She was joined by members of the North Texas Congressional Delegation in making the announcement. 
   "Key members of Congress asked the local leaders to present a plan to solve the Wright amendment issue in a way that benefits all of Texas. They did exactly that. I commend the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and DFW on reaching a compromise agreement to repeal the long-standing dispute over the Wright amendment. My bill will repeal the Wright amendment over eight years and achieve a balance between Love Field and the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport with a significant benefit to consumers. 
   "The agreement upon which this legislation is based represents a commitment by local officials and members of the Texas delegation to work together in the best interest of the Dallas and Fort Worth communities and the state of Texas. I am proud to introduce this legislation today and will continue to work with my House colleagues as it works its way toward enactment."
   Key points of Senator Hutchison's legislation are detailed below:
   * Relaxing restraints on flights to and from Love Field: The Wright amendment is modified to allow air carriers to immediately provide ticketing from Love Field to any U.S. or foreign destination through any other point in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Alabama. 
   * Repeal of Wright amendment: The remaining provisions of the Wright amendment will be repealed eight years after the date of enactment. 
   * The 20 gate cap will be enacted as agreed with consideration for the noise, environment, traffic, and safety of residents, schools, and businesses in the area around Love Field. 
   * Treatment of international non-stop flights to and from Love Field: As under current policy, non-stop international flights may not arrive or depart from Love Field. 
   * Charter flights at Love Field: Charter flights at Love Field will not be affected and will continue to hold all current rights and privileges. 
   * Applicability: The legislation will specify that it will apply only to Love Field.
