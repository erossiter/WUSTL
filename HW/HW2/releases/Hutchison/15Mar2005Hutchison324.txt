SEN. HUTCHISON TO CHAIR FIRST APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON VETERANS AFFAIRS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today will chair her first Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs hearing at 2:30 p.m. in 138 Dirksen Senate Office Building.  
 The focus of Sen. Hutchison's first hearing is the Department of Veterans Affairs' budget and Dept. Sec. Jim Nicholson will be testifying.
   "Today's hearing is just the beginning of my fight to keep Congress' promise to our veterans," Sen. Hutchison said. "Veterans have risked their lives for our country. While we can never fully repay them, we can do everything possible to fulfill our commitments."
   A recent realignment of the Senate Appropriations Committee reduced the number of subcommittees from 13 to 12. The new structuring plan eliminated the old VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee and spread those responsibilities to other, existing subcommittees. Veterans Affairs was added to Sen. Hutchison's existing Military Construction Subcommittee. 
   "Properly funding the Dept. of Veterans Affairs will be especially difficult in this belt-tightening year," Sen. Hutchison added. "While the task may be difficult, it is absolutely necessary, and I look forward to working with Sec. Nicholson to make it a reality."
