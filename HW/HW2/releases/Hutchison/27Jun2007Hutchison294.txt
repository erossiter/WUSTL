SEN. HUTCHISON INTRODUCES 'RETURN HOME' AMENDMENT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today introduced an amendment to S. 1639, the immigration reform bill, that would require adult illegal immigrants to return home to apply for legal re-entry. The amendment is expected to be debated today. 
   The Hutchison amendment applies to "Z-1" (head of household) and "Z-2" (spouse) visa holders and would require them to return home within two years of receiving their Secure ID. Children, "Z-3" visa holders, would be exempt from this requirement.
   "My amendment seeks to require illegal immigrant workers to return home before they can achieve permanent legal status," said Sen. Hutchison. "If they came here illegally in the first place, the only way they can legally re-enter is from outside the country, just like those waiting in line now."
   "Z" visa holders would be required to make an appointment at a consular office outside the United States to get their final approval to hold the renewable "Z" visa.
   If a "Z" visa card holder does not return home within two years, the Hutchison amendment would disqualify the individual's application and the individual would be subject to deportation.
