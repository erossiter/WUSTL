SEN. HUTCHISON PASSES AMENDMENT FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT EDUCATION FUNDING
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today co-sponsored an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Labor Health And Human Services Appropriations bill which adds an additional $7 million to the Advanced Placement (AP) program.  
 The amendment was agreed to unanimously and the bill it amended is expected to pass the Senate later today. 
   "We must do more to expand the Advanced Placement Program that has a proven track record of success for our students," Sen. Hutchison said. "This funding will help strengthen the program and give more students access to the college-level courses which set the standard for academic achievement."
   Sen. Hutchison helped start federal funding for this program. In 1998 it was funded at $3 million and Sen. Hutchison's amendment will bring the total funding to $40 million. 
   The AP Program is a vitally important educational tool which allows students to pursue college-level studies while still in high school. The funding will be used to expand the program through teacher training and participation and help make classes and tests affordable for all students.
   The college-level curriculum gives students the chance to earn college credit, advanced placement or both. Research has shown that participation in AP courses helps students graduate on time from college, which is a significant financial consideration, with the rising cost of public and private universities. 
   A U.S. Department of Education Study concluded participation in AP courses is a stronger predictor of success in college than test scores or grade point average. Sen. Hutchison co-sponsored the amendment with Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).
   After Senate passage today the bill must be reconciled with the House and signed into law by President George W. Bush.
