SEN. HUTCHISON TO OFFER VISA AMENDMENT TO IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, will offer a SAFE Visa amendment to the immigration bill. The amendment will allow a temporary worker program with no pathway to citizenship. It would be an option for those who do not want to become American citizens, but do want to keep their ties to their country of origin. A vote on Sen. Hutchison's amendment is expected early this week.  
   The SAFE (Secure Authorized Foreign Employee) Visa plan is based on an existing and successful Mexican/Canadian program established in 1974. Unlike the Canadian version - which is limited to agriculture workers from Mexico - the SAFE Visa will include industries such as agriculture, service and construction and will involve all of the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR nations. 
   "The SAFE Visa will help meet the economic needs of our country by providing necessary labor resources while not creating a pathway to citizenship," Sen. Hutchison said. 
   Sen. Hutchison's SAFE Visa would create a pilot program between the United States and NAFTA and CAFTA-DR nations that provides legal entry for those who seek work yet does not create a pathway to permanent residence or citizenship in the United States. Implementation of this program would begin within one year of enactment. No application would be accepted from an applicant who is in the United States. 
   How Senator Hutchison's SAFE Visa works:
   * Applications for a SAFE Visa must be made from country of origin;
   * Employer would be responsible for the cost of transportation from the country of origin to the place of employment and return to the country of origin;
   * Program would be structured for a maximum 10-month work period, with the SAFE visa renewable annually after the worker has returned home;
   * Employer would be responsible for collection of all standard payroll deductions:
   - SAFE cardholders would be entitled to receive their portion of Social Security when the card is permanently relinquished; 
   - All Medicare withholding for SAFE cardholders would be used to pay for uncompensated emergency health care provided to non-citizens (will help hospitals burdened with non-payment of bills from illegal aliens); 
   * Workers would be allowed to enter the country with a SAFE Visa issued only after passing a background check, medical exam and producing proof that a job has been secured in the United States. A SAFE Visa would be tamper proof and use biometric (fingerprint) data.
   * SAFE Visas would not create a path towards citizenship: 
   - SAFE cardholders would be required to return to their home countries and relinquish their SAFE Visas before applying for lawful permanent residence or any other visa category; 
   * SAFE Visas would be linked to the U.S. employment rate in occupational classifications and geographic areas, with more visas available during times of low unemployment. The SAFE Visa would terminate if the worker is unemployed for 60 or more consecutive days, and the worker would be required to leave the U.S.
   * SAFE Visa holders would not be eligible for federal, state or local government-sponsored social services.
