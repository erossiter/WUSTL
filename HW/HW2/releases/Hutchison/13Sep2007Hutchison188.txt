SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES AIR FORCE TO BRING TOTAL FORCE VISION TO NAS-JRB FORT WORTH
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) announced that Gen. Michael T. Moseley, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force (USAF), will bring his Total Force vision to Texas, with plans underway for the active association of the 301st Fighter Wing at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (NAS-JRB) in Fort Worth. Gen. Moseley made the announcement today at a ceremony at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. 
   The 301st Fighter Wing at NAS-JRB consists of eighteen F-16 fighter aircraft whose pilots, crews and maintainers have been deployed multiple times to provide bombing support to ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The active association of the 301st will establish permanent active duty billets for pilots and maintainers to be stationed at NAS-JRB.
   The USAF's Total Force Integration effort is to combine the forces of over 680,000 Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Active Duty, and Civilian personnel together into a single fighting force.
   "Active, Reserve, and Guard units are fighting side by side in the Global War on Terror now," Sen. Hutchison said. "Integrating these components of our armed forces is a must. I commend Gen. Moseley's efforts to do so as it allows our service men and women, regardless of mobilization status, to work and train together before they go to war and the Joint Reserve Base at Fort Worth is a wonderful place to start."
