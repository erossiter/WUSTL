SEN. HUTCHISON COSPONSORS BORDER SECURITY BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, is an original cosponsor of the Border Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act, S. 575, introduced this week by Sen. Peter Domenici (R-NM). The bill promotes the use of infrastructure and technology improvements to meet border security needs while facilitating the flow of legitimate commerce.  
   "Our sovereign borders must be secured against threats and safe for legal trade," Sen. Hutchison said. "The provisions of this bill will help us safeguard our points of entry without jeopardizing our vital international economy. Modern technology can be a powerful ally in these efforts." 
   The legislation authorizes funding to implement infrastructure and technology improvements, such as sensing and monitoring devices, and train security personnel on their use. The bill also requires an annual National Land Border Security Plan, which would contain vulnerability assessments and help coordinate the efforts of federal, state and local officials.
