SEN. HUTCHISON DISCUSSES FUTURE OF RED RIVER ARMY DEPOT WITH ARMY MATERIAL COMMAND GENERAL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today met with U.S. Army Material Command (AMC) General Benjamin S. Griffin in her Washington, D.C. office to discuss Red River Army Depot's (RRAD) needs and identify new opportunities for the depot. The meeting was held as part of Sen. Hutchison's ongoing efforts to strengthen and enhance RRAD. 
   "Red River is in a class by itself. The base workforce and the Texarkana community are true patriots," Sen. Hutchison said. "Red River proved its importance and its contributions to the War on Terror during the BRAC process. We now have the opportunity to modernize its capabilities to help grow and strengthen the base." 
   The AMC manages the Army's five depots, including RRAD. Sen. Hutchison discussed with General Griffin the need to improve the depot's capacity to rebuild and overhaul humvees which is crucial in the War on Terror. They also discussed the need to provide RRAD with the industrial capabilities for operations in support of future war fighting forces and equipment. 
   In February, Sen. Hutchison toured RRAD with General Peter Schoomaker, Chief of Staff of the Army. She requested the visit in an effort to highlight the great workforce at Red River. During the BRAC process, Sen. Hutchison worked with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Congressman Ralph Hall (R-TX) to encourage BRAC Chairman Anthony Principi to visit Red River - a turning point that undoubtedly contributed to the unanimous BRAC Commission vote to keep Red River open.
