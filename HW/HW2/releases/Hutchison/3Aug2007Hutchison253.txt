SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON FISA REFORM
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) released a statement following Senate passage of S. 1927, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reform bill, offered by Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Kit Bond (R-MO): 
   "It was imperative that the Senate pass this FISA reform bill before we adjourned for August recess. We could not in good conscience fail to give our intelligence agencies the tools they require to monitor terrorist communications abroad, which could be the difference between preventing a major domestic terrorist attack and being hit again by an attack that would rival 9/11 in its devastation.
   "When we are asked to provide specific tools to defend this country, while protecting constitutional rights, we must never waiver in this responsibility.
   "With this bill our intelligence community can continue their critical efforts to protect this country."
   Sen. Hutchison is a member of the Senate Republican Leadership as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and is currently serving her third term in the U.S. Senate.
