SEN. HUTCHISON URGES SEN. DURBIN TO APOLOGIZE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement urging Sen.  
 Dick Durbin (D-IL) to apologize for his remarks comparing United States military men and women to "Nazis, Soviets in their gulags or some mad regime-Pol Pot or others-that had no concern for human beings." Her statement follows:
   "It's remarkable how many different memories Senator Durbin's remarks managed to tarnish all at once.
   "While I was immediately disturbed by Sen. Durbin's thoughtless remarks I waited, patiently, all week for his much-needed apology. The time has come. 
   "Sen. Durbin not only diminished the horrific treatment of so many people during the last century, he brazenly sullied the reputation of our military men and women, arming America's enemies with false reason to hold us in contempt. 
   "I sincerely urge Sen. Durbin to do the right thing and retract his statement."
