SEN. HUTCHISON VISITS FORT HOOD TO DISCUSS BASE REALIGNMENTS ON BRAC RECOMMENDATION LIST
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today visited with local elected and Fort Hood base officials to discuss realignment changes included in the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) recommendation list released May 13 by the Department of Defense. Sen.  
 Hutchison cited concerns over critical base information not considered in the Department of Defense's initial recommendation.
   "Community, base and elected officials are working together to ensure the BRAC Commission has the most accurate information on every capability the base has to offer in support of our Armed Forces," Sen. Hutchison said. "The 37,600 acres opened for training were not considered before the recommendation was released. This information must be considered before final decisions based on overall military value are made that affect the Fort Hood community and our nation's military strength."
   Sen. Hutchison highlighted the base's status as one of the military's premier Army installations citing its capacity to train and deploy soldiers as efficiently as any other in the country. In addition, she highlighted its range capacity and maneuver space, along with the fact that Fort Hood is not forced to contend with restrictive environmental regulations that limit training on other Army bases. 
   On May 26, Senators Hutchison and John Cornyn sent Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a letter requesting that he direct the Department of Defense to release all the data on how the Department determined which bases were to be added to the BRAC list. The Department has yet to make public all the data on how the military value for each installation was scored.
