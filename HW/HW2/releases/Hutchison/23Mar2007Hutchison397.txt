SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES AGAINST RECORD TAX INCREASES
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, today voted to defend working families against passage of a nearly $15 trillion Democrat budget that includes an historic $732 billion tax increase over five years. 
   "Today, I voted to defend working Americans whose wallets will be raided by this budget. This budget fails to extend vital tax cuts that are driving our growing economy, and instead creates the steepest tax hike in history. It will weaken our strong economy and erase incentives to build, invest and save. The tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 have led to job creation and record tax revenue," Sen. Hutchison said. 
   American families face tax increases because the budget does not extend tax cuts on capital gains and dividends that have boosted investment and fails to provide permanent relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax which will hit 23 million taxpayers in 2007.
