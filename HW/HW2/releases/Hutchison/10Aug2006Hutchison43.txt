SEN. HUTCHISON ADDRESSES TEXAS ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS CONVENTION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today delivered remarks to Texas radio and television station owners and managers at the Texas Association of Broadcasters (TAB) Convention.  
   "Broadcasters make invaluable contributions to local communities throughout Texas, and I consider myself one of their strongest allies in the Senate," Sen. Hutchison said. "I always enjoy visiting with members of the broadcasting industry to discuss ways we can work together to serve the best interests of Texans." 
   TAB is the largest state broadcast associations in the nation, representing more than 1,100 radio and television stations. Last year, the association honored Sen. Hutchison with the Legislative Leader Award for 2005.
