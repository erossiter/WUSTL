SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE GONZALES AS ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to today's nomination of Alberto Gonzales as U.S. Attorney General:
   "Al Gonzales earned universal respect among Texans for his ability, his integrity and his dedication to the law. He has, since that time, served four distinguished years in the White House. I believe he will be an outstanding Attorney General for our country. I will do everything I can to help Al Gonzales through what I hope will be an expedited confirmation process in the U.S. Senate."
