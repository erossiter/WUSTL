SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $3.9 MILLION AWARDED TO TEXAS FOR DROUGHT, WILDFIRE RECOVERY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Agency Service (FSA) has awarded Texas $3.9 million in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funding.  
   "Current conditions remind us all how devastating wildfires, drought and other natural disasters can be for farmers, ranchers and their land," Sen. Hutchison said. "This important funding will assist them as they work to rehabilitate their damaged lands and begin producing again." 
   A total of more than $2.01 million will be provided to Callahan, Donley, Eastland, Erath, Montague and Sterling Counties for wildfire conditions. Bowie, Camp, Collin, Delta, Fannin, Franklin, Grayson, Hopkins, Hunt, Lamar, Morris, Rains, Red River, Titus and Wood Counties will receive $1.9 million for drought conditions. 
   ECP gives producers resources to remove debris from farmland, restore fences and conservation structures, provide water for livestock in drought situations and grade and shape farmland damaged by a natural disaster. Locally-elected FSA county committees implement ECP for all disasters other than drought, which is done by FSA's national office. Eligible producers receive cost-share assistance of up to 75 percent of the cost of approved practices, as determined by FSA county committees.
