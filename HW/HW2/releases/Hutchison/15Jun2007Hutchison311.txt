SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES TEXAS VA MEDICAL CENTERS TO OFFER EXTENDED HOURS
  Texas' senior Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison announced today that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will be extending the hours at all 153 medical centers across the country, including Texas' six medical centers in Dallas, Houston, Waco, Temple, Kerrville and Bonham. This change will benefit new combat veterans and older veterans. 
   "I am pleased that the VA will be making their services more convenient for veterans across the state of Texas," said Senator Hutchison.
   "Illness doesn't follow a 9-to-5 schedule," said VA Secretary Jim Nicholson. "I'm directing our medical centers to provide extended hours to ensure we're there for the veterans who have earned our care."
   VA has more than 9,000 mental health professionals who will be offering extended service for veterans with this announcement.
   Individual medical centers will be announcing their extended hours in the coming weeks.
