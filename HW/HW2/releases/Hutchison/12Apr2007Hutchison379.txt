SEN. HUTCHISON COSPONSORS BILL TO ENHANCE VETERANS BENEFITS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today signed on as an original cosponsor of the Veterans Housing Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. The legislation, introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), improves assistance for service members and their families. 
   "This legislation will help us meet the special needs of many of our injured service members and their families during their treatment and recovery," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am encouraged by bipartisan support for this bill and will work with my colleagues to pass this measure to strengthen assistance for those who have served and sacrificed." 
   The bill would provide assistance for housing and automobile grants to burn victims and enhance grant assistance for Department of Defense service members as they make the transition to the VA system. It allows active duty service members transitioning to the VA eligibility for a partial temporary housing grant while residing with family members and requires the VA to report on the possible need for a permanent grant.
   Introduced today, the legislation also strengthens grants to burn victims and requires the VA to report on the need for potential changes in grant assistance for other specialized injuries such as Traumatic Brain Injury.
