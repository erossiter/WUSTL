SEN. HUTCHISON MOURNS PASSING OF FORMER PRESIDENT FORD
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), who was appointed by President Ford as Vice Chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and has stayed in touch with him throughout her career, today commented on the loss of former President Gerald Ford. 
   "In a time of great turmoil in our nation's history, Gerald Ford was chosen to be Vice President because of his impeccable integrity and the confidence that members of Congress from both Parties had in his leadership. When he became President, he was a healing force and continued to be a sought-after voice of reason throughout his life. My thoughts and prayers go out to Betty and the whole Ford family as we honor a public servant who gave tirelessly to our country over nearly three decades in elected office."
