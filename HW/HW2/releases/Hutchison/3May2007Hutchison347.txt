SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON WOUNDED WARRIOR COMMISSION MEETING IN SAN ANTONIO
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today released the following statement regarding tomorrow's public meeting of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors in San Antonio, Texas: 
   "I welcome the commission to San Antonio to examine the facilities used to treat our wounded warriors and the processes employed to deliver care. As its nickname 'Military City USA' suggests, San Antonio is home to many of America's bravest fighting men and women. It is also the home of the military's best medical facilities. Brooke Army Medical Center, Wilford Hall and the Audie Murphy Veterans Hospital have provided advanced medical care for America's wounded warriors for years, and I am working hard to ensure that they are able to meet their expanding role in treating those wounded in action. 
   "While the facilities and the care provided in San Antonio are top-notch, we can always look for ways to cut red tape, implement the most advanced treatments and expand and modernize facilities throughout the military and veterans health care system. I look forward to the recommendations that come forward when the commission concludes its work."
