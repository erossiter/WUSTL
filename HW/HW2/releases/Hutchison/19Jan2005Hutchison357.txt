SEN. HUTCHISON LAMENTS LOST HEALTH CARE FUNDING
  In a setback for Texas taxpayers, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services today announced that the State of Texas forfeited $104 million in Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funding for fiscal year 2002, raising the total lost by the state since 2000 to more than $700 million. 
   "The health care system in Texas, and particularly our county hospital network, is under enormous pressure because of the large number of uninsured patients that require treatment. As a result, our property tax payers are bearing a heavy burden," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services. "I regret that another significant allotment of Texas taxpayer dollars, that could have helped local governments pay for their health care bills, has again been voluntarily forfeited. As a simple matter of fiscal conservatism, this does not make sense."
   In 2005, for every dollar the state puts into CHIP, the federal government will provide $2.65 in matching funds. (This program is particularly beneficial to state health systems, because the match is greater than Medicaid. For every state Medicaid dollar, the federal government supplies $1.56.) States have three years to take advantage of CHIP dollars before they are redistributed to other states. Today, HHS said that the states of Arizona, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey and Rhode Island, would be the primary beneficiaries of this redistribution, having spent their own allocation.
