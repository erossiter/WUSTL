SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES AGAINST TAX PACKAGE, CLOTURE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today voted against a $29 billion tax increase as part of the energy bill being considered by the Senate. The Senate rejected the tax package by a vote of 57 - 36. 
   "This tax package was a disaster and would have reduced supplies, leading to higher gas prices and more dependence on foreign oil" said Sen. Hutchison.
   Sen. Hutchison also voted against cloture to end debate on the energy bill, but that vote passed 61-32.
   Sen. Hutchison believes the underlying bill must contain safety measures which help ensure the domestic animal agriculture industry is not adversely affected by a transition to increased renewable fuels production. Texas ranks at the top in animal agriculture production with over 14 million head of cattle.
