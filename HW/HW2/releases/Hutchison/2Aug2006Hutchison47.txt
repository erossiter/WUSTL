COMMERCE SECRETARY GUTIERREZ, POLICY EXPERTS COMMENT ON SENS. HUTCHISON-PENCE BORDER SECURITY IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL
  "Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said Tuesday that Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's immigration plan is "an intriguing proposal" that could be a starting point for a compromise between lawmakers trying to secure the border and those trying to create a guest worker program. . . .  
   Gutierrez, who met with Hutchison and Pence to discuss their ideas, praised their proposal for providing "strong border security, while also recognizing our economy's need for temporary workers." http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/nation/4088056.html

   "The Pence-Hutchison plan meets our number-one test: that the solution include tougher enforcement, both on the border and in the workplace, more visas for workers, and an answer for the 12 million illegal immigrants already in the county."
