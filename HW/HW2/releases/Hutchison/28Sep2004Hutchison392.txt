SENATE PASSES AIR CARGO SECURITY LEGISLATION
  Today the United States Senate passed Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's (R-TX) Air Cargo Security Act as an amendment to the National Intelligence Reform Act in order to strengthen security on passenger and cargo flights. 
   "The 9/11 Commission recognized vulnerabilities within our current system of air cargo transportation that must be addressed," said Sen. Hutchison, one of the principal authors of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). "Improved screenings and checked baggage inspections have decreased the risks for passenger flights. However, additional security requirements for air cargo will help make aviation even safer." 
   Sen. Hutchison's amendment will establish a more consistent and reliable system for safely shipping air cargo. Sen. Hutchison introduced similar legislation that passed the Senate twice, but the measure has not yet been considered by the House. The amendment will enact the following safeguards:
   * Instructs TSA to establish an effective national air cargo inspection program and to work with foreign countries to conduct regular inspections at facilities transporting air cargo to the U.S.; 
   * Requires the creation of an industry database of all known air cargo shippers and better scrutiny of indirect air carriers and facilities; 
   * Permits TSA to recommend suspension or revocation of the Federal Aviation Administration certification for noncompliant air carriers; 
   * Directs TSA to develop a training program for air cargo handlers; 
   * Requires all-cargo air carriers to develop approved security plans for their facilities, operations, cargo and personnel. Plans must include background checks for employees and contractors with security responsibilities. 
   "Twenty-two percent of all air cargo travels without inspection on commercial flights. Until we screen air cargo, our passenger flight security will remain incomplete. Congress must act quickly to increase inspections on air cargo to help reduce potential threats to aviation security," Sen. Hutchison said.
