SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER HOUSTON MAYOR WELCH
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) released the following statement on the passing of former Houston Mayor Louie Welch: 
   "I was saddened by the news that my friend Louie Welch has passed away. I've known Louie for over thirty years, since I worked with him during my time in the state legislature. Mayor Welch was a key figure in the growth of Houston, first as a city councilman, then as Mayor. As a city leader he always worked to stay ahead of the critical water, mass transit and city infrastructure issues that were so vital to the future of Houston.
   "I send my best wishes to Louie's wife Helen and their family in this difficult time."
