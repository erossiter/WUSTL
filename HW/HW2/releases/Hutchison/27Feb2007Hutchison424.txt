DEFENCE SECRETARY GATES CONFIRMS SUSPECTED IMPACT OF DELAYED MILITARY HOUSING FUNDS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison today questioned Defense Secretary Robert Gates on the impact of the Democrats cutting $3.1 billion in funding for facilities for our troops and their families in the recently passed continuing appropriations resolution. During floor debate on the resolution, Sen. Hutchison argued that cuts would delay the return of over 10,000 troops currently stationed at foreign bases. She worked to restore the $3.1 billion in an amendment, but Senate Democrats refused to bring her amendment to the floor for a vote.  
   "Secretary Gates confirmed my concerns that this funding is imperative and the cuts to military housing will delay the return home of thousands of troops. During his testimony, Sec. Gates specifically cited Fort Bliss in El Paso and Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio as bases that will be welcoming thousands of troops but need this funding immediately to begin to build the infrastructure to support them," Sen. Hutchison said.
   Sen. Hutchison, Ranking member on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, introduced an amendment to the FY 2007 Continuing Resolution to restore $3.1 billion in funding to implement the recommendations of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) to construct facilities to support our troops and their families. The Democratic majority prevented any amendments, including the Hutchison-Inhofe military funding amendment with 27 sponsors, from being considered and receiving a vote.
