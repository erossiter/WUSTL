SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES I-69 IS 'CORRIDOR OF THE FUTURE'
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the proposed extension of Interstate Highway 69 has been named a "Corridor of the Future" by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). This designation makes the corridor eligible for expedited review and approval processes within the DOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). 
   "When completed, this vital trade corridor will link all three NAFTA countries and present expanded opportunities for international commerce," Sen. Hutchison said. "This project means more jobs and a strong, growing economy for all Texans."
   According to the DOT, the Corridors of the Future competition is a component of the Department's Congestion Reduction Initiative. This program was designed to accelerate the development of multi-state, and possibly multi-use, transportation corridors to reduce congestion.
   Today's announcement will conclude a year long process which began on September 5, 2006, with the publication of a Federal Register Notice seeking applications from states, or private sector entities working with states, interested in forming coalitions to build corridors to alleviate congestion on highways, rail or waterways. The Department received 38 proposals in response to the Federal Register Notice and in February 2007, selected 14 projects located on 8 major transportation corridors to participate in Phase 2 of the competition.
   Sen. Hutchison joined 11 other Senators and 44 U.S. Representatives to sign a letter of support calling for the designation announced today. This letter can be found at http://hutchison.senate.gov/resources/07_20_07_I69letter.pdf.
   Sen. Hutchison is a senior member of the Commerce Science, and Transportation Committee which oversees the DOT.
