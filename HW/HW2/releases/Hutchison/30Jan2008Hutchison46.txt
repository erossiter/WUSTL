SEN. HUTCHISON ASKS PRESIDENT TO FUND LEVEE FENCE ALONG RIO GRANDE
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas senior' Senator, today wrote a letter to President Bush asking the White House to fund a local project developed by local elected officials in Cameron and Hidalgo Counties that will repair the levees along the Rio Grande while securing the border. 
   Sen. Hutchison is specifically urging that President Bush request sufficient funding through the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) to repair the levees and construct strategic fencing "in accordance with the proposal offered by locally elected officials" working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
   "We have an outstanding project developed at the local level that will secure our border while protecting Texas residents from the dangers of flooding caused by natural disasters," said Sen. Hutchison. "I will work with the President, the Office of Management and Budget, IBWC, Congress, and local officials to repair the levees and secure the border."
   The President is expected to release the 2009 Federal Budget request on February 5.
