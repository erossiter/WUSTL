SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $2.35 MILLION IN GRANT FUNDING TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator, today announced two grants totaling $2.35 million in U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration (EDA) funding to help meet the economic needs of San Antonio and Clarksville. 
   "These grants will provide important economic support for San Antonio and Clarksville," Sen. Hutchison said. "This funding will help create jobs and encourage private investment in our local businesses, and it will address the needs of our displaced veterans in San Antonio by helping them reintegrate into the workforce."
   According to the Department of Commerce, $1.35 million in EDA funding will be used to construct a Job Training and Work Therapy Center in San Antonio to address the needs of displaced veterans, the homeless and the disabled. In San Antonio, approximately one quarter of the homeless population is made up of veterans. This grant is expected to create 115 jobs and spur over $300,000 in private investment, and it will allow the facility to serve 500-600 veterans per year.
   Additionally, $1 million in funding will be used to enlarge a vacant building from 12,500 to 37,500 square feet. The building is located in the Clarksville Industrial Park, which is owned by the city of Clarksville, and will be used by Veneer Solutions to process wood for furniture manufacturers. As a result of increased business activity, the company plans to consolidate and expand its operations, which will create more jobs in Clarksville.
