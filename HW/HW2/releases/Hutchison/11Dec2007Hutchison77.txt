SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $150,000 GRANT TO RENOVATE HISTORIC TEXAS BUILDING
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator, today announced that a $150,000 grant has been awarded to the Galveston Historical Foundation by the Department of Interior's National Park Service to renovate the Ashton Villa/James Moreau Brown House in Galveston. 
   "These funds will help preserve an important piece of Texas history," Sen. Hutchison said. "The Ashton Villa building is widely considered to have been the first brick house built in Texas, and this grant will ensure that this Texas treasure is preserved for future generations to enjoy."
   As part of the FY 2007 Save America's Treasures grant program, the funding will provide a heating, venting, and air conditioning system to help address significant moisture problems, as well as roof and masonry repair for this historic building.
   Constructed in 1859 by James Moreau Brown, the Ashton Villa/James Moreau Brown House is considered one of the earliest brick buildings in Texas and has served as a public museum since 1970.
