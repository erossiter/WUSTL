SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON WRIGHT AMENDMENT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today made the following statement on the Wright Amendment agreement announced by Dallas and Fort Worth officials:
   "I commend the mayors of Dallas and Fort Worth for reaching a solution on a dilemma that has divided the community for three decades. The agreement announced today will produce economic benefits for North Texas while also promoting competition that will lower costs for consumers. I will introduce legislation to carry forward the spirit of this compromise as I work to obtain support in Congress to enact the terms of the agreement."
