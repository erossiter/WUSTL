SEN. HUTCHISON CONGRATULATES FUTUREGEN ENERGY FACILITY FINALISTS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today congratulated Jewett and Odessa, Texas for reaching a short list of Candidate Sites vying to host the world's first near-zero emissions fossil energy facility. The planned facility is a $1 billion public-private partnership venture between the FutureGen Alliance, Inc. and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  
   "The selection of these two Texas locations highlights our state's leadership in the energy industry and our abundance of diverse natural resources," Sen. Hutchison said. "Bringing FutureGen to Texas would create new job opportunities and help reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil."
   As both a power plant and research facility, FutureGen will demonstrate the technical and economic viability of generating clean power from coal. The project will gasify coal to generate electricity and produce hydrogen, capturing and storing carbon dioxide in deep geologic formations. The technologies refined and commercialized at this 275-megawatt prototype power plant will lead to the deployment of similar clean energy facilities across the nation.
   Texas' leaders began preparing the state's bid to host the project immediately after President Bush announced the FutureGen Initiative. Senator Hutchison announced the submission of Odessa and Jewett as possible sites in March. The Jewett proposal, based at the Jewett lignite mine, capitalizes on Texas' abundant lignite resources. The communities of Odessa and Midland worked together to develop a proposal which showcases Texas' energy expertise in the use of carbon dioxide and hydrogen by the petrochemical industry.
