SENS. STABENOW, HUTCHISON, LEVIN, CORNYN SET WAGER FOR MICHIGAN STATE-BAYLOR NCAA PLAYOFF
  Michigan State and Baylor have both climbed the ladder of the NCAA Division I women's basketball playoffs and will meet in the championship game tonight. Now, U.S. senators from Michigan and Texas are laying odds that their respective teams will take the final historic step and win the national title. 
   The senators today set the stakes for a friendly wager. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and John Cornyn (R-TX) are putting up bearclaws - pastries that celebrate the Baylor "Lady Bears" - in the belief that the team of Baylor Coach Kim Mulkey-Robertson will be successful. Looking ahead to the sweet success of MSU Coach Joanne McCallie's five-year rebuilding plan, Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) are wagering chocolate-covered Michigan cherries and blueberries.
   "I'm proud of both coaches and the remarkable programs they have created at MSU and Baylor," Stabenow, an MSU grad, said today. "This is a dream match-up for all fans, but in the end I believe Michigan State's three-point shooting and its never-say-die spirit will give the Spartans the edge over the Lady Bears."
   "The Baylor Bears are this year's 'Big Mo' team," Sen. Hutchison said. "The Lady Bears' victory will be sweet with the chocolate-covered cherries on top! I congratulate both teams for their great effort, sportsmanship and determination that allowed them to compete for the national title."
   "The Spartans will deliver bad news to the Baylor Bears tonight, as Michigan State's remarkable teamwork and unshakable spirit prove too hard to beat," Levin said. "Congratulations to both teams on an excellent season!"
   "Baylor has the motivation and inspiration to win it. And Coach Kim Mulkey-Robertson has the tenacity and energy to lead her team to victory," Cornyn said. "So, sic 'em, Bears!"
