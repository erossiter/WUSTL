PENTAGON SELECTS EL PASO RESIDENT AS NEW ADVOCATE FOR TEXAS BASE COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) announced today that the Department of Defense has appointed Tom Thomas of El Paso to a key position to ensure strong ties between Army bases and the Texas communities that surround them. Sen. Hutchison recommended him for the post after consultation with Dee Margo, who held the post for eight years. 
   Mr. Thomas has been invited to become the newest of Texas' three "Civilian Aides," which serve as liaisons to local civilians. Civilian Aides are responsible for keeping the public apprised of Army initiatives and representing community interests before the Pentagon.
   Born and raised in El Paso, Mr. Thomas brings a wealth of business experience of more than 30 years and is currently Senior Vice President of the Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce. He will replace Charles DeWetter, whose term expired in September. Mr. Thomas has worked to better acclimate Fort Bliss soldiers to El Paso and sought to improve their quality of life. He led a Defense Industry Task Force for El Paso and helped implement an annual Freedom Fiesta for the soldiers of Fort Bliss.
   "Tom will play a vital role to ensure Army bases have a healthy relationship with the communities surrounding them," Sen. Hutchison said. "I appreciate his commitment to service and I commend the Army for making a fine selection. I was proud to nominate him and help win his appointment today."
   "Tom Thomas has been a strong public advocate of the Army and in particular, Fort Bliss, for many years both as a public volunteer and in business when directing economic development for the Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce," said Mr. Margo, Chairman of the Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce and Civilian Aide from 1990-1998. "Tom personifies the stated mission of the Civilian Aides to the Secretary of the Army via his advocacy and support of the US Army."
