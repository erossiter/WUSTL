SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES TO PROTECT AMERICAN FLAG
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today voted in support of a Constitutional Amendment prohibiting desecration of the American flag.  
   "The American flag is recognized around the world as a powerful symbol of our heritage and our freedom which many have died defending," Sen. Hutchison said. "Desecration of the American flag is a physical action that should not be interpreted as protected speech. I support this amendment because I believe it is important to protect Old Glory, our beloved national symbol."
   Sen. Hutchison is an original cosponsor of the amendment, S.J. Res.12, which was introduced by Sen. Orin Hatch (R-UT).
