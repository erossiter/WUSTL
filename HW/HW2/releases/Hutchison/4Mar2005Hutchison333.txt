SEN. HUTCHISON CONGRATULATES GROUP FOR ?REMEMBERING THE LADIES'
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today addressed a crowd gathered for a "Remember the Ladies" Luncheon hosted by Southern Methodist University DeGolyer Library supporters.  
 During her speech, Sen. Hutchison stated her support for the library system's efforts to preserve papers and artifacts representing women in the Southwest Region.
   "Texas and the Southwest Region is an area steeped in tradition," Sen. Hutchison said. It is our responsibility to preserve the contributions women of the past have made to the Southwest we know today. These artifacts and papers will serve as an educational tool at all levels and I congratulate your efforts to preserve our past for tomorrow's students." 
   Supporters of Southern Methodist University's DeGolyer Library gathered at the SMU campus to raise money to fund an archivist to help preserve and arrange the library's extensive collection of papers and artifacts of women in the Southwest. The historic collection includes documents from women involved in business, entrepreneurship, politics and pioneering efforts in the Southwest Region of the country.
