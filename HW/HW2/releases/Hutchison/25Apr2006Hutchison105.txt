  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today congratulated Gray Miller upon Senate confirmation as District Judge for the Southern District of Texas.

   Gray Miller currently serves as a senior partner at Fulbright & Jaworski in his native city of Houston. Before coming to the firm, he was an officer with the Houston Police Department as he worked his way through the University of Houston School of Law.
