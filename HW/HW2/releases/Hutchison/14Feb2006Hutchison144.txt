SEN. HUTCHISON MOTION TO MAKE STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTION PERMANENT APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced a motion to instruct conferees for the Tax Reconciliation Act to make the state sales tax deduction permanent. The instruction was passed by a vote of 75-25 today and gives guidance to the conferees as they develop the final version of the tax bill. 
   "All Americans should be treated equally when it comes to deducting their state taxes, whether they pay state income taxes or sales taxes," Sen. Hutchison said. "The Senate already passed a two-year extension. Today's action will guide conferees and help us ensure Texans have the same tax relief opportunities as the rest of the nation on a permanent basis." 
   The motion follows Senate passage of the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005 on February 2. The bill provides for a two-year extension of the state and local sales tax deduction and will be sent to conference to reconcile the Senate and House versions of the tax legislation. Sen. Hutchison has led the effort to extend this tax relief and also make it permanent.
