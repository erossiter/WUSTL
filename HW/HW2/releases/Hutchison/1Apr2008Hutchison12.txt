SEN. HUTCHISON: HIDALGO COUNTY LEVEE MOVING FORWARD
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator, welcomed the announcement by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that they will move forward on the promised 22 mile levee barrier in Hidalgo County. 
   The levee barrier project in Hidalgo County will strengthen flood protection in the area while providing the Border Patrol with important tactical infrastructure.
   "I believe Secretary Chertoff is taking the responsible approach to exercise his legal authority to keep the agreement with Hidalgo County that serves the dual purposes of flood protection and border security," said Sen. Hutchison.
