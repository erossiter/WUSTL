SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF NATIONAL ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today applauded the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  
   "We cannot continue to import nearly 60 percent of our energy from foreign countries," said Sen. Hutchison. "More energy independence is critical to our economic strength and national security. This legislation is a balanced energy plan and a positive step forward in addressing America's increasing energy needs." 
   The Energy Policy Act will be a sweeping energy research and development program. It will improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy resources including hydropower, geothermal, solar and wind energy. The bill also includes increased energy tax incentives. 
   "This energy bill makes sense for our economy, consumers, businesses and environment. It will stimulate our economy by stabilizing energy prices and creating American jobs," said Sen. Hutchison. "I believe this bill will help lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy." 
   In 2000, President Bush began calling on Congress to take action on a comprehensive energy bill. Thus far, Congress has been unable to get a bill to the President's desk.
