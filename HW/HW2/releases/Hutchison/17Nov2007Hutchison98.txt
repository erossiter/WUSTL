SEN. HUTCHISON HELPS DEDICATE GOV. BRISCOE POST OFFICE
  U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas' senior senator and Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, today helped dedicate the Gov. Dolph Briscoe Post Office in Uvalde. 
   "I've had the privilege to know Dolph for decades, and I have always been impressed by his love for Texas, and his strong commitment to public service," Sen. Hutchison said. "Before, during, and after his service as Governor, Dolph has been committed to the people of his hometown of Uvalde. This post office will always bear the name of Dolph Briscoe, and it will ensure that his legacy lives on in Uvalde for generations to come."
   Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn and Rep. Ciro Rodriguez (D-TX) introduced legislation in Congress to name the Uvalde post office after Gov. Dolph Briscoe. The House passed this legislation on July 30, and the Senate passed it on Aug. 3.
   Gov. Briscoe served as Governor of Texas from 1973-1979 and is a native of Uvalde. Briscoe served in the state legislature from 1949-1957.
