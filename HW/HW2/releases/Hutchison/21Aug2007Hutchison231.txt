SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES EXTENSION OF FEMA DISASTER ASSISTANCE DEADLINE
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has extended the deadline by which individuals affected by severe storms, tornadoes and flooding between June 16 and August 3 can register for disaster aid to October 29, 2007. 
   "I am pleased FEMA has extended this deadline so Texans in those communities can get the help they need to repair and rebuild," said Sen. Hutchison. "I'll continue working with the federal, state and local government to make sure Texas gets the resources it needs."
   The 33 Texas counties eligible for Individual Assistance (IA) are: Archer, Bee, Bell, Brown, Burnet, Cherokee, Comanche, Cooke, Coryell, Denton, Eastland, Grayson, Guadalupe, Hamilton, Henderson, Hood, Lampasas, Llano, Medina, Nueces, Parker, Runnels, Smith, Starr, Tarrant, Travis, Van Zandt, Victoria, Walker, Webb, Wichita, Williamson and Zavala.
   According to FEMA, IA funds can be used for temporary housing, home repairs and other disaster-related expenses not covered by insurance. The deadline extension also applies to low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration, which may be available to help renters, homeowners, and businesses recover from losses not fully compensated by insurance.
   Even if a Texan in one of the eligible counties has contacted their insurance company, the Red Cross or another nonprofit, they should contact FEMA by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) to apply for federal aid. Individuals with hearing or speech impairments can call the TTY registration number: 1-800-462-7585.
