SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES ALMOST $1 MILLION IN HURRICANE RELIEF
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that $969,595 in recovery funding has been awarded to Texas colleges and universities by the U.S Department of Education. Sen. Hutchison was an original co-sponsor of an amendment to secure this funding in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill that passed on May 3, 2006. 
   "Our southeast Texas institutions of higher education were heavily impacted by the storms of 2005," Sen. Hutchison said. "This funding will help their ongoing recovery efforts by reimbursing lost revenue."
   Hurricane Education Recovery Awards (HERA) have been granted to the following Texas schools that were forced to close, relocate or significantly curtail their activities as a result of damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita:
   Lamar University $679,471 
   Lamar Institute of Technology $144,288 
   Lamar State College-Port Arthur $75,951 
   Lamar State College-Orange $69,885 
   This funding is intended to partially reimburse these institutions for lost tuition revenue and other expenses associated with the hurricanes.
