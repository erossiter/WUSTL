SEN. HUTCHISON WELCOMES NEWS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH CARE STUDY IN SOUTH TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today made a statement in response to the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) announcement that it will conduct a study on veterans' access to health care in South Texas. 
   "I welcome the news that the VA has responded to my request to take another look at veterans' health care needs in the Valley. It is a good first step," Sen. Hutchison said. "Our veterans have earned accessible health care and I will continue to work to ensure we meet the needs of veterans in South Texas and throughout the state."
   The VA announced the study will include projections in the demand for VA's health care services, taking into account seasonal fluctuations in population and workload.
