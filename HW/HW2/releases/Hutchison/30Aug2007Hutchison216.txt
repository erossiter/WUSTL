SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $170,000 IN LAW ENFORCEMENT GRANTS
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded $171,634 in grants to Texas law enforcement agencies to assist in their mission to protect public safety. 
   "It is so important that our police officers have the resources they need to keep us safe," Sen. Hutchison said. "These grants will provide the training and equipment needed to help our law enforcement officials fight crime." 
   The following organizations will receive funding:
   ORGANIZATION - FUNDING - PURPOSE 
   City of Garland - $149,978 - Gang prevention education 
   City of Orange - $21,656 - Information technology upgrades 
   Total: $171,634 
   Funding for the city of Garland is provided under DOJ's Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) Program. According to DOJ, the goal of the GREAT program is to train law enforcement officers in a school-based curriculum in which the officers provide instruction to school-aged children in life skills, gang awareness and anti-violence techniques.
   The grant awarded to the city of Orange is provided under DOJ's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, established to aid the efforts of local and state law enforcement agencies. The City of Orange Police Department will use the grant to purchase new computers, upgrade existing computer technology and to repair broken computer hardware.
