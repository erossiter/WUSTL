SEN. HUTCHISON LAUDS WHITE HOUSE UPON RELEASE OF JUDGE ROBERTS' DOCUMENTS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today released the following statement on the White House's delivery of more than 38,000 pages of documents pertaining to Judge John Roberts to Capitol Hill as well as the American Bar Association's (ABA) unanimous "well qualified" rating of Judge Roberts.  
 Her statement follows: 
   "The White House had every legal right under the Presidential Records Act to withhold these documents. President Bush should be applauded for waiving that right thereby allowing the Senate to proceed with an open and transparent confirmation process. 
   "Yesterday, the American Bar Association unanimously gave its highest rating to Judge Roberts. The ABA told the White House it believes Judge Roberts has the temperament, integrity and professional competence to be confirmed to the high court. I believe we now have everything we need to confirm Judge Roberts and ensure the Supreme Court has a full bench by the start of the new term in October. 
   "After meeting with Judge Roberts, it is clear to me that President Bush selected a sincere man with integrity, a fine legal mind and a real sense of fairness."
