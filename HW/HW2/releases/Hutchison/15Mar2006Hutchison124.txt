SENATE PASSES SEN. HUTCHISON PORT SECURITY AMENDMENT
  A port security amendment sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today passed the Senate. The amendment to the Senate Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution calls for $978 million for improved port security measures. Other amendment sponsors include Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK). 
   "We must increase our ability to secure cargo before it leaves foreign ports and expand our inspection and tracking capability here in the U.S." Sen. Hutchison said. "This amendment calls for funding for these critical port security initiatives. Our ports cannot continue to be a potentially grave weakness in our homeland security." 
   Specifically, the amendment calls for $978 million in maritime security funding, including the U.S Customs' Container Security Initiative, improved data for targeted cargo searches and security threat assessments at our nation's ports.
   Sen. Hutchison reintroduced her Shipping Container Security Act, S.376, which mandates broad port security measures in 2005.
   The bill - which Sen. Hutchison first introduced in 2004 - requires all foreign countries shipping goods to the U.S. to grant access to U.S. inspectors so that containers headed to the U.S. are able to be inspected at their port of origin; develops and implements a comprehensive plan to increase the number of containers inspected as they enter the U.S.; and monitors the transport of cargo within the U.S. until it reaches its final destination.
