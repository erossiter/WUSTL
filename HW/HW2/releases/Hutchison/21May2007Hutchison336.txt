SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES TO ALLOW MORE TIME ON IMMIGRATION BILL
  Today Texas' Senior Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee (RPC), issued this statement following her vote against cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1348, the immigration bill: 
   "Immigration is far too important an issue for us to rush through the U.S. Senate. This bill has not even been written in legislative language, has not been approved through the committee process, and therefore cannot be vetted by the American people. I believe we can produce a better bill if we take adequate time to consider this landmark legislation."
