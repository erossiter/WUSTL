SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY NICHOLSON FOR HIS SERVICE TO AMERICA'S VETERANS
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today released the following statement regarding the announcement that U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) Jim Nicholson will resign to return to the private sector: 
   "I want to thank Secretary Nicholson for being an outstanding VA Secretary and a tireless advocate for our veterans. During Secretary Nicholson's tenure, the VA has vastly improved medical care for our veterans at time when our VA facilities are under significant strain due to the demands of the Global War on Terror. We both saw this need and worked to increase funding for the VA, which we will have doubled from FY 2001 to FY 2008.
   "I witnessed his dedication when he worked with me to save the critical VA hospitals in Waco and Big Spring. Secretary Nicholson also agreed to conduct a study on the need for improved access to health care in the Rio Grande Valley and I will continue working with him to complete it.
   "Along with the over 1.7 million veterans living in Texas, I wish to express my appreciation to Secretary Nicholson and wish him well in his future endeavors."
   Secretary Nicholson has announced he will serve through October 1, 2007 or until a successor can be confirmed by the Senate.
   As former Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Military Construction and Veterans Appropriations Subcommittee, Sen. Hutchison worked closely with Secretary Nicholson in the more than two years he has served in the Administration.
