SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH LUBBOCK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, TEXAS TECH REPRESENTATIVES
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today met with representatives of the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce and Texas Tech University in her Washington, D.C. office to discuss their legislative priorities in Congress. 
   "It is important to hear directly from local leaders to understand their issues and concerns as we move key legislation and funding bills through the legislative process," Sen. Hutchison said. "We discussed the importance of improving transportation in West Texas and affordable healthcare, along with water and wind energy projects which are critical to the West Texas economy. I look forward to continuing my work with the community on these priorities." 
   In past appropriations bills, Sen. Hutchison has secured more than $8.6 million for the Ogallala Aquifer and $450,000 for the Water Law and Policy Research Institute at the Texas Tech University School of Law. The funding will help preserve water resources and improve irrigation practices for the region. In addition, Sen. Hutchison has secured $1.5 million for the Great Plains Wind Power Test Facility which will enhance the significant measurement and analysis capabilities at Texas Tech University.
