SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), the senior Senator from Texas, released a statement following the President's State of the Union address: 
   "Tonight President Bush detailed many important initiatives that Congress should undertake this year. I will continue to work with the administration and Congress to strengthen the economy, lower taxes, expand access to health care, reauthorize No Child Left Behind, support free trade, and advance new technologies for our future energy demand. We must only accept victory in Iraq and we can only do that if the Congress fully funds the troops ably led by Gen. Petraeus. I was particularly pleased to hear the President call for improved care and services for our Veterans and do so by improving job opportunities, access to childcare and allowing troops to transfer unused GI bill benefits to children and spouses. The Congress has a lot of work to do on these issues and I look forward to working in a spirit of bipartisanship going forward."
