SEN. HUTCHISON'S EARLY CANCER DETECTION LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW
  Cancer screening legislation introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, was today signed into law by President Bush at a White House ceremony. The bill Sen. Hutchison introduced with Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) reauthorizes the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.  
   "Early detection of breast and cervical cancers saves lives and is essential to our fight against these devastating diseases," Sen. Hutchison said. "The national early detection program has given millions of disadvantaged women access to vitally important cancer screenings and must be continued."
   The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program makes critical breast and cervical cancer screenings and post-screening diagnostic services available to low-income, uninsured and underinsured women. Established by Congress in 1991 and reauthorized in 2000, the program has been implemented in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To date, it has provided nearly 6.9 million screening exams to almost 2.9 million underserved women nationwide.
