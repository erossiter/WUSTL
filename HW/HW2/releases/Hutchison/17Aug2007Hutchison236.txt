SEN. HUTCHISON FINISHES THREE DAY, 1,000 MILE WEST TEXAS BUS TOUR
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today completed a three day, 12 city, 1,000 mile bus tour of West Texas during which she met with countless Texans to listen to their concerns and discuss with them the issues they care most about. 
   "This was an amazing opportunity to meet with Texans and hear what is really on their minds," Sen. Hutchison said. "After hearing their concerns, I know I can be more responsive to their needs."
   The tour included stops in Borger, Dumas, Canyon, Plainview, Lubbock, Lamesa, Big Spring, Midland, San Angelo, Abilene, Eastland and Mineral Wells.
   Of particular interest to West Texas, Sen. Hutchison has recently:

   * Secured $100,000 in this year's Agriculture Appropriations bill for wool research at the Texas A&M Research and Extension Center in San Angelo. Sen. Hutchison has secured over S1.5 million for this research center in past years.

   * Secured $450,000 in Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005 for the Innovative Low Income Housing Finance Initiative, which provides funding for the City of San Angelo to establish revolving loan funds for families and individuals who don't qualify for home loans due to medical bills or other needs
   * Supported $3 billion in emergency agricultural assistance, which compensates agricultural producers for losses in 2005, 2006, and early 2007
