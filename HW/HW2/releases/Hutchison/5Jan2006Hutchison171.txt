SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES IMMEDIATE EDUCATION FUNDING FOR TEXAS SCHOOLS AFFECTED BY HURRICANE RITA
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that $50 million from the Hurricane Education Recovery Act will be made available immediately by the U.S. Department of Education to help reopen Texas schools in areas affected by Hurricane Rita.  
   "This first installment in emergency funding is great news for students, parents, teachers and community members in East Texas. They have been eager to get their schools up and running again and this funding is critical to those efforts," Sen. Hutchison said. "I have worked hard to ensure that the needs of Hurricane Rita victims in Texas are met as we work to meet the needs of victims in other hurricane-affected states. I expect additional funding will be dispersed soon to reimburse Texas schools which have taken in students displaced by Hurricane Katrina." 
   Sen. Hutchison helped secure Texas' eligibility for its share of funding in the third hurricane emergency supplemental bill which passed Congress on December 21, 2005. This immediate funding is the first installment from the $750 million that Congress appropriated for restarting schools in hurricane-affected states. The funding is provided to states to help with the costs related to the reopening of, restart of operations in, and the re-enrollment of students in schools that serve areas affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
