SEN. HUTCHISON SADDENED BY DEATH OF KTRK TELEVISION CONSUMER REPORTER ZINDLER
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today released a statement regarding the death of KTRK television consumer reporter Marvin Zindler: 
   "I always looked forward to seeing Marvin each year at the Houston Rodeo Parade and admired the countless good deeds that 'Marvin's Angels' did for Texans over the years. Houstonians have enjoyed watching Marvin on KTRK in Houston since 1973 with his unique consumer reporting and one-of-a-kind personality.
   "On a personal note, when I was a cub reporter for KPRC television in Houston in the early 1970s, Marvin was Deputy Sheriff in Harris County and he was very kind in showing me the ropes at the county courthouse and around town. We've been great friends since then.
   "Ray and I send our sincere condolences to his wife Niki and their five children."
