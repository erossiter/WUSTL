SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES AGAINST MOTION TO PROCEED
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today voted against Cloture on the Motion to Proceed to S. 1639, the immigration bill. The cloture vote passed 64-35. 
   Following the vote, Sen. Hutchison released this statement:
   "Today I voted against the immigration bill because I believe we can provide a workable guest worker program without amnesty, and this bill appears to be going in the opposite direction.
   "Until major changes are made that reject amnesty, and we have a more open, fair process for debating one of the most crucial issues facing our nation, I cannot support this immigration bill."
   Sen. Hutchison's "return home" amendment will be considered. The amendment, co-sponsored by Senators Bob Corker (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN), would require adult illegal immigrants to return to their home country within two years of receiving their Secure ID, also known as their temporary "Z" visa.
