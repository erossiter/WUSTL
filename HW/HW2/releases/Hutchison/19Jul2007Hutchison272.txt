SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $1.2 MILLION MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FOR SHEPPARD
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), today announced that the U.S. Air Force (USAF) will bring a $1.2 million project to the Sheppard AFB for construction of urgently needed and larger vehicle bays to accommodate new fire trucks. The funding is immediately available and being used from the USAF's Operations and Maintenance account. 
   "This will better enable the firefighters on base to keep their families and fellow airmen safe by properly employing the latest and most advanced firefighting equipment," Sen. Hutchison said.
   The USAF has been receiving new firefighting vehicles that are too large to safely fit into current vehicle bays at existing fire stations such as the main fire station at Sheppard. This project will involve constructing an addition to the main fire station adding more space for vehicle bays, and will allow for the construction of additional space as required.
