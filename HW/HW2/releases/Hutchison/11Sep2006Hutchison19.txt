SEN. HUTCHISON MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF SEPT. 11, 2001 TERROR ATTACKS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today released the following statement marking the 5-year anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 
   "Today we remember a terrible day in American history-a day that encompassed both our darkest moment and our finest hour. We learned much about our vulnerabilities on September 11th, but we learned more about heroism, freedom and the American spirit. This is a war that terrorists began long before September 11, and we owe it to future generations to see the War on Terror through to ultimate victory.
   "We and our allies are charged to protect freedom in an increasingly dangerous world, and we must be vigilant. The price of failure is unimaginable. Since September 11, we have significantly strengthened our national defense and homeland security. We have engaged the enemy in the Middle East so that they do not reach America and for five years we have prevented another attack on U.S. soil.
   "We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who are defending America and exporting freedom today. We have not forgotten the events of 9/11, and we will not forget those who continue to serve on behalf of us all."
