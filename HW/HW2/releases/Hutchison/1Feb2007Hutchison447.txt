SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS PROTECTION OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN MINIMUM WAGE BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, made the following statement on efforts to include small business tax relief in the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 which passed the Senate today. 
   "Increasing the minimum wage is the right thing to do as long as it is coupled with tax and regulatory relief for small businesses. They are the job-creating engine that drives our nation's robust and growing economy. Additional benefits for small business should have been included in the minimum wage bill, including Association Health Plans, to lower health care costs. I will work to include that important health benefit to small business employees in upcoming legislation." 
   The following tax relief provisions were included in the legislation:
   * Expensing- A one-year extension of a provision allowing small businesses to combine as much as $112,000 in expenses into one annual tax deduction.
   * Leasehold Improvements - An extension through March 31, 2008, of the provisions that allow property owners to more quickly deduct the cost of making improvements to a restaurant or to leased property. Also, extends the provision to apply to improvements made to owner-occupied retailer space and for the construction of new restaurants.
   * Cash Method of Accounting - A permanent change to the tax code that will allow more businesses to simplify their bookkeeping by allowing them to use the cash method of accounting for tax purposes. 
   * S Corp Reforms - A modification to the standards that allow small businesses to qualify for or stay within the S Corp tax rules. 
   * Certified Professional Employer Organizations - Establishes a certificate program for companies that provide and oversee employees for other corporations. The certification would require these companies to meet certain standards set by the IRS. Businesses that contract with certified professional employer organizations would be assured they would not be liable for those taxes already paid to the certified professional employer organization.
   * Work Opportunity Tax Credit - A five-year extension of the tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce. Also, a modification to the work opportunity tax credit to include a tax credit for employing veterans disabled after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
