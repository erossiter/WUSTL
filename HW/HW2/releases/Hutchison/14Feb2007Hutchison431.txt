SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today commented on passage of the $463 billion omnibus spending bill which Democrats forced through Congress without any amendments, including Sen. Hutchison's amendment to restore $3.1 billion in funding to construct facilities to support our troops and their families.  
   "I voted for the passage of the omnibus spending bill because our government needs this funding to continue operating, but I still object to the process that brought this bill to a vote despite promises of bipartisanship. I am very troubled that this large spending measure was not allowed to be amended in the House or Senate. My amendment to restore critical funding for facilities for our troops and their families had bipartisan support. It is not the way we should do business in the U.S. Senate.
   "It is critical that this military funding is provided as soon as possible and I will work to ensure it is included in the supplemental spending bill. By deferring to the supplemental spending bill, these desperately needed resources will only add to our deficit rather than be paid for now as an appropriations bill." 
   Sen. Hutchison introduced an amendment to the FY 2007 Continuing Appropriations resolution to restore $3.1 billion in funding to implement the recommendations of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) to construct facilities to support our troops and their families. The Democratic majority prevented any amendments, including the Hutchison-Inhofe military funding amendment with 27 sponsors, from being considered and receiving a vote.
