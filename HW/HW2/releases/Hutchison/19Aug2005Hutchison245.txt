SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $6.5 MILLION AWARDED TO TEXAS PUBLIC FINANCE AUTHORITY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced the Texas Public Finance Authority will receive $6,930,768 in funding from the U.S. Department of Education under the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Program. 
   "Preparing our students for college can never begin too early," said Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "These funds will allow TPFA to offer their students the tools necessary to excel academically and prepare students for higher education." 
   The Texas Credit Enhancement Program will create a debt service reserve fund to issue tax-exempt revenue bonds to provide financing for the acquisition, construction, repair or renovation of eligible Texas charter schools.
