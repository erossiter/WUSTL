SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement on the National Day of Prayer:  
   "From our nation's earliest beginnings, Americans have relied on the power of prayer to guide us through uncertain times. We are still using prayer to get us through each day as we strive to make the world safe from terror. 
   "There is nothing more powerful than prayer - no greater gift than praying for others. In fact, it is the greatest gift we can give. 
   "I hope today serves as a reminder to all Americans that there is a higher purpose to our lives. We should never be ashamed or embarrassed to thank God for our many blessings."
