SEN. HUTCHISON SPEAKS AT TEXAS FARM BUREAU CONVENTION
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, this week delivered remarks at the 73rd Annual Texas Farm Bureau Convention. She spoke on issues of concern to representatives of Texas' more than 225,000 farms and ranches, including extension of the 2002 Farm Bill and disaster relief.  
 "The passage of a new farm bill that is good for Texas is one of my top priorities for the new congress," Sen. Hutchison said. "The 2002 Farm Bill successfully addressed the goal of producing a safe, abundant domestic food supply, while also protecting the interests of our agriculture industry. We must continue these policies as we craft new legislation."
 In March 2006, Sen. Hutchison led efforts to direct over $12 million in relief funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to farmers impacted by the single largest wildfire in Texas history. She is also a co-sponsor of the Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2006, which provides over $2.5 billion in relief for crop losses in 2005 or 2006 and over $1.7 billion for livestock losses due to wildfires.
 "Between drought, hurricanes, and wildfires, this has been a tough year for farmers and ranchers," Sen. Hutchison said. "Farms and ranches are a vital component of our state and national economy. When the farmers and ranchers suffer, we all suffer."
 Prior to the devastating Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Sen. Hutchison advocated for the establishment of a "rainy day fund," emergency funding set aside to aid in recovery from natural disasters. Sen. Hutchison today reiterated support for the fund and commented that the events of the past year have brought the need for such a program into sharp focus.
