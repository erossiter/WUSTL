NEW PASSPORT RULES REQUIRE PLANNING AHEAD
  As Texans prepare for family trips and summer vacations, many are having difficulty getting the passports they need to travel. Under new federal requirements, more Americans will need passports to re-enter the United States after traveling overseas. Therefore, it is important to know if you will need a passport for your trip, to be familiar with the application process and to make your arrangements well in advance. 
   To help prevent undocumented persons from entering our country, new travel guidelines within the western hemisphere are in place. Although well intentioned, the new passport requirements are proving inconvenient and cumbersome. Additionally, the U.S. Department of State's delay in processing passport applications has caused great frustration.
   Traditionally, our hemisphere has offered safe travel destinations and friendly neighbors. It is clear, though, that terrorists are anxious to infiltrate our nation through other countries. Further, a few rogue dictators in Central America have sought alliances with nations that harbor terrorists. As a result, a passport or other appropriate documentation is now mandatory for all air travelers re-entering the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda. Beginning January 1, 2008, land and sea travelers will also need a passport to return from these countries. A receipt showing that you have submitted your passport application and a government issued ID will be sufficient for travel to these destinations until the end of September.
   With these additional requirements in place, the State Department has received a record number of passport applications and is experiencing a sizable processing backlog. In order to avoid delays, I encourage you to complete and submit your application with all proper documentation as soon as possible.
   If you are applying for your first passport, you must go in person to one of 384 Passport Acceptance Facilities in Texas, most of which are post offices, county clerks' offices or federal office buildings. Please take the following with you, and be prepared to pay the appropriate application fee:
   * A completed "Application for Passport" (Form DS-11)
   * Proof of citizenship (certified birth certificate, naturalization certificate, etc.)
   * Proof of identity (such as a driver's license or government ID)
   * Two passport photos (commercially available)
   A full list of acceptance facilities and further details about the passport application process can be found online at http://travel.state.gov. Please remember that each traveler must have a passport, including children and infants. The process for passport renewal is similar and can also be found on the above website.
   The State Department reports that routine applicants should receive their passports within 10 to 12 weeks of applying and can track the status of their request online within 3 to 4 weeks. However, my office has heard from people who have waited over four months for their application to be processed. I recommend that you apply months before you are scheduled to leave the U.S., just to be sure. If you must have your passport in hand quickly, expedited service is available from the State Department for a fee.
   Your passport identifies you as a United States citizen and will grant you entry into more than 140 nations worldwide. Safeguard it at all times, travel safely and enjoy your vacation!
