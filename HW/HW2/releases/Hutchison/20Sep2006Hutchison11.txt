SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON SURVEY FINDING STRONG SUPPORT FOR LOCAL AGREEMENT TO REPEAL WRIGHT AMENDMENT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today commented on a recent survey conducted for Rep. Michael Burgess (R-26) in the Dallas-Fort Worth area finding solid support for the agreement developed by local officials and currently pending before Congress to repeal the Wright amendment:  
   "The agreement I introduced in the Senate is a local solution to a problem imposed upon them by the federal government. I am encouraged that the local community has responded favorably to increasing competition and lowering fares for consumers," Sen. Hutchison said. "I will share these polling results with my colleagues in Congress as I work to move the Wright amendment legislation forward."
   In response to the question, "Do you favor or oppose the current compromise pending before Congress between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth that will end the Wright amendment in eight years?" 58 percent of those surveyed said they favored the current compromise proposal compared to 17 percent who oppose it.
   The survey of 400 registered voters from Cooke, Dallas, Denton and Tarrant Counties was conducted September 15-17 and has a margin of error of +/- 5 percent.
