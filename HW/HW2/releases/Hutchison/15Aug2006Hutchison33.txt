SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES EL PASO DECLARED FEDERAL DIASTER AREA
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that President Bush has declared El Paso, County, Texas a federal disaster area. The declaration makes El Paso eligible for both Individual Assistance and Public Assistance following extensive flooding in late July and early August. Sen. Hutchison sent an August 4 letter to President Bush urging him to expedite the federal major disaster declaration, followed by an August 11 letter requesting both Individual Assistance and Public Assistance be provided.  
   "This federal disaster declaration means federal aid can now be provided to help the El Paso community recover from extensive flooding damage," Sen. Hutchison said. "Eligibility for both Public and Individual Assistance will assist community recovery efforts as well as help individuals and their families who were forced to flee from their homes. I have been in constant contact with local, state and FEMA officials throughout this process and am pleased this federal disaster declaration has been made today." 
   Sen. Hutchison toured El Paso to survey the damage on August 7 and has worked with Representative Silvestre Reyes, Mayor John Cook and other officials to offer assistance at the federal level.
   Public Assistance is used to rebuild damaged infrastructure, public services and government functions, while Individual Assistance is used to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other disaster-related expenses not met by insurance or other aid programs.
