SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENDS MOTIVA ENTERPRISES ON PROGRESS TOWARD PORT ARTHUR OIL REFINERY EXPANSION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today released the following statement in support of Motiva Enterprises' announcement that it has made significant progress toward expanding refining capacity in Port Arthur, Texas. The 325,000-barrell-per-day expansion would enhance supplies of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in the U.S. and make the Port Arthur Refinery the largest in the country: 
   "The expansion would provide a solid boost for the Port Arthur economy and our nation's efforts to strengthen our oil and energy independence. This would be the equivalent of building an entire new refinery. I expressed my support today to Shell's President, John Hofmeister, and commended him for leading this project that would create new jobs in the Port Arthur community. Increased refinery expansion is a key element to lowering energy costs. The current high prices at the gas pumps send a clear warning sign that our nation needs more expansion. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It is a growing economic and national security concern."
