SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH SPEAKER OF IRAQI NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today met with Dr.  
 Hajem Al-Hassani, Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, in her Washington D.C. office to discuss the December elections and women's rights as the constitutional process continues. 
   "The Iraqi people are making historic strides on their path to establishing a free and stable democracy," Sen. Hutchison said. "The women who suffered under years of oppression deserve to have a role in this new society. We saw them brave the insurgent threats when they went to the polls last January demonstrating strong commitment to their free nation. Let a truly free Iraq serve as a model for men and women around the world fighting for those same freedoms." 
   Dr. Al-Hassani is both a U.S. and Iraqi citizen. He is meeting with U.S. elected officials as the Iraq people prepare to cast their votes on a new constitution on October 15. If approved, the constitution will serve as the basis for national elections December 15.
