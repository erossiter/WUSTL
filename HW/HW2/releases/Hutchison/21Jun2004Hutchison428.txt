SEN. HUTCHISON OFFERS BILL TO BOOST WATER PROJECTS ALONG U.S.-MEXICO BORDER
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) told a visiting delegation of South Texas leaders that she is proposing Congress authorize water infrastructure projects in 19 irrigation districts in El Paso, Hudspeth and Willacy counties.  
 The Senator today offered to amend legislation she enacted to add these counties to a list that currently includes Cameron and Hidalgo counties.
   Senator Hutchison made the announcement in an address to a Washington gathering of more than 100 public officials and community activists organized by U.S. Rep. Ruben Hinojosa (D-TX). Federal authorization would better position the water projects for funding from Congress or other entities, such as the North American Development Bank (NADBank) and the Bureau of Reclamation.
   "I am committed to ensuring an adequate and reliable water supply for Texas' border communities," Senator Hutchison said. "Our cities, farmers and families are facing a crisis brought on by a growing population and Mexico's continued failure to repay its water debt. Now more than ever, we must make the best use of the resources we do have. That's exactly what this bill will do."
   Senator Hutchison added that she hoped projects in El Paso, Hudspeth and Willacy counties would enjoy the same boost Cameron and Hidalgo counties received after enactment of the Senator's Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Resources Conservation and Improvement Act of 2000.
