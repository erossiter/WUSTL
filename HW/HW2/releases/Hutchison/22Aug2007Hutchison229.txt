SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $100,000 TO FIGHT DRUGS IN WEBB COUNTY
  Texas's senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that a $100,000 grant was awarded to a Webb County organization to fight drug use among youths. 
   "The Webb County Community Coalition is part of a national network of community groups that through their joint efforts have helped reduce youth drug use by 23 percent over the last five years, and I'm proud that this funding will help support their continued success," Sen. Hutchison said.
   The grant was awarded to the Webb County Community Coalition through a highly competitive process from the Drug Free Communities Support Program, a program of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. According to ONDCP, the Coalition was established in 1999 to combat substance abuse along the Texas-Mexico border with the goals of empowering citizens to take action to prevent alcohol, tobacco and other drug use and abuse among community youth and adults, and to strengthen collaboration by supporting the local drug prevention, intervention and treatment infrastructure.
