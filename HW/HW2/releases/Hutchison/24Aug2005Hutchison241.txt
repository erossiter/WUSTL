BRAC COMMISSION VOTES TO FOLLOW DOD RECOMMENDATION, MOVE TROOPS TO FORT CARSON, COLO.
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), who is in attendance for the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) votes today, made the following statement after the Commission voted to follow the Department of Defense's recommendation and move troops from Fort Hood to Fort Carson in Colorado:  
   "I will be speaking with Army Chief of Staff General Schoomaker to impress upon him the need to look for ways to enhance Fort Hood. There will be movement of troops that have yet to be assigned and I will continue to urge him to bring more troops to the base from overseas installations," Sen. Hutchison said. "We have the next two years to work towards this goal and I will work to keep Fort Hood at present levels."
