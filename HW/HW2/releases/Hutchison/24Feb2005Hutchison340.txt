SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $12 MILLION DONATION BY LOCAL COMPANY TO TRINITY TRUST
  At the 4th Annual Trinity Commons luncheon held today in Dallas, Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) announced the Hunt Petroleum Corporation will donate $12 million to the Trinity Trust in support of the Trinity River Vision Plan. Sen. Hutchison has been a leading advocate of the extensive downtown improvement project, securing more than $42 million for the Trinity River Corridor during her tenure in the U.S. Senate.
   "No city can achieve greatness without generosity from its leaders," Sen. Hutchison said. "The vision of the Trinity River Corridor will transform Dallas into a beautiful city with a clear focal point centered around the river, park and recreational facilities. The Hunt Petroleum Corporation is making a huge contribution to our future"
   In addition, Sen. Hutchison used the annual forum to announce the Woodall Rogers Bridge will be named for Margaret Hunt Hill, a founding director of the Hunt Petroleum Corporation. Sen. Hutchison helped secure the federal appropriation of the final $8 million needed to begin construction on the bridge, the first of three Trinity River bridges being designed by world-renowned architect Santiago Calatrava.
   Sen. Hutchison has worked closely with local officials, community members, environmental groups and the Army Corps of Engineers through the continued progress of the Trinity River Corridor. She plans to pursue additional resources for the project through her seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
