SEN. HUTCHISON CONGRATULATES ESCHENBACH ON CONFIRMATION AS FDA COMMISSIONER
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today congratulated Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, on the Senate's vote to confirm him as the Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Dr. von Eschenbach has served as the acting commissioner since September of 2005. 
 "Not only is Dr. von Eschenbach a wonderful friend, but he is impeccably qualified for this position. He is a nationally recognized urological surgeon, medical educator and cancer advocate. He is also a three-time cancer survivor," Sen. Hutchison said during remarks on the Senate floor today. "He understands the needs of doctors and patients and he is the right person to protect the interests of both."
 Dr. von Eschenbach served as Director of the National Cancer Institute. Prior to holding that position, he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Academic Officer at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He was also the founding Director of M.D. Anderson's Prostate Cancer Research program. Before arriving at M.D. Anderson, Dr. von Eschenbach served his country as a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Medical Corps from 1968 to 1971.
