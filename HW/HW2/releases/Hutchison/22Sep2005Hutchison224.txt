SENATE APPROVES 2006 VA BUDGET
  Today the Senate approved the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill of 2006.  
 The legislation was authored by the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, chaired by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX). The legislation appropriates funds for Fiscal Year 2006 for the Department of Veterans Affairs and includes nearly $2 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the previous shortfall. 
   "I am pleased to help pass this legislation, which will add nearly $5 billion to last year's VA funding level and includes nearly $2 billion in emergency supplemental funding," said Sen. Hutchison. "We must live up to the promises made to our veterans." 
   The legislation will provide more than $70.7 billion to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs. It includes $36.6 billion for mandatory veterans' benefits including pensions and compensation. The subcommittee included over $34 billion in discretionary spending, more than $1.25 billion above the president's budget request and more than $3.3 billion above FY 2005. This amount includes $23.3 billion for medical services, $2.8 billion for medical administration, $3.2 billion for medical facilities and $412 million for medical and prosthetic research. 
   "Veterans have risked their lives for our freedom. While we can never fully repay them, we can do everything possible to fulfill our commitments," said Sen. Hutchison. "Maintaining quality health care services for our veterans is critical." 
   The legislation passed the House of Representatives on May 26th. It will now be sent to the Senate Floor before going to President George W. Bush to be signed into law.
