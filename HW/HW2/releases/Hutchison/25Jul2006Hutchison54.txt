SEN. HUTCHISON CO-SPONSORS CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the Senate has passed the Child Custody Protection Act, of which she is a co-sponsor. The act makes it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion in order to avoid a state's parental notification laws. 
   "The laws of many states are designed to protect the rights of minors and their parents, and this act ensures that such laws are not circumvented by crossing state borders." Sen. Hutchison said.
   The Child Custody Protection Act protects the safety of pregnant minors and the right of parents to be involved in their child's medical decisions. At least 37 states have enacted statutes requiring parental notification or consent before a minor can obtain an abortion. Texas requires anyone under the age of 18 to have one of their parents' consent, or judicial bypass, to have an abortion.
