SEN. HUTCHISON ONE STEP CLOSER TO ENSURING ARMY STICKS WITH LONE STAR PLANT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced the Senate Appropriations Committee has voted to put strong language into its supplemental report that ensures the Army will use the full $15.5 million at the Lone Star facility in producing the M67 hand grenade, even if the work continues beyond the October 1 fiscal year end. 
   "I applaud the committee for getting us one step closer to ensuring the Lone Star facility remains a viable part of our military industrial base," said Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee. "For months, I have pressed the Pentagon to recognize Lone Star's ability to provide high-quality products for the Army. It has the experience and workforce to get the job done."
   Sen. Hutchison's staff met with DoD officials last year to make the case for continuing the grenade's production at the LSAAP. In August, she visited the plant and met with local leaders. Following the meeting, Sen. Hutchison personally talked to then-Acting Secretary of the Army Les Brownlee on behalf of the plant. If the Lone Star facility were to lose the Fiscal Year 2005 funding, the facility's future would be in doubt. This would endanger nearly 350 jobs and a $15.5 million annual payroll.
   This is the first step in the process. The House of Representatives must also agree. Sen. Hutchison will work with Congressman Ralph Hall (TX-04) to get House approval. 
   "I will continue to work with local leaders, company officials and members of Congress to keep Lone Star active," Sen. Hutchison said.
