SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $63 MILLION IN HURRICANE RELIEF FOR EDUCATION IN TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that Texas will receive $35.2 million in the first of four installments for the costs associated with students displaced by Hurricane Katrina residing in Texas. Texas will also receive $28.2 million from the Hurricane Education Recovery Act to help restart Texas schools in areas affected by Hurricane Rita. 
   Sen. Hutchison helped secure Texas' eligibility for its share of funding in the third hurricane emergency supplemental bill which passed Congress on December 21, 2005.
   "Texas communities have been diligently working to get their schools up and running while educating thousands of new students displaced by Hurricane Katrina. This funding relief is critical to their ongoing efforts," Sen. Hutchison said. "This latest installment in emergency funding is welcome news in Texas." 
   In January, Texas received $50 million from the Hurricane Education Recovery Act for a total of $78.2 million in funding to restart Texas schools.
   The $28.2 million announced today is the second installment from the $750 million that Congress appropriated for restarting schools in hurricane-affected states. The funding is provided to states to help with the costs related to the reopening of schools, restarting of operations in schools and the re-enrollment of students in schools that serve areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
