 Charles Wilson. 
   "As a naval officer and member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Charles Wilson served his country and state with distinction. It was an honor to lead the effort in the Senate to rename this facility in commemoration of his commitment to our troops," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am pleased Secretary Nicholson is here with us today. Both he and Representative Wilson have been leaders on issues important to our nation's servicemen and women." 
   Secretary Nicholson and Sen. Hutchison spoke at the renaming ceremony at the Lufkin VA Outpatient Clinic. Sen.
