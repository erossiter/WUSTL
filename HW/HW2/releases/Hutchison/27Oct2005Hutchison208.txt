ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TO VISIT RED RIVER
  Following a request made by Texas' senior sen., Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), General Peter Schoomaker, Chief of Staff of the Army, has agreed to visit Red River Army Depot in Texarkana. Sen.  
 Hutchison made the request in an effort show what a great workforce we have at Red River. The date of the visit has yet to be finalized.
   "I am pleased General Schoomaker has agreed to visit Red River Army Depot," said Sen. Hutchison, who led the effort to defend and, ultimately, save Red River from closure during the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. "Now that BRAC is behind us, we must begin to look toward the future and improve Red River. General Schoomaker is taking a personal interest in possible infrastructure improvements that would enhance Red River's ability to modernize and grow into an elite 21st Century depot facility."
   The visit was secured by Sen. Hutchison during a recent meeting with General Schoomaker at the Pentagon. Sen. Hutchison hopes to accompany the general on his visit to the base. During the BRAC process, Sen. Hutchison worked with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Congressman Ralph Hall (R-TX) to encourage BRAC Chairman Anthony Principi to visit Red River - a turning point that undoubtedly contributed to the unanimous Commission vote to keep Red River open.
   "I look forward to General Schoomaker seeing first hand the critical work conducted at Red River and meet the dedicated and skilled workers who proudly serve our nation," Sen. Hutchison said. "Red River is a vital component of our nation's military and makes an incredible contribution to the War on Terror."
