SENATE REJECTS MEASURE TO LOWER PAYMENTS FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, applauded the 53-46 vote in the United States Senate to reject an amendment to the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.  
 The amendment would have reduced farm payment limits from $360,000 to $250,000 and restricted the eligibility requirements for receiving payments.
   The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 made a six-year commitment to America's farmers to provide price and income support to offer stability in the unpredictable agriculture industry. Changing the farm program payments would disproportionately impact certain commodities and regions. 
   "By passing the 2002 farm bill, we made a commitment to our farmers. We must continue to honor this promise," said Senator Hutchison. "Our growers and ranchers depend on this agreement to finance their operations. To change this funding midstream would be detrimental to Texas agriculture."
   The Senate passed the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 Thursday, November 3. The legislation will reduce federal spending by $39 billion over five-years. The House of Representatives is scheduled to consider the measure next week.
