BIG SPRING VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL CRITICAL TO VETERANS CARE, SEN. HUTCHISON SAYS
  Following a tour of the Big Spring Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Center, Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said the facility was critical to veterans care and she expressed optimism that more would share that view after a feasibility study is conducted.
   "This hospital provides quality health care in a location that continues to serve West Texas very well," Sen. Hutchison said. "Moving it would impose a new hardship on Texas veterans, requiring them to travel great distances. We must do better by those that have done so much to defend our country over the years. I am hopeful the upcoming study will recognize the Big Spring hospital is ideally located and take into account the views of community leaders."
   In a meeting on Capitol Hill earlier this month, Sen. Hutchison urged Jim Nicholson, the incoming head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, to keep the Big Spring VA hospital open and to come see it firsthand. Sen. Hutchison is the second ranking Republican on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction to approve Mr. Nicholson's nomination and send it to the full Senate for consideration.
   Senator Hutchison has actively supported the Big Spring facility, personally meeting with outgoing VA Secretary Anthony J. Principi several times to underscore the devastating effect a closure would have on the West Texas community. She believes the Big Spring facility is ideally situated to serve West Texas veterans. She has worked extensively with community leaders to save the facility and was instrumental in winning an additional round of study before any changes to the hospital are adopted.
