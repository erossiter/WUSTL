SEN. HUTCHISON HAILS SHRINKING FEDERAL DEFICIT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on Fiscal Year 2006 budget figures released today by the U.S. Treasury Department. The figures show the federal budget deficit has been reduced to $248 billion, cutting it in half three years ahead of schedule. 
   "Today's deficit reduction numbers are further vindication for the positive economic effect of tax cuts. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have generated record tax revenues from robust economic growth, which also pushed the Dow to new record highs. When we return in November, Congress needs to make the tax cuts permanent in order to sustain economic growth, balance the budget and benefit working families."
