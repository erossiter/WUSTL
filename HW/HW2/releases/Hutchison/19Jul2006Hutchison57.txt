SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. HUTCHISON'S LEGISLATION TO REPEAL WRIGHT AMENDMENT
  The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee today passed legislation introduced by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) to implement the agreement reached in June to repeal the Wright amendment. The legislation passed by a vote of 21-1 and will be sent to the full Senate for consideration. 
   "The overwhelming committee support for my bill is an encouraging development for the North Texas community as our Wright amendment repeal moves closer to being signed into law. My bill will significantly benefit consumers by repealing the Wright amendment over eight years and achieving a balance between Love Field and the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. The agreement upon which this legislation is based represents a commitment by local officials and members of the Texas delegation to work together in the best interest of the Dallas and Fort Worth communities and the state of Texas." 
   Key points of Senator Hutchison's legislation are detailed below: 
   * Relaxing restraints on flights to and from Love Field: The Wright amendment is modified to allow air carriers to immediately provide ticketing from Love Field to any U.S. or foreign destination through any other point in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Alabama. 
   * Repeal of Wright amendment: The remaining provisions of the Wright amendment will be repealed eight years after the date of enactment. 
   * The 20 gate cap will be enacted as agreed with consideration for the noise, environment, traffic, and safety of residents, schools, and businesses in the area around Love Field. 
   * Treatment of international non-stop flights to and from Love Field: As under current policy, non-stop international flights may not arrive or depart from Love Field. 
   * Charter flights at Love Field: Charter flights at Love Field will not be affected and will continue to hold all current rights and privileges. 
   * Applicability: The legislation will specify that it will apply only to Love Field.
