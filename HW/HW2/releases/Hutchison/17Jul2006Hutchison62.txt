SEN. HUTCHISON CONDEMNS HEZBOLLAH INSTIGATION IN MIDDLE EAST
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today released the following statement on the Lebanese-Israeli conflict: 
   "I strongly condemn the violent instigation by the Hezbollah militants in the current Lebanese-Israeli conflict. Their continued crusade to destroy Israel has endangered civilians on both sides of the border and threatened diplomacy in a fragile region. Israel has a right to self-defense in the face of these unwarranted attacks. In the interest of peace, the democratic Lebanese government should immediately repudiate the conduct of the Hezbollah terrorists, expel them from Lebanon and denounce their international backers. Syria and Iran must also be cautioned against aiding and abetting this terrorist organization."
   Sen. Hutchison reminds Texans that those with loved ones in Lebanon may contact the U.S. State Department for updates on the situation at (888) 407-4747 if calling from within the U.S. or Canada or (202) 501-4444 if calling from elsewhere. U.S. citizens in Lebanon are advised to remain in place and register their location using the above telephone numbers or the State Department web site at https://travelregistration.state.gov. Registered travelers will be included in any future evacuation plans and updates.
