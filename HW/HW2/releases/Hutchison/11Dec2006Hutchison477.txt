SEN.HUTCHISON REACTS TO U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL'S ACCUSATIONS IN FAREWELL SPEECH
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's farewell speech, dismissing his attacks as a selective recollection of the facts. 
   "It is America's defense of liberty and guarantee of free speech that gives Kofi Annan a forum for his criticisms. Those very freedoms were attacked on September 11 drawing us into a War on Terror to defend our values. Kofi Annan's farewell remarks ignore the fact that the U.S. contributes 25 percent of the U.N.'s peacekeeping budget and continues to be the greatest defender of liberty the world has ever known."
