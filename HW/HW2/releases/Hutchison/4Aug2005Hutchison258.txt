  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today recognized the importance of community service at the Texas Association of Broadcasters' (TAB) Community Service Awards breakfast.  
 The association honored Sen. Hutchison with the Legislative Leader Award for 2005. 
   "It is important that all Texans recognize the high value the Texas Association of Broadcasters places on community service. Its members lead by example in commitment to the community," Sen. Hutchison said. "Local broadcasters keep Texas communities informed about important events and emergencies. From community event updates to Amber Alerts, our broadcasters are a key part of our lives." 
   The Community Service Awards Breakfast was held as part of the TAB Annual Convention. TAB is the largest state broadcast associations in the nation, representing more than 1,100 radio and television stations. The awards ceremony honors community service contributions made by Texas radio and television stations each year.
