SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $4.9 MILLION GRANT AWARDED TO TEXAS BORDER SHERIFF'S COALITION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition will receive a $4.9 million grant from the Department of Justice. The grant will help provide equipment and supplies for the Operation Linebacker Task Force. 
   "Our borders must be secured--it is an issue of national security." Sen. Hutchison said. "As a border state, Texas is in a unique position to assist in enforcement efforts." 
   The Operation Linebacker Task Force will assist U.S. Customs and Border Protection in preventing terrorism, strengthening control of the Texas-Mexico border, and protecting U.S. citizens. The Task Force is an initiative of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, an association of the sheriff's offices in Texas' 16 border counties.
