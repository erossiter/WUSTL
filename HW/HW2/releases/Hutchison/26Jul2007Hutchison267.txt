SEN. HUTCHISON PROTECTS FUTURE FUNDING FOR NATIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE, RESCUE TRAINING CENTER
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today protected future federal funding for the National Emergency Response and Rescue Training Center (NERRTC) at Texas A&M University by authorizing $94.5 million in federal funding through Fiscal Year 2011. This authorization was included in the Conference Report for the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, which passed the Senate tonight 85-8. 
   In the Conference Report, which is expected to pass the House of Representatives Friday, NERRTC is authorized to receive federal funding of $22 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, $23 million in FY 2009, $24 million in FY 2010, and $25.5 million in FY 2011.
   "I've been committed to the training program at A&M since long before 9/11," said Sen. Hutchison. "This authorization dictates strong federal funding levels for the next five years to ensure our first responders are prepared for terrorist attacks and natural disasters, and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee I will work to deliver these funding levels."
   The bill authorizes specific funding levels for the individual members of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, of which NERRTC is a member. These funding levels are a baseline to determine future funding needs. The $22 million funding level for NERRTC in FY 2008 should be the minimum for the five year period authorized.
   As one of seven members of the Consortium, NERRTC provides effective anti-terrorism training and education for emergency workers and senior officials. Sen. Hutchison made a May 2006 visit to the center, which integrates Texas Engineering Extension Service training facilities and experienced instructors to give emergency responders unsurpassed training and technical assistance.
   Since FY 1998 Sen. Hutchison has delivered $131.6 million in federal funding for NERRTC.
