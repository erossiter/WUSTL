SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MCKINNEY OFFICIALS REACH WRIGHT AMENDMENT AGREEMENT
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced an agreement has been reached between McKinney officials and the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, following a dispute over the June 2006 compromise agreement to repeal the Wright amendment. 
   "Today, we have taken one more positive step in our legislative efforts to achieve a balanced solution to the Wright amendment issue. I am pleased that the parties accepted my advice to return to the negotiating table and consider the clarifying language I proposed to resolve McKinney's objections," Sen. Hutchison said. "Having McKinney join Dallas and Ft. Worth in supporting our effort to repeal the Wright amendment is a terrific boost. Our united front in the halls of Congress will serve the interests of North Texas by opening the airways to competition and ultimately lowering fares for consumers."
   Sen. Hutchison introduced legislation to repeal the Wright amendment on July 13. A markup of the bill, S.3661, will be held Wednesday, July 19 before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
