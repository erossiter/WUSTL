SEN. HUTCHISON HONORS EILEEN COLLINS' NASA SERVICE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space, today commended Eileen Collins' service to our nation following her announcement that she plans to retire from NASA:
   "Eileen Collins is a courageous leader who paved the way for female astronauts. The nation watched last summer as her crew performed an outstanding mission, including the repair of the Shuttle Discovery, allowing the safe completion of the Return to Flight mission. I thank her for her service and her contribution to our nation's bold future in space."
