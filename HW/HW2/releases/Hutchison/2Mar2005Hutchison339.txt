SEN. HUTCHISON EXPANDS JURISDICTION ON APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, added Veterans Affairs issues today to her portfolio when the full committee announced it will restructure its subcommittees. 
   "I am pleased to be able to fight not only for our current military men and women, but our veterans as well," Sen. Hutchison said. "Veterans have risked their lives for our country. While we can never fully repay them, we can do everything possible to live up to our promises. I will proudly lead that mission as subcommittee chairman."
   The agreement announced today reduces the number of Senate appropriations subcommittees from 13 to 12. The new structuring plan will eliminate the old VA, HUD and Independent Agencies subcommittee and spread those responsibilities to other, existing subcommittees. 
   Veterans Affairs will be added to Military Construction. Other changes include moving HUD under Transportation and Treasury, combining State with Foreign Operations, moving EPA under Interior and moving NASA to Commerce and Justice.
