SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $6.6 MILLION IN HURRICANE RELIEF FOR TEXAS, HOUSTON
  Texas' senior Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), today announced that FEMA has approved grants totaling over $6.6 million for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and the city of Houston. The funds will help reimburse Texas for costs associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  
   "Texans opened their doors and welcomed thousands of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Soon after, many Texas homes, businesses and government buildings were ravaged by Hurricane Rita," said Sen. Hutchison. "This funding will help reimburse Texas for its generosity and speed our recovery from the effects of the storms." 
   The Texas Department of Criminal Justice was awarded over $1.6 million to repair an administrative building at the Stiles Unit that was severely damaged by Hurricane Rita. Houston will receive over $5 million to offset the cost of managing the city's evacuee housing program.
