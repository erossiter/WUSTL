BRAC COMMISSION ACCEPTS SEN. HUTCHISON REQUEST TO HOLD REGIONAL HEARINGS IN TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today released the following statement after hearing that the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission has accepted her request to hold two regional hearings in Texas.  
 The first hearing will take place in Dallas on June 22 and the second in San Antonio on July 11. 
   On May 11, Senator Hutchison invited the 2005 Base BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi to meet with fellow members of the Texas Delegation in her office. In that meeting, Chairman Principi agreed to send at least one BRAC commissioner to each affected base, and said he would consider Sen. Hutchison's request to hold regional hearings in Texas. Sen. Hutchison's statement follows:
   "I am pleased Chairman Principi has accepted my request to hold regional hearings in Texas. During the last BRAC process in 1995, we organized similar hearings and found them to be very helpful in allowing communities to make their case directly to the Commission. While Texas came away ahead overall in the first recommendation list, there were individual installations on the list that are not only critical to our military, but to the defense of our homeland. The Texas delegation will provide compelling evidence why Texas is the premiere state to keep and train our military. Texas is the proud home for multiple Army, Navy, Air Force, Reserve and National Guard installations and that should never change."
