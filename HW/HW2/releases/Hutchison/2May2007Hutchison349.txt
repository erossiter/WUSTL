SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR DALLAS AREA RAPID TRANSIT RED LINE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator, today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) will award $9 million to Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) for the purchase of eight new center section cars to provide level boarding on the Red Line. 
   "The Red Line is a critical part of Dallas' transportation system, and this additional funding will help make the line accessible to even more people," Sen. Hutchison said. "FTA is providing funding above and beyond what was already secured this year because DART is such an exemplary system."
   In July 2006, Sen. Hutchison helped obtain a $700 million Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) between DART and the FTA for the Green Line. The first $80 million installment of that funding was provided this year. This additional $9 million in funding for the Red Line is provided through a discretionary funding source for transit projects. DART has consistently come in ahead of schedule and under budget in impact studies and other progress markers.
