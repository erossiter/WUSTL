SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON COMPETITIVENESS, RESEARCH INVESTMENT AT ANNUAL TAMEST CONFERENCE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today discussed achievements in the areas of medicine, engineering and science at Texas' colleges and universities during closing remarks at the 4th annual The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas (TAMEST) conference. Sen. Hutchison is the founder and serves as the honorary chairman of TAMEST, which concluded its conference in Austin today.  
   "This year's TAMEST conference has been the most successful yet. Each year, as more Texas scientists are recognized by their peers and elected to the National Academies, TAMEST grows in size and stature," Sen. Hutchison said. "This collaboration leads to scientific breakthroughs and helps bring more research dollars to our universities, colleges and medical schools. The presentations have been fascinating and should serve as inspiration for younger students with interests in these critical fields." 
   In 2000, after learning that Texas universities ranked sixth nationally in federal research and development dollars, Senator Hutchison set out to obtain for the state a greater share of those funds. Her strategy focused on three parts: hosting annual conferences in Washington to help academics identify new research opportunities, encouraging colleges and universities to establish centers of excellence to specialize in unique fields, and urging the schools to jointly pursue projects. 
   TAMEST consists of the state's 11 Nobel Laureates and 200 plus members of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences dedicated to increasing national awareness of and funding for research and development (R&D) at Texas colleges and universities.
