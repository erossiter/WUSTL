SEN. HUTCHISON COMMEMORATES 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION CREW ARRIVAL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space, today honored the 5th Anniversary of the first space crew's arrival aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  
 The ISS has been continually occupied since the first crew arrived on November 2, 2005: 
   "Today's anniversary marks five years of continuous research conducted on the ISS. If we plan carefully and provide the appropriate resources, this celebration will be just the beginning of humanity's status as extraterrestrial," Sen. Hutchison said. "We must honor our commitment to our international partners to finish the space station so we can further enhance science and medical research and expand the variety of areas to which space research can be applied." 
   The crew currently occupying the ISS arrived in October as the 13th crew and will remain there until April, 2006.
