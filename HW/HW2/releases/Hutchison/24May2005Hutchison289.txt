SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUSTICE OWEN VOTE IN SENATE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement regarding the scheduled U.S. Senate vote to approve the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to the federal bench. Sen.  
 Hutchison called Justice Owen last night to tell her she would finally have her confirmation vote:
   "Justice Owen is an exceptional jurist who is committed to the Constitution and her community. I know her personally and I admire her dedication to the law and public service. Her professionalism is widely admired across my state. She, and the nation, have waited entirely too long for her leadership.
   "This irrefutably well-qualified woman will finally take her rightful place on the federal bench.
   "During the last four years, Justice Owen has shown courage, patience and judicial temperament. My admiration for her has grown through this time and I believe she is exactly the quality of person Americans deserve.
   "The votes on these three judges should be followed with an up or down vote for all of President Bush's nominees to the federal bench. Every nomination should receive a vote as the Constitution envisioned."
