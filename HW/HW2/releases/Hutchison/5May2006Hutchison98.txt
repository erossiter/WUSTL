SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON DOW's SIX-YEAR HIGH
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today released the following statement after the Dow closed at 11,577.74 - its highest level in six years. Sen. Hutchison's statement follows: 
   "Today's six-year high shows what is possible when Congress allows hard-working Americans to keep more of what they earn. The historic tax relief package of 2003 ignited the economy, boosted tax revenues and led to more Americans working today than ever before. Today's news highlights why Congress must make the historic tax relief permanent and continue to allow the market to grow - not hamstring the economy and burden Americans with tax increases. We must also come up with a new energy bill that increases production capabilities and further invests in alternative sources of energy."
