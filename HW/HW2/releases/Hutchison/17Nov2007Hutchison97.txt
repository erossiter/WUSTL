SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH TEXAS A AND M INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY'S GAINING EARLY AWARENESS AND READINESS FOR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS STUDENTS TO DISCUSS EDUCATION
  U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas' senior senator and the Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, today met with children and parents participating in Texas A&M International University's GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs) to discuss the importance of education. 
   "GEAR UP is an outstanding program that focuses on keeping young students focused on higher education opportunities," Sen. Hutchison said. "We need to do even more to increase the skills of the next generation of Texans. That's why I co-sponsored breakthrough legislation such as the America Competes Act, which recently became law, to authorize grants for states to promote better coordination of elementary and secondary education. It also strengthens the skills of thousands of math and science teachers through support for the National Science Foundation's Teachers Institutes for the 21st Century Program.
   "I also am a co-sponsor of legislation to increase financial support and provide new technology for Hispanic Serving Institutions. As co-chair of the Senate's HSI Coalition, I've helped increase HSI funding by more than 800% since Fiscal Year 1995.
   "I will continue to work with Laredo's leaders, Mayor Salinas and Judge Valdez, and others to increase education for all."
   GEAR UP is a national program that provides grants to states and partnerships to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in post-secondary education. TAMIU received an over $4 million, six-year grant that began in Fiscal Year 2006 to support the GEAR UP program in Laredo.
