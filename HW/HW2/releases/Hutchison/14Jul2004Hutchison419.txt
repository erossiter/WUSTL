SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. HUTCHISON'S BILL DESIGNATING EL CAMINO REAL DE LOS TEJAS AS NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL
  The U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources today passed without objection legislation introduced by Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison to designate the oldest trail in Texas, El Camino Real de los Tejas, as a National Historic Trail. The full Senate will now consider the measure.
   "El Camino Real de los Tejas is an important part of our heritage. This bill grants the legendary trail the status it deserves while protecting the rights of private property owners," said Sen. Hutchison. "This designation will help educate visitors and pay homage to the many settlers and celebrated Texans who used El Camino Real de los Tejas in the birth and early days of our state."
   El Camino Real de los Tejas was a corridor of trails used by settlers, immigrants, Indians and the military. The trail is a combination of routes totaling almost 2,600 miles from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo to Natchitoches, Louisiana. It also served as a path for such Texas heroes as Davy Crockett and Sam Houston, who both fought in the struggle for Texas independence from Mexico. 
   "Designation as a National Historic Trail creates greater awareness of the historic importance of an area. It provides communities a great tool for further developing heritage tourism efforts that can result in significant economic boosts for a region," said John L. Nau, III, chairman of the Texas Historical Commission. "Once again Senator Hutchison has done an outstanding job for Texas by introducing key legislation to make certain the oldest trail in Texas is recognized."
   "I believe our efforts today will highlight and preserve an important part of Lone Star history," Sen. Hutchison said.
