SEN. HUTCHISON INTRODUCES LEGISLATION CREATING CHILDHOOD DRINKING PREVENTION SEMI-POSTAL STAMP
  MRS. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation creating the childhood drinking prevention semi-postal stamp.  
   Alcohol is the number one substance used and abused by America's children. Nearly a third of children begin drinking before the age of 13, and forty percent of children who begin drinking by age 15 will develop alcohol abuse or dependence later in life. 
   I do not believe most parents or adults intentionally ignore this issue, however many Americans do not realize the prevalence and seriousness of childhood drinking. Several national surveys, including those conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, demonstrate the serious consequences associated with early alcohol use. 
   For example, in 2002, 1.5 million youths between the ages of 12 to 17 needed treatment for alcohol abuse. Early alcohol use is more likely to kill or injure young people than all illegal drugs combined. 
   If the onset of drinking is delayed, a child's risk of serious alcohol problems could be decreased or even prevented. That is why I am pleased to propose the passage of a semi-postal stamp on childhood drinking prevention. A semi-postal stamp will publicize this important children's health issue in every home, school, and community across the nation. 
   Profits from the childhood drinking prevention stamp would be dedicated to support education and prevention efforts. I would also provide a further platform for millions of Americans to raise awareness about the importance of keeping children alcohol free. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this important legislation.
