SEN. HUTCHISON TO EMBARK ON THREE-DAY EL CAMINO REAL TRAIL COMMEMORATION TOUR
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) will travel across Texas for three days to commemorate the recent designation of El Camino Real de los Tejas as a National Historic Trail. Sen.  
 Hutchison will highlight historic points along the trail and discuss the economic impact this designation will have on the trail communities. Local officials and historical commission members will join the tour at each stop.
   Sen. Hutchison will begin the tour on Monday, March 21, with a kick-off event at El Camino Real Park in Milam. The tour will culminate on Wednesday, March 23, in Eagle Pass with Gov. Martinez of Coahuila, Mexico. In addition, San Augustine, Nacogdoches, Cherokee, Crocket, Madisonville, Caldwell, Giddings, Bastrop, San Marcos, Gruene, San Antonio, Jourdanton, Pearsall and Carrizo Springs will host trail commemoration events throughout the tour.
   Sen. Hutchison worked for three years to achieve the historic designation which was the only such new trail approved in the last session of the 108th Congress.
   The bill designating El Camino Real as a National Historic Trail passed the Senate on September 15, 2004, and the House of Representatives passed the bill 13 days later. It was signed into law by President Bush on October 18, 2004.
   The El Camino Real de los Tejas trail is a combination of routes totaling nearly 2,600 miles from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo to Natchitoches, Louisiana. El Camino Real was a corridor of trails used by settlers, immigrants, Native Americans and the military. It also served as a path for such Texas heroes as Stephen F. Austin, Davy Crockett and Sam Houston, who fought in the struggle for Texas independence from Mexico.
