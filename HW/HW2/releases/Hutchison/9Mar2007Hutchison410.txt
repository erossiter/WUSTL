SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS COURT RULING STRIKING DOWN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GUN BAN
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today applauded a ruling issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in which the court struck down Washington, D.C.'s ban on the use of firearms for self-defense. 
   "I agree with the court that the Constitution guarantees law-abiding citizens the right to bear arms and defend themselves," said Sen. Hutchison. "That is why next week I will reintroduce my legislation to repeal the existing ban. Protection of constitutional rights does not cease when you cross into the borders of the District of Columbia.
   "Not only is Washington, D.C.'s gun ban unconstitutional, but it also has been a public policy failure as seen in the rise in crime since its enactment. The time has finally come to change course."
   The District of Columbia enacted the Firearms and Control Regulations Act in 1975 and has some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation. Prior to the gun ban's implementation, the murder rate in the District was on the decline. Following the ban, the murder rate began to rise and had tripled by 1991, while violent crime was decreasing nationally.
