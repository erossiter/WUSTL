SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES TO REAUTHORIZE PATRIOT ACT, STRENGTHEN PORT SECURITY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today voted to pass the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006. In addition to provisions that improve investigative tools to help thwart terrorist attacks, the legislation includes several new provisions to improve our nation's ability to secure our ports.  
   "This is an important advance in post-9/11 investigative capabilities," Sen. Hutchison said. "The port security provisions in the bill are critical in helping our nation eliminate port vulnerability. They will also provide momentum for passage of more broad port security legislation I have introduced. Our ports must receive the attention needed to help address this weakness in our homeland security efforts."
   Sen. Hutchison sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) on February 24, 2006 urging him to hold a vote on her Shipping Container Security Act, S. 376, following the debate over a United Arab Emirates company planning to take over operations of several major U.S. ports. Key provisions of Sen. Hutchison's legislation include requiring all foreign countries shipping goods to the U.S. to grant access to U.S. inspectors so that containers headed to the U.S. are able to be inspected at their port of origin and developing and implementing a comprehensive plan to increase the number of containers inspected as they enter the United States. 
   A portion of the Patriot Act Conference Report outlines new port security measures. This section, the Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2005, would impose penalties for seaport entry by false pretenses, the obstruction of maritime inspections, terrorist attacks on passenger vehicles and the transport of dangerous materials.
