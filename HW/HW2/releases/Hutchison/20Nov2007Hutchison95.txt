SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $30 MILLION IN GRANTS FOR TEXAS HOSPITALS, CLINICS
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced $31,492,477 in Federal Communications Commission (FCC) grants to help Texas' rural health care groups build high-speed internet networks. 
   "These FCC grants will help provide our Texas health care workers with the tools they need to treat illnesses and save lives," Sen. Hutchison said. "This funding will provide health care physicians with faster access to health records in the event of a medical emergency."
   The funding will help close the gap in technology access between rural and urban health care facilities. Additionally, these grants will allow rural physicians to utilize electronic medical records to more efficiently and cost-effectively manage chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
   The Southwest Telehealth Access Grid will receive $15,561,181 in FCC funding to build its telecommunications network and better distribute telemedicine clinical services and educational and training programs to approximately 60 facilities in Texas, New Mexico and Colorado.
   The Texas Health Information Network Collaboration will receive $11,042,096 to support physician-patient consultations, distance education, medical data management and medical records exchanges.
   The Texas Healthcare Network will receive $4,889,200 to improve an existing network that serves approximately 40 primarily rural health care facilities in the state. I call on our Senate leadership and our House leadership to make it happen."
