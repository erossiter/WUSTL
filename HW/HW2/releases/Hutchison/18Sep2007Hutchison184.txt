  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that Rice University was awarded a $520,000 research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to conduct research on systems for the next generation of the Internet. 
   "The Internet is a driving force of our economy, and this research at Rice will help create the next generation of this vital global network," Sen. Hutchison said.
   According to NSF, Rice University will use this grant to develop new network controls for the next generation of the Internet. Under the direction of Tze Sing Ng, the project will start with a "clean slate" to help create more manageable networks for the Internet. This research provides opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate students and the findings from this effort will be used to create courses on network management.
