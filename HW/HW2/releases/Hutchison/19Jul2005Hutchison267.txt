SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "President Bush has selected a person with a fine legal mind who is respected by his peers and has a reputation for integrity and fairness. 
   "Judge Roberts graduated at the top of his class at Harvard. He honed and developed his judicial skills with help from an incredible teacher when he clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist. He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   "I hope my colleagues in the Senate can recreate that spirit of bipartisanship in the coming weeks. This is a task so important that partisan politics must be set aside. 
   "There is no higher priority facing the Senate than the task of confirming Judge Roberts to the high court. We must make this process fair and free from partisan politics. The Senate should act quickly to ensure he is in place by the first Monday in October."
