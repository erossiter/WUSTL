SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON DEATH OF AL QAEDA LEADER ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chairman of Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today released the following comment on the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi: 
   "I applaud our armed forces in Iraq who have brought this notorious terrorist to justice," Senator Hutchison said. "Zarqawi was capable of the worst imaginable atrocities, including the barbarian execution of innocent American citizens. Last night's successful air strike is evidence of America's firm resolve to win the War on Terror by hunting down terrorists across the globe."
