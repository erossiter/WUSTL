  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement on the loss of United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist: 
   "I am deeply saddened by the passing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Our nation has lost a profound defender of the Constitution and a staunch protector of liberty. Even when his health was failing, he continued his service to the end out of a pure devotion to the institution. He has left behind a legacy of thoughtfulness and quiet intellect. For nearly 19 years, he presided over historic and tumultuous times with grace and equanimity."
