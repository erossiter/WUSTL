SEN. HUTCHISON WRITES TO VA SECRETARY ON RIO GRANDE VALLEY VETERANS
  The Honorable R. James Nicholson 
  Secretary
  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
   Sent via fax
   Dear Secretary Nicholson: 
   Thank you for working with me on our shared mission to provide health care and other benefits earned by our nation's veterans.
   Recently, at my request, you agreed to look at the need for a VA hospital in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. This study will help you and your staff assess the quality of care our Valley veterans are receiving and what gaps in health care may exist. I look forward to reviewing the findings of your study.
   In addition, I have received a letter from Brownsville City Commissioner Ernie L. Hernandez, Jr. The Commissioner wrote that, in Brownsville, there is a former regional hospital with 140 beds that is no longer in use. According to the Commissioner, it was restored by private investors, is fully furnished and has all the equipment necessary to become a full-time hospital. My staff has recently toured this facility with the Commissioner and I would be interested in getting your comments on its potential future use. 
   As the needs of our veterans in the Valley, the entire State of Texas and across the nation continue to grow, I look forward to our continued work together on their behalf. 
   Sincerely,
   Kay Bailey Hutchison
