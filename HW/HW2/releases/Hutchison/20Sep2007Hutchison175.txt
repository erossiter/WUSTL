SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $13.5 MILLION IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT GRANTS FOR TEXAS
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the State of Texas will receive $13.5 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide "Access to Recovery" treatment vouchers for Texans recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. 
   "These 'Access to Recovery' grants will bring a brighter future for Texans facing the harsh reality of addiction," Sen. Hutchison said.
   According to the HHS, under the grant program, Texas Expanding Access to Recovery (TEATR) will extend the current program within the Texas Drug Court Program administered by the Governor's Office. TEATR will extend the geographic reach of the current program from 13 to 18 counties, as well as enhance the faith-based, volunteer-based and community-based components of ATR. In addition, TEATR will include treatment and recovery support to methamphetamine abusers without regard to drug court involvement in all 18 counties.
