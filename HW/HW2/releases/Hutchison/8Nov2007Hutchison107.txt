SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $1 BILLION IN FUNDING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR TEXAS WATER PROJECTS
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that 39 Texas water projects totalling $1,084,570,000 passed as the Senate voted to override President George W. Bush's veto of the 2007 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The veto was overridden by a Senate vote of 79-14. The House overrode President Bush's veto in a 361-54 vote on Tuesday. The bill is now law.
   "This bill will provide a positive benefit to Texas' economy by creating jobs and improving our infrastructure," Sen. Hutchison said. "These projects will ensure that our waterways remain viable for commerce, our communities are protected from floods, and our precious ecosystems are restored." 
   Sen. Hutchison announced that 39 Texas projects, totalling over $1 billion, were approved, including the following:
