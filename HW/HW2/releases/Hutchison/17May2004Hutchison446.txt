WHITE HOUSE SENDS JUSTICE SCHNEIDER'S NOMINATION TO CONGRESS
  President George W. Bush today nominated Texas Supreme Court Justice Michael H. Schneider to fill the state's Eastern District federal judicial seat previously held by the late Judge John H. Hannah, Jr. In February, Sens. Hutchison and John Cornyn sent a recommendation to President Bush that he nominate Justice Schneider for the position. The Eastern District includes Beaumont, Longview, Lufkin, Marshall, Paris, Sherman, Texarkana and Tyler. 
   "For over a quarter-century, Michael Schneider has exemplified the wisdom and integrity we Texans expect from our judges," Sen. Hutchison said. "His performance in office makes him an excellent choice, and I know he will serve with honor and distinction on the federal bench."
   Justice Schneider has over 25 years of judicial experience on both the trial and appellate levels, serving as a justice on the Supreme Court of Texas since 2002. Prior to joining the state's highest court, he was chief justice of the Texas First Court of Appeals from 1996 to 2002, a judge for the 157th District Court of Texas from 1990 to 1996, and a judge for the West University Place Municipal Court from 1978 to 1990. In addition to his service on the bench, Justice Schneider served as assistant district attorney for Harris County, and worked as general solicitor for the southern region of Union Pacific Railroad and general counsel for Bawden Drilling, Inc.
   Justice Schneider earned his bachelor's degree from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1965, a law degree from the University of Houston College of Law in 1971, and a Master's of Law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 2001. He has been honored as Judge of the Year twice by the Texas Association of Civil Trial and Appellate Specialists and by the Houston Police Officers Association.
