SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS WIND ENERGY IN TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, applauded news that Texas has surpassed California as the largest producer of wind energy in the nation. 
   "Texas has always been on the cutting edge of innovation, and that tradition continues with the production of wind energy," Sen. Hutchison said. "Developing alternative sources of electric power combats rising energy costs and is a path toward energy independence."
   According to a report recently issued by the American Wind Energy Association, Texas now has 2,370 megawatts (MW) of capacity -- enough to power over 600,000 average American homes. Texas has added 375 MW so far in 2006, which is 46% of the megawatt capacity brought online nationwide this year.
