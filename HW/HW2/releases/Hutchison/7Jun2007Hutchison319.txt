SEN. HUTCHISON VOTES TO KEEP DEBATE OPEN ON IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, released the following statement today after she voted to keep debate open on S. 1348, the immigration reform bill: 
   "This bill is not yet ready. It never went through committee, and when you write a bill on the floor it takes more time. I want to have the opportunity to introduce an amendment that would take the amnesty out of this bill. I could never vote for cloture until we have the opportunity to address the amnesty issue.
   "I want a good bill that secures the border and creates a temporary worker program without amnesty. I hope we can work on this issue in a positive, productive way and do what is right for our country today, tomorrow, and in the long-term."
