SEN. HUTCHISON PUSHES FOR RISK BASED HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today expressed her concern over the Senate's failure to approve an amendment to allow the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary to allocate funding for homeland security grants based upon risk analysis.  
   "With limited resources, we must ensure that the greatest number of citizens is protected from terrorist attack. There is no room for pork in national security and homeland security," Sen. Hutchison said. "This amendment would ensure grants are distributed to the most vulnerable places in the country in a fiscally responsible way."
   Sen. Hutchison cosponsored the amendment to the 9/11 Commission Bill introduced by Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA).
   "As the 9/11 Commission recommended, homeland security funds should be spent where the threat and consequences are greatest and where the greatest damage would be done to our people and our economy. Terrorists are more likely to target Texas, with 23.5 million residents, densely populated urban areas, large ports, vital industries and 1,240 miles of international borders than smaller, more rural states." 
   The funding allocation directed in the amendment covers the major first-responder grant programs administered by DHS in addition to some grants for seaport and airport security. It also reduced the "small state minimum" to 0.25 percent per state. Current practice requires each state be guaranteed a minimum of 0.75 percent of much of the grant funding. The bill is consistent with 9/11 Commission recommendations to distribute homeland security assistance based upon threat and vulnerability assessments.
