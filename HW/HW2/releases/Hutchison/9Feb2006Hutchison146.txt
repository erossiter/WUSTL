SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEETING WITH BORDER SHERIFFS
  Texas' senior senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), today released the following statement after her meeting with Texas border sheriffs in her office: 
   "I am very pleased with the productive discussion I had with our border sheriffs today. They will continue to keep me apprised of their individual situations and I will help them fund Operation Linebacker in Congress. I will also work to pass my legislation that grants them expanded, but not mandatory, authority to apprehend illegal aliens. Even after 9/11, our nation's borders remain porous. We must take bold action to secure our borders."
