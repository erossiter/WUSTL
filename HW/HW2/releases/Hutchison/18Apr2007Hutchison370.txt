SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN ANNOUNCE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR EASTERN DISTRICT VACANCY
  Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn today announced they have begun the application process to fill the vacancy for the next U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas which includes Beaumont, Lufkin, Tyler, Marshall, Texarkana, Plano, and Sherman. 
   Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn have established a panel of leading attorneys and legal experts in Texas to help identify the most qualified candidates to fill the vacancy created by U.S. Attorney Matt Orwig, who is leaving to become the managing partner at a national firm and open its Dallas office.
   "Texas has a strong record of accomplished legal minds who have answered the call to serve," said Sen. Hutchison, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. "Serving the people of Texas is a noble profession and I look forward to working through the process with those interested in applying."
   "Senator Hutchison and I are committed to finding the best-qualified nominee to serve as the chief federal prosecutor in the Eastern District," said Sen. Cornyn, Vice-Chairman of the Republican Conference, and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "I look forward to the recommendations of the panel of distinguished Texas lawyers, which includes three former U.S. Attorneys."
   Those interested in being considered should submit a résumé and completed questionnaire to both Senators by no later than Wednesday, May 2, 2007. Use of express mail is strongly recommended because of delays due to the enhanced security procedures involving Congressional mail.
   The questionnaire is available on Sen. Hutchison's website: hutchison.senate.gov. It is also available on Sen. Cornyn's website at cornyn.senate.gov.
   Further information may be obtained from Sen. Hutchison's office at (202) 224-5922 or from Sen. Cornyn's Judiciary Committee office at (202) 224-7840.
