SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $64 MILLION TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS IN TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced $64 million to combat homelessness in Texas. Sen.  
 Hutchison unveiled the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants alongside HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson at the Star of Hope Mission in Houston.
   The funds can be applied to basic shelter needs, transitional housing, permanent housing, job training, health care and other support services.
   "These funds are not a handout - they're a road map to preventing chronic homelessness in the future," Sen. Hutchison said. "While some of the funds will be applied to immediate needs, others will support job training and homeless prevention programs that put people to work and keep them off the streets."
   President George W. Bush began his fight to end chronic homelessness over two years ago. HUD is allocating a total of $1.4 billion nationally to more than 4,000 organizations to fight homelessness. "I applaud President Bush's compassion, especially during a time of such fiscal restraint," Sen. Hutchison added.
