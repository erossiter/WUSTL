SEN. HUTCHISON NAMED MR. SOUTH TEXAS 2005
  Citing her decade of work in the United States Senate on behalf of Texas communities, the Washington's Birthday Celebration Association (WBCA) today announced it was naming Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) "Mr. South Texas" for 2005. 
   According to the WBCA, since 1952 the group has bestowed the esteemed award upon individuals each year for their contributions to the growth and development of the area. Previous recipients of the award include President George W. Bush, former Senator Phil Gramm, former Lieutenant Governor William P. Hobby, and the Honorable Anne Armstrong, along with local leaders like the Cigarroa family and state Senator Judith Zaffirini. Sen. Hutchison will be inducted into Los Caballeros de la Republica del Rio Grande, and presented with the Caballero Medallion at the Mr. South Texas Luncheon this winter.
   "I am deeply grateful for this tremendous honor and humbled to be among so many important Texas historical figures," Sen. Hutchison said. "For years I have worked with local leaders to make South Texas an even better place to live and call home."
   Senator Hutchison has consistently been an ally of South Texas, making the needs of its citizens a top priority throughout her career.
   * Water - The Senator has secured millions of dollars to better conserve the water we have in South Texas and to compensate farmers suffering the effects of the shortage. 
   * Economic Development - Strengthening the region's economy has been a priority. Sen. Hutchison won approval for millions of dollars throughout her career for San Antonio's military-industrial complex, Corpus Christi's Packery Channel project, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, among many other job creators. 
   * Colonias - She was the first to champion colonia clean-up efforts and has obtained over $615 million in colonia improvement funding, including the first federal appropriation in 1993, and later introduced legislation that would restrict their growth. 
   * Transportation - Sen. Hutchison has been a tireless advocate of South Texas transportation needs, winning federal clearance and millions of dollars for the Brownsville West Rail relocation project as well as authorization and $7.4 million for the I-69 trade corridor. She supports the Ports of Corpus Christi and Brownsville. She also has authored a Borders and Corridors bill to ensure states whose roads bear the brunt of international commerce receive a more equitable share of federal funding. 
   She has been a co-chair of the Hispanic Serving Institution Caucus, securing millions for these colleges that seek to expand higher education for Hispanic American students. 
   Over the past 100 years, the Washington's Birthday Celebration in Laredo has become legendary, marking community traditions and promoting greater understanding between the people of the Americas. It also generates national and international affection for the unique culture and rich history of Laredo.
