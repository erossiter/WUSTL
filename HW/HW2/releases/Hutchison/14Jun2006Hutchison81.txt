SEN. HUTCHISON COSPONSORS BILL TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM SEXUAL PREDATORS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, announced that the Stop Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Youth (SAFETY) Act, has been introduced in the Senate. Sen. Hutchison is a cosponsor of the bill, which focuses on halting the distribution of child pornography over the Internet. 
   "The Internet has revolutionized communication and commerce, however, it cannot be a shelter for those who commit heinous crimes against our children," Sen. Hutchison said. "This legislation will better equip law enforcement officials to bring to justice those who create, distribute and provide access to child pornography." 
   Under the SAFETY Act, introduced by Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), financial support of child pornography and operation of a child pornography enterprise would become federal crimes. In addition, it increases existing penalties for child pornography, child prostitution and sex trafficking and provides law enforcement officials with enhanced resources to prosecute crimes against children. The bill also creates a federal Office of Sexual Violence and Crimes against Children in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). 
   According to the DOJ, reports of child pornography increased more than 30-fold in the period between 1998 and 2004. In 2003 alone, more than 20,000 images of child pornography were posted on the Internet each week.
