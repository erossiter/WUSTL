SENATE PASSES KEY ENERGY TAX PROVISIONS BACKED BY SEN. HUTCHISON
  Significant energy tax provisions authored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) passed the U.S Senate as part of the JOBS Act on Tuesday evening.  
   "Since I came to the Senate a decade ago, I have advocated a national energy policy," Sen. Hutchison said. "These tax provisions are the first step toward passing a comprehensive plan to create jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign energy." 
   The bill includes key elements authored by Sen. Hutchison, such as marginal well tax credits, delay rental payment amortization and geological and geothermal (G&G) expensing. The marginal well tax credits will provide a reasonable safety net so that small, independent producers stay in business when prices fall. "These provisions will keep small producers competitive, encourage investment and keep jobs in America," Sen. Hutchison said.
   Sen. Hutchison noted the bill also provides a tax credit for alternative, renewable fuels including wind, solar and geothermal power. "Wind energy is especially critical to Texas, one of the nation's leaders in this growing field. It provides a reliable and meaningful energy source to West Texas and is an important part of the manufacturing industry in East Texas," she said.
