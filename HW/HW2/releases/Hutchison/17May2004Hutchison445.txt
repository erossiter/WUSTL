SENATE VOTES TO PROVIDE NEEDED HEALTH BENEFITS IN DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  The U.S. Senate today passed an amendment to the Department of Defense (DoD) Authorization Act introduced by Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) that provides service academy cadets, midshipmen and senior Reserve Office Training Corps (ROTC) cadets improved access to health care when injured during military training. 
   "Cadets, midshipmen and officer candidates should receive health care when they are injured in training," Sen. Hutchison said. "These young men and women have demonstrated their commitment to serving our country, and we should honor their dedication and service."
   Current law, established in the Career Compensation Act of 1949, denies academy cadets and midshipmen the disability benefits provided to all other members of the regular armed forces. Specifically, with respect to health benefits, cadets and midshipmen who are separated for medical disability after being injured during military training, face unnecessary and unfair burdens in maintaining continuity of healthcare. 
   In addition, ROTC cadets are in many cases required to pay for their own medical care after being injured during military training. This condition exists even though ROTC cadets are covered under the Office of Workers Compensation (OWC) within the Department of Labor. Medical care providers, many of whom have not been compensated for their prior work, often decline to treat ROTC patients with OWC unless they use private medical insurance.
   The amendment will provide health and dental benefits for service academy cadets and midshipmen by including them in the military disability discharge and retirement system. It would also transfer medical claims responsibility for ROTC cadets from the Department of Labor OWC program to the Department of Defense and would authorize the use of supplemental health care program funds by the TRICARE Management Agency, improving access to care.
