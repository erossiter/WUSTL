SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today issued the following statement on the passing of President Ronald Reagan:
   "Today we lost the father of the modern conservative movement. At a time of despair, Ronald Reagan restored optimism and hope to America. An unequaled champion of freedom, smaller government, and market-oriented principles, he has always been an inspiration to me. Perhaps most importantly, this happy warrior faced the gravest threat of his time and made the difficult decisions that ultimately won the Cold War. The Gipper may be gone, but his legacy and influence on our nation will live on forever."
