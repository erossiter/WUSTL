SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $269,025 RESEARCH GRANT FOR UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the University of Houston was awarded a $269,025 research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to study the Antarctic Peninsula. 
   "These NSF funds will support efforts at the University of Houston to expand our knowledge and understanding of the world we live in," Sen. Hutchison said.
   This award supports a research cruise to perform geologic studies in the area under and surrounding the former Larsen B ice shelf, on the Antarctic Peninsula. The project will characterize the Larsen ice shelf's history and the conditions leading to its collapse which could further reveal the oceanographic and atmospheric effects of climate change.
