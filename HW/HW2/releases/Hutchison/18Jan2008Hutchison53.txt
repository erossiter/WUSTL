SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $2.1 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR TORNADO SHELTERS IN EAST TEXAS
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Texas' senior senator, today announced over $2.1 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Grants to construct community shelters in the East Texas towns of Henderson and Center. 
   "We have soundly learned that preparation is the best protection against natural disasters," Sen. Hutchison said. "Though disasters can't be adequately predicted, we can make sure that East Texas communities have the resources to protect lives and mitigate damage when they do strike."
   According to DHS, $1,048,958 in federal funding will go toward constructing a 25,367 square foot structure in Henderson. $1,101,600 will go toward constructing a 24,789 square foot structure in Center and will contain a main civic hall, breakout room and a "hardened" safe room shelter. Both structures will be capable of providing "near absolute protection" from an F-5 tornado.
