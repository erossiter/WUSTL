SEN. HUTCHISON DELIVERS REMARKS AT LBJ BUILDING NAMING CEREMONY
  Texas' senior U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today delivered remarks at a ceremony to rename the U.S. Department of Education headquarters building the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building, in honor the nation's 36th president and a proud Texan. 
   "As a Texan, I am proud to have led this effort to honor President Johnson," Sen. Hutchison said. "It is a fitting tribute to this small town Texas teacher who went on to become known as our 'Education President,' and signed over 60 far-reaching education bills." 
   Sen. Hutchison sponsored legislation to rename the building in recognition of President Johnson's contributions to American education. H.R. 584 was signed into law by President Bush on March 23, 2007.
