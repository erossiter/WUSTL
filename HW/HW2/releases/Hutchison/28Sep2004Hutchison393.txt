SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES NEW FUNDS SECURED FOR PACKERY CHANNEL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison announced today that the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to redirect $909,100 to pay for critical flood control and dredging work at the Corpus Christi Packery Channel.  
 The money comes from a discretionary account at the Corps for projects that meet the qualifications to continue despite a temporary shortfall. This funding will help keep contractors on the job and enable the project to be completed ahead of schedule.
   The Senator is a longtime supporter of the Packery Channel initiative, winning more than $2.3 million for it in the fiscal year 2004 budget. Earlier this year, Senator Hutchison was notified of the funding shortfall, at which point she contacted senior Corps officials and urged them to reallocate resources to the waterway that would otherwise go unused. She is working to secure the necessary funding to complete the project.
   "The Packery Channel is vital to the economic development of Corpus Christi. Dredging allows greater flood control protection, defending both residents and property," Senator Hutchison said. "I appreciate the cooperation of the Corps of Engineers in this funding effort. This project is one of my top priorities and I am committed to its completion."
