PRESIDENT SIGNS BILL TO RAISE PILOT RETIREMENT AGE TO 65
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), who has been named Ranking Member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, announced that legislation raising the retirement age for domestic airline pilots from 60 to 65 has become law. 
   H.R. 4343, the Fair Treatment for Experience Pilots Act, raises the mandatory retirement age from 60 years to 65 years for pilots serving on commercial passenger flights in the U.S.
   "Today healthy Americans are living and working productively much later in life," said Sen. Hutchison. Our safest, most experienced pilots have been sidelined because of an outdated standard set in 1959. Now, they can keep delivering passengers safely to their destinations."
   The Senate version of the bill, S. 65, was introduced by Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) and included a large number of Senators from both parties.
   On Dec. 5, Sen. Hutchison was named Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, taking over for Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS) who will resign before the end of this year.
