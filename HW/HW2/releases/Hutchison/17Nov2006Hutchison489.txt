SEN. HUTCHISON HONORS HISPANIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the U.S. Senate has passed S. Res. 608, a resolution she introduced recognizing the contributions of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in higher education. 
   "Hispanic-Serving Institutions are key members of our higher education system and provide crucial academic opportunities for students," said Sen. Hutchison. "I am proud that the U.S. Senate has honored the efforts of more than 400 institutions associated with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities." 
   Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, organized and serves as the co-chair of the Hispanic-Serving Institutions Coalition in the Senate. Under her leadership, HSI funding has increased more than 800 percent since Fiscal Year 1995. This funding has allowed more of the 42 HSIs in Texas to receive development grants. Sen. Hutchison also helped secure more than $94.9 million for HSIs in the Senate Fiscal Year 2007 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill. 
   The resolution introduced by Sen. Hutchison recognizes the national role of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities as an advocate and champion for Hispanic higher education and congratulates the organization on its 20th anniversary. The resolution further applauds HSIs for their work to provide quality education for all students and encourages the institutions and their supporters to continue their outstanding efforts.
   The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities was founded in San Antonio, Texas with 18 founding member institutions. The organization has grown to include 207 certified HSIs, 126 associate members, 79 partners and over 45 institutions in Latin America, Spain and Portugal. Certified HSIs currently enroll more than half of all Hispanic students in college.
