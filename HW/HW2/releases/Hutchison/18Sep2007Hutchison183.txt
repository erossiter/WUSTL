SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $598,000 RESEARCH GRANT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the University of Houston was awarded a $598,000 research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to award scholarships to economically disadvantaged engineering students. 
   "These NSF funds will provide scholarships and expand available services for deserving students at the University of Houston," Sen. Hutchison said.
   This grant will support the S-STEM scholarship program at the University of Houston, under the direction of Dr. Karolos Grigoriadis. According to NSF, the University of Houston will use this grant to award scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students in the university's accelerated BS/Graduate engineering program. The scholarships will allow students to complete a non-thesis graduate program or to conduct research in an area of personal interest, rather than in an area of available funding.
