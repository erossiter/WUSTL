SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $3.5 MILLION AWARDED TO AUSTIN AREA AIRPORTS
  The City of Austin has been awarded $3.5 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for Austin-Bergstrom International Airport to help them acquire land to meet day-night sound level (DNL) compatibility, Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) announced today.
   "These funds will directly improve the quality of life for Texans living nearby Austin-Bergstrom International Airports," Sen. Hutchison said. "The acquisition of lands encircling the airport will provide a buffer to absorb noise and allow Hill Country residents to better enjoy their beautiful surroundings."
   The DNL calculates the cumulative exposure of residents to airport noise. It is based upon numerous variables including flight paths, type of aircraft and the number of flights. Night flights are weighted as louder than daytime flights. The DNL is the standard used by the Federal Aviation Administration in measuring the noise impact of an airport on surrounding communities.
