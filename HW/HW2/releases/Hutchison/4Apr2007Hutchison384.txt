SEN. HUTCHISON DISCUSSES COMPETITIVENESS, RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT AT TAMEST NANOTECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today discussed the success and achievements of The Academy of Medicine, Engineering, and Science of Texas (TAMEST) at a nanotechnology conference held by the organization. Sen. Hutchison is the founder and honorary chairman of TAMEST.  
   "TAMEST fosters collaboration, recognizes Texas' brightest minds and is helping our state become a leader in exciting new fields like nanotechnology," Sen. Hutchison said. "This close interaction leads to scientific breakthroughs and helps bring more research dollars to our universities, colleges and medical schools." 
   In 2000, after learning that Texas universities ranked sixth nationally in federal research and development dollars, Senator Hutchison set out to obtain for the state a greater share of those funds. Her strategy focused on three parts: hosting annual conferences in Washington to help academics identify new research opportunities, encouraging colleges and universities to establish centers of excellence to specialize in unique fields and urging the schools to jointly pursue projects. 
   TAMEST consists of the state's 11 Nobel Laureates and over 200 members of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences dedicated to increasing national awareness of and funding for research and development at Texas colleges and universities.
