SEN. HUTCHISON SUPPORTS EARMARK REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today continued her support for earmark reform by welcoming the recommendations offered by the Republican Fiscal Reform Working Group to improve transparency and accountability. 
   "I support these recommendations because they offer real reform," said Sen. Hutchison. "With these provisions we could reduce the federal deficit by striking unnecessary earmarks, increase transparency by requiring all earmarks be placed in bill text and made available online, and require Senators and the administration to be equally accountable for all earmarks, whether in the President's requests or those made by Members of Congress."
   Sen. Hutchison is the senior Senator from Texas and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
