SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEVELOPMENT, RELIEF AND EDUCATION FOR ALIEN MINORS ACT
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today released the following statement on her vote to invoke cloture on the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act: 
   "I support the goal of encouraging college education for children whose parents brought them into America illegally, but it is unfair to reward the children of undocumented workers and favor them over the children of legal residents. Today I voted to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate for debate, with the commitment that there is still the opportunity to change the Durbin bill and gain bipartisan consensus.
   "Though the motion to proceed failed, I will continue to work for fair and comprehensive border security and immigration reform."
