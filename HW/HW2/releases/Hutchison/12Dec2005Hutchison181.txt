SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON RESUMPTION OF BEEF TRADE WITH JAPAN
  Texas' senior Sen., Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), today lauded Japan's decision to resume trading beef with the United States.  
 In December of 2003, Japan banned U.S. beef from its market after the discovery of the first BSE-infected cow in the U.S. Since trade was cut off, Sen. Hutchison has met with the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. and has also urged President Bush and the Secretary of Agriculture to take action against Japan in an effort to have the ban lifted. She also wrote to the U.S. Trade Representative asking him to impose economic sanctions on Japan if the country did not resume trade. Her statement follows:
   "I am pleased that Japan has finally heeded our call and lifted its ban. This ban was unnecessary and harmed our nation's ranchers and cattlemen. Today's action should be a model for other Asian countries whose markets remain closed to U.S. beef. The United States, particularly in Texas, produces the world's finest and safest beef. I will continue to work to ensure our producers enjoy open markets throughout Asia."
