SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS RECOVERY OF STOLEN VA COMPUTER DATA
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today commended the recovery of the stolen VA laptop that contained personal data of millions of veterans and active duty personnel. 
   "The recovery of this stolen data should come as a great relief to the veterans and military personnel whose personal financial information was threatened," Sen. Hutchison said. "While we have yet to learn if the data has been compromised, I applaud the efforts of federal, state and local law enforcement officials who recovered the missing computer. Our veterans have served to protect our nation, and we must ensure that their personal information is secure and protected in the future."
   As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing the Department of Veterans Affairs, Sen. Hutchison will use her leadership position to ensure the department has the necessary resources to protect the welfare of our veterans. 
   Sen. Hutchison introduced several amendments that were passed as part of the Defense Authorization Bill to provide financial and personal data protection for veterans and service members. She offered an amendment with Senators George Allen (R-VA) and Larry Craig (R-ID) to provide financial protection to the 26.5 million veterans and active duty military personnel whose personal data and Social Security information was contained on the recovered laptop. 
   Sen. Hutchison also introduced an amendment requiring the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct a study and report on the feasibility of developing an alternative to printing an individual's Social Security number on their DOD-issued military identification card. In 1967, the military services directed all services to start using an individual's Social Security number in place of a separate service serial number.
