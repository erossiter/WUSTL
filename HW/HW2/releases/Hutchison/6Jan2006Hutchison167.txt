SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY COMBAT SYSTEM TO BE LOCATED AT FORT BLISS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Army's Evaluation Brigade Combat Team (EBCT) will be located at Fort Bliss.  
 The EBCT unit will be tasked with evaluating the Future Combat System (FCS), the Army's leading-edge modernization program, and will bring new, high-tech job opportunities to the community. 
   "With its vast air space and maneuver capabilities, Fort Bliss was the clear choice for the location of the Army's modernization program. This announcement is a tremendous step forward in the modernization of our Armed Forces that will reduce threats to our soldiers serving on the ground," Sen. Hutchison said. "The system will serve as a magnet, drawing other high-tech programs to the area and the Fort Bliss community will benefit from new job opportunities this program will create. Fort Bliss will help lead our country in meeting the new challenges of the 21st Century." 
   The Secretary of the Army, Dr. Francis Harvey, notified Sen. Hutchison of the Army's decision in a Thursday afternoon conversation after she had been working for months with the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Peter J. Schoomaker, and other Pentagon officials to support funding for the system and present Fort Bliss as the best and most logical location for the FCS evaluation program.
   FCS is the Army's modernization program and the selection of the EBCT mission location shows the Army is progressing with its modernization effort to meet new challenges of the 21st Century. Fort Bliss has over three million acres, the largest useable airspace and best maneuver areas in the continental U.S.
