SEN. HUTCHISON ELECTED AS CHAIRMAN OF REPUBLICAN POLICY COMMITTEE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today was elected by her Republican colleagues to serve as the Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee during the 110th Congress. Currently serving as the Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, a position she has held since 2001, Sen. Hutchison ran unopposed for the Policy Chair position, the fourth highest Republican leadership post. 
   "I am honored to receive such overwhelming support from my colleagues to serve as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. I look forward to working with the new leadership team to renew our party's commitment to our core principles of freedom, limited government, a strong national defense and lower taxes," Sen. Hutchison said. "We must promote health care reform, social security reform and tax reform to continue to grow the economy and to protect middle-class families from burdensome new tax levies favored by the Democrat majority."
   Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who was elected to serve as Senate Minority Leader, also commented on Sen. Hutchison's leadership position.
   "Sen. Hutchison was reelected to her third term with more votes than any other Republican senator. Her outreach to diverse groups during her role as Conference Vice Chairman demonstrates a focus on implementing policies that benefit small business owners, farmers, veterans, seniors and all working Americans. She will continue to be an integral part of our leadership effort, and I couldn't be happier to have such an effective leader on the team."
