SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR $3.1 BILLION TO FUND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that Congress has approved the remaining $3.1 billion Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) funding as part of the emergency supplemental bill. Sen. Hutchison fought to include the funding in the Continuing Resolution (CR) that passed in February 2007. However, it was cut from that bill. Her continued determination ensured that the BRAC funds were included in the supplemental passed tonight. 
   "This is great news for Texas because our troops and their families are finally getting the funding they need," Sen. Hutchison said. "This bill represents an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars into military construction projects in Texas.
   Passage of the bill today means that the full Fiscal Year 2007 funding for facilities for troops and their families has been approved. The funding includes $741 million Sen. Hutchison helped secure for Texas Base improvements.
  BRAC projects at Texas bases that will now be fully funded include:
   * More than $455 million for Fort Bliss infrastructure improvements;
   * More than $109 million for Fort Sam Houston; 
   * $35 million for the Grand Prairie Armed Forces Reserve Center;
   * $44 million for the Camp Bullis Armed Forces Reserve Center;
   * $28 million for a Medical Administrative Center and an Intelligence Operations Center at Lackland Air Force Base; 
   * More than $25 million for Laughlin Air Force Base; 
   $19.5 million for the Seagoville Armed Forces Reserve Centers;
   * More than $20 million for improvements at NAS/JRB Fort Worth and Carswell Air Reserve Station; and
   * More than $4 million for Randolph Air Force Base improvements.
