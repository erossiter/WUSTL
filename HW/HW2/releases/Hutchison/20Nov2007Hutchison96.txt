SEN. HUTCHISON CONGRATULATES HOUSTON DYNAMO ON SECOND STRAIGHT MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER LEAGUE TITLE
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today released the following statement to congratulate the Houston Dynamo on their second straight Major League Soccer (MLS) Championship: 
   "I just want to congratulate Coach Dominic Kinnear and the Houston Dynamo on their second straight MLS Cup. Their achievement brings pride and excitement to the city of Houston, and is the culmination of so much hard work, perseverance, and skill. It's clear how difficult it is to win back-to-back MLS championships since no team has done it since 1997.
   "This organization has now won two championships in their first two years in Houston after moving from San Jose, an incredible feat. I wish them the best of luck on making it three in a row."
