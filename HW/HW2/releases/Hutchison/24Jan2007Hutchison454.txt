SEN. HUTCHISON CALLS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF TO BALANCE MINIMUM WAGE BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today made the following statement on the Senate vote to pass a minimum wage bill without including important protections for small businesses:
   "Small businesses are the backbone of our fast-growing economy and employ the vast majority of American workers. Experts agree that increasing labor costs without providing tax and regulatory relief will kill jobs and harm those we are most trying to help. I will support the minimum wage increase, as I have before, when it is balanced with small business relief."
