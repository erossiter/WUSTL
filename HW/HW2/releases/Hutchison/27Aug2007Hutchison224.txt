SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) released a statement today on the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: 
   "I have known Alberto Gonzales for many years, going back to his service to our state as a member of the Texas Supreme Court, Texas Secretary of State and as General Counsel to the Governor.
   "Alberto grew up from modest beginnings in San Antonio and Humble, Texas and was an honor student in Harris County. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for four years, before completing his education at Rice University in Houston. A Harvard-trained lawyer, Alberto was the first Hispanic Attorney General of the United States.
   "I thank Alberto Gonzales for his years of service to our country in the military, the judiciary, the White House and as the nation's top law enforcement officer. He has served in difficult times and I believe is a good, honest man who has worked hard in public service all his life.
   "I wish Alberto, his wife Rebecca, and their three sons the best in the future."
   Sen. Hutchison is a member of the Senate Republican Leadership as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and is currently serving her third term in the U.S. Senate.
