  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the American College of Emergency Physicians, headquartered in Irving, TX, was awarded a $1,154,224 grant through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Competitive Training Grant Program to create a Web-based program for disaster response training. 
   "The proper coordination of resources is key to an effective disaster response, and this grant will help state and local officials improve their response through specialized training," Sen. Hutchison said. 
   According to DHS, the American College of Emergency Physicians will provide Web-based training for state and local officials in 18 states on the processes to develop and maintain detailed and effective pre-incident plans to ensure the efficient distribution of patients, sharing of information and resources, and coordination of roles and responsibilities of state and local agencies involved in responding to disaster victims.
   The Competitive Training Grant Program awards funds to competitively selected applicants to develop and deliver training programs addressing high priority national homeland security training needs. The program supports training initiatives that are national in scope and further the DHS mission of preparing the nation to prevent, protect against, respond to and recover from incidents of terrorism and catastrophic events.
