SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN WORK TO SECURE FUTUREGEN SITE IN TEXAS
  Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn renewed their commitment to bringing FutureGen Alliance, Inc. - a public-private venture with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build the world's first near-zero emissions fossil energy facility - to Texas. The announcement follows FutureGen's release this week of the final Request for Proposal (RFP) which will start the competitive, host site selection process. 
   "Bringing the FutureGen site to Texas will help our state secure its role as a national leader in the energy field and create new job opportunities," Sen. Hutchison said. "I look forward to leading Texas' efforts to host this initiative that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make energy more affordable. Texas is the nation's largest consumer of coal, making it a logical choice for this federal energy initiative." 
   "FutureGen represents the innovative technologies that our country must pursue to adequately meet our growing energy needs and remain good stewards of the environment," Sen. Cornyn said. "Texas's geology, workforce, and energy leadership make it an ideal location for this forward-looking project. As we work together with state leaders and Congressional Delegation, I am confident that Texas will rise to the top in the national competition." 
   FutureGen is a $1 billion public-private venture to build the world's first near-zero-emissions fossil fuel energy facility. Cosponsored by the Alliance and the DOE, the FutureGen project will gasify coal to generate electricity and produce hydrogen, capturing and storing carbon dioxide in deep geologic formations.
   As both a power plant and research facility, FutureGen will demonstrate the technical and economic viability of clean power generation from coal. The technologies refined and commercialized at this 275-megawatt prototype power plant will lead to the deployment of similar clean energy facilities across the nation and help to shape the global energy future.
   States competing to be chosen as the host site for the FutureGen facility must submit their proposals to the Alliance by May 4, 2006, according to the submission deadline outlined in the final RFP. The Alliance will announce a Candidate Site List, consisting of those sites that are best qualified to host the FutureGen facility, in the summer of 2006. Texas' leadership began preparing the state's bid to host FutureGen immediately after President Bush announced the FutureGen Initiative in 2003.
