SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $11 IN FEMA RELIEF FUNDING FOR TEXAS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced FEMA is awarding a total of $11,247,749 in federal grants to the state of Texas for the costs associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. A breakdown of the grant awards is listed below. 
   "Texas opened its doors to thousands of Hurricane Katrina victims and offered housing, healthcare and schools for displaced students," Sen. Hutchison said. "This is another positive step as we continue to work for additional reimbursement funding for the heavy costs associated with both Gulf Coast hurricanes that have affected Texas." 
   * $1,320,824 to the Adjutant General's Department. This grant provides reimbursement to the Adjutant General's Department for additional labor costs not previously reimbursed on the previous project worksheet. The labor was incurred by the deployment of the Texas National Guard in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
   * $2,100,000 to Bell County. This grant provides reimbursement to Bell County for interim housing of evacuees of Hurricane Katrina. Costs included are unit rental, utilities, unit deposits, furniture and household goods and management costs.
   * $5,464,852 to the city of San Antonio. This grant provides reimbursement to the city of San Antonio for costs of managing several large shelters, including contracts for leased facilities, equipment and services, food and supplies to support the shelters for evacuees from impacted states as a result of Hurricane Katrina. 
   * $2,362,073 to the Texas Building & Procurement Commission. This grant provides reimbursement to Texas Building & Procurement Commission for costs incurred for transportation of evacuees by air travel and bus travel as well as force account overtime labor and materials associated with sheltering evacuees from impacted states as a result of Hurricane Katrina. 
   Sen. Hutchison has been working in the Senate on passage of the third emergency supplemental bill that includes funding for Texas in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita which the House passed December 18. The Senate is expected to pass the funding - which is attached to the final version of the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Bill - today or Wednesday and will send it to be signed by President Bush.
   Sen. Hutchison's major effort is to "assure Hurricane Rita victims are not forgotten as we work to meet the requirements of Katrina victims."
   Sen. Hutchison helped secure Texas' eligibility for its share of the following in the supplemental bill:
   * $645 million for cost of educating displaced students (authorized up to $6,000 per- student and $7,500 for special needs students); 
   * $350 million for the Army Corp of Engineers for repairs and dredging in hurricane-affected states; 
   * $125 million in grants for the Department of Labor for displaced workers; 
   * $550 million in Social Services Block Grants; 
   * $90 million for Head Start for children displaced by hurricanes; 
   * $11.5 billion for Community Development Block Grants in hurricane-affected states; 
   * $390 million for Section 8 housing vouchers; 
   * $125 million for state and local law enforcement assistance; 
   * $2.75 billion for highway, road and bridge repairs; 
   * $441 million for Small Business Administration Disaster Loan Program; 
   * $4.5 million for manufacturing extension centers; 
   In an effort to keep these emergency necessities from adding more to the deficit, the bill is fully offset - or paid for - by reallocating existing FEMA funds and making a one-percent across-the-board cut in federal spending. However, Sen. Hutchison personally ensured exemption from the cuts for the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
