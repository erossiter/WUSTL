SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON EXTENSION OF FAA REAUTHORIZATION
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member on the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, released the following statement today on the extension of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization, which passed tonight by unanimous consent: 
   "While I am pleased with our work today, I am disappointed we could not provide more stability in the system by completing a longer-term extension through September 30, 2008, which is the end of the Fiscal Year. As legislators, it is our responsibility to create stability and predictability in our infrastructure system. We cannot allow our lack of action to disturb the modernization efforts and the flow of funds to our aviation system.
   "Thankfully, the extension we passed today will provide immediate funding and spending authority as well as a valuable cushion for the Senate to work on the overarching FAA Reauthorization bill.
   "I am looking forward to working with my friend and distinguished colleague Sen. Jay Rockefeller to complete a multi-year FAA Reauthorization bill. We have several challenges ahead of us, and we will attempt to come together in a bipartisan way to meet those challenges. The extension we passed today is just the first step in what will be a very important year for aviation policy."
