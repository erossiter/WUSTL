SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENDS $46 MILLION FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AT FORT HOOD
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, today commended President Bush for including in his fiscal year 2006 budget request $46.4 million for military construction at Fort Hood. 
   "I applaud the president for making Fort Hood a priority," Sen. Hutchison said. "With this budget request, the president has signaled his vote of confidence for Fort Hood and I will do everything possible to see that these requests are met in Congress."
   Ft. Hood received the following requests in the president's budget:
   * $6.6 million for battalion command and control facilities
   * $4.1 million for a fire station
   * $8 million for a multipurpose squadron qualifying course 
   * $6.1 million for a qualification training range
   * $21.6 million for a vehicle maintenance shop 
   "President Bush has done a great job of delivering a fiscally responsible budget and still delivering for our military men and women," Sen. Hutchison added. "Some of the thousands of troops coming home from Europe may be going to Fort Hood, so these requests are all the more important."
