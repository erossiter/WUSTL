SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $518 MILLION NAVY CONTRACT AWARD TO SEALY-BASED STEWART, STEVENSON
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that Sealy-based Stewart and Stevenson Tactical Vehicle Systems, Inc. has won a $518 million contract award from the U.S. Department of Navy for 1,170 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles. 
   "This is a significant contract win for one of our leading Texas companies dedicated to protecting our troops from improvised explosive devices," said Sen. Hutchison.
   The Army and Navy have developed an MRAP combat vehicle fleet capable of sustained operations in a chaotic, mine-infested, non-linear battlespace.
   The work will be conducted in Sealy, Texas and it is estimated the work will be completed by the end of February 2008.
   According to their website, "Stewart & Stevenson is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of specialized equipment and a leading provider of aftermarket parts and service to the oil and gas and other industries that we have served for over 100 years. Headquartered in Houston, Texas since 1902, (S&S) operates from a network of 53 strategic locations."
