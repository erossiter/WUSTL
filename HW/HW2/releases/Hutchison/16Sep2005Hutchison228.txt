SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $1 MILLION AWARDED TO TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $1,085,000 has been awarded to the Texas Department of Public Safety, for the 2005 National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP), by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.  
   "The safety and protection of our citizens is vital to our communities," said Sen. Hutchison. "I am pleased the Texas Department of Public Safety will receive these critical funds necessary to improve the safety of our families." 
   The goal of NCHIP is to improve the nation's safety and security by enhancing the quality, completeness and accessibility of criminal history record information and by insuring the nationwide implementation of criminal justice and non-criminal justice background check systems. 
   The funds will be used to develop the Texas Sex Offender Registration Database. They will also be used for web services and file upload gateway project to allow larger agencies in the state to electronically update and verify sex offender registration information - a process which now relies largely on paper methods.
