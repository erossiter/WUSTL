SENS. HUTCHISON, MIKULSKI RECOGNIZED IN SPACE NEWS' TOP 10 WHO MADE DIFFERENCE LIST
  Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), the senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, have been included in Space News' "10 Who Made a Difference in Space" list. 
   According to Space News, the people on this year's list have made decisions that collectively changed the status quo in the space community and most likely the future direction of civil, military and commercial space programs. Space News recognized the joint efforts of Senators Hutchison and Mikulski to change the debate over NASA's budget.
   "It is imperative that we provide the funding necessary for America to continue its leadership in space exploration," Sen. Hutchison said. "Our support for NASA must reflect the importance we place on space exploration and its contribution to research and national security."
   Senators Hutchison and Mikulski successfully introduced a $1 billion NASA funding amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill in July. The amendment provides funds to reimburse NASA for the costs of returning to flight following the Shuttle Columbia disaster and implementation of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board recommendations. The funds will also provide relief for NASA facilities damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Vital research was being cut to fund emergency repairs; the additional funds will restore core missions for NASA science.
   In addition, the amendment provides $40 million for repairs to the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and the Michoud Assembly in New Orleans, which were damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The funds will also provide critical support for flight operations at Houston's Johnson Space Center.
