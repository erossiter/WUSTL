SEN. HUTCHISON: SENATE SHOULD OFFER MUKASEY AN EXPEDITIOUS HEARING
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, issued the following statement on the nomination of retired federal judge Michael B. Mukasey for Attorney General:
   "Judge Mukasey appears to be a fine choice for Attorney General. I believe the Senate should expeditiously begin confirmation hearings and offer this nominee a fair vote on the floor so the DOJ has a duly confirmed Attorney General to lead this vital department."
