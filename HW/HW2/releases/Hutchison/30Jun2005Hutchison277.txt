  Following NASA's announcement today that July 13 has been approved as the Return to Flight launch date for Shuttle Discovery, Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Space, applauded the announcement and said she will attend the launch. 
   "I am pleased NASA has approved a return to flight date and I look forward to attending the launch that will mark an important milestone in space exploration for the United States," Chairman Hutchison said. "It took a great deal of hard work and dedication by NASA to get us safely back in flight and leading the world in exploration.
