SENS. HUTCHISON, LANDRIEU HOST 'TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS TO WORK DAY'
  Today Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA) hosted an assembly of Senate staff members and their children to celebrate the 12th Annual "Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day."  
 The nationwide event encourages parents to bring their children to see the working world firsthand. 
   Families were able to visit with Clifford the Big Red Dog and Arthur from PBS Kids. Each child was given a colorful PBS KIDS Share a Story book to write about their big day on Capitol Hill. 
   "In the hustle and bustle of the world today, it is increasingly more difficult for parents and children to spend quality time together," Sen. Hutchison said. "Participating in 'Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day' encourages parents and children to communicate and children get to learn what their parents do during the weekday, which is a big part of who they are." 
   Event Co-Hosts include: Senators George Allen, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, Jim Bunning, Conrad Burns, Richard Burr, Saxby Chambliss, Hillary Clinton, Tom Coburn, Susan Collins, John Cornyn, Larry Craig, Jim DeMint, Mike DeWine, Chris Dodd, John Ensign, Mike Enzi, Dianne Feinstein, Bill Frist, Chuck Grassley, Chuck Hagel, Orrin Hatch, James Inhofe, Daniel Inouye, James Jeffords, Tim Johnson, Edward Kennedy, John Kerry, Herb Kohl, Jon Kyl, Frank Lautenberg, Trent Lott, Blanche Lincoln, John McCain, Barbara Mikulski, Patty Murray, Ben Nelson, Barack Obama, Mark Pryor, Harry Reid, John Rockefeller, Ken Salazar, Rick Santorum, Jeff Sessions, Richard Shelby, Gordon Smith, Debbie Stabenow, Ted Stevens, Craig Thomas, John Warner and Ron Wyden.
