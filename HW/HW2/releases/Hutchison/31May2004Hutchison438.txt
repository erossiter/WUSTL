SEN. HUTCHISON WELCOMES USO LOUNGE TO DFW
  Calling it an important symbol of American support for those who serve, U.S. Sen.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison joined the United Service Organizations (USO) and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport Board members to celebrate the opening today of the USO Lounge at the airport. The 2,900 square-foot facility was officially opened this Memorial Day as a salute to our brave troops across the globe.
   "We are asking so much of our men and women in uniform serving in the war on terror," Senator Hutchison said. "The new USO Lounge at DFW airport will make traveling to their next duty station a little easier."
   Thousands of soldiers who pass through DFW airport each month as part of the United States military's Rest and Recuperation (R&R) program will benefit from this new addition. The new USO Lounge is designed to provide a comfortable and relaxing retreat for soldiers and their families during a difficult time.
   In February, Senator Hutchison gained approval from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to allow family to accompany military personnel through airport security checkpoints. The directive provided federal security directors at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and other airports across the country the authority to grant military family members a privilege previously reserved for only small children, senior citizens and handicapped passengers.
   "Our troops deserve every moment they can spend with their loved ones while home for R&R," said Senator Hutchison. "While we can never fully repay their service, this is an important symbol of American support for those who serve."
