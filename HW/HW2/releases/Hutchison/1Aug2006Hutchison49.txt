SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF ENERGY SECURITY ACT ALLOWING OFFSHORE PRODUCTION
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced the passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, a bill she co-sponsored and helped draft. The bill opens 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas production. 
   "Development of America's vast resources will reduce our reliance on foreign oil," said Sen. Hutchison. "Volatile swings in the world energy market hurt American consumers, but the increased domestic production approved today will help offset rising prices. This landmark legislation will positively impact farmers, ranches, businesses and households."
   Lease Area 181 and the lease area directly to the south are expected to provide more than 1.2 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of gas. Federal royalty sharing provides the Gulf Coast states, including Texas, the means to protect important national ecosystems, prepare for natural disasters and mitigate the costs of Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production.
   The global demand for oil and gas is rising at a rapid rate, and increasing domestic sources of energy will strengthen our national and economic security and reduce our dependence on foreign sources. The amount of oil expected to be produced from this area is enough to fuel approximately 87.2 million vehicles for a year. The amount of gas that will be provided is six times the amount of liquefied natural gas that the U.S. imports each year and three times the amount currently in storage. 
   Texas will receive 10 percent of the eligible 37.5 percent in revenues from both lease areas for the life of production after 2007. Beginning in 2017, Texas will receive 21 percent of the eligible 37.5 percent in revenues that are allocated for new Outer Continental Shelf production outside Lease 181 and the southern lease block.
