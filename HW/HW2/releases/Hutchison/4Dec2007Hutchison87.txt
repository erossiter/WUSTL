SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES OVER $21 MILLION FOR TEXAS IN FEDERAL REVENUE SHARING
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) Minerals Management Service (MMS) disbursed $21,667,264 in revenues associated with Texas mineral leases on federal lands and offshore tracts for 2007. 
   "Texas has been blessed with bountiful natural resources," Sen. Hutchison said. "Developing these resources is critical to our long-term security. Besides contributing to our national energy security, this production contributes to the coffers of our state's education, infrastructure improvements and capital projects."
   MMS is the federal bureau within the DOI that manages the nation's natural gas, oil and other mineral resources. The disbursements represent the Texas' cumulative share of revenues collected from mineral production on federal lands located within their borders, and from federal offshore oil and gas tracts adjacent to their shores.
