SEN. HUTCHISON TO LEAD BRAC COMMISSIONER PRINCIPI ON TOURS OF INGLESIDE NAVAL STATION, RED RIVER ARMY DEPOT
  Following a request made by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission Chairman Anthony Principi has agreed to tour Ingleside Naval Station and Red River Army Depot on July 10.  
   "I look forward to the opportunity for Naval Station Ingleside and Red River Army Depot to show Chairman Principi the important work being done at these bases and the contributions they are making to our nation's War on Terror," Sen. Hutchison said. "Facts and figures are critical to the BRAC process, but these personal visits will allow Chairman Principi to see their military value. Their support for our nation's military is overwhelming and Chairman Principi will see that soon himself." 
   Sen. Hutchison has hosted several Texas Delegation meetings with Chairman Principi in her Washington, D.C. office throughout the BRAC process. She met with Chairman Principi at BRAC headquarters on June 21 where he agreed to her request to personally attend the regional BRAC hearing on July 11 in San Antonio.
