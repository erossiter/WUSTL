SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $1.1. BILLION AIR FORCE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT FOR BOEING
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that the U.S. Air Force awarded a 10-year, $1.1 billion contract for Boeing to continue the KC-135 Stratotanker Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) program, which includes the Boeing Support Systems site at the Port of San Antonio, the former Kelly Air Force Base. 
   "San Antonio has the highly skilled and dedicated workforce that has helped this program be a success for nearly ten years, so it is only fitting that this important work continues there," Sen. Hutchison said.
   "Sen. Hutchison has worked for many years to ensure that the former Kelly Air Force Base is charged with missions that provide the support our fighting men and women need and create jobs for San Antonio's economy," Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce President Joe Krier said. "Sen. Hutchison's advocacy was instrumental in securing this new maintenance contract for Boeing's Port of San Antonio facility."
   The Port of San Antonio facility is Boeing's largest maintenance center. Boeing currently employs approximately 300 workers for the tanker maintenance program in San Antonio. As a result of this contract, Boeing expects to hire 200 additional workers. 
   Sen. Hutchison wrote a letter on March 26 to Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne in support of the PDM program at the Port of San Antonio. The letter was also signed by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Reps. Charles Gonzalez (D-TX), Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ciro Rodriguez (D-TX) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX).
