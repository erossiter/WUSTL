SEN. HUTCHISON CALLS FOR PERMANENT TAX RELIEF ON TAX DAY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today commented on the need to make permanent the state sales tax deduction and other tax relief that has spurred unprecedented economic growth. Today, Tax Day, is the deadline for American taxpayers to file their federal taxes.  
   "This could be one of the last Tax Days that American families can enjoy the tax relief that has led to unprecedented economic growth. Tax Day should serve as a reminder that the best way to continue growing our economy is to make this tax relief permanent so workers and families keep more of what they earn," Sen. Hutchison said.
   Sen. Hutchison introduced legislation to provide a permanent state sales tax deduction on January 4, the first day of the 110th Congress. She also introduced and passed an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget which allows for the permanent deduction, saving Texas taxpayers millions.
   "The state sales tax deduction provides significant help for Texans. My bill makes the deduction permanent and treats all Americans fairly by allowing those who live in states without an income tax to deduct their state sales taxes just like others deduct their state income taxes," Sen. Hutchison said.
