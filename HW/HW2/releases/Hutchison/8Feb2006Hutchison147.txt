SEN. HUTCHISON APPOINTED TO WEST POINT BOARD OF VISITORS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today attended the United States Military Academy Board of Visitors (BOV) Organizational Meeting in the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C. 
   Sen. Hutchison was recently appointed by Senate President Pro Tempore, Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK), to serve as a representative of the Senate Appropriations Committee on the West Point BOV. Sen. Hutchison previously served on the 15-member BOV as an appointee from the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1997 through 1998, and served as chairman of the board from 1998 through 2000. 
   "It is wonderful to be associated with an institution that carries the pride, tradition and excellence of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. It is critical to our national security and our freedom that we maintain West Point's highest standards," Sen. Hutchison said.
   "Your experience, prior service on our Board, and knowledge of military and public service will be invaluable to the BOV," said Lt. Gen. William J. Lennox, Jr., Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy, in a letter to Sen. Hutchison. 
   The BOV is charged with inquiring into the morale and discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal issues, academic programs and other matters of the United States Military Academy. The BOV provides oversight and serves in an advisory role to the superintendent, the Army and the president on the operations of West Point. It submits an annual report to the president in his role as commander-in-chief, concerning any actions, views and recommendations pertaining to the Academy.
