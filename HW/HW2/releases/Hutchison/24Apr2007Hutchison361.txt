SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH CITY OF CARROLLTON LEADERS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and Texas' senior senator, today met with officials and citizens of the city of Carrollton, Texas, including Mayor Becky Miller and City Manager Leonard Martin. The group met to discuss local issues. 
   "Carrollton is an important and growing city with increasing transportation and public safety requirements," Sen. Hutchison said. "Hearing from local leaders about the issues and concerns of their community helps me address their needs here in Washington."
   Senator Hutchison previously helped secure $6 million to improve the intersection of Belt Line Road and I- 35E and $2 million to design the downtown Carrollton Regional Multi-Modal Transit Hub Station in the last highway bill.
