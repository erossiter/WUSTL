SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON LONDON TERROR BOMBINGS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement on the terror bombings in London:  
   "America was awoken today to yet another act of brutal, cowardly terror. Our British friends are suffering because there are people in the world who fear freedom and despise democracy. 
   "As President Bush meets this week at the G-8 Summit, today's horror should serve as a reminder that while there are many issues confronting the world, none are more important or time sensitive than winning the War on Terror. 
   "The thoughts and prayers of my Senate colleagues and me are with Prime Minister Tony Blair and the British people. And here at home we must remain steadfast in the defense of our nation and the spread of liberty around the world."
