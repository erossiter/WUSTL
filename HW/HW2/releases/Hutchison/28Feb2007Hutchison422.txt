SEN. HUTCHISON MEETS WITH BORDER TRADE ALLIANCE
  Texas' senior Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison today met with members of the Border Trade Alliance in her Washington, DC office. The group discussed border security and international commerce issues. 
   "Our borders must be secured and we must also safeguard the legitimate flow of international trade," Sen. Hutchison said. "The Border Trade Alliance understands both of these priorities and recognizes their importance to our state and nation."
   Senator Hutchison is a vocal advocate for border security and comprehensive immigration reform measures that protect local interests and international trade. In January she hosted a meeting between Texas border leaders, Senator John Cornyn and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to gain local input on implementation of the Secure Border Fence Act. 
   Sen. Hutchison is an original cosponsor of the Border Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act, S. 575, introduced on February 15, 2007 by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-NM). The bill promotes the use of infrastructure and technology improvements to meet border security needs while facilitating the flow of commerce.
