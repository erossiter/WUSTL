SEN. HUTCHISON OPPOSES ARBITRARY TROOP WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, today voted against legislation that mandates an arbitrary deadline for troops to withdraw from Iraq. Sen. Hutchison spoke on the Senate floor during debate on the bill. The following is an excerpt of her remarks: 
   "The president heard what the people said in the elections of last year. The president has changed the policy. We have confirmed a general to go over there and direct a new strategy, which by all accounts, is beginning to have some hope of success. 
   "Mr. President, if we do what is in this bill ? it says the president shall commence the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq no later than 120 days after the date of this act. Mr. President, that puts a bulls eye on our troops on the ground. It says we're not committed, we're not in this to do what we said we would do, to stand with you, to have a stable democracy in this country, and we're just going to leave. We're not stating any benchmarks, we're not stating any success strategies. We're just saying 120 days, and we're gone. 
   "What do you think that does to our troops on the ground? What does it say to our allies? And most important, Mr. President, what does it say to the enemy? It says that the greatest country in the world is going to be there as long as it's not very hard. And when it gets too tough for America, we will just leave and we will walk out. Mr. President, that is not the message of the greatest country on earth."
