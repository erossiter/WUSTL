SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN ANNOUNCE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR TWO SOUTHERN DISTRICT VACANCIES
  Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn today announced they have begun the application process to fill vacancies for the next U.S. District Judge and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas which includes Houston, Galveston, Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen, Corpus Christi and Victoria.  
   Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn have established a panel of leading legal officials and attorneys in Texas to help identify the most qualified candidates to fill the Houston-based vacancies created by U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein, Jr., who will be taking senior status later this year, and the resignation of U.S. Attorney Michael T. Shelby, who will leave office effective June 11. 
   "Texas has a strong record of accomplished judges who have answered the call to serve the people of Texas," said Sen. Hutchison, Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. "Serving on the federal bench is a noble profession and I look forward to working through the process with those interested in applying."
   "Texans deserve the finest legal minds to serve as U.S. District Judges and U.S. Attorneys throughout our state's four federal judicial districts. Public service is a great calling, and I encourage everyone who is interested in serving the Southern District of Texas to apply for these positions," said Sen. Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Those interested in being considered should submit a resume and completed questionnaire to both Senators by no later than July 1. Express mail is recommended because of delays due to the enhanced security procedures involving Congressional mail.
   The questionnaire is available on Sen. Cornyn's website at cornyn.senate.gov. It is also available on Sen. Hutchison's website at hutchison.senate.gov. 
   Further information may be obtained from Sen. Cornyn's Judiciary Committee office at (202) 224-7840 or from Sen. Hutchison's office at (202) 224-5922.
