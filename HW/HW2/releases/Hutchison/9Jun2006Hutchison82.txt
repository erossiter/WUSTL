SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $230 MILLION FOR V-22 PROGRAM INCLUDED IN EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chairman of Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that the final Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill includes $230 million for the V-22 "Osprey" program. The bill will provide funding for the MV-22 Marine Corps version of the revolutionary vertical take-off and landing aircraft, assembled in Amarillo, TX.  
   "The Global War on Terror depends upon these versatile aircraft, which are assembled here in Texas," Sen. Hutchison said. "As the current fleet of Marine helicopters ages, it is imperative that we give our troops the tools and technology necessary to complete their mission."
   The Marine Corps' fleet of 38-year old CH-46 "Sea Knight" helicopters has been subject to heavy wear in the Global War on Terror. The new funding will be used to replace helicopters lost in combat.
