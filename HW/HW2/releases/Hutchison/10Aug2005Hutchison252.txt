SEN. HUTCHISON ADDRESSES ORGANIZATION AT GALVESTON NATIONAL LAB GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today addressed members of the University of Texas Board of Regents and representatives of the University of Texas Medical Branch at the Galveston National Lab Groundbreaking Ceremony. Sen.  
 Hutchison was a leader in helping secure the federal contract for the University of Texas Medical Branch to establish the lab which will be one of only two biocontainment laboratories in the nation. 
   "This groundbreaking ceremony represents an investment in science and knowledge that will improve public health and strengthen our national security," Sen. Hutchison said. "I was honored to help secure the contract for the development of the Galveston National Lab which will be a leader in the research field. These top facilities will attract renowned biologists to establish a better understanding of infectious diseases and the threats they pose." 
   Sen. Hutchison worked to help secure a $48 million, five-year contract from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the University of Texas Medical Branch. The contract is to establish the Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease. With this contract, the University of Texas Medical Branch will lead an alliance of 24 entities across a five-state region. 
   When the Galveston National Laboratory is finished, it will be one of the most sophisticated biomedical research facilities in the world and a key part of the NIH biodefense program. Scientists will be able to safely study both naturally occurring infectious agents and those which can be used for biological attacks in the secured research facility.
