SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S FISCAL 2008 BUDGET REQUEST
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today applauded the permanent tax cuts and funding levels recommended by President Bush in his Fiscal Year 2008 Budget request. 
   "I am pleased that the president's budget demonstrates a continued commitment to securing the tax relief that has fueled our robust economy, protecting America in the War on Terror and supporting essential domestic programs." Sen. Hutchison said. 
   "The president's budget provides increases in several crucial areas. The proposed 11 percent increase for the Department of Defense supports our troops and their mission in the War on Terror. The budget also reflects continued dedication to the president's Vision for Space Exploration with a 3.1 percent increase for NASA. We must continue to provide funding for the practical and scientific benefits of space exploration."
