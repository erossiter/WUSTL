SENATE PASSES SENS. BINGAMAN - HUTCHISON AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT
  The United State Senate today passed the "Border Law Enforcement Relief Act," an effort by U.S. Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) to provide $50 million in grant funding each year for the next five fiscal years to supplement law enforcement efforts in border communities. This legislation passed by voice vote as an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill. 
   Over the next five fiscal years, the amendment will authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide grant funding to law enforcement agencies to address both criminal activity and border security. Priority for these competitive grants will be given to agencies serving communities with a population under 50,000 and those located within 100 miles of the U.S. border with Mexico or Canada, or are designated High Impact Drug Trafficking Areas.
   "This critical grant funding can be used by border law enforcement to purchase equipment, hire personnel, upgrade technology and cover additional costs like overtime and transportation," said Sen. Hutchison. "I know that border sheriffs and other local law enforcement agencies in Texas and along the southwest border have had their resources stretched thin and we recognize they need greater funding. I will continue working with DHS and law enforcement to ensure they have the funding they need to secure the border and protect our communities."
   Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and John Cornyn (R-TX) co-sponsored the amendment.
