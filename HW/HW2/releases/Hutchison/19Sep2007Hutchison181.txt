SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES BAYLOR SCIENTIST RECEIVES ELITE AWARD
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced that Baylor College of Medicine Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Dr. Kjersti Aagaard is the recipient of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) New Innovator Award.  
   "This recognition of Dr. Aagaard's work is another testament to Texas' scientific leadership," Sen. Hutchison said. "I congratulate her on being recognized nationally for her research."
   According to NIH, Dr. Aagaard was one of only 29 scientists nationwide to receive the New Innovator Award, a program begun this year to recognize new investigators who have not previously received an NIH grant. Dr. Aagaard will receive $1.5 million over five years to fund the direct costs of her research.
   Award recipients were selected through an application and evaluation process in which 262 scientific experts helped to determine the most competitive individuals. NIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni's advisory committee gave a final review, and Dr. Zerhouni selected the recipients from among their recommendations.
   Dr. Aagaard will study the effects of maternal obesity on the adult health of their children.
