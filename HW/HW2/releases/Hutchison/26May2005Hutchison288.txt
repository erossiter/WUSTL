SENS. HUTCHISON, CORNYN SEND LETTER TO DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD REQUESTING BRAC DATA
  Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn today sent Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld the following letter requesting that he direct the Department of Defense to release data on how the department determined which bases were to be added to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) list.  
 The letter follows:
   May 26, 2005
   The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld
  Secretary of Defense
  The Pentagon
  Washington, D.C. 20301-4000
   Dear Secretary Rumsfeld:
   We are writing to request the release of installation-specific data the Department of Defense used in preparing the recommendations for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). While the Department has released the service-specific analysis, it has not released the installation-specific data which was the basis for the Department's analysis. More specifically, the Department has yet to make public the data on how the military value for each installation was scored. 
   If the Department continues to delay the release of this data, communities adversely impacted by BRAC and the BRAC Commission will be unable to assess the Department's recommendations in the limited time allotted to them under the law. Communities have a right to know how their bases were measured so they can either support or challenge the proposals. The first Commission hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, June 7th, less than two weeks from now, and the Commission must send its recommendations to the President no later than September 8, 2005. Congress designed this process to be open and transparent, and we are troubled by the lack of information the Department has released.
   We urge you to release this data immediately to avoid undermining the BRAC process.
   Sincerely,
   Kay Bailey Hutchison 
  John Cornyn
