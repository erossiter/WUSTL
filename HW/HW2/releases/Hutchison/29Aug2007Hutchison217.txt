SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $2.1 MILLION EARLY CHILDHOOD READING GRANT FOR HEARNE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT
  Texas' senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison today announced that the Hearne Independent School District has been awarded a grant of $2,166,898 for early childhood reading programs by the U.S. Department of Education.
   "Studies have consistently shown that the earlier a child learns to read, the better their future academic performance will be," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am pleased to announce this funding to help school children in Hearne meet their full potential."
   This grant has been awarded under the department's Early Reading First Program, which supports local efforts to enhance the early language, literacy and prereading development of preschool age children, particularly those from low-income families, through instructional strategies and professional development based on scientifically based reading research.
