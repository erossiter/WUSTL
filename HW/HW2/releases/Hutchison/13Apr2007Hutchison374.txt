SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $428.6 MILLION PROVIDED FOR TEXAS HURRICANE COSTS
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the $428.6 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding she helped secure for Texas hurricane recovery costs will be released to the state. The release follows the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) approval of the Texas Action Plan. The CDBG funds will reimburse Texas communities for the costs associated with Hurricane Rita damage and the accommodation of 250,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees who sought refuge in Texas. 
   "I am pleased HUD has approved the state's plan so the $428.6 million in emergency funding can now begin flowing to Texas communities still rebuilding from the costs of the devastating 2005 hurricanes," Sen. Hutchison said. "My fellow Texans graciously opened their doors to the thousands of Hurricane Katrina evacuees and students seeking refuge. This funding will have an enormous impact on the Houston community and Southeast Texas communities as they work to recover from Hurricane Rita." 
   Sen. Hutchison announced that she secured the $428.6 million in the 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill at an August 2006 event in Houston with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson. The funding for Texas is part of a total $5.2 billion she helped secure for Texas and other states affected by the 2005 hurricanes. While $4.2 million of that funding was designated to Louisiana in the legislation, $1 billion remained to be divided among the remaining states. 
   Sen. Hutchison was also able to secure in the emergency funding bill legislation that raised the federal reimbursement rate for Hurricane Rita damage claims in Texas to a 90 percent federal, 10 percent local rate. By securing that provision in the final bill, the new reimbursement rate will save Texas counties over $200 million.
