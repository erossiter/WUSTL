   "For the separation of power to continue to be balanced, it is critical that well-qualified jurists serve on the high court. Samuel Alito has a brilliant legal mind and has stated the role of a judge is one who should interpret, not make, the law. Judge Alito's professional experience, personal character and commitment to the fair application of the law will help ensure the integrity of our judicial system."
