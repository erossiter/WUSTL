SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON CIA LEAK CASE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement on the CIA leak case: 
   "The integrity of our judicial system demands an untarnished process void of prejudgments. Constant leaks about a leak investigation are not only ironic but unfair to those involved. Out of respect for our system of justice, everyone needs to take a deep breath and not judge those involved until it has been proven they are anything other than innocent. Today's announcement is the middle of the process, not the end."
