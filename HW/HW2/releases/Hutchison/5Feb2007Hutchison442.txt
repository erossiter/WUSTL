SEN. HUTCHISON APPLAUDS NASA FUNDING INCREASE IN PRESIDENT'S FISCAL YEAR 2008 BUDGET REQUEST
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Space, Aeronautics and Related Sciences, today applauded the 3.1 percent NASA funding increase recommended by President Bush in his Fiscal Year 2008 Budget request.  
   "The proposed increase in NASA funding demonstrates the president's commitment to space exploration and recognizes the practical and scientific benefits of the space program," Sen. Hutchison said. "I am pleased that resources are provided for continued Space Shuttle operations and assembly of the International Space Station.
   "I am troubled, however, that much of this increase could be consumed in making up for the $545 million funding reduction in the Fiscal Year 2007 continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives. I am especially concerned about possible delays in development of the new Crew Exploration Vehicles. I will continue to urge my colleagues in the Senate to provide NASA funding at the president's Fiscal Year 2007 requested levels."
