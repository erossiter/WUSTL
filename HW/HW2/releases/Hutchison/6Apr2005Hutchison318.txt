SEN. HUTCHISON HOSTS SIGNING OF UT-SANDIA AGREEMENT DRAWING NEW RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES TO TEXAS UNIVERSITIES
  Following a meeting organized by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) just over a year ago, Sens.  
 Hutchison and Pete Domenici (R-NM) today hosted a signing of a memorandum of understanding formalizing an agreement between the University of Texas System and the Sandia National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M. The new partnership will bring additional research opportunities to UT-Austin, UT-Arlington, UT-Dallas, UT-El Paso, UT Southwestern Health Science Center and UT Medical Branch in Galveston.
   "UT schools have an outstanding reputation for their research across the country. This agreement will further academic standings at both UT schools and at Sandia," Sen. Hutchison said. "This partnership will foster academic growth with an influx of new resources for more advanced instruction and learning."
   More than a year ago Sen. Hutchison, the state's senior Senator, arranged and hosted a meeting for UT officials that first opened the door to this partnership. She believed the highly regarded UT engineering Department would contribute to the academic component of the Sandia mission and approached the manager of the lab to explore the possibility of a formal association. After several meetings, the partnership expanded to other UT components.
  The projects expected to result from the agreement and schools doing the work are:
   * Simulated engineering - UT-Austin, UT-Arlington and UT-Dallas
   * High energy density physics - UT-Austin
   * Energy, water security and sustainability - UT El Paso
   * A Health Security Program to further study infectious diseases - UTMB-Galveston
   * Bio-Sensor programs, digital security and bio-defense projects - UT Southwestern.
