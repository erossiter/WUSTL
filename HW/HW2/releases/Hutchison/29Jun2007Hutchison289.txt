SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES $4 MILLION EMERGENCY GRANTS FOR TEXAS COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) announced today the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has approved her request for $4 million in National Emergency Grant funding for Texas communities affected by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions. The funding will be directed to the Texas Workforce Commission to assist both communities and workers. 
   "I am pleased the Labor Department has approved my request for emergency funding for communities that were hit hard by BRAC," said Sen. Hutchison. "This funding will help businesses and individuals get back on their feet with transition pay and employment and training services."
   Specifically, this funding is intended to target workers, businesses, and communities impacted as a result of the 2005 BRAC at Fort Bliss, Fort Sam Houston, Fort Hood, and the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.
   According to DOL, National Emergency Grants are discretionary awards by the Secretary of Labor that temporarily expand service capacity at the state and local levels in response to significant dislocation events. Significant events are those that create a sudden need for assistance that cannot reasonably be expected to be accommodated within the Dislocated Worker Program.
