SEN. HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $6 MILLION AWARDED TO REGION ONE EDUCATION SERVICE CENTER
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today announced Region One Education Service Center will receive $6,541,260 in funding from the U.S. Department of Education under the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR-UP). 
   "The Region One Education Service Center serves over 8,000 traditionally underprivileged youth," said Sen. Hutchison, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "GEAR-UP in this area will provide a support network to address the needs of students as they begin seventh grade until they graduate high school." 
   GEAR-UP is designed to increase the number of low-income students who are equipped to begin and succeed in a higher education environment.
