SEN. HUTCHISON COMMENTS ON SPIKE IN GAS PRICES
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following comments on the recent spike in oil and gas prices: 
   "The direct effect that the turbulence in the Middle East has on oil and gas prices is a painful economic reminder that we are too dependant on foreign sources of energy. It is imperative that we develop domestic sources of energy and alternative fuel sources. Our national and economic security depends on it. 
   "This week, the Senate reached a bipartisan agreement to open areas in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas exploration. It is irresponsible to leave these critical resources dormant. We should continue to look for opportunities to produce known resources which are currently and unnecessarily off limits.
