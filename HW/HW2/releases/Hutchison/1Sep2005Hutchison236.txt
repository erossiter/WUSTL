SEN. HUTCHISON ISSUES STATEMENT ON HURRICANE KATRINA
  Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today made the following statement after meeting with Houston Mayor Bill White, County Judge Robert Eckels and city officials in Houston:  
   "The city of Houston and the state of Texas should be commended for opening up their facilities to the victims of this devastating hurricane. Mayor White, Judge Eckels and all of Houston's city officials are working diligently to ready the city for our neighbors in need. Congress is attempting to determine what the needs are and how they can best be met in all of the affected areas. While we cannot bring back the losses to the victims of this devastation, hopefully, working as a nation, we can help regain some sense of normalcy in their lives."
