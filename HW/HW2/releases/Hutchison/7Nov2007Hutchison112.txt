SEN. HUTCHISON LEADS EFFORT TO EXPEDITE MILITARY, VETERANS SPENDING BILL
  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) today led a successful effort to defeat attempts to attach the FY 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MilCon/VA) Appropriations bill to the FY 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill that President Bush is expected to veto. 
   "The president has said he would sign the stand alone MilCon/VA bill, so there is no substantive reason to join these bills together. This political maneuvering jeopardized crucial funding for our veterans, our active duty troops and their families."
   Sen. Hutchison raised a Rule 28 Point of Order, which the Senate sustained 47-46, in objection to the conference report joining the two appropriations bills together. Rule 28 prohibits conferees from adding to bills that have already passed both houses of congress.
   "I am pleased that the Senate recognized the urgency of this bill and supported my point of order. This funding can now move forward on a bipartisan basis to provide for the American heroes and their families who depend upon it."
