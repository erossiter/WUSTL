                                                                                  Monday  May 1  2006      WASHINGTON    U S  Sens  Jeff Sessions  R AL   Richard Burr  R NC  and Tom Coburn  R OK  today called for a more equitable distribution of HIV AIDS funding  saying that rural areas    particularly in the South    are being shortchanged at the expense of large metro areas                        The three senators raised the issue at a news conference  Sessions and Burr are members of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  which later this month is scheduled to reauthorize the 1990 Ryan White CARE Act  the main federal HIV AIDS spending law  Coburn has introduced a stand alone bill that would readjust the distribution formula                 Ryan White CARE Act funding provides medical care  anti retroviral treatments  counseling and testing for HIV AIDS patients who need it the most                    Why do states like Alabama have waiting lists for people to get basic drugs while places like New York  Houston and San Francisco have so much money that they provide acpuncture  massage therapy  dog walking and   companion services    Ryan White himself would not get the proper funding under the current funding formula     Sessions said  referring to the Indiana teenager who died in 1990 after contracting AIDS from hemophilia treatments                 HIV AIDS funding formulas direct a great deal of money to   eligible metropolitan areas       cities with populations of at least 500 000 with more than 2 000 reported AIDS cases in the past five years    rather than simply allowing money to follow HIV AIDS patients in each state  This two tiered system allows eligible metropolitan areas to get direct money from the federal government  on top of state funds                  According to a June 2005 Government Accountability Office report  some states receive  1 500 more than other states per AIDS case  thanks to the formula that favors big cities                    Ryan White CARE Act funding must be distributed more equally among states   Southern states like North Carolina have been historically underfunded and yet the South continues to have one of the highest numbers of AIDS cases     Burr said     The Ryan White CARE Act exists to protect and support those battling HIV and AIDS   It is time for Ryan White funds to be distributed more evenly so all HIV and AIDS patients benefit and not just those patients living in the largest urban areas                        The U S  federal government will spend over  20 billion on HIV AIDS related programs this year alone   There is no acceptable reason why we should deny any American living with HIV access to medically necessary care   Yet under current federal formulas  San Francisco is receiving funding for those who died over a decade ago while patients in rural America are literally dying awaiting access to medication on AIDS Drug Assistance Program waiting lists     Coburn said                  The South has been particularly hard hit in recent years  with seven of the nation  s 10 highest AIDS case rates located in the region  Because Alabama has no   eligible metropolitan area     the state receives  3 657 per AIDS patient in federal money  compared to  5 264 per patient in California                 In 2004  the latest year for which statistics are available  Alabama had 5 729 cumulative HIV cases and 7 744 cumulative AIDS cases  Alabama is one of several states with a federal AIDS Drug Assistance Program waiting list that at times has swelled to more than 600 patients   Alabama ranks 13th in cumulative HIV cases and 24th in cumulative AIDS cases                 North Carolina has approximately 18 900 people living with HIV or AIDS   In 2004  66 7 percent of people living with AIDS in North Carolina were African American  the 5th highest in the nation    North Carolina currently ranks 14th among states with the greatest number of AIDS cases in the nation                 As of January 1  2006  there were 4 442 reported cases of HIV AIDS in Oklahoma   While there currently is no ADAP waiting list  the state has enacted caps on the number of enrollees and expen ditures per enrollee due to funding shortfalls                  The Centers for Disease Control estimates that about 40 000 people in the United States become infected with HIV each year  and that more than 1 million Americans currently have HIV AIDS  African Americans account for half of all new AIDS cases  and African American women account for two thirds of new AIDS cases among women                            2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama                     All rights reserved
