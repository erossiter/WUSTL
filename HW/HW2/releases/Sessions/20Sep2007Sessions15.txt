                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        IRAQ WAR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Thursday  September 20  2007      Mr  SESSIONS  Mr  President  any American I know should be  and is  vitally interested in what is happening in Iraq and what our policy should be  There is no doubt that good people can disagree about how we should handle this important and difficult situation  Nobody s patriotism should be questioned in this process  But I would urge that these disagreements that might be expressed be expressed in ways that minimize the negative impact on what may be  and will be the decided policy of the United States  In other words  we need to be sure that as we conduct this debate  we have a policy in this country  and we need to make sure that we execute it in a way that most likely will provide us a method of success  Let me recap the history of how we got here because I think it is important  By more than a three fourths vote  77 Senators in this body authorized the use of military force in Iraq  The initial invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein went well  surprisingly well  better than most would ever have expected  But the postinvasion situation has been much more difficult than expected  My personal view  for what it is worth  and it   Page  S11829    may not be worth much  is that we underestimated the difficulties of establishing a functioning democracy in an undeveloped nation that had deep sectarian divides  that had no history of law or democracy  and that had been traumatized by years of oppression in a war  So we can look back and say there are a lot of mistakes out there that have been made  but I think the real problem is we are facing a difficult job that is not going to be easy  and no one should underestimate the challenge  But we must honestly evaluate our current position and use this time in this Congress right now to decide what we are going to do  I know good people will disagree  but we will reach a decision before this debate is out  So we owe nothing less to those fabulous men and women who serve us in Iraq than to give this our best judgment  our hardest work  our most sincere consideration  There can be no doubt but that this is the correct time for a national evaluation  Remember how we got here  In May  May 24 of this year  in a bipartisan vote  we voted to clearly affirm the surge  80 to 14 was what that vote was  We debated the question  We knew General Petraeus was there  The President asked that we fund 30 000 additional troops as part of this surge  and we decided to do so  We voted for it  This Congress said we will execute that surge  I remember Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi meeting with the President and working on the deal  and we agreed to do the surge 80 to 14 on final vote  So it is really not President Bush s surge or General Petraeus s surge  it was and is America s surge  and our troops are carrying out America s policies  I hope our colleagues here won t be adopting the reasoning of MoveOn Org instead of recognizing the responsibilities that we all have to those we have sent into harm s way  Now  no one in May was sure how things would work out  Things had not gone well in 2006 and in early 2007  All of us were worried about what was happening  Violence had increased  the uncertainty had increased  and I think Congress rightly was concerned  After debate  we decided to execute the surge operation which was more than just increased troops  and I will talk about that in a minute  We decided that  for the purpose of openness and accountability  as part of the funding of this war that we had appropriated  we wanted some reports  In fact  we asked for five separate reports  Those reports have been produced as required  A report was required on the status of 18 benchmarks submitted by July 15  A report was required for an independent commission of experts to report not later than September 1 analyzing the progress of the Iraqi security forces  That was the General Jones commission  former supreme allied commander in Europe  former commander of the United States Marine Corps  and 20 other experts compiled that report  A report from the GAO  the comptroller general  on whether the 18 benchmarks had been achieved by September 1  a followup on the benchmarks report submitted by September 15  Then public testimony was required from the U S  Ambassador to Iraq and the commander of Multi National Forces Iraq  General Petraeus  not later than September 15  We have had all of that in the Armed Services Committee  of which I am a member  We had Mr  Walker from GAO give the GAO report  We had General Jones and his commission give their report  and we had General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker give their reports  They testified before the House  They testified before other committees  We have had now a national discussion about this situation  and it is time for us to begin to make some decisions  So what I hope we will do is make a decision  and we will stick by it  and next week we would not have leaders in this body saying it is a failure before it ever gets started  as we have had in the past  Let me summarize the reports that came in briefly  The administration report on benchmarks  as well as a GAO report  shows that we had some progress on some matters but that there had been limited political progress in Iraq  I would note that the GAO report  which was valuable and I think not inaccurate but could be misinterpreted  was important  It did not  however  incorporate data from August and early September from Iraq  That data shows remarkable progress in those recent weeks  and it was not part of its report  So the progress on the military front that they reported was not as significant as the later reports would show  It only measured whether the goals of each one of the benchmarks were fully achieved  It didn t measure whether progress had been made  Ambassador Crocker  on the benchmarks  made some important comments  Those I would point out to my colleagues  One  he said  yes  an oil law had not been passed by the Iraqi Parliament  They couldn t get together on that  Sometimes we can t get together in this body and agree on things  So what happened is  they are indeed sharing oil revenue throughout the provinces in a fair and just way  although they have not yet been able to pass an overall oil law  So we are saying  according to benchmarks  they haven t met the benchmarks because the benchmarks said they must pass an oil law that would share their resources  But  in fact  they are sharing  He talked about a benchmark dealing with reconciliation with former members of the Baathist Party and the Saddam Hussein regime  He said  no  they had not been able to pass in the parliament the legislation that would effectuate  as we would like to see it  a reconciliation among the former Baathists and the current leadership in Iraq  but it was happening out there  He said in various different places throughout Iraq former members of Baathist activities are coming into the government  Sunnis who allied with al Qaida are coming in and working with the American military  and at the grassroots level real progress is being made and reconciliation is occurring in a lot of different places in Iraq  Now  the Jones commission was a very valuable commission  General Jones is a very distinguished  40 year veteran of the U S  Marine Corps  former commandant  He served as supreme allied commander of Europe and commander of USOCOM  This bipartisan commission he headed was composed of 20 members representing senior military leaders  civilian officials  former chiefs of police  former DC Police Chief Charles Ramsey  former TRADOC Commander General John Abrams  and Mr  John Hamre  former Under Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration  a respected voice on defense matters  Between them  the commissioners had more than 500 years of collective military experience and more than 150 years of police experience  The Commission reported strong progress within the Iraqi Army but much weaker progress among the national police  in fact  unacceptable activity within the police  They called for massive reform and restructuring of the Iraqi police forces  I asked General Jones and his colleagues in this fashion  I told him that before General Petraeus went to Iraq to take over the effort there  he told us he would define the challenge as being   difficult  but not impossible    So I asked General Jones   What are our realistic prospects for a long term situation in which there is some stability and a functioning government that is not threatening to the United States   This is what General Jones said   Senator  I think that General Petraeus s words were correct  I think it is a difficult situation that is multifaceted  It is about bringing about in Iraq not only safe and secure conditions  but a completely different method of government  jump starting an economy  rule of law  The whole aspect of transition is just enormously complex   He added this   And regardless of how we got there  we are where we are  It is  strategically  enormously important not only nationally  but regionally and globally  for this to come out and be seen as a success  And our report  I think  not only unanimous but very hard hitting in certain areas  intentionally makes the point that there are some good things happening and that we are all excited to see that  That is certainly encouraging  but there is more work that needs to be done  We wanted to be very specific about where we think that work should be done  It doesn t mean it can t be done   They call for a massive overhaul of the Iraqi police  He said it is difficult and it needs to be done  More progress needs to be made  but it is not impossible  So I followed up with that  I said   Did any of your commission members  or any significant number of them  conclude that this could not work  that this was a failed effort  or that we ought to just figure   Page  S11830    a way to get out of there regardless of the consequences   Here is General Jones s answer   I don t believe that there is a commissioner that feels that way  But let me just take a poll right now   He turned around and surveyed the Commissioners  and they all agreed with General Jones  Then General Petraeus and Ambassador Corker came before us last week to give their report  which detailed progress on a number of different levels  General Petraeus is one of our most distinguished officers in the Armed Forces  He graduated as an academically   distinguished cadet   from West Point  He was the General George C  Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U S  Army Command and General Staff College  class of 1983  He also has a master s and a Ph D  from Princeton  and he served as a professor at West Point  He is on his third tour in Iraq  I know a lot of people in this body think they have figured out how to deal with Iraq  He spent 2 full years there and now over a half a year again in Iraq dealing with these circumstances  He is a very capable person  as anyone can well see  Well  I have been to Iraq six times  On the first trip  I met General Petraeus  He commanded the 101st Airborne in Mosul  They were achieving some fine success and reconciliation  They were able to catch Saddam s sons  Uday and Qusay  He worked with Alabama engineering National Guard units impressively  in my opinion  to bring them on line in an effective way  I was impressed in my meeting with him  The next year  he came home  and then they asked him to go back to train the Iraqi Army  He went back and took charge of that operation and spent a year doing that in Iraq  meeting people in Baghdad and getting a real feel for that country  Then he came home  When he got home  he wrote the counterinsurgency manual for the U S  Department of Defense  which details the principles and tactics that can work to defeat an insurgency  In fact  insurgencies can be defeated if you have a sustained and intelligent policy that is well led  So he wrote that manual  and President Bush met with him and decided to send him back a third time in January  and he asked him to lead this effort  He has been doing so with integrity  skill  and effectiveness  As a matter of fact  one commentator said even in the early months you could feel that there was a new atmosphere and a new strategic vision and new leadership  It was filtering down throughout the system  So to have a group like MoveOn org suggest  not suggest but call him a traitor and a liar  that is despicable  I cannot imagine anybody who would not condemn such a statement  This is a patriot of the highest order  We have asked him to go into harm s way for the third time to serve the national interests of the United States  not serve President Bush  to serve this Congress  by a 80 to 14 vote in May  So I am telling you that we need to get serious  We sent him there by a unanimous vote  confirmed him to be commander  and we voted to fund the operation  fund the surge  That wasn t President Bush who put up the money  we put it up  We asked him to come back and give us a report on how well it is going  We asked an independent commission to give us another report  We asked the GAO to give us a report  We have gotten those reports  and it is now time for this Congress to make some decisions  It is just that serious  This is a very important matter for the United States  It is important for us  You tell me about the morale of the military  People say the morale of the military is not well  They are doing beyond anything I could expect  Reenlistments remain very high  I have to be amazed at that  and I know others are  We have a good reenlistment rate  and we are able to retain peopleand bring people into the military  They are going to Iraq and serving ably  As a matter of fact  in a moment  I will share a report from some of our Alabama people who came by to see me and what they had to say about their tour there  So we have done this  and we are now at a point where we have to make some decisions  I have been asked  Well  has the situation changed since General Petraeus has made his report  I think it has  mainly because of what he said  not how he said it  I asked him back in January at his confirmation hearing would he always be truthful with the Congress and the American people about the status of this war and would he tell us if he didn t think he could be successful  He said that he would  I asked him at this hearing  General Petraeus  when you came before us in January  before you went to Iraq  you had previously told me that no matter what happened  you would tell the Congress the truth  He told me that in private the night before  So the next morning  I asked him  Will you tell the truth to the American people  He committed that he would  So at this hearing last week  I asked him   Have you  to the best of your ability  told this Congress the truth about the situation in Iraq today   He said   I have  yes  sir   You can call him a liar if you want to  I don t  I believe he gave us the truth as he had the ability to give it to us  I asked him further   General Petraeus  in your opinion  is there a circumstance in which  in your opinion  is this effort in Iraq such that we cannot be successful  that we would be putting more effort in a losing cause if we continue it  or  in your opinion  do we have a realistic chance to be successful in this very important endeavor   He replied   Sir  I believe we have a realistic chance of achieving our objectives in Iraq   So we received the reports and the information  What did some of that information tell us  I cannot tell my colleagues or the American people that this will continue  but  remarkably  violence in Baghdad is down dramatically  Remember  it was the President and everybody who acknowledged that if the large capital city could not be stable and was sinking into violence  there is no way we could have a peaceful settlement in Iraq and reconciliation and make progress  We had to reduce violence in Iraq  The report General Petraeus gave us and the charts he produced showed that civilian deaths in Iraq  in Baghdad  were down 70 percent  In his report  he declared that civilian deaths throughout the nation of Iraq were down 55 percent  Now  that is really big  Remember  the surge didn t reach full strength until June or July  He has only had the full surge in place for a month or two  So this is really big  Mr  KERRY  Will the Senator yield for a question  Mr  SESSIONS  Yes  Mr  KERRY  On his own charts  he showed that two thirds of the reduction of violence took place before our troops even got there  isn t that right  Mr  SESSIONS  Mr  President  I will respond to that  I don t believe that is accurate  Mr  KERRY  That is the chart  Mr  President  Mr  SESSIONS  The most dramatic reductions in violence occurred in the last months of August and September  Regardless of that  I would say the Senator is making a point I think I can agree to  that it is not just the number of troops that are affected  General Petraeus is executing a strategy utilizing counterinsurgency tactics that are more suited to the problems in Iraq and are proving to be more effective in reducing violence and protecting the civilian people in Iraq  Mr  KERRY  I further ask the Senator  if the civilian deaths are down to such a degree that Baghdad is such a security success  why did the Iraqi Legislature not reconcile on the issue of oil or debaathification  Mr  SESSIONS  I will give my best answer to that  We had the President of the United States and the majority leader in the Senate say we had to have an immigration bill  They tried to pass it right here on the floor of the Senate  They could not pass it  The President could have stood on his head  and that bill would not pass  Just because we think we can order the Iraqi Parliament to vote out some law doesn t mean they can do that  So I am really worried about it  frankly  I am fully willing to acknowledge that it is a very troublesome development that the Iraqi Parliament hasn t been able to pass laws to carry out some of these needed reforms  But I don t think they are going to be more likely to be effective in passing legislation if we precipitously withdraw  allowing violence to increase again and whatever   Page    S11831    else might happen  with Iran expanding its influence  I have to tell you that the substantial reduction in violence we have seen is not small  This is really large  If you told me when the surge started that we would see a 70 percent reduction in civilian deaths in Baghdad  I would not have believed it  I would have thought that would be more optimistic than I was prepared to be  So whether it will hold  I don t know  We have seen some improvement  I know the Senator from Massachusetts would like to speak  I will just conclude by saying  OK  we have had these reports  we have seen this progress  and we know what the difficulties are  I have decided  based on General Petraeus s testimony  the Crocker testimony  the Jones Commission report  and other information we have  that things are moving in a better direction  I personally believe it is the new tactics  not so much the number of soldiers  I am very happy General Petraeus has concluded he can draw down troops while maintaining this progress of reducing violence  In fact  he has recommended that within the next few weeks  a Marine unit not be replaced  So that represents an initial reduction in our forces within a few weeks  Then the next reduction will come before Christmas will be an Army brigade  and he would have 30 000 troops withdrawn by next summer and would report to us again in March on whether he could continue this rate of reduction or accelerate it  There is not that much difference  I say to my colleagues  in what we want  Senator Levin wants to see troops withdrawn  He wants to see a stable Iraq  The question is  Do we do it with a mandated withdrawal rate dictated by Congress or do we do it in harmony with the situation on the ground that leaves us in the best possible position to allow a stable  peaceful Iraq  an ally to the United States  to exist  I think we should accept the report  We should see this as good news  celebrate that some progress has been made and recognize that serious challenges are out there  I do believe Congress has every right to monitor this situation closely  We have every right to reject the President s recommendation  to reject General Petraeus s recommendation  to cut off funds and order our troops home if we so desire  I think that would not be a good decision  I think it would not be in the long term interests of the United States of America  Therefore  I oppose the Levin amendment  I yield the floor
