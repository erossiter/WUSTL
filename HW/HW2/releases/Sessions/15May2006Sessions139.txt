                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Monday  May 15  2006                    WASHINGTON    U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  made the following statement in reaction to President Bush  s address on border security and immigration Monday evening                    I am happy to see President Bush go beyond talk and take some action   But a few steps  including calling out the National Guard  significant though they may be  will not change the pervasive illegality of our current immigration system to one that works   And the American people know it   Quite apart from the need to deal fairly and generously with the 11 million that have come and lived here for a significant period  we must confront the continued flow of more illegals into the country                   To do that  the President must assemble his top  law enforcement officers  prosecutors  and budget experts and tell them with clarity that it is now his policy to stop further illegal immigration into our country   He must tell them to review their policies and to promptly report to him the funds  personnel  and equipment that each agency needs to make this happen   He must present proposals to Congress to close the loopholes that exist in current law                   Specifically  these are some of the essential steps that must be taken to create a system of immigration that works and where the law is honored                   1          A significant increase in short term detention space   Without detention space  the law enforcement officer who apprehends a law breaker has his work completely negated   The good news is that as border enforcement improves and as  catch and release  ends  the word will spread and fewer will try to come illegally and thus have to be detained   But more bed spaces are needed now                   2          Expanding border fencing and barriers is essential   This too will send a message to the world that we are serious about enforcement   Again  this clear message will result in fewer attempted crossings and reduced arrests   Indeed  Mike Chertoff  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  recently told some Senators that he favors 350 miles of new fencing plus 500 miles of vehicle barriers   A clear statement of affirmation of this policy by the President and immediate commencement of construction is needed                   3          The US VISIT system that was authorized 10 years ago is not complete and far behind schedule   US VISIT will record the entry and exit of everyone who enters or departs the United States   This system will be the cornerstone of any effective enforcement policy   The President must demand prompt completion of US VISIT   Nothing will work without it   The delays are inexcusable                      4          We must create a workplace verification system that every employer can access to verify the legal status of potential employees   We now only have a  basic pilot program    The full  effective operation of a workplace verification system is required for workplace enforcement    Employers must be told exactly what is required of them as they hire   We cannot wait                   5          In addition to utilizing the National Guard at the border  the President needs to call on the 700 000 state and local law enforcement officers to be the eyes and ears of immigration law enforcement   There are now fewer than 20 000 federal immigration enforcement officers   When state and local officers apprehend illegals in the course of their work and call on federal enforcement officers  federal immigration law enforcement must respond to them   The President must lead on this issue   It is so bad now that state and local officers don t even bother to call                   Each of these steps is essential for any sound immigration system to work   They can be started now   They can be completed quickly   While they will cost money  they are affordable   If the President finds that more money  personnel  legal authority  and equipment are needed  requests should be made to Congress at once                    President Bush is a strong leader   When he wants something done in a hurry  he can get it done   He should be congratulated for taking some important steps to end the lawlessness of immigration   But  unless he promptly acts to jump start these stalled initiatives  we are in for more of the same                                2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama                     All rights
