of illegal immigrants into the United States  a bipartisan group of Senators today proposed legislation to focus on securing America  s borders to stop the flow of unlawful immigration  deter terrorists from entering the country  and enhance security measures including additional border agents and security equipment       The Border Security and Interior Enforcement Improvement Act of 2005 will devote additional resources to solidify U S  borders  The bill reflects the sponsors  belief that lax border security is one of the root causes of unlawful immigration and drug trafficking and has the potential to allow terrorists to enter the United States  The bipartisan border security bill is sponsored by Sens  Ben Nelson  D NE   Jeff Sessions  R AL  and Tom Coburn  R OK           To date  Congress has failed to address the flood of unlawful immigration across our borders because the existing approaches try to tackle every issue   said Nelson   Our bill focuses on securing our border and represents a new way of thinking on immigration reform by focusing on border security first         Any improvement in our current failed immigration system must start with a legal system that works     said Sessions     I ve been working at these issues for several years and believe this legislation contains many of the provisions that are essential if this nation is to restore the rule of law in immigration         America has long been a welcoming nation  but we are a nation governed by the rule of law   Tolerating illegal immigration undermines the rule of law and poses a threat to our national security   I believe the way to solve America s illegal immigration problem is to secure our borders  strictly enforce immigration laws and remove incentives to illegal immigration   said  Coburn       Key elements of the Border Security Act of 2005 include       Southwest Border Security  Provides for the construction of a border fence from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico  employs additional border patrol agents  and coordinates aerial surveillance with the Department of Defense        Sessions Immigration Page 2       Federal  State  Local Law
