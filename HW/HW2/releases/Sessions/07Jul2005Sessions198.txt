                                                                                   Thursday  July 7  2005                    WASHINGTON    Responding to the terrorist attacks in London  U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  today called on the Senate to pass legislation he authored that would close loopholes and toughen penalties for terrorist activities involving mass transportation systems                   The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sessions   bill last April and the measure is awaiting action by the full Senate        I introduced this bill last year following the terrorist train bombings in Madrid that killed nearly 200 people     Sessions said    Today  s barbaric attacks on the London subway and bus systems underscore the need to strengthen our laws for prosecuting  people who would use our mass transit systems to inflict terror on innocent civilians                        Thirty two million times a day Americans board public transportation systems  When they board the subway to commute to work  take Amtrak or a cruise ship  they should do so with the comfort of knowing our laws are fully adequate to deter and punish anyone who would attack them                      Sessions last year chaired a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his bill  which was endorsed by the Department of Justice  the Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration  Earlier this year  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee included Sessions   proposal in his leadership package of priority legislation for the 109th Congress  Sessions today wrote to Frist urging him to push for passage of the mass transit protection bill as soon as next week  when Congress returns from a Fourth Of July recess                      Sessions   bill  the Railroad Carriers and Mass Transportation Act of 2005   consolidates and eliminates inconsistencies in two prior laws   One is the Wrecking Trains Statute  enacted in 1948   The second is the Mass Transportation Anti Terrorism Statute  enacted as part of the USA Patriot Act                        These two laws provide different penalties for the same terrorist acts directed at mass transportation vehicles  leaving prosecutors with the difficult job of determining which statute they should apply when a terrorist is apprehended   For example  if a terrorist disables a train by setting fire to it  and the death of a passenger results  the Wrecking Trains statute authorizes prosecutors to seek the death penalty  while the Mass Transportation Anti Terrorism Statute provides only for life imprisonment                     Another inconsistency is the Mass Transportation Anti Terrorism Statute contains a more exhaustive list of prohibited conduct than the Wrecking Trains statute   Sessions   bill incorporates the more exhaustive list   Among other things  it would criminalize the placing of biological agents on or near a railway  releasing hazardous material on or near a railway and disabling a railroad dispatcher or conductor   It also criminalizes   attempted    terrorist attacks  such as the attack nearly carried out by shoe bomber Richard Reid   Anyone who attempts  threatens or conspires to engage in conduct which would endanger persons on trains or passenger vessels would be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years                    Sessions   bill adopts the definitions set forth in the Mass Transportation Statute  including a broad definition of    vehicle      The term vehicle includes any carriage or contrivance used  or capable of being used  as a means of transportation on land  on water or through the air   Further  it defines   dangerous weapon    to specifically include box cutters and pocket knives                   Sessions   bill would extend the same protections to railroads  freight trains and passenger vessels that already exist for other mass transportation systems        The current wrecking trains statute does not prohibit many types of attacks that are currently covered by this mass transportation statute     Sessions said    There is no reason that legislation should prohibit certain terrorist acts on an airplane  but not on a railroad carrier                       Finally  Sessions   bill explicitly covers commuter trains  such as Amtrak  and massive freight railroad operations   Freight operations carry huge amounts of cargo across the country every day  and  the protection of the economy requires protection of the infrastructure supporting our railroads  Sessions said        It is time to put the terrorists on notice that their activities against American citizens will be detected and will result in swift and harsh punishment     Sessions said    We have to give law enforcement the ability to prosecute and give the judicial system the ability to pass harsh sentences                               2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama                     All rights reserved
