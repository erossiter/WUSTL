                                                                                    Tuesday  November 15  2005      WASHINGTON    The Senate today approved a  441 6 billion Fiscal Year 2006 defense authorization bill that would boost soldiers   pay by 3 1 percent and includes  52 2 million for military construction spending at four Alabama installations  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  announced     The defense bill for the fiscal year that began October 1 contains  20 million for a Software Engineering Directorate  SED  annex at Huntsville  s Redstone Arsenal     The authorization for the Army  s SED expansion  which could result in several hundred new jobs  was not included in President Bush  s FY   06 budget request  But Sessions  a Senate Armed Services member  got the committee to approve the project  The SED produces critical software that undergirds the nation  s most advanced missile and aviation systems       One of my very first projects as a new senator in 1997 was to get an earlier SED expansion authorized by the Armed Services Committee     Sessions said    Since that time I  ve  come to value the work that the SED does for the soldier  I have long believed in its mission and the people who staff the facility  I was extremely pleased to be able to authorize a second expansion        The Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization Bill is expected to head for conference with members of the House Armed Services Committee later this month  Senate and House conferees will meet throughout the holidays to reconcile the two bills     As Chairman of the Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee  Sessions increased the authorization level for the  3 36 billion ground based missile defense program    headquartered at Redstone Arsenal    by  100 million       In consultation with senior missile defense officials  I saw the important need for improvement in missile testing     Sessions said    These much needed funds will permit the acquisition of several more test missiles needed to enhance our overall missile defense capability  and was the underlying reason for the aggressive stance we took during floor action to defeat a Democratic missile amendment designed to cut missile defense funding by  50 million        The  441 6 billion FY   06 authorization bill is  21 billion more than the Defense Department got last year  representing a 3 1 percent increase     The defense bill authorizes a total of  52 2 million in military construction spending at four Alabama installations                                                                   In addition to the  20 million SED funding  the bill would authorize  8 2 million for a Marine Corps readiness center addition at Ft  Whiting in Mobile   14 9 million for a squadron officer facility at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery and  9 1 million for an Alabama Air National Guard composite operations and training facility at Dannelly Field in Montgomery      The bill also authorizes funding for a number of defense programs and weapons systems built or managed in Alabama  such as      Huntsville                                                                    12

                                               6 million for emerging space control simulation technology                                                                  6 million for improvements to
