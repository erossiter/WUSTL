Year 2006 defense authorization bill that includes  20 million for a Software Engineering Directorate  SED  annex at Huntsville  s Redstone Arsenal  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  announced                   Overall  the defense spending bill for the fiscal year that begins October 1 also authorizes a boost in soldiers   pay by 3 1 percent and a 10 percent housing allowance increase for U S  service personnel worldwide                   The  20 million authorization for the Army  s SED expansion  which could result in several hundred new jobs  was not included in President Bush  s FY   06 budget request  But Sessions  a Senate armed services member  got the panel to approve the project  The SED produces critical software that undergirds the nation  s most advanced missile and aviation systems                     One of my very first projects as a new senator in 1997 was to get an earlier SED expansion authorized by the armed services committee     Sessions said    Since that time I  ve  come to value the work that the SED does for the soldier  I have long believed in its mission and the people who staff the facility  and I was glad to be able to authorize a second expansion                       The defense authorization bill is expected to reach the Senate floor late next week  The House of Representatives passed its defense bill earlier this month  Once the Senate passes its version  Senate and House conferees will meet to reconcile the two bills                   As chairman of the armed services Strategic Forces Subcommittee  Sessions increased the authorization level for the  3 36 billion ground based missile defense program    headquartered at Redstone Arsenal    by  100 million                     In consultation with senior missile defense officials  I saw the need for improvement in missile testing     Sessions said    These much needed funds will permit the acquisition of several more test missiles needed to enhance our overall missile defense capability                      The  441 6 billion FY   06 authorization bill is  21 billion more than the Defense Department got last year  representing a 3 1 percent increase                   The defense bill
