                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Monday  May 15  2006                    WASHINGTON    U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  today unveiled an impact analysis that shows the Senate immigration bill    should it become law    would permit up to 217 1 million new legal immigrants into the United States over the next 20 years  a number equal to 66 percent of the total current population of the United States                   Even if the maximum levels are not reached  the increase to the U S  population caused by S  2611 will be at least 78 7 million in 20 years  just over 25 percent of the total current population  This lower estimate assumes that the bill s escalating caps on certain visas will not increase at all over the next 20 years  if the bill s caps are hit each year  the total number will be the higher estimate                            Until now  most of us have focused on securing the border and deciding how to treat the illegal alien population already in the United States     Sessions said    Few  if any  of us have looked ahead to see what the long term numerical impact of the bill would be  My staff and I have just completed such a study  and the results are shocking                      Sessions discussed his findings at a news conference today  along with Robert Rector  a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation  who released his own analysis showing similar numbers                     As we begin debate today on the floor  my goal is to get these numbers before my colleagues so that they can appreciate just how breath takingly unsatisfactory this 614 page Senate bill is     Sessions said    We know that this country is going to treat the illegal alien population fairly   However  if the Senate wants to be successful in passing immigration reform  it should produce a bill that secures the borders and the workplace and establishes a commonsense  carefully thought out  legally enforceable policy for legal immigration in the future   For our immigration system to work  the Senate bill must guarantee that today  s facade of enforcement and illegal immigration flows won  t exist in the future                         If the current legal immigration level  950 000 a year for 20 years or 18 9 million over 20 years  is excluded from the total  according to Sessions  the Senate bill could be described as increasing legal immigration by 59 million to 198 2 million over 20 years                     These are actually very conservative estimates     Sessions said    For example   for the low end  we assumed the caps would never escalate  and we only added an average of 1 2 immediate family members coming in with each alien worker  Additionally  our numerical analysis did not add in estimates of future illegal immigration flows  or include any estimates for chain migration    the parents  brothers and sisters that new citizens can bring in on a permanent basis          Chain migration occurs when an immigrant becomes a citizen   Citizens have a legal       right to bring in family members other than spouses and children  They can bring in their parents  their adult siblings and the spouses and children of their adult siblings                       You can see how the potential exponential growth impact of the Senate legislation will cause consternation on the part of Congress and the American people       Sessions said                     The Senate bill would increase permanent future immigration into the United States in several ways        LOW SKILLED PERMANENT IMMIGRATION        H 2C Workers  By creating a new  H 2C  visa category for   temporary guest workers     low skilled workers  with an annual   cap    of 325 000 that increases up to 20 percent each year the cap is met  the bill allows at least 6 5 million  and up to 60 7 million new guest workers to come to the United States over the next 20 years  There is nothing   temporary    about these workers  Employers may file a green card application on their behalf as soon as they arrive in the United States  or the worker may self petition for a green card after four years of work       H 4 Family Members of H 2C Workers  By creating a new visa category  H 4  for the immediate family members of the future low skilled workers  H 2C   and allowing them to also receive green cards  the bill would allow at least 7 8 million  and up to 72 8 million immediate family members of low skilled workers to come to the United States over the next 20 years        HIGH SKILLED PERMANENT IMMIGRATION       H 1B  The bill would essentially open the borders to high skilled workers  as well as low skilled workers  By increasing the annual cap of 65 000 to 115 000  automatically increasing the new cap by 20 percent each year the cap is hit  and creating a new exemption to new cap for anyone who has an   advanced degree in science  technology  engineering  or math    from any foreign university  the number of H 1B workers coming into the United States would undoubtedly escalate  The 20 year impact of this escalation could be anywhere from 1 million to 20 1 million  H 1B workers are eligible for green cards and would be allowed to stay and work in the United States for as long as it takes to process the green card application         STEEP INCREASES TO ANNUAL GREEN CARD LIMITS          Family Based Green Cards  The bill would increase the annual cap on family based green cards available to non immediate family members  adult sons and daughters  adults siblings  and the spouses and children of adult siblings  by more than 100 percent  upping the current cap of 226 000 to 480 000 a year  Immediate family members are already able to immigrate without regard to the family based green card caps   The 20 year impact of this change would be an increase of 5 1 million non immediate family member green cards       Employment Based Green Cards The bill would increase the annual cap on employment based green cards by more than 500 percent  upping the current cap of 140 000 to 450 000 until 2016 and to 290 000 thereafter and exempting all immediate family members that currently count against the cap today  spouses  children and parents  from the newly escalated cap  The new exemption would result in an average of 540 000 family members receiving green cards each year of the first 10 years  and an average of 348 000 family members receiving green cards each year of the second 10 years  The 20 year impact of this change would be an increase of 13 5 million employment based green cards  for a total of 16 3 million employment based green cards issued over the course of the next 20 years                                  2004 United States Senator Jeff
