                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Sen  Jeff Sessions Explains His Opposition to Final Passage of the Senate Immigration Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thursday  May 25  2006                    WASHINGTON    U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  today announced his intention to vote against final passage of the immigration bill  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Sessions will serve on the conference committee that will try to reconcile the separately passed Senate and House immigration bills                     The American people were counting on us to secure our borders and restore the rule of law to our immigration system     Sessions said    Unfortunately  the United States Senate today let the American people down by passing a deeply flawed bill that gives the illegal alien population every benefit this nation can bestow  and increases future legal immigration levels by three to five times the current level  Additionally  the immigration levels for the future ensure that 70 percent of the large influx will be admitted without having to meet any educational  skill or language requirements                    According to Sessions  the fatal flaws are numerous                                                        Border Security   Although I was glad the Senate approved my amendment to increase the amount of fencing and vehicle barriers along our southwest border  the border is not secured by this bill   The border security and immigration enforcement provisions will have to be paid for in the future  not just authorized by this bill    An   enforcement trigger    amendment  which I voted for  but which failed to pass  was needed to ensure that the American people are not promised immigration enforcement that is never delivered                                                      Workplace Enforcement  Workplace enforcement is an integral component of effective immigration enforcement   Today  no mandatory  workplace verification system exists  and employers know they can get away with hiring illegal workers   This must end   The provisions in the bill that attempt to address the problems in the workplace are deficient and will not work                                                        Amnesty  If amnesty means anything  it means giving illegal aliens every benefit that legal immigrants receive   Under the bill  a vast majority of the illegal alien population will be given every benefit our nation can bestow on its citizens  including participation in the Social Security System based on their illegal work histories                                                      Temporary Worker Program is Not Temporary  Though it has been sold as a   temporary guest worker program   there is nothing   temporary   about the new guest worker program created by this bill  Almost every new   temporary guest worker   who comes in the future will be eligible for legal permanent resident status  a green card  and put on the path to citizenship                                                      Future Immigration Levels  The bill increases future legal immigration at least three times the current level   Instead of 18 9 million people coming in the next 20 years  more than 66 million people will immigrate over the same time period   That number is too high                                                       The Needs of the United States    The bill does nothing to ensure that our nation  s future immigration policy reflects our country  s needs   Developed nations have reformed their immigration policies to prioritize high skilled immigration over large scale low skilled and extended family chain migration   This bill prioritizes low skilled and chain migration over skill based immigration  an approach we should reject                                                      Fiscal Impact    No official study has been conducted on the huge adverse financial impact this bill will create in the out years  According to the Congressional Budget Office  the bill will increase direct spending by  54 billion and discretionary spending by  64 billion in just the first 10 years  The Heritage Foundation projects the bill will increase long term federal spending by at least  50 billion a year    These are staggering numbers that indicate that this bill might have costs as great as half a trillion dollars in any future 10 year period  This bill is a huge  monumental budget buster                              2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama                     All rights reserved
