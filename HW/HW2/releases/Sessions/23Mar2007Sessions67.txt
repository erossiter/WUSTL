                                                                               Senators Feinstein and Sessions Continue Effort to Stop Controlled Substances from Being Sold Online Without Valid Prescriptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Friday  March 23  2007         Washington  DC   U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and Jeff Sessions  R Ala   today reintroduced legislation to hold accountable those who operate unregistered pharmacies on the Internet and protect the safety of consumers who wish to fill legitimate prescriptions online          Senator Feinstein first drafted legislation to stop the dangerous practices of rogue online pharmacies after Ryan Haight  a California high school honors student and athlete  died in 2001 from an overdose of the painkiller hydrocodone   He had purchased the painkiller from an online pharmacy after simply filling out an online questionnaire describing himself as a 25 year old male suffering from chronic back pain   The doctor prescribing the drug never met or personally examined Ryan          The bill introduced today  originally drafted by Senator Sessions  is designed to stop Internet pharmacies that sell controlled substances without a valid prescription  not pharmacies that sell drugs at a low cost to individuals who have a valid prescription from their U S  doctors           Today  controlled substances are just a click away on the Internet   This is dangerous and it should be stopped   Senator Feinstein said    This legislation bans the dangerous practices of rogue pharmacies and requires all controlled substances purchased on the Internet to be done with a legitimate prescription and a medical examination             Law enforcement officers in Alabama have expressed concern   Senator Sessions said   Abuse of controlled substances  often by minors  is a problem we must continually combat  Recently  the internet has exploded with online pharmacies making sales without requiring a valid prescription or verifying the age or identity of the person buying the controlled substance   This has made some of the most dangerous and addictive painkillers easy to obtain without a valid prescription   Often  minors are the individuals ordering these substances over the internet                   Prescription drug abuse is growing in the United States  with 15 1 million adults admitting to abuse of prescription drugs in a 2003 study   That number represents a 94 percent increase in the last decade          Last month  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that deaths from accidental drug overdoses nearly doubled from 1999 to 2004  increasing from 11 155 in 1999 to 19 838 in 2004   Accidental drug overdoses are now the nation s second leading cause of accidental death   The CDC has attributed the rise in drug overdose deaths to a higher use of prescription painkillers and increasing numbers of overdoses of cocaine and prescription sedatives         Ready access to controlled substances over the Internet is helping to fuel addictions   Senator Feinstein said    Patients use these pharmacies to obtain addictive drugs  like Vicodin and Oxycontin   They can receive these dangerous drugs without a doctor performing a physical exam to ensure that an underlying health condition will not cause a dangerous side effect   Often  a credit card is all that is required           Bill Summary       The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2007 amends the Controlled Substances Act   It would         I                   Bar the sale or distribution of a controlled substance via the Internet without a valid prescription   A practitioner must conduct an in person examination of a patient in order for a prescription to be considered valid         II                 Require Online Pharmacies to display information identifying the business  the pharmacist  and any physician associated with the website   Pharmacies must also clearly display a statement of compliance on their homepage   This will allow consumers to clearly identify which pharmacies are safe  and which are not         III              Create tough penalties for pharmacies that continue to operate outside the law  by clarifying that such activities are subject to the current federal laws against illegal distributions  and the same penalties applicable to hand to hand sales   Internet distributors  like other drug dealers  could be prosecuted in our federal courts  and if convicted would face sentences of up to life imprisonment  as well as forfeiture of their criminally derived proceeds        IV             Increase the penalties for illegal distributions of controlled substances categorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration as Schedule III  IV and V substances   For Schedule III substances  existing maximum penalties would be doubled  up to 10 years for a first conviction  and to 20 years for a second conviction  and new penalties of up to 30 years would be added if death or serious bodily injury results   The bill adopts similar increases for Schedule IV and V substances  with longer periods of supervised release also available to follow prison terms ordered on these drug distribution convictions        V                Allow a state attorney general  after giving the U S  Department of Justice notice and an opportunity to intervene  to shut down a rogue site across the country  rather than only bar sales to consumers of his or her state                                 2004 United States Senator Jeff
