                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wednesday  February 21  2007      MONTGOMERY   U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions and Gov  Bob Riley today called on Congress to pass legislation designed to improve adolescent literacy                   At a joint news conference at the Alabama Department of Education  Sessions said that he would be introducing legislation next month  called the Striving Readers Act  that would provide grants to states and districts to create literacy programs specifically for middle and high school students   The legislation would help ensure that students at risk of dropping out because they read below grade level receive the literacy interventions they need to earn a high school diploma                    The Striving Readers Act marks an important and urgent investment in the older student   said Sessions   We must not risk squandering the investments Congress has already made through the important Reading First program for younger students   But with 70 percent of our middle and high school students reading below grade level  we know we must continue our support with ongoing programs that reflect the needs of the older student for more advanced vocabulary and comprehension skills    All students  throughout their K 12 educational experience  deserve adequate support to ensure on time graduation with appropriate skills and knowledge that meet the demands of the 21st century                    Riley pointed out that Alabama had implemented an effective model for literacy initiatives in secondary schools since 1998   Some 135 intermediate and secondary schools in Alabama have benefited from this model for adolescent literacy   Funding  however  has been concentrated in Grades K 3 where the gains in student achievement are obvious                      The Striving Readers project will provide funding for adolescent literacy programs in Alabama s neediest middle schools and high schools   Riley said   Alabama has been one of the nation s leaders in implementing an effective literacy program  Striving Readers can make adolescent literacy programs a reality for all states                          Sessions said the Striving Readers Act has bipartisan support  noting that U S  Sen  Patty Murray  D WA  is co sponsoring the legislation            This Striving Readers funding will provide resources for effective adolescent literacy initiatives for Alabama s most needy students   Sessions said   Everyone has seen the outstanding impact of Alabama s Reading Initiative and the federal Reading First program for younger children in Alabama   It is time for us to join together to meet the needs of students in the upper grades who are below grade level  Many of them drop out  or they graduate without the skills they need to succeed in the workforce   I applaud Alabama s leadership on this important issue as they work to expand the Alabama Reading Initiative into middle and high schools  and I am honored to offer legislation to promote this effort on the national level                      Once fully phased in  the bill would cost  1 billion annually  Alabama s share would be about  22 million                   Striving Readers was first piloted in 2004 as a Title I demonstration program funded solely through the appropriations process   Last year s funding was  29 7 million  which was enough for only eight competitive grants   The Sessions Murray bill would authorize  200 million in FY2008  with increasing funding to FY2012  which would allow expansion of Striving Readers to every state         Specifically  the Sessions Murray bill would                    Help states create statewide literacy initiatives for students in grades 4  12  share data on student progress to parents and the public  and improve teacher training and professional development in literacy so that all students receive high quality instruction                    Help districts and schools create plans to improve literacy for adolescents  develop top notch assessments  train teachers in every subject area in literacy strategies and use regular data to improve teaching and learning                   Allow districts and schools to hire and place literacy coaches  train parents to support the literacy development of their child  and connect learning inside the classroom with learning that takes place outside the classroom                   Require states  districts  and schools to participate in a rigorous evaluation that demonstrates student progress                    Require the federal government to complete an overall evaluation of the program to determine its impact on the nation s middle and high schools                            2004 United
