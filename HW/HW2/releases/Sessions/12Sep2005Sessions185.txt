                                                                                   Monday  September 12  2005      Judge Roberts  congratulations on your nomination to be our nation s 17th Chief Justice       You are one of our nation s premier lawyers who has won the respect of colleagues  adversaries and judges for your integrity  professionalism and legal skill   But  as you have already seen  our confirmation process is not a pretty sight   Time and again  you will have your legal positions  your pre_decisional memoranda  even as a young lawyer  distorted and taken out of context   These attacks are driven by outside leftist groups   They will dig through the many complex cases you have dealt with in an effort to attack your record   They will produce  on cue  the most dire warnings that civil liberties in America will be lost if the Senate confirms you as a federal judge   It is really a form letter   All they have to do is place your name in the blank space   These tactics are unfair   and sometimes dishonest  as we saw with the forced withdrawal by the National Abortion Rights Action League of its false and contemptible advertisement       My advice to you is this   keep your famous good humor  take your time  and explain the procedural posture of the cases and exactly how you ruled as a judge or the position you took as a lawyer   Americans know these matters are often complex and will appreciate your answers       The American commitment to the rule of law is one of our most exceptional characteristics as a people   It is the foundation of our liberties and our productive economic system   This tradition is a product of centuries of development       In his magnificent speech in March of 1775 in the House of Commons  urging King George not to go to war against the colonies  Edmund Burke described America s commitment to the rule of law by saying    In no country perhaps in the world is the law so general a study     I hear that they have sold nearly as many of Blackstone s Commentaries  on the law  in America as in England        But activism by a growing number of judges threatens confidence in the judiciary  Activism is when a judge allows his personal views on a policy issue to infect legal judgments   Activist rulings cease to be based on statutes or the Constitution  but reflect whatever a judge may think is decent or wise public policy   This should not be  but even some members of this body have encouraged it   Indeed  Judge Roberts  a senator in recent weeks demanded to know whose  side  you are on before he voted    His statement  while shocking  provides a direct glance into the philosophy of activism   When we have an  activist  judiciary  the personal views of a judge become everything   Who the judge is and whose side he is on  not the law and the facts  will determine the outcome of the case         Since federal judges hold their offices for as long as they live  and are  unaccountable to the citizenry  activist rulings strike at the heart of our democracy       Five members of the court may effectively become a continuing constitutional convention on important questions such as the taking of private property  the definition of marriage  the pledge of allegiance or even prayer at football games   If a Congress acts wrongly  new members may be elected and the result change by a simple majority   A Supreme Court decision founded on the Constitution can be changed only by constitutional amendment which requires a vote of two thirds of both houses of Congress  plus a vote of three fourths of the state legislatures       This results driven philosophy does not respect the law   Indeed  it destroys the law   It is a post_modern philosophy that elevates outcomes over the law   Many believe the law does not have an inherent moral power  and that words do not have  and cannot have  fixed meanings   Judges are thus encouraged to liberally interpret words to reach a result the judge believes is correct   Activist Supreme Court judges do this by saying they are interpreting the words of the Constitution in light of  evolving standards of decency    This phrase has actually formed the legal basis for a number of recent decisions   But as a legal test  it utterly fails because the words can mean whatever the judge wants them to mean   It is not objective  cannot be consistently followed  and is thus by definition not law  but license   Such vague standards provide the court a license to legislate    a power the Constitution did not provide to judges   Indeed  recently this license has led some judges to conclude that they may look beyond American law or American standards of decency to the standards of foreign nations in an attempt to justify their decision   The arrogant nature of this concept is revealed by a Supreme Court ruling in 2003    There  a majority of the U  S  Supreme Court explicitly declared that the Constitution prohibits the elected representatives of the people from relying on established morality as a basis for the laws they pass   The court thus declares itself free to amend the Constitution by redefining its words to impose whatever it decides is  evolving standards of decency    Yet at the same time  the Supreme Court prohibits legislatures from enacting laws based on objective standards of morality        While these unprincipled decisions are becoming too frequent  I do not want to suggest that such is the common practice because it is not   Having practiced full time in federal court for more than 14 years   I witnessed this first hand    Day after day   if the law and facts were on my side  I would win consistently  if they were not  I would lose   This was true regardless of whether the judge was a Democrat  a Republican  a liberal or a conservative       Certainly  our founders were so adamant that judges be unbiased and fair that they drafted a Constitution that gave them a lifetime appointment and provided that Congress could not even reduce their pay   Our founders believed this independence would enhance objectivity and  justice        My fear today is that many have come to believe that to expect objectivity in judges is hopelessly naive   Liberals and conservatives openly make this point   Our able colleague  Senator Schumer  when he chaired the Courts Subcommittee  held hearings contending that all judges have ideologies  that we should admit that their political views affect their decisions  and we should openly inquire about these personal beliefs   A writer in the conservative National Review complained that Republicans are hurting the conservative cause by insisting on  abiding by those outdated norms     In effect  he suggests conservatives should get their guys in there to promote conservative ideas       While many advocates on the left and right would like a court that promotes their agenda  I do not want that and neither do the American people   What we must have  what our legal system demands  is a fair and unbiased  umpire who calls the game according to the existing rules  and does so competently and honestly every day   This is the American ideal of law       Ideals are important because they form the goals to which we all strive   We must never abandon our  ideal of unbiased judges  judges who rule fairly  without regard to politics   Two important  bipartisan commissions  The Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and Citizens for Independent Courts  have issued reports that deplore any policies that would tend to politicize the courts   These hearings provide the nation an excellent opportunity to discuss these important concepts       Our nation cries out for judges who love the law and who work every day to uphold its moral authority   The people rightly demand judges who follow  not make law   From everything I have seen  Judge John Roberts  you are just the man to fill that need       straight from central casting        We unanimously confirmed you two years ago to the U  S  Court of Appeals   I am confident that after this exhaustive process you will be confirmed to the august position of Chief Justice       I look forward to participating in the hearing with you and congratulate you on being nominated for this position                              2004 United States
