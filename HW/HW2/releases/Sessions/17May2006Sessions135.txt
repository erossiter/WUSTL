                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wednesday  May 17  2006      WASHINGTON    The Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  approved a federal HIV AIDS funding bill today that includes an estimated  5 million in new money for Alabama  announced Sen  Jeff Sessions  a member of the panel                    I am pleased that this legislation will send new money to the state   It also allocates more funding for Alabama and other states which have seen the largest increases in new patients but have not received money to meet this growing need     Sessions said                   The bill  known as the Ryan White CARE Act  provides funding for medical care  anti retroviral treatments  counseling and testing for HIV AIDS patients who need it the most                 The previous HIV AIDS funding formulas under Ryan White  in place since 1990  directed a great deal of money to   eligible metropolitan areas       cities with more than 2 000 reported AIDS cases in the past five years    rather than simply allowing money to follow HIV AIDS patients in each state  This system has allowed eligible metropolitan areas to get direct money from the federal government  in addition to their state funds  According to a June 2005 Government Accountability Office report  some states receive  1 500 more than other states per AIDS case  thanks to the formula that favors big cities                 The South has been particularly hard hit in recent years  with seven of the nation  s 10 highest AIDS case rates located in the region  Because Alabama has never had an   eligible metropolitan area     the state received  3 657 per AIDS patient in federal money  compared to  5 264 per patient in California in Fiscal Year 2004  the latest year for which information is available                 Alabama received approximately  12 million in Ryan White formula funding in FY 2004  This new legislation would send an additional estimated  5 million in the formula funding to serve patients across the state  The new bill would bring some of the   big city    funding into Alabama for the first time  It also aims to stop the   double counting    of patients living in metropolitan areas  who have previously been counted for both local and state funds through Ryan White               I am glad to report that this bill has made the HIV AIDS funding formulas more equitable  guaranteeing that states such as Alabama will receive an adequate portion of the federal money available  based on the number of patients  It is essential that the money go to where the epidemic is today                                                                  In 2004  the latest year for which statistics are available  Alabama had 5 729 cumulative HIV cases and 7 744 cumulative AIDS cases  Alabama is one of several states with a federal AIDS Drug Assistance Program waiting list that at times has swelled to more than 600 patients  Alabama ranks 13th in cumulative HIV cases and 24th in cumulative AIDS cases                   We have devoted  40 million to ensure that people who are diagnosed with AIDS have access to the medication they need   It is unconscionable to tell someone they have AIDS and then delay the start of necessary medication     Sessions said    We will also begin including HIV patients as part of the funding formula  which is key for Alabama where HIV cases have been on the rise   While states treat HIV patients  Ryan White funding was only provided for AIDS patients   This will provide a more accurate picture of the needs that exist and the funding will follow                    Problems with Ryan White have included inconsistencies with the ways states spent their funding   Because of the inequities in the formula  some states receive an excess of funding and they can provide services like dog walking  art lessons  and massage therapy while states like Alabama cannot even provide basic medical care for their patients  Sessions is pleased that this legislation makes certain that funding is spent as it is intended   for medical care                     This bill requires that 75 percent of the funding be used for core medical services  which is a big step toward eliminating wasteful spending   The changes we made ensure that medical care comes first and remains the focus     Sessions said                The Centers for Disease Control estimates that about 40 000 people in the United States become infected with HIV each year  and that more than 1 million Americans currently have HIV AIDS  African Americans account for more than half of all new AIDS cases  and African American women account for two thirds of new AIDS cases among women       I have also worked to ensure that testing is encouraged  as an estimated 300 000 people in America with HIV or AIDS are unaware that they have it   When people know they have it  they are less likely to spread the disease  and they can take medications that will improve and prolong their lives   It is important that HIV testing become a part of routine medical care in order to best prevent the spread of this devastating disease        The House of Representatives is scheduled to consider the Senate bill next month                              2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama
