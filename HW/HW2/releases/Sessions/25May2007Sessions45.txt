Fiscal Year 2008 defense authorization bill that includes  42 million for Advanced Hypersonic Weapons and restored  480 million in authorization for the Littoral Combat Ship  U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  announced today                   The legislation authorizes a wide range of programs to provide research  technology  training  and resources necessary to support America s servicemen and women engaged in the War on Terrorism                     I am proud that Alabama continues to be a national leader in defense activities that are essential to equipping our troops with the most advanced technology available   said Sessions    This bill includes a host of programs that will help keep the United States military postured to protect America s interests around the world                    As Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee  Sessions worked to increase the authorization level for the Advanced Hypersonic Weapons to  42 million to provide primary and applied research for the program  Major elements of the research program  a part of the Space and Missile Defense Command  are conducted in Huntsville   Research conducted there is critical to developing ultra high speed conventional missiles that have the capability to precisely strike targets at extreme distances                    Advanced Hypersonic Weapons technology is the wave of the future for long range missiles   This capability will allow us to respond rapidly with conventional weapons   Sessions said    The ability to strike with precision worldwide will reduce our reliance on nuclear options                    The full committee adopted an amendment offered by Sessions and Sen  Susan Collins  R ME  to restore  480 million in authorization for the Littoral Combat Ship  LCS    The LCS is the first of the U S  Navy s next generation of surface combat ships   The ship  intended to operate close to shore  is designed to engage in anti submarine warfare  anti mine operations  and force protection   Prior to the Sessions amendment  the underlying sub committee mark zeroed out the LCS program                    I am pleased that we were able to provide funding to sustain development of this critical Navy system   The LCS program has experienced significant challenges  but the Secretary of the Navy has acted promptly and responsibly to control cost growth   Sessions said    I am proud of the hard work that has been done in Mobile  and I want to ensure the program remains viable and competitive   While there are some available and unspent funds in the LCS account  I will work to reach higher levels of funding to ensure this top Navy priority is kept on track                     Sessions announced the bill secured an additional  105 million above the President s budget request for the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense  THAAD  missile system   Under the committee passed legislation  that program would now be authorized at  963 billion   The THAAD anti missile technology provides force protection for U S  troops and civilians from incoming missiles in their final stage of attack   Much of the work on the THAAD system is conducted Troy and Huntsville                    The Terminal High Altitude Air Defense system provides force and population defense against many of the short and intermediate range threats our soldiers and allies face today   Sessions said    I continue to be encouraged by the progress of this program  as evidenced by the successful April 2007 test   The system s hit to kill capability is critical for providing regional missile defense protection                        The defense authorization bill is expected to reach the Senate floor this summer   The House of Representatives finalized its authorization bill earlier this month   Once both chambers have passed the legislation  Senate and House conferees will meet to reconcile the two bills                    The project list includes        Huntsville      o         42 million for development of Advanced Hypersonic Weapons by the U S  Army Space and Missile Defense Command      o         20 million in military construction authorizations for Phase II of the Software Engineering Annex at Redstone Arsenal      o         11 million for development of Operationally Responsive Space and Tactical Satellite programs managed by U S  Army Space and Missile Defense Command      o         5 million to continue development of Space Control Test Capabilities      o         10 million for the Phalanx Next Generation Ship Self Defense System      o         9 million for the Global Air Traffic Management for KC 135 Tankers      o         6 million for Special Operations Command Stand Off Precision Guided Munitions      o         5 million for Aircraft Component Remediation to improve existing UH 60 helicopters      o         2 million for Quick Material Express Delivery Systems        Troy      o         105 million for the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense  THAD  missile system       Anniston      o         137 9 million for the Army   30 3 million for the Navy and Marine Corps and  18 2 million for the Air Force for Hydra 70 rockets  equaling the President s request      o         402 million increase nationally in Army depot maintenance funding over FY 2008       Mobile      o         314 5 million  equaling the President s request  for the KC X tanker transport that EADS and Northrop Grumman are competing to build for the Air Force      o        Bill language to require the KC X tanker competition to be fair and open      o         480 million for the Littoral Combat Ship  with a portion of the program to be executed in Mobile                                2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama                     All
