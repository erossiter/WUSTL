                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Statement of U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions on the Air Force decision today to allow the Boeing Company to bid again on government rocket contracts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Friday  March 4  2005        I am pleased to learn that after a lengthy and thorough investigation by the United States Air Force and the Department of Defense  the 20 month suspension of the Boeing Company from conducting Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle  EELV  launches has been lifted            As a former prosecutor  I understand the Department s efforts to hold those responsible who violate the Procurement Integrity Act  Guilty officials at all levels must be held accountable for their actions   The Boeing Company has  however  responded very quickly to all the recommendations made by the Air Force to improve its integrity in procurement systems and train its employees on ethical standards of conduct   These actions are what Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld expects from our leading defense corporations         I realize this long suspension has been hard on the hundreds of fine employees in the Decatur plant  who are innocent of wrongdoing  This was a pivotal decision for the Decatur facility and can only be positive for its future  I believe the plant is ready to seize the opportunities the lifting of the suspension provides  Boeing and our superb Decatur production facility are now ready for bidding on rocket orders worth as much as  4 billion   Boeing s Delta IV rockets will once again thunder into the sky and deliver the assured access to space that is critical to the defense of our great nation                               2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama                     All rights reserved
