                                                                               Sen  Sessions Releases List of 20 Loopholes in the Senate Immigration Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Monday  June 4  2007          WASHINGTON  U S  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R AL  released a list of 20 loopholes in the comprehensive immigration bill today which reveals that the bill is fatally flawed and will not establish a functioning immigration system in the future    The list of loopholes includes flaws effecting border security  chain migration and assimilation policies  The list exposes the lack of serious attention given to ensuring that the legislation fixes Americas failed immigration system     I am deeply concerned about the numerous loopholes we have found in this legislation  They are more than technical errors  but rather symptoms of a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation that stands no chance of actually fixing our broken immigration system  Sessions said  Many of the loopholes are indicative of a desire not to have the system work    For example  one loophole in the enforcement trigger fails to require the U S  VISIT system  the biometric border check in check out system established by Congress in 1996  but never implemented  to be fully functioning before new worker or amnesty programs begin  Without the system in place  the U S  has no method of ensuring that workers and their families do not overstay their visas    Another flaw in the legislation prevents the benefits of merit based immigration from taking full effect until 2016  Until then  chain migration into the U S  will actually triple  compared to a disproportionately low increase in skill based immigration  As a result  the merit based system in the bill is only a shell of what it should have been    A third loophole in the bill allows immigrants to avoid demonstrating a proficiency in English for more than a decade  Illegal aliens are not required to learn English to receive full probationary benefits of citizenship  Passing a basic English test is only required for the third Z visa renewal  twelve years after amnesty is granted     Sessions will highlight many of the loopholes contained in the list this week during Senate debate on the immigration bill     A full list of the 20 loopholes is attached       20 Loopholes in the Senate Immigration Bill    Loophole 1  Legal Status Before Enforcement     Amnesty benefits do not wait for the enforcement trigger  After filing an application and waiting 24 hours  illegal aliens will receive full probationary benefits  complete with the ability to legally live and work in the U S   travel outside of the U S  and return  and their own social security card  Astonishingly  if the trigger is never met and amnesty applications are therefore never approved  the probationary benefits granted to the illegal alien population never expire  and the new social security cards issued to the illegal alien population are not revoked   See pp  1  290 291   315     Loophole 2  U S  VISIT Exit Not In Trigger    The enforcement trigger  required to be met before the new temporary worker program begins  does not require that the exit portion of U S  VISIT system  the biometric border check in check out system first required by Congress in 1996 that is already well past its already postponed 2005 implementation due date  to be in place before new worker or amnesty programs begin  Without the U S  VISIT exit portion  the U S  has no method to ensure that workers  or their visiting families  do not overstay their visas  Our current illegal population contains 4 to 5 5 million visa overstays  therefore  we know that the U S  VISIT exit component is key to a successful new temporary worker program   See pp  1 2     Loophole 3  Trigger Requires No More Agents  Beds  or Fencing Than Current Law     The enforcement trigger does not require the Department of Homeland Security to have detention space sufficient to end catch and release at the border and in the interior  Even after the adoption of amendment 1172  the trigger merely requires the addition of 4 000 detention beds  bringing DHS to a 31 500 bed capacity  This is far short of the 43 000 beds required under current law to be in place by the end of 2007  or the additional 20 000 beds required later in the bill  Additionally  the bill establishes a catch  pay  and release program  This policy will benefit illegal aliens from countries other than Mexico that are caught at the border  then can post a  5 000 bond  be released and never show up for deportation hearings  Annual failure to appear rates for 2005 and 2006  caused in part by lack of detention space  doubled the 2004 rate  106 000  110 000 compared with 54 000   Claims that the bill expands fencing are inaccurate  The bill only requires 370 miles of fencing to be completed  while current law already mandates that more than 700 miles be constructed  See pp  1 2   10 11  and EOIRs FY2006 Statistical Yearbook  p  H2  and The Secure Fence Act of 2004     Loophole 4    Three Additional Years Worth of Illegal Aliens Granted Status  Treated Preferentially To Legal Filers    Aliens who broke into the country illegally a mere 5 months ago  are treated better than foreign nationals who legally applied to come to the U S  more than two years ago  Aliens who can prove they were illegally in the U S  on January 1  2007  are immediately eligible to apply from inside the U S  for amnesty benefits  while foreign nationals that filed applications to come to the U S  after May 1  2005 must start the application process over again from their home countries  Last years bill required illegal aliens to have been here before January 7  2004 to qualify for permanent legal status   See pp  263  282   306     Loophole 5  Completion of Background Checks Not Required For Probationary Legal Status    Legal status must be granted to illegal aliens 24 hours after they file an application  even if the aliens have not yet passed all appropriate background checks   Last years bill gave DHS 90 days to check an aliens background before any status was granted   No legal status should be given to any illegal alien until all appropriate background checks are complete   See pp  290     Loophole 6  Some Child Molesters Are Still Eligible    Some aggravated felons  those who have sexually abused a minor  are eligible for amnesty  A child molester who committed the crime before the bill is enacted is not barred from getting amnesty if their conviction document omitted the age of the victim  The bill corrects this loophole for future child molesters  but does not close the loophole for current or past convictions   See p  47  30 33   p  48  1 2    Loophole 7  Terrorism Connections Allowed  Good Moral Character Not Required    Illegal aliens with terrorism connections are not barred from getting amnesty  An illegal alien seeking most immigration benefits must show good moral character  Last years bill specifically barred aliens with terrorism connections from having good moral character and being eligible for amnesty  This years bill does neither  Additionally  bill drafters ignored the Administrations request that changes be made to the asylum  cancellation of removal  and withholding of removal statutes in order to prevent aliens with terrorist connections from receiving relief   Compare 204 in S  2611 from the 109th Congress with missing 204 on p  48 of S A  1150   see missing subsection  5  on p  287 of S A  1150      Loophole 8  Gang Members Are Eligible    Instead of ensuring that members of violent gangs such as MS 13 are deported after coming out of the shadows to apply for amnesty  the bill will allow violent gang members to get amnesty as long as they renounce their gang membership on their application   See p  289  34 36     Loophole 9  Absconders Are Eligible    Aliens who have already had their day in court  those subject to final orders of removal  voluntary departure orders  or reinstatement of their final orders of removal  are eligible for amnesty under the bill  The same is true for aliens who have made a false claim to citizenship or engaged in document fraud  More than 636 000 alien fugitives could be covered by this loophole   See p  285 19 22 which waives the following inadmissibility grounds  failure to attend a removal proceeding  final orders of removal for alien smuggling  aliens unlawfully present after previous immigration violations or deportation orders  and aliens previously removed  This appears to conflict with language on p  283 40 41  When a direct conflict appears in a statute  the statue is interpreted by the courts to the benefit of the alien      Loophole 10  Learning English Not Required For A Decade    Illegal aliens are not required to demonstrate any proficiency in English for more than a decade after they are granted amnesty  Learning English is not required for an illegal alien to receive probationary benefits  the first 4 year Z visa  or the second 4 year Z visa  The first Z visa renewal  the second 4 year Z visa  requires only that the alien demonstrate an attempt to learn English by being on a waiting list for English classes  Passing a basic English test is required only for a second Z visa renewal  the third 4 year Z visa   and even then the alien only has to pass the test prior to the expiration of the second extension of Z status  12 years down the road    See pp  295 296     Loophole 11  Earned Income Tax Credit Will Cost Taxpayers Billions In Just 10 Years     Current illegal aliens and new guest workers will be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit  a refundable tax credit designed to encourage American citizens and legal permanent residents to work  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this loophole will cost the U S  taxpayer up to  20 billion dollars in just the first 10 years after the bills enactment  To be consistent with the intent of the 1996 welfare reforms  which limited new immigrants from receiving public benefits until they had been legal permanent residents for five years  the bill should withhold EITC eligibility from amnestied aliens until they become legal permanent residents  Closing this loophole will save the taxpayers billions of dollars   See p  293 after S A  1190 was adopted  p  307  p  315  606  All that is required for EITC eligibility is a social security number and resident alien status  Nothing in the bills tax provisions limit EITC eligibility  The issuance of social security numbers to aliens as soon as they apply for amnesty will ensure they are able to qualify for the EITC     Loophole 12  Affidavits From Friends Accepted As Evidence     Records from day labor centers  labor unions  and sworn declarations from any non relative  acquaintances  friends  coworkers  etc  are to be accepted as evidence that the illegal alien has satisfied the bills amnesty requirements  This low burden of proof will invite fraud and more illegal immigration  even aliens who are not yet in the U S  will likely meet this burden of proof  DHS will not have the resources to examine whether the claims contained in the sworn declarations of the aliens friends  that the alien was here prior to January 1  2007 and is currently employed  are actually valid   See p  293  13 16     Loophole 13  Taxpayer Funded Legal Counsel and Arbitration    Free legal counsel and the fees and expenses of arbitrators will be provided to aliens that have been working illegally in agriculture  The U S  taxpayer will fund the attorneys that help these individuals fill out their amnesty applications  Additionally  if these individuals have a dispute with their employer over whether they were fired for just cause  DHS will pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator   See p  339 37 41   p  332  37 38     Loophole 14  In State Tuition and Student Loans     In state tuition and other higher education benefits  such as Stafford Loans  will be made available to current illegal aliens that are granted initial probationary status  even if the same in state tuition rates are not offered to all U S  citizens  This would normally violate current law  8 U S C  1623  which mandates that educational institutions give citizens the same postsecondary education benefits they offer to illegal aliens   See p  321  8 31     Loophole 15  Inadequacy of the Merit System     The merit system  designed to shift the U S  green card distribution system to attract higher skilled workers that benefit the national interest  is only a shell of what it should have been  Though the merit system begins immediately  it will not increase the percentage of high skilled immigrants coming to the United States until 2016  8 years after enactment  Of the 247 000 green cards dedicated to the merit based system each year for the first 5 years  100 000 green cards will be reserved for low skilled guest workers  10 000  and for clearing the current employment based green card backlog  90 000   From 2013 to 2015  the number of merit based green cards drops to 140 000  and of that number  100 000 green cards are still reserved each year for low skilled guest workers  10 000  and for clearing the current employment based green card backlog  90 000   Even after 2015  when the merit system really begins  in 2016  by having 380 000 green cards annually  10 00 green cards will be reserved specifically for low skilled workers  and points will be given for many characteristics that are not considered high skilled  For example  16 points will be given for aliens in high demand occupations which includes janitors  maids  food preparation workers  and groundskeepers   See p 260  25  p  261  20  p  262   The Department of Labors list of occupations with the largest job growth available at       Loophole 16  Visas For Individuals That Plan To Overstay    The new parent visa contained in the bill which allows parents of citizens  and the spouses and children of new temporary workers  to visit a worker in the United States is not only a misnomer  but also an invitation for high rates of visa overstays  This new visa specifically allows the spouse and children of new temporary workers who intend to abandon their residence in a foreign country  to qualify to come to the U S  to visit  The visa requires only a  1 000 bond  which will be forfeited when  not if  family members of new temporary workers decide to overstay their 30 day visit  Workers should travel to their home countries to visit their families  not the other way around   See p  277 1  33  and p  276  38 43     Loophole 17  Chain Migration Tippled Before Being Eliminated     Though the bill will eventually eliminate chain migration  relatives other than spouses and children of citizens and legal permanent residents   it will not have full effect until 2016  Until then  chain migration into the U S  will actually triple  from approximately 138 000 chain migrants a year  equal to 14  of the 1 million green cards the U S  currently distributes on an annual basis  to approximately 440 000 chain migrants a year  equal to 45  of the 1 million green cards the U S  currently distributes on an annual basis    See pp  260 13  p  270  29  pp  271  17    Loophole 18  Back Taxes Not Required    Last years bill required illegal aliens to prove they had paid three of their last five years of taxes to get amnesty  This year  payment of back taxes is not required for amnesty  The bill requires taxes to be paid at the time of application for a green card  but at that time  only proof of payment of Federal taxes  not state and local  is required for the years the alien worked on a Z visa  not the years the alien has already worked illegally in the United States  Though Senator McCains S A  1190  adopted by voice vote  claimed to require undocumented immigrants receiving legal status to pay owed back taxes  the amendment actually only required proof of payment of taxes for any year during the period of employment required by subparagraph  D  i   Since the bill does not contain a subparagraph  D  i   nor require any past years of employment as a prerequisite for amnesty  the amendment essentially only requires proof of payment of taxes for future work in the U S   not payment of back taxes   See p  307  and p  293 as altered by S A  1190  amendment p  2  19 20     Loophole 19  Social Security Credits Allowed For Some Illegal Work Histories    Aliens who came to the U S  on legal visas  but overstayed their visas and have been working in the U S  for years  as well as illegal aliens who apply for Z visa status but do not qualify  will be able to collect social security credits for the years they worked illegally  Under the bill  if an alien was ever issued a social security account number  all work authorized aliens who originally came on legal visas receive these  the alien will receive Social Security credits for any quarters of coverage the alien worked after receiving their social security account number  Because the bill requires social security account numbers to be issued promptly to illegal aliens as soon as they are granted any probationary benefits based upon application  for Z status   these benefits are granted 24 hours after the application is filed   an illegal alien who is denied Z visa status but continues to work illegally in the U S  will accumulate Social Security credits   See pp  316 8  16  and pp  315  32 39    Loophole 20  Criminal Fines Not Proportional To Conduct    The criminal fines an illegal alien is required to pay to receive amnesty are less than the bills criminal fines for paperwork violations committed by U S  citizens  and can be paid by installment  Under the bill  an illegal alien must pay a  1 000 criminal fine to apply for a Z visa  and a  4 000 fine to apply for a green card  Eighty percent of those fines can be paid on an installment plan  Under the bills confidentiality provisions  someone who improperly handles or uses information on an aliens amnesty application can be fined  10 000  Administration officials suggest that the bills criminal fines are proportionate to the criminal conduct  Why  then  is the fine for illegally entering  using false documents to work  and live one tenth the fine for a paperwork violation committed by a government official   See p  287  34  p  317  9  p  315 6 8   remarks made by Secretary Gutierrez on Your World with Neil Cavuto  4 00 May 31  2007                            2004 United States Senator Jeff
