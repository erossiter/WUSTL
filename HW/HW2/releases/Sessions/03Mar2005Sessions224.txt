                                                                                Thursday  March 3  2005      WASHINGTON   Sens  Jeff Sessions  R AL  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation designed to help states prevent prescription drug abuse                   Sessions and Durbin discussed their legislation at a news conference with Reps  Edward Whitfield  R KY  and Frank Pallone  D NJ   who are sponsoring a similar bill in the House of Representatives  The House last year passed the Whitfield Pallone bill  Sessions and Durbin introduced a prescription drug monitoring bill last year in the Senate  but it was not acted upon                The Sessions Durbin legislation  entitled the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act  would create a federal grant program to help establish or improve state run prescription drug monitoring programs                    Over the past 10 years  the abuse and diversion of prescription drugs has grown from a regional crisis to a national epidemic     said Sessions  who as a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  HELP  chaired a hearing on the subject last  year    We need to help states mount an effective response to this problem  while ensuring that physicians have the information they need to provide their patients safe  timely and effective treatment for pain and other medical conditions                        The illegal trafficking in prescription medications constitutes a particularly troublesome aspect of the substance abuse problem in America     said Durbin    And while this illegal drug trade costs us billions of dollars each year  there is an ever higher price    one that is measured in pain and sorrow    that is being paid by the families of those who become addicted                   Sessions and Durbin said that while press coverage has frequently focused on the abuse and diversion of OxyContin and other narcotic pain relievers  the problem extends to several classes of commonly prescribed drugs  including tranquilizers and stimulants  It  s estimated that more than 6 million Americans are current abusers of prescription drugs that fall within these three classes                   Nineteen states  including Illinois  currently have operating prescription drug monitoring programs  According to the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws  an additional 24 states are actively pursuing program establishment  Alabama passed legislation last year to establish a program which is expected to be operating by next year                    A 2002 report from the General Accounting Office  GAO  suggests that these individual state programs have been quite successful  but the report also clearly describes the limitations of the current approach   For example  while patients can and do cross state lines regularly to seek appropriate medical treatments calling for prescription drugs  others travel to neighboring states for the purpose of gaining inappropriate access to these medications  The scope of the problem is unknown  because not all states have programs in place  and existing programs are not yet equipped to efficiently and effectively share information across state lines                   Sessions and Durbin said the ultimate aim of their legislation is to make it possible to share the information across all state lines while maintaining the privacy of individual patients   medical records  Their bill would authorize  95 million through 2011 for state drug monitoring programs                    Sen  Edward Kennedy  D MA   the ranking member of the HELP Committee  and Sen  Christopher Dodd  D CT   also a HELP member  are co sponsors of the Sessions Durbin bill                    The national problem of prescription drug abuse worsens every year     said Kennedy    Physicians want to treat pain without contributing to addiction   Law enforcement officials want to stop the flow of prescription drugs from pharmacies to the streets   A national prescription drug monitoring program will provide a valuable resource to achieve these goals                          Access to pain relief improves the quality of life for millions of Americans  many suffering from serious and debilitating illness   But when abuse of these drugs occur  it  s a prescription for disaster     said Dodd     This common sense measure will help ensure that we don  t turn a blind eye to drug abuse while still ensuring that patients have access to important medicines that make a difference in their lives                               2004 United States Senator Jeff Sessions  Alabama                     All rights reserved
