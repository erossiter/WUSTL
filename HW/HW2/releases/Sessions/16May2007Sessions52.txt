                                                                               Sens  Sessions  Pryor  Cornyn and Salazar Introduce Legislation to Promote Fairness in U S  Sentencing Guidelines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wednesday  May 16  2007          WASHINGTON   The disparity in federal sentencing guidelines for crack and powder cocaine offenses would be reduced from 100 to 1 to 20 to 1 under legislation introduced in the Senate this week by U S  Sens  Jeff Sessions  R AL   Mark Pryor  D AR   John Cornyn  R TX  and Ken Salazar  D CO                     The legislation comes after the U S  Sentencing Commission last month submitted to Congress recommended guideline changes to federal crack cocaine penalties   The Commission recommended that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines be changed to allow for a lesser sentence for offenses involving crack cocaine          The bill  the Drug Sentencing Reform Act of 2007  would reduce the disparity for triggering the mandatory minimum sentences for crack and powder cocaine from 100 to 1 to 20 to 1 by reducing the penalty for crack cocaine and increasing the penalty for powder cocaine   The underlying goal of the bill is fairness   treating similar drugs more equally when it comes to sentencing                    The measure also would shift some of the emphasis in sentencing from drug quantity to the type of criminal conduct by increasing penalties for the worst drug offenders who use violence and employ children as couriers   It would decrease penalties on those who play only a minimal role in a drug trafficking offense  such as a girlfriend or child of a drug dealer who receives little or no compensation                     In 1984  Congress abolished the parole system and established the Sentencing Guidelines to provide more uniform and certain sentencing  In 1986  lawmakers set statutory mandatory minimum sentences for various illegal drugs  including a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking 500 grams of powder cocaine or 5 grams of crack and a 10 year mandatory minimum for trafficking 5 000 grams of powder or 50 grams of crack                    The 100 to 1 ratio of crack to powder was enacted largely to prevent the spread of crack cocaine across America  especially into minority neighborhoods   Despite that goal  crack cocaine has spread across the country and into minority neighborhoods                      A recent U S  Sentencing Commission report said that 83 percent of offenders sentenced for crack violations were African Americans  And a Bureau of Prisons study revealed that weapons use and violence are more accurate indicators of recidivism than drug use                    Sessions  Pryor  Cornyn and Salazar introduced similar legislation last year  All four senators are former state attorney generals                    Sessions said   This bill would bring balanced improvements to the current sentencing system to ensure a more just outcome   The 100 to 1 disparity in sentencing between crack cocaine and powder cocaine is not justifiable  My experience with the guidelines as U S  Attorney has convinced me that these changes will make the criminal justice system more effective and fair                               Pryor said   Cocaine poses a significant threat because it is readily available  highly addictive and directly associated with violent crime in both rural and urban communities  We need to send a strong message to those who buy and sell this drug  and that includes fixing the disparities that exist in our sentencing guidelines and keeping the most dangerous offenders off the streets                       Cornyn said   This bill will make sure our law enforcement resources are directed where they re needed most  It updates the law  making it fairer  by reforming the sentencing disparity that has developed over the years  We have made great strides in the war on drugs in recent years  but Congress must remain vigilant in addressing current drug problems  such as the stark increase in use of powder cocaine                     Salazar said   As a former Attorney General I understand the need to ensure that the punishment for selling drugs  and in this case crack and cocaine  is severe but just   said Senator Salazar    The Drug Sentencing Reform Act takes vital steps to reduce the disparity between crack and cocaine offense and in the end helps ensure the punishment fits the crime                                   2004 United States Senator Jeff
