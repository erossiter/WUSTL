                                                                                   Tuesday  December 26  2006      A Bipartisan Fix for Retirees      By Jeff Sessions  Tuesday  December 26  2006  A25      In the aftermath of their November election victory  Democratic leaders have pledged to work on a bipartisan basis to solve the problems facing our nation  In that spirit  I suggest that Democrats and Republicans can successfully work together to create personal savings accounts for all Americans outside the Social Security system  an idea that politicians from both political parties have supported for years and that The Post s editorial page recently endorsed   Up From the Depths   editorial  Nov  27        For the first time since the Great Depression  our country s savings rate has fallen into negative territory  with more than half of all American workers having less than  25 000 in savings excluding their primary residence  More troubling  almost half of the 152 7 million Americans who worked in 2004 worked for an employer that did not sponsor any retirement plan  and an additional 17 3 million did not participate in the plans their employers did have  Furthermore  the average American worker has held nine jobs by age 35  meaning that he often leaves his job before his retirement benefits become vested and that he will probably cash out whatever limited employer sponsored retirement savings he has when he changes jobs       The solution for this problem is to create a national system of personal savings accounts modeled on the successful Thrift Savings Plan  TSP  for federal employees  Federal employees pay Social Security taxes and receive the same Social Security benefits as everyone else  But the TSP program allows them to invest a portion of each paycheck    along with a government match for part of these contributions    in one of six investment accounts  or some combination of these accounts   including a government securities fund and a common stock fund  Over the past two decades  this system has been an unqualified success  as federal employees have received large returns on the money they invested       Under legislation I will be introducing in the next Congress  an individual personal retirement account    called a PLUS Account  for Portable  Lifelong Universal Savings Accounts     would be established for every American at birth and would be endowed with a  1 000 contribution from the federal government  This money could be placed in a limited number of investment funds similar to those offered by the TSP program  with the parents of each newborn choosing their preferred funds  Parents and grandparents also would be allowed to contribute up to  5 000 annually to these accounts  Without any additional contributions  and given a reasonable rate of return  the initial  1 000 endowment would be worth  50 000 to  100 000 when each individual reached age 65       But the real impact of PLUS accounts would be that  beginning in 2009  1 percent of every worker s paycheck would be automatically deposited into his own account for the first  100 000 earned annually  with his employer required to match this 1 percent contribution  Worker contributions would be made pretax while employer contributions would be tax deductible  Both workers and their employers would have the option of contributing more       Funds contributed to PLUS accounts would be the legal property of each account holder  but they could not be touched until age 65  Any funds remaining when an individual died could be passed on to a spouse  children  grandchildren or anyone of the holder s choosing  including a favorite charity   Account assets would be protected from creditors and would not be considered in determining eligibility for any federally funded benefits or in calculating estate tax liability  Finally  my plan would simply serve as a supplement to the Social Security system  not altering the program in any way       If we begin PLUS accounts at birth and require a portion of every paycheck to be invested  the average American citizen could retire with a rather sizable nest egg  For instance  given a 6 59 percent rate of return  the same rate as the TSP s most conservative fund since 1987   someone who makes  46 000 a year    the median household income in 2005    and contributes 1 percent of each paycheck would retire with almost  300 000  If that same individual were to contribute 3 percent over the course of his working life  he could expect to retire with over a half million dollars  even if his employer never contributed more than 1 percent        The continued success of the U S  economy depends on increasing savings for every citizen to provide the investment capital we need to ensure long term economic growth  More important  without increased savings  most Americans will not have sufficient money upon retirement to live the comfortable life they deserve after 40 plus years of work  As all honest policymakers in Washington are aware  Social Security alone cannot sustain the lifestyle retirees want and can have  especially as 78 million baby boomers begin to retire       Our nation s saving rate is a big problem  It requires a big solution  We cannot tinker with the federal tax code and expect personal savings to increase dramatically  By harnessing the power of compound interest through individual savings accounts and small paycheck deductions  we can ensure that almost every American will retire a half millionaire       The writer is a Republican senator from Alabama and a
