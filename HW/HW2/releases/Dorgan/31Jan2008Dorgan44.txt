NORTHWEST AGREES TO STUDY MINOT AIRFARES
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan announced today that Northwest Airlines has agreed to do a comprehensive review of the cost of flying in and out of Minot. 
   During a meeting in Dorgan's Capitol Hill office, Dorgan and Minot city leaders met with representatives of Northwest Airlines, who agreed to gather the appropriate information and study the fares they charge passengers flying to and from to Minot. Dorgan also said that Northwest agreed to send a representative to Minot to meet with local travel agents to hear their analysis of Minot airfares compared to other regional airfares. 
   Dorgan, city leaders and Northwest representatives agreed to review the conclusions in a conference call in two weeks. 
   "I will stay involved with this issue so we can find a solution that is workable for the people of the Minot region," Dorgan said. "Northwest officials have told me they will make adjustments to Minot fares if their review confirms the data that was given to them by Minot officials."
   Information sent to Dorgan by Minot city officials described higher fares for Minot travelers compared to fares in other cities. The parties discussed that information today and the Northwest officials agreed to a comprehensive review of the fares for Minot. 
   "We appreciate the opportunity to meet with Northwest officials and are grateful for Senator Dorgan's help in finding a resolution," Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman said. "I think the Northwest officials were listening and hopefully we can find an outcome that works for everyone."
