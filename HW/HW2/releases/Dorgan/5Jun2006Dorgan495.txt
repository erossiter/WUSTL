SEN. DORGAN: AIR FORCE REMAINS COMMITTED TO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES MISSION AT GRAND FORKS AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday that he has been assured by Air Force officials that the Grand Forks Air Force Base will be home to a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and play a key role in ensuring national security for decades to come. 
   Despite conjecture that Grand Forks Air Force Base will be forced to compete with other military bases for its UAV fleet, Dorgan said the Air Force remains committed to a UAV mission at Grand Forks. The briefing his office received last month from Air Force officials, which laid out a number of details about the transition from the base's tanker mission to a UAV mission, is a firm sign that the Grand Forks base's new mission is on track, Dorgan said.
   "The Air Force has repeatedly assured me that it is committed to bringing a fleet of UAVs to Grand Forks Air Force Base - that includes Predators and Global Hawks," Dorgan said. "I have worked closely with the Air Force to ensure we have a smooth transition from a tanker mission to a UAV mission, and they have told me they are impressed with the base's infrastructure and personnel and the support of the community. The employees at Grand Forks Air Force Base and residents of Grand Forks can feel confident that their military installation will host missions that are of vital importance to our national security for decades to come."
