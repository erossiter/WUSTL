SEN. DORGAN COSPONSORS BILL TO MOVE UP IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN LABELING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), joined with his colleagues, Sens.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Conrad Burns (R-MT) and Craig Thomas (R-WY), on Wednesday to introduce legislation that would speed up implementation of country-of-origin labeling (COOL) for fresh fruits and vegetables, peanuts, and meat products. 
   "Americans can already look at a label and see where their shirts, their shoes, or their cell phones were made," Dorgan said. "They ought to be able to do the same with the food on their dinner plate." 
   COOL was originally scheduled to begin in September 2004, but the Bush Administration dragged its feet in implementing the program. Opponents then succeeded in delaying the law for two years. The legislation introduced by Dorgan, Johnson, Enzi and Thomas would move forward the date of implementation for COOL by nine months, to January 30, 2006. 
   Opponents of COOL in the House of Representatives have inserted an additional delay of COOL for meat products until Sept. 30, 2007 in this year's Agriculture Appropriations Bill. Dorgan said he also plans to offer an amendment to the Senate's version of that bill to prevent such a further delay. 
   "The opponents of COOL, led by the big meat packers, have succeeded for too long in delaying a program that is supported by America's farmers, ranchers, and consumers," Dorgan said. "COOL is the law of the land, and I intend to keep fighting for this program."
