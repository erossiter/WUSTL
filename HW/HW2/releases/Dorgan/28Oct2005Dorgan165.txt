DELEGATION ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AMERICORPS TO SERVE NORTH DAKOTA COMMUNTIIES
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy announced Friday the creation of an Americorps Vista program in North Dakota that will result in 26 volunteers working on economic development and other issues on three Indian reservations across the state.  
   The federal Corporation for National and Community Service will fund 26 positions in North Dakota, directing more than $122,000 to the state for the program. The University of North Dakota (UND) will manage the state's program, which will serve locations at the Trenton Indian Service Area southwest of Williston, the Three Affiliated Tribes in New Town and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in Belcourt. 
   The Americorps Vista members will help the communities improve education and economic development activities, and work to bridge the digital divide in Internet access and use. In exchange for one year of service, Americorps members receive $4,725 to pay for college, graduate school or to pay back certain student loans. 
   "The Americorps program has a dual benefit, helping both communities served and rewarding the people who enter this program with the opportunity to improve the lives of so many," the delegation said in a joint statement. "These Americorps members will be helping our tribal communities with some very difficult issues. For their service, they will earn money to pay for their own education, as well as the satisfaction that comes from serving their country on the ground level." 
   The goal of the Americorps Vista program is to bring communities and individuals out of poverty. More than 6,000 Americorps members across the country are working with non-profit organizations to expand the programs on illiteracy, health services, business development, housing options and more. 
   The program is managed by the federal Corporation for National and Community Service with funds appropriated by Congress.
