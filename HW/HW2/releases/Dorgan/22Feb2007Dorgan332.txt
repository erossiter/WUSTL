SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES SUCCESS WITH DHS PROPOSAL TO WAIVE PASSPORT REQUIREMENT FOR CHILDREN TRAVELING TO CANADA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) welcomes the Department of Homeland Security's announcement Thursday of a new proposal that would waive the passport requirement for children under 16 when traveling from the United States to Canada. Dorgan has led the push to exempt children from having to present a passport when traveling to Canada.  
   "This is a victory especially for families who live near the Canadian border," said Dorgan. "Requiring a passport for children would be a ridiculous expense for families and place an undue burden on travel. We have to provide for security at our borders - that is important - but we don't want to shutdown cross-border travel with rules and regulation that cost families a great deal of extra money. DHS is making a step in the right direction." 
   Dorgan has pushed for alternatives to the new passport requirement. Last year, he introduced a bipartisan bill, the Common Sense Cross-Border Travel and Security Act of 2006, which called for exempting children under 18 from the passport requirement. Dorgan has also worked on a proposal for a lower-cost passport card. 
   Currently passports are required for travel to Canada by air. As early as January 1, 2008, U.S. citizens traveling to Canada, will be required to present a passport when traveling by land or sea. The new plan would exempt children under 16 traveling by land or sea, and instead allow them to present a notarized copy of their birth certificate and have parental consent. In addition, children between the ages of 16 through 18, traveling with a school, religious, athletic or cultural groups under adult supervision, would be able to use a certified copy of their birth certificate. The new proposal will be open to public comment.
