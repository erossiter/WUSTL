SEN. MCCAIN'S ANNOUNCEMENT SUPPORTS SEN. DORGAN'S EFFORTS TO STOP FILLING STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE
  Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is renewing his efforts to "put downward pressure on gas prices by suspending putting oil underground into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)." 
   Today, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) broke with the Bush Administration by supporting efforts to stop filling SPR, given the high price of oil. All 51 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus, including Senators Clinton and Obama, called on President Bush to suspend filling the SPR in a letter dated March 11, 2008. Dorgan believes the support of all three Presidential candidates is good news for those who are suffering from high gas prices, and that McCain's backing could "encourage additional bipartisan support for my legislation."
   "I welcome the support of John McCain for my legislation to stop putting oil underground and start putting it into our supply pipeline. His support, along with the support of Senator Clinton and Senator Obama, means that all three Presidential candidates now oppose the Bush Administration program of putting nearly 70,000 barrels of oil underground every day," said Dorgan.
   "The current policy of putting oil underground puts upward pressure on gas prices and is not in the nation's interest," said Dorgan. "With oil prices at record highs, and the SPR nearly full, it makes no sense for the Department of Energy to put nearly 70 thousand barrels of oil underground every single day."
