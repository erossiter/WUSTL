SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES 'COMMONSENSE' SECURITY LEGISLATION FOR U.S.-CANADA BORDER TRAVEL
  In what he called a "commonsense approach to cross-border traffic," Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced legislation he said will significantly lower the cost of the State Department's alternative passport card system in a way that will allow Americans to continue routine travel to Canada. 
   The State Department announced last year it would begin requiring Americans to have passports-costing just under $100 each-in order to travel to Canada. The agency later proposed an alternative that would force Americans to pay as much as $50 per person for a passport-like identification card allowing them to cross the border.
   Dorgan said $50 per person is still an excessive amount of money when considering that a family of four would be forced to come up with $200 to visit relatives in Winnipeg.
   Dorgan said the three-pronged bill, the Common Sense Cross-Border Travel and Security Act of 2006, 1) exempts children under 18 from the passport card requirement; 2) creates a system of free day-passes for travel to Canada; and 3) sets a ceiling of $20 for the cost of a new passport identification card.
   "My legislation is a commonsense approach to routine, cross-border travel between the U.S. and Canada," Dorgan said. "It's critical to protect this country from terrorists, but that doesn't mean placing unfair financial burdens on American families who wish to travel back and forth to Canada to visit Grandma and Grandpa. People routinely cross the U.S.-Canada border for a whole range of business and personal reasons. I believe my bill is a practical response that increases our security in a way that makes sense."
   Joining Dorgan as co-sponsors of the legislation are Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Conrad Burns (R-MT), Max Baucus (D-MT), Jim Jeffords (I-VT), and Patty Murray (D-WA).
