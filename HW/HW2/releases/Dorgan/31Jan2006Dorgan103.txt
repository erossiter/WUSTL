SEN. DORGAN IS SENATE DESIGNEE TO WATCH STATE OF THE UNION FROM UNDISCLOSED LOCATION
  For the first time in many years, Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) will not be at the State of the Union address tonight. He has been designated to watch the speech from an undisclosed location. 
   There is a tradition that during the President's annual State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, one member of the President's cabinet, one Senator and one member of the House of Representatives are designated to be outside of the House chamber. 
   The tradition is based on national security reasons. It ensures that in the event of a catastrophic event, such as a terrorist attack or natural disaster, when all of the officials of our government are gathered in one room there would be a cabinet officer, a member of the House and a member of the Senate who remain out of harm's way. 
   Senator Dorgan is the designated Senator this evening, and said he will be watching the President's State of the Union address from another location.
