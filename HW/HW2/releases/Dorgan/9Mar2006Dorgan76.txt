SEN. DORGAN: NEW TRADE DEFICIT NUMBERS SHOW NATION'S TRADE POLICIES ARE 'BRAIN DEAD'
  "Brain Dead." That's how Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) described our trade policies and the politicians who support them, as he reacted to today's announcement of a record $68.5 billion deficit for January 2006 by the Commerce Department. "These runaway trade deficits are being financed by the selling away of America, piece by piece - and still the President and the Congress sink their heads deeper in the sands of denial. It is unbelievable," Dorgan added. 
   "The Administration's enthusiasm for turning over six of our major U.S. ports to a company owned by the United Arab Emirates is obviously due in part to these massive trade deficits. The only way for the United States to keep financing $2 billion a day in trade deficits is to sell off U.S. assets, and that now apparently includes our security assets," Dorgan said. Dorgan has introduced legislation to block the Dubai ports deal.
   Dorgan noted that the trade deficit with China had also reached an all-time monthly record of $17.9 billion in January 2006. "China has been trading unfairly since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2002, and the Administration has done nothing about it," Dorgan said.
   Dorgan and Senator Lindsdey Graham (R-SC) have introduced legislation calling for the U.S. to revoke China's permanent normal trade relations status, instead making normal relations with that country subject to yearly approval by Congress, depending on whether China is trading fairly.
