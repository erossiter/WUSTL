SEN. DORGAN SAYS FUNDING BILL PROVIDES MORE MONEY TO SUPPORT TROOPS THAN PRESIDENT REQUESTED
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday the supplemental appropriations bill now on its way to the White House fully funds U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and includes $4 billion more for the Defense Department than the President requested. 
   Dorgan said he does not support a funding cut-off and does not support a hard deadline that could jeopardize funding for troops in the field. "This legislation contains neither," he said.
   Dorgan said the legislation provides more than $100 billion for the Defense Department, including more money than the President requested for protecting U.S. soldiers from roadside bombs, meeting the health needs of soldiers and treating veterans when they return home.
   "This legislation also includes 'goals' for a new strategy in Iraq, which is urgently needed," Dorgan said. "It makes clear to the Iraqi government that they need to set some timelines and goals for the Iraqi government to begin providing for their own security.
   "The Iraqi government has repeatedly committed to taking action that would reconcile the warring factions in their country and train Iraqis to provide security. They have time and time again failed to take those actions. Without some pressure, there is little reason to believe they will take the necessary action. That's what this legislation does: it pushes the Iraqi government to meet benchmarks. Only then will we begin to see an end to the war and be able to bring our troops home."
