SEN. DORGAN TELLS TRADE AMBASSADOR DEBATE ON TRADE POLICY SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED
  Responding to U.S. Trade Ambassador Robert Zoellick's recent statement that the new Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) should be brought to a vote after the elections this year, Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said he believes the American people deserve to have a debate on the trade agreement in the U.S. Senate before the election. 
   Dorgan has written a letter to Zoellick urging him to send CAFTA to the Senate for debate now. 
   An opponent of the CAFTA agreement, Dorgan says the trade deal is unfair to American producers and other workers. There's a good chance of defeating it in the U.S. Senate, he said. 
   The Senator pointed to last month's $46 billion trade deficit-the largest in history - as evidence that current trade policies aren't working. "All of our recent trade agreements have failed in representing the interests of American producers and other American workers," Dorgan said. 
   "I support expanded trade, but it must be fair trade," Dorgan said. "Most of these trade agreements set us up for unfair competition." 
   Among other things, Dorgan said, CAFTA "will begin a process that will unravel the sugar program and set a precedent for devastating the sugar beet growers, who are vibrant contributors to the economy in North Dakota and Minnesota."
