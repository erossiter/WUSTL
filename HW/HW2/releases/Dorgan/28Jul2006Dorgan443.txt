SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS FDIC MORATORIUM, CALLS FOR PERMANENT END TO DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took "a step in the right direction" today by placing a 6-month moratorium on applications for deposit insurance from commercial giants such as Wal-Mart. He called on the FDIC to act further by closing the loophole in federal law that allows companies like Wal-Mart to own "industrial loan companies" that are exempt from important federal regulation and oversight. 
   Dorgan pressed the FDIC in April to deny Wal-Mart's application for deposit insurance, which would allow the company to own a federally insured "industrial loan company" - an institution that operates like a bank but is exempt from federal oversight through a loophole in banking regulations. He also called for a permanent end to the so-called "ILC loophole."
   Allowing companies such as the retail giant Wal-Mart to own and operate a federally-insured bank "violates one of the most important tenets in federal banking law: banks and commercial businesses should be kept separate," Dorgan said. If Wal-Mart is granted FDIC insurance protection one of the nation's largest and most powerful corporations would be permitted to enter the banking business through an unintended back door, he said.
