SEN. DORGAN SAYS BUSH PLAN TO SHIELD DRUG MAKERS FROM LIABILITY 'WILL NOT STAND'
  The President's plan to shield big drug manufacturers from the consequences of their own negligence is a mistake, Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday. 
   "In its zeal to support the big drug companies, the Bush Administration is seriously overreaching with this proposal. It will not stand," Dorgan said. 
   On Wednesday, the President began a new push to enact a long-standing Republican goal to limit medical malpractice liability against health care providers, including drug companies. An important element of the President's "malpractice reform" plan would bar punitive damages against prescription drug manufacturers whose products harm people if those products have FDA approval. 
   Dorgan said the Administration's proposal fits a "growing and disturbing" pattern. "This Administration has blocked access to lower priced prescription drugs from other countries. It has outlawed any attempt to negotiate lower prices for drugs purchased by the federal government through Medicare. Now, the president wants to take away every American's right to sue for damages if the drug companies harm them through negligent testing, manufacturing or marketing of their overpriced prescription medicines." 
   "I predict that this plan will fail," Dorgan said.
