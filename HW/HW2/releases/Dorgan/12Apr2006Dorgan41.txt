SEN. DORGAN ASKS FDIC TO REJECT WAL-MART APPLICATION THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO OFFER BANKING SERVICES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is urging the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to deny Wal-Mart's application for federal deposit insurance that would allow it to operate as a bank. 
   Wal-Mart is the world's largest retailer, with sales topping $244.5 billion in 2003. It is America's largest employer, with over one million employees in the United States. Each week 100 million Americans - about one third of the nation's population - enter U.S. Wal-Mart stores.
   Allowing the retail giant to own and operate a federally-insured bank "violates one of the most important tenets in federal banking law: banks and commercial businesses should be kept separate," Dorgan wrote in a letter to the Acting Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
   If Wal-Mart is granted FDIC insurance protection one of the nation's largest and most powerful corporations would be permitted to enter the banking business through an unintended back door, Dorgan wrote. "A downturn, let alone a failure, in Wal-Mart's colossal retail business could create a major disruption in the nation's banking system," Dorgan said.
   "Moreover, Wal-Mart's market power is almost incapable of challenge," Dorgan added. "A Wal-Mart bank could potentially make decisions to grant or withhold credit that could have an adverse impact on many local economies, especially in the rural areas of our nation."
   "Keeping banking and the workings of the nation's payment and credit system separate from the nation's industrial and retail sectors helps to ensure the stability and integrity of the banking system and reduces the chance of a major banking failure and taxpayer bailout," Dorgan wrote.
