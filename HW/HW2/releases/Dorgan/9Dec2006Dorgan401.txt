SEN. DORGAN SAYS SENATE APPROVES BILL THAT WILL BOLSTER RURAL HEALTH CARE, NORTH DAKOTA ENERGY INDUSTRY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said legislation approved by the Senate late Friday includes provisions that will help improve health care in rural areas and boost North Dakota diverse energy industry.  
   Dorgan, who is a leader in the push in Congress to improve rural health care, said the bill includes a number of provisions that will help ensure rural hospitals are fairly compensated for lab tests and other services provided under Medicare. He said that will help ensure health care facilities can afford to offer more services so residents don't have to drive hours for a check-up. 
   The bill also includes a number of energy-related tax incentives, including an additional one-year extension of a production tax credit for wind and other renewable energy facilities. The incentive has been key to the development of North Dakota's vast wind resources. The credit has helped attract investment in wind energy and good-paying jobs through companies such as LM Glasfiber in Grand Forks and DMI Industries in West Fargo. 
   "The passage of this bill will help improve the quality of life in North Dakota both by expanding access to rural health care and growing our energy industry," Dorgan said. "By giving our rural clinics and hospitals a fair reimbursement for their work under Medicare, we'll ensure residents of rural areas have access to those services when they need them. The provisions related to energy in this legislation will help our state realize its potential to be a national leader in the production of energy from a number of sources. That's good news for North Dakota and for our country."
