SEN. DORGAN CALLS FOR OPEN, COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS AS FCC CONSIDERS NEW RULES ON MEDIA OWNERSHIP
  Following the Senate Commerce Committee's vote Thursday to approve Robert McDowell as the fifth commissioner to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called on FCC Chairman Kevin Martin to ensure the Commission's new rulemaking process on media ownership is open and transparent and involves the public at every step. 
   Dorgan, in a bipartisan letter to Martin that was also signed by five other senators, said that the FCC's new rules on media ownership are complex and interconnected and will have a profound affect on what the public watches, hears and reads. For this reason, the FCC must make sure its deliberations on the issue are open, transparent and comprehensive, Dorgan said.
   "The rules governing media ownership have a significant impact on the diversity of voices and ownership in our communities," Dorgan said. "Unfortunately, the FCC does not have a good record when it comes to keeping its deliberations open to the public. We don't want to repeat the mistakes the Commission made in the past, when it shut the public out of the decision-making process. The American people have a big stake in the outcome of this debate and must be included."
   Dorgan was joined on the letter by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS), John Kerry (D-MA), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME).
