SEN. DORGAN SUPPORTS SEN. McCAIN'S CALL FOR LEGISLATION IF BASEBALL DOES NOT ACT ON STEROIDS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan, who chaired the first Commerce Subcommittee hearing on the use of steroids in baseball in 2002, said Tuesday that the baseball players union has no choice: they have to take aggressive steps to address a growing scandal of steroid use. 
   Support from Dorgan, a Democrat, for McCain's call - McCain is a Republican - indicates there is high-level, bi-partisan support within Congress for taking action if baseball does not. 
   Dorgan said that the players union, at both his hearing in 2002, and the hearing chaired by Senator McCain in 2004, largely "stonewalled" by saying that steroid use and testing is a privacy issue for baseball players.
   "That's an absurd argument," Dorgan said Tuesday. "Children emulate those sports stars. The use of steroids, growth hormones and banned substances by professional athletes means young kids emulate that behavior. These drugs are dangerous. Baseball should act immediately, both to protect the players and also to protect the kids who will emulate what they see their sports heroes doing." 
   "Senator McCain is right. If the players union continues to ignore this growing scandal, Congress should and will take action. That's not the preferred outcome. Baseball should clean up its own act," Dorgan said.
