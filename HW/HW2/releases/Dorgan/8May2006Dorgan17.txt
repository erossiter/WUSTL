SEN. DORGAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON GROUNDBREAKING FOR ETHANOL PLANT IN JAMESTOWN
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday the groundbreaking of a new ethanol plant in Jamestown, North Dakota, is a positive sign of North Dakota's growing ethanol industry that will benefit farmers and help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Energy Committee, authored a provision in the federal energy bill approved by Congress last year requiring refiners to produce and use at least 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol in their gasoline blends annually by 2012.

   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   May 8, 2006
   "The groundbreaking of a new ethanol plant in Jamestown, North Dakota, today is an exciting development for our state and its ethanol industry.
   "As we work to reduce our country's dependence on foreign sources of energy, North Dakota will play a huge role. We have an abundant and diverse set of energy resources - in fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, and in renewables such as wind, biodiesel and ethanol.
   "I think one of the most promising resources we have is ethanol. That's why I included in the federal energy bill a provision that will boost the amount of ethanol our drivers use, and I'm excited that we are already seeing the results of that legislation."
