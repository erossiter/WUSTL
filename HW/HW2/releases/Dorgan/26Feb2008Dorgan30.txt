SEN. DORGAN QUESTIONS DOE ON DRIVE TO FILL STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE
  The Department of Energy faced sharp questions at a committee hearing in Washington Tuesday from Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), who wants them to stop taking oil off the market and putting it underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   "At $100 a barrel it makes no sense for the Administration to be putting 70,000 - 80,000 barrels of oil a day underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That puts upward pressure on both oil prices and gas prices," Dorgan said. "One of the expert witnesses, who previously testified before the Energy Committee, today estimated that taking oil off the market, especially light sweet crude; these actions have increased the price of oil by as much as $10 a barrel. 
   "I believe the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is important to our economy and to our energy security but when prices are this high, oil should be available to consumers rather than underground in a way that increases gas prices." 
   The Administration is attempting to "top off" the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is already nearly 97 percent full. 
   Dorgan is the lead sponsor of bi-partisan legislation currently in Congress that would require a pause in filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the rest of this year. 
   "People are having difficulty paying the increased costs of gas prices and I don't think the federal government should be making things worse by taking oil supplies off the market. We ought to be trying to make things better by investing more aggressively in homegrown sources of energy." 
   Dorgan questioned the Department of Energy officials during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee hearing on the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve fill and inventories management policies.
