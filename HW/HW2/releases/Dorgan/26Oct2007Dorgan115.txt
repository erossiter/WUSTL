SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES DICKINSON LIVESTOCK SPECIALIST TO TESTIFY BEFORE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Friday the International Trade Commission has invited Dr. Kris Ringwall, Director of the Dickinson Research Extension Center, to testify at a hearing November 15 examining the effect of animal health, sanitation and food safety measures on global beef trade. 
   The invitation for Dr. Ringwall to testify is a recognition of the expertise he has gained as one of the lead investigators in a joint project between North Dakota State University and Dickinson State University aimed at ensuring the safety of the nation's food supply using cutting-edge technology. Senator Dorgan has secured $6.6 million in federal funding to support the research project, and has included another $1.8 million in the pending Fiscal Year 2008 Agriculture Appropriations bill to continue the work.
   Dr. Ringwall's testimony at the Washington, D.C., hearing will focus on animal identification, animal traceback and biosecurity issues for beef cattle producers and consumers.
   "The security of livestock is a critical issue for the safety of our food supply and the health of the agricultural industry," Dorgan said. "The program Dr. Ringwall is leading at NDSU and Dickinson State is ground-breaking. I look forward to meeting with him when he comes to Capitol Hill and hearing his thoughts on how best to ensure the security of our beef industry."
