SENATE PASSES AMENDMENT ADDING FUNDS FOR B-52S, SENS. CONRAD, DORGAN ANNOUNCE
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) said Thursday the Senate took a positive step forward in waging a campaign to convince the Air Force not to retire 38 of its B-52 bombers with the passage of an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 budget that would provide funding to keep the planes part of the military fleet. 
   Conrad and Dorgan, who sponsored the amendment with Senators Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and David Vitter (R-LA), said the action does not ensure the Air Force will choose to keep all of the B-52s, but advises them that the will of Congress is to keep the fleet in tact.
   "Adding this amendment to the budget bill was the first major legislative step in our effort to save the B-52 bombers at Minot Air Force Base," Conrad and Dorgan said. "The B-52s are still a tremendous asset for our military because they are cost-effective to maintain, and the Air Force has indicated that the planes still have 20 to 30 years of operational life remaining."
   Specifically, the amendment adds $77 million in the Fiscal Year 2007 budget, and $1.1 billion over five years to the Pentagon's budget for the B-52s.
   "There's no question that the B-52 is the best bomb truck for the buck. If we're going to keep up our fighting effort overseas, we need to keep the B-52 in the air," Senator Conrad said. "We've got a bipartisan group of senators who agree that the B-52 is an important weapon in the arsenal of our nation."
   "This is just a start," Dorgan said. "I feel confident that Minot Air Force Base will have B-52s to fly in the future. I will continue to meet with the officials in the Air Force in charge of making these decisions, and continue to press the case that the B-52s have plenty of life left in them."
