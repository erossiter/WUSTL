SEN. DORGAN MEETS WITH NORTHWEST, DELTA EXECUTIVES ON PROPOSED AIRLINE MERGER
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met Tuesday with the CEOs of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines to discuss his concerns about the companies' proposed merger. Dorgan said he will continue to visit with Delta and Northwest executives in an effort to gain a full understanding of how the merger would affect service and pricing in North Dakota and other rural states. 
   "I'm concerned about the effect this would have on our rural communities, as well as the airline industry as a whole," Dorgan said. "Air passengers in smaller states continue to pay higher prices than travelers in larger cities. I want to know what the consequences of this merger would be for states like North Dakota."
   Dorgan and the two executives indicated they will continue their discussions in the weeks ahead.
