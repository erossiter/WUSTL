SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN LEGISLATION TO HELP BRING RELIABLE FUNDING TO UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE
  The U.S. Senate approved a provision Tuesday authored by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that will help bring a permanent, more stable supply of funding to United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck. 
   The Senate approved Dorgan's provision as part of the Higher Education Reauthorization bill. The provision provides for continued federal support for United Tribes Technical College by specifically authorizing the Department of Interior to fund the school. The provision will encourage the Administration to include funding for the school in its annual budget, which will provide more certainty for the school's budget, Dorgan said.
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has secured funding for the school six years in a row after the President eliminated it each time from his budget proposal for the Department of the Interior.
   "United Tribes Technical College has proven itself as a valuable education facility for our American Indian students," Dorgan said. "It has graduated thousands of students that have gone on to fulfilling careers and important leadership positions in our country. This school doesn't deserve to be cut out of the President's budget every year, and this amendment will help make sure it can depend on a reliable supply of federal funding to carry out its important educational mission."
