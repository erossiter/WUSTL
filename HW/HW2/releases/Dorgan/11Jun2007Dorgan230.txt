SEN. DORGAN, OTHER SENATORS TO MEET WITH U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SCHWAB, WILL URGE BENCHMARKS, ACCOUNTABILITY FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and a group of Senators will meet Tuesday with U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab to discuss the need for benchmarks and accountability in future trade agreements.  
   The meeting is scheduled for 10:30 AM and will be held in Senator Dorgan's Capitol Hill office. In addition to Dorgan and Schwab, the meeting will include Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Bob Casey (D-PA). 
   Specifically, the group will ask that future trade agreements contain specific, quantitative benchmarks for success, regarding: 
   * Net creation of U.S. jobs 
   * Net improvement of U.S. wages 
   * Significant increases in foreign market access 
   * Measurably increased enforcement of labor and environmental standards 
   The group is asking that benchmarks not only be included in the agreements, but if they are not met that the trade agreement could be terminated. 
   "We need to define what constitutes a successful trade agreement, and then to make sure the agreements we negotiate actually meet those benchmarks," Dorgan said. "Otherwise, nothing is going to change. We'll keep setting record trade deficits. We'll continue to produce a flurry of trade agreements, and we'll get the same old results - foreign markets that remain off limits to U.S. producers, downward pressure on U.S. wages, good paying American jobs shipped overseas, and no improvement whatever in the enforcement of labor or environmental standards from our trading partners."
