SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES SERIES OF RESEARCH CORRIDOR ACTION SUMMITS
  As part of his effort to develop a Red River Valley Research Corridor in North Dakota, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday a series of Action Summits that will take place throughout the year to strategize and make plans for advancing specific science and technology projects aimed at growing the Corridor. 
   The Summits will bring together university researchers, business leaders and economic developers to discuss potential Research Corridor sectors. The first Action Summit will take place in Grand Forks on Thursday, July 1, and will focus on biosciences. The second Summit, addressing radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, will be held in Fargo on Wednesday, August 11. Future Summits will be held in other parts of the state as well, Dorgan said.
   "Bringing experts from specific scientific fields together in one room is a great way to brainstorm, plan and move forward with strategies to help bring high-paying jobs in North Dakota," Dorgan said. "These Summits will help ensure that our efforts are focused, on target, and that we're pursuing strategies that build on our strengths."
   The basis for Dorgan's Red River Valley Research Corridor is that high-level research attracts businesses to the state-creating jobs and fueling economic growth. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, already has helped draw more than $100 million in high-tech research and training to North Dakota colleges and universities.
   The public is invited to attend the Action Summits. For more information, contact Research Corridor Coordinator Delore Zimmerman at 888-775-0192 or delore@theresearchcorridor.com.
