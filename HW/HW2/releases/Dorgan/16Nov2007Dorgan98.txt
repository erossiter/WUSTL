SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS EFFORT TO GIVE FOSTER CHILDREN PERMANENT FAMILIES
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan is joining many families in North Dakota and across the country in celebrating National Adoption Day and congratulating those families that will be welcoming a new member this Saturday, November 17. National Adoption Day is an annual event held the Saturday before Thanksgiving.  
   Tomorrow, judges, lawyers, foster care professionals and child advocates will donate their time to finalize the adoption of hundreds of children in ceremonies around the country that commemorate National Adoption Day. These ceremonies, including one in Fargo, will mark the first day as part of a secure, permanent family for the foster kids who are being adopted. The Fargo ceremony will be held at the Cass County Court House beginning at 9:00 a.m. 
   "There are some wonderful North Dakota children who will officially become part of a family on Saturday and I couldn't be happier for them and their new families," Dorgan said. "But we all have to remember that there are more children that are still looking for homes and National Adoption Day helps shine the spotlight on them and the need to help them find good families. I'm hoping that we can get more families thinking about adopting." 
   In addition to marking the adoptions, National Adoption Day aims to raise the awareness that there are still thousands of kids across the country that are waiting to find a good, permanent home and that adopting is beneficial to both the child and the families. There are currently 114,000 kids in foster care who are available to be adopted. 
   Senator Dorgan is a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption.
