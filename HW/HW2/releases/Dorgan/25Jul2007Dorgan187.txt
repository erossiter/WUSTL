SEN. DORGAN SAYS PARK SERVICE CONFIRMS IT HAS AUTHORITY TO USE QUALIFIED VOLUNTEERS TO THIN NORTH DAKOTA ELK HERD
  The Director of the National Park Service has sent a letter to U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that resolves the dispute over thinning of the elk herd at Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The letter confirms Dorgan was correct in his position that the Park Service has the authority to use qualified volunteer hunters to thin the elk herd. 
   In a letter sent to Dorgan late Tuesday, National Park Service Director Mary Bomar put to rest conflicting statements from within the agency about whether it has the authority to use volunteer hunters to thin the elk herd. She said Park Service officials will include the option as it develops its plan to cull the herd. Dorgan requested the clarification last week.
   "Director Bomar's response makes clear what we've known all along - the Park Service already has the authority to use qualified volunteers to thin the elk herd at Theodore Roosevelt National Park," Dorgan said. "I appreciate that she cleared this issue up so it can be added to the list of options to cull this herd. It makes no sense to me to spend millions of dollars on sharpshooters and helicopters when North Dakota hunters would be willing to take care of this problem free of charge."
   Park Service officials in North Dakota had suggested they could not use volunteers to thin the elk herd at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, despite a report by the Congressional Research Service - and the acknowledgement of Park Service officials in Colorado - that volunteers could be used. 
   A timeline of events sent by Bomar indicates that the Park Service agreed to consider the use of volunteers at Theodore Roosevelt National Park after Dorgan introduced a bill to clarify that hunters may be used and requested a clarification of the Park Service's position.
