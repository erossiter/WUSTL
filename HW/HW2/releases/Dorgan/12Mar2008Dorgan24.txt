   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   March 12, 2008
   "The negotiation of this new farm bill has been an extraordinarily frustrating process. Planting season is approaching fast, and family farmers in North Dakota and across the country are waiting for a new farm bill so they can make good business decisions.
   "It is critical that we find an agreement on a farm bill that will strengthen the safety net and re-establish a permanent disaster aid program so there's a helping hand for our producers when times are tough.
   "The President hasn't been willing to meet Congress halfway on this. He hasn't been much help so far, but I hope he'll feel some pressure to do what's right for rural America and find a compromise that will support our producers.
   "I'll keep working with Senator Conrad, Congressman Pomeroy and the rest of my colleagues to find a way to pass a farm bill that's good for North Dakota and good for our nation."
