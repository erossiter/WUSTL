DELEGATION ANNOUNCES $200,000 CLEANUP GRANT FOR HISTORIC DICKINSON ELKS BUILDING
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) announced Wednesday that the City of Dickinson will receive a $200,000 federal grant to eliminate hazardous substances from the historic Dickinson Elks Building. 
   The funding will be used to clean up asbestos, lead paint and black mold contamination and monitor community health. Redevelopment plans include office space and residential units in the building, which was once a hub of social activity in Dickinson. 
   "The restoration of the Dickinson Elks Building will provide jobs, encourage additional development and be a source of community pride," the delegation said in a joint statement. "It will help make this local treasure once again a key part of the life of downtown Dickinson, and this grant is an important step toward making that vision a reality." 
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded the Brownfields Cleanup grant with funds appropriated by Congress to restore "Brownfield" sites, which are properties whose use or development may be restricted by the presence or possibility of hazardous substances.
