DELEGATION ANNOUNCES PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SEO PRECISION, NORTHROP GRUMMAN
  U.S. Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy announced today that SEO Precision of Crosby, North Dakota, has formed a new, formal partnership with Northrop Grumman, a major government contractor that will open the door to new opportunities for high-technology growth in North Dakota. 
   The delegation has long worked to help connect North Dakota businesses with large federal contractors, an effort that has paid off again for the state's growing economy. The latest deal is a formal, Department of Defense-sponsored Mentor-Protégé agreement between SEO Precision and Northrop Grumman's Space Technology sector in Redondo Beach, Calif. 
   Northrop Grumman is a leader in the development of high-energy laser systems for the use of the U.S. military. That fits well with the specialty of SEO Precision, a leader in the design and manufacturing of fast-steering mirrors that are used in laser systems.
   "Together with our delegation and Northrop Grumman Space Technology, SEO is working very hard to strengthen our footprint in northwest North Dakota, building on the already rich resources that we have discovered here," said Esther Oehlke, co-founder and Chief Operations Officer of SEO Precision. "This partnership is a critical step forward in our path to long-term business success, and will continue to bring highly rewarding career opportunities and economic growth to rural North Dakota."
   "This new partnership between one of North Dakota's most promising start-up companies and one of our nation's largest contractors is a boost on two fronts - it will help produce better technology for our troops and, at the same time, support good-paying jobs in rural North Dakota," the delegation said in a joint statement. "We're proud we could help make this agreement a reality."
