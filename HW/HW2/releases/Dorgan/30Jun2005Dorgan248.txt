SENATE APPROVES INTERIOR BILL WITH MORE THAN $22 MILLION FOR NORTH DAKOTA PROJECTS, SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD ANNOUNCE
  The U.S. Senate approved an Interior Appropriations bill late Wednesday that allots more than $22 million for water, cultural and Indian health and education projects in North Dakota, Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) announced today. 
   Dorgan and Conrad were able to secure funding for a wide range of North Dakota projects, including education programs aimed at American Indians, efforts to preserve historical sites, and development of water resources.  
   Among the earmarks is $3.5 million for the United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) in Bismarck. Funding for the school was zeroed out in the President's budget proposal. A separate $54 million sum will be split among the nation's 25 tribal colleges, four of which are in North Dakota. Dorgan and Conrad secured another $2 million - double last year's funding level - to continue research aimed at improving the nation's air, water and soil quality at the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. 
   "I was glad to be a part of securing support for these projects," said Dorgan, who is the ranking member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. "Whether giving a helping hand to our tribal colleges, controlling agricultural pests, or protecting our state's rich history, this funding is an investment in some of North Dakota's most prized resources." 
   "These projects will improve the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the soil we farm in North Dakota, making life better for everyone," Conrad said. "In addition, funding will be provided for Native American education, helping the youth of an important part of North Dakota's population become the next generation of leaders." 
   Below is a list of North Dakota projects Senators Dorgan and Conrad added to the bill. 
   * United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) $3.5 million 
   The bill restores funding to UTTC that was zeroed out in President Bush's Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal. The funding will allow UTTC to continue its unique mission of educating Indian students from tribes from across the country. The college offers 20 two-year degree programs to its 500 students. UTTC also educates 100 pre-school and 175 elementary school children, and has an 80% job placement rate over the past decade.
