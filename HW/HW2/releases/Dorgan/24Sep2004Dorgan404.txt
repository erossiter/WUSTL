SEN. DORGAN SAYS NORTH DAKOTANS WILL BENEFIT FROM TAX CUT BILL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan says the $146 billion tax cut bill approved late Thursday by the Senate and House contains several items of importance to North Dakotans, particularly families and wind energy producers.  
   "These are important provisions for North Dakotans, especially North Dakota families with kids, and for the growing wind energy industry in our state," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan, who voted for the tax cut bill, said that, among other things, it does the following: 
   * Extends the $1,000 child tax credit: Dorgan said an estimated 66,000 North Dakota families with kids under age 17 will now continue to benefit from the $1,000 per child tax credit, which was otherwise scheduled to expire at the end of this year and drop back to $700 per child. The credit is extended for five years, making it available through the end of 2010. Another 13,000 low-income North Dakota families, who were left out of last year's child tax credit increase, will also benefit from it for the first time under this bill, Dorgan said. 
   * Extends marriage penalty relief: Scheduled to expire at the end of this year, the tax cut bill extends tax relief for married couples who otherwise often would pay more federal income taxes as a married couple than they would pay as two singles. 
   * Retroactively extends the wind energy production tax credit: North Dakota's growing wind industry gets a boost by this provision which retroactively extends - through the end of 2005 - the now expired production tax credit for facilities that produce electricity from wind and other renewable sources. Dorgan said he's confident new projects now on the shelf in North Dakota - parked there awaiting congressional action to extend the credit - will now begin.
   The bill also included a number of other tax cuts for individuals and extensions of tax credits for business. 
   The bill now goes to the President to be signed into law.
