SEN. DORGAN WELCOMES FORMER CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING CHAIRMAN TOMLINSON'S RESIGNATION FROM CPB
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday he welcomes the resignation of former Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Chairman Kenneth Tomlinson from the CPB Board of Directors.  
   "I've not seen the results of the Inspector General's investigation, but expect to see it shortly and I look forward to doing so," Dorgan said. "Mr. Tomlinson's departure from the CPB Board, however, comes as welcome news. There's no doubt in my mind that Mr. Tomlinson's legacy at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a negative one, and that he has done far more harm to the CPB than good." 
   Tomlinson has been the subject of an Inspector General's investigation since early summer after Dorgan and others requested it, following complaints that Tomlinson had used CPB funds, without board approval, to "analyze" public broadcasting programs for political bias, and used procedures outside CPB by-laws to engineer the selection of his hand-picked successor as CPB Chairman, a former Republican National Committee Charperson. 
   Dorgan requested the political bias "analysis" Tomlinson commissioned and described it as highly unprofessional. The conservative political consultant Tomlinson hired to conduct it had no professional standing as a media analyst.
