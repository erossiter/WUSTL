$2.9 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL DISASTER AID APPROVED
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy today announced that the House and Senate have approved $2.9 billion in emergency aid for farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather-related losses. The President is expected to quickly sign the measure into law soon. 
   The aid measure, part of the Military Construction Appropriations Bill, comes after the North Dakota delegation worked for several weeks to show lawmakers the importance of the aid to family farmers and ranchers, many of whom have suffered devastating losses from flooding, frost and drought. Dorgan and Conrad were co-sponsors of the aid package in the Senate and guided it to Senate approval, and Pomeroy co-sponsored a similar measure in the House, and pushed for its approval in the House. 
   The delegation effort overcame attempts by the White House and some House Republicans to scrap or greatly reduce the aid. North Dakota farmers and ranchers could qualify for close to $200 million under the bill. 
   "This is a big victory for family farmers across the country who suffered losses from weather," the delegation said in a joint statement. "It's the first big step toward making their lives and businesses whole again. This was the right thing for Congress to do. Americans come together to help each other when disaster hits, and just as the nation came to the aid of the victims of the Florida hurricanes, the country has recognized that these farmers and ranchers deserve help also."
