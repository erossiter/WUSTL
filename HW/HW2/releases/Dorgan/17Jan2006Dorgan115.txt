SEN. DORGAN RECEIVES 'THANK YOU' FOR STANDING UP FOR WAHPETON
  During a visit to Wahpeton's Giant Seeds today, Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) received a personal 'thank-you' from the employees of the sunflower seed company for his work to help settle a dispute with Major League Baseball that could have spelled real trouble for the company. Giant Seeds contacted Dorgan last year when Major League Baseball objected to its use of the word "Giant" on its sunflower seed label, saying the name and logo were similar to the professional San Francisco Giants baseball team. Dorgan said that Major League Baseball's contention was "complete nonsense." 
   "No one would have confused Giant sunflower seeds from Wahpeton with some official product from the San Francisco Giants baseball team," he said. "I just didn't like seeing a small company having to defend itself against Major League Baseball, and so I got involved and called the baseball commissioner and worked to try to get it resolved in a way that was satisfactory to Giant Seeds," Dorgan said. "Major League Baseball eventually did the right thing and resolved the issue in a way that satisfied the Wahpeton company." Dorgan took on the case of another North Dakota company several years ago when he talked the Necco candy company into backing off its attempt to stop a Mandan company from selling its Lewis and Clark candy bars. "I don't like to see big companies using muscle to threaten small companies," Dorgan said. "I also happen to like both candy bars and sunflower seeds, so I was happy to lend a hand."
