SEN. DORGAN TOURS ANNE CARLSEN CENTER FOR CHILDREN
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) toured the Anne Carlsen Center for Children here Tuesday and met with officials from the center and Minot State University to discuss a project aimed at serving children in North Dakota who have been diagnosed with autism. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured more than $400,000 in federal funding last year to develop the Great Plains Autism Treatment Program. The program teams Minot State University with the Anne Carlsen Center to help better diagnose and monitor autism, conduct research on how to improve treatment of autistic individuals in rural areas, and ensure information about autism is available to medical health professionals and families in North Dakota.
   "Our state has lacked a program to help families who are dealing with autism, but the Great Plains Autism Project will help us fulfill that void," Dorgan said. "The Anne Carlsen Center for Children is a first-class facility. We're pairing that with some top-notch faculty at Minot State University and I'm encouraged by the potential for this new program. I'm going to keep working in Congress to ensure the Great Plains Autism Project has the support it needs to take care of those who need it."
