SEN. DORGAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON AGREEMENT THAT AVOIDS 'NUCLEAR OPTION' ON SENATE FILLIBUSTERS

 The agreement avoids implementation of the "nuclear option" by Senate Republicans, which would have changed Senate rules to prevent filibusters against federal judge nominees.

   "The good news here is that the ultimate damage was not done to the Senate or to the country. The agreement prevents the Republican leadership from breaking the rules to change the rules to bar filibusters. Minority rights are therefore protected. 
   "Having averted the immediate crisis, I hope cooler heads will now prevail. The White House needs to understand that putting someone on the federal bench for a lifetime has to be a cooperative effort. 
   "As the current record of 208 approvals for 218 nominees suggest, a majority of the Senate is ready to work with the President in confirming federal judges. 
   "Now it is time to get on to the pressing problems before us that the American people want us working on: better health care, improving education, doing something about the exporting of American jobs and our trade deficit, and tackling high energy prices."
