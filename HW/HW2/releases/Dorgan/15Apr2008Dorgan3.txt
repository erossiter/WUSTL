SEN. DORGAN CALLS FOR END TO JOB SEARCH FREEZE AT GRAND FORKS HUMAN NUTRITION RESEARCH CENTER
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service (ARS) on Tuesday to end a job search freeze it has imposed on the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center. He said the freeze, which was imposed in response to the President's proposal to shut down the facility, has hampered its ability to carry out critical research to address the nation's obesity problem. 
   Dorgan, in a letter to ARS Administrator Edward Knipling, said the job search freeze has prevented the Human Nutrition Research Center from filling several open positions - including three in its growing obesity research initiative.
   Dorgan has fought the President's proposal to shut down the Grand Forks facility, pointing out that it performs some of the country's best human nutrition and obesity research at a low cost and in a rural area. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which will write the bill that funds ARS, Dorgan said he is confident he will be able to include funding to keep the center running.
   "The fact is, the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center is doing some of our best research on nutrition and obesity," Dorgan said. "We're going to keep this place up and running, and this job search freeze is only delaying the important work they have to do. We desperately need to address the obesity epidemic in this country, especially in rural areas and on Indian reservations. I hope the ARS will lift this job search freeze so the researchers in Grand Forks can stop worrying about budget cuts and focus on how to improve public health."
