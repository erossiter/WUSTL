SENATE VOTES TO CLOSE COSTLY, NEVER ENDING INDEPENDENT COUNSEL OFFICE, REQUIRE RELEASE OF REPORT ON FORMER HUD SECRETARY CISNEROS INVESTIGATION
  The U.S. Senate voted Thursday to approve a call by Sens.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to close down activities of a seemingly eternal Independent Counsel appointed 11 years ago to investigate former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros. 
   The investigation, which has cost taxpayers nearly $22 million so far, ended in February 2003. Independent Counsel David Barrett submitted his report on the investigation in August 2004. Barrett, however, continues to keep his Independent Counsel office open and continues to bill the government for salaries, fees, expenses and travel, claiming $930,742 in expenses for the six months that ended on March 31 of this year, alone. 
   "I've always understood that appointments to the Supreme Court were for a lifetime, but an appointment to be Independent Counsel is not. It's time for this to end," said Dorgan, who along with Grassley offered the amendment to bring an end to Barrett's Independent Counsel service and his ability to keep billing taxpayers. 
   The legislation requires the three-judge panel which oversees Barrett to release his report on the investigation within 60 days of enactment of the legislation, and for Barrett's office to close shop within 45 days after that. 
   If the three judge panel believes there is reason to extend the date for release of the report, it may do so, but only after reporting publicly the reason for any extension and then only if it sets a firm date for release of the report. 
   The Senate voted to adopt the amendment during its consideration of Treasury-Transportation Appropriations bill.
