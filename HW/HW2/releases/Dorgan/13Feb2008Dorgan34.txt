SEN. DORGAN WELCOMES SIGNING OF STIMULUS PACKAGE WITH CHECKS FOR SENIORS, DISABLED VETERANS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said the economic stimulus package signed into law by the President Wednesday will "help get the economy moving," but said Congress and the President have further work to do.  
   He also welcomed inclusion of tens of thousands of North Dakota senior citizens and disabled veterans in the final rebate package, many of whom were not included in the original proposal. Dorgan supported adding them to the stimulus package when it was before the Senate. 
   The final package signed into law today will provide rebate checks to an estimated 300,000 North Dakotans, including about 90,000 senior citizens and 8,300 disabled veterans in the state. 
   "Senior citizens and disabled veterans not only need the rebates and are among the most likely to spend them, they have also earned them," Dorgan said. "I'm glad we were able to add them to the package and that the President today has accepted that action." 
   Dorgan said policy makers still have work to do to set the economy right. "There are some longer term, more fundamental issues we need to deal with, and the sooner we get to them, the better," Dorgan said. The nation's trade and fiscal policies still need to be reformed, he said, and financial regulators, who allowed the subprime loan mess to develop, still need to "wake up and do their jobs."
