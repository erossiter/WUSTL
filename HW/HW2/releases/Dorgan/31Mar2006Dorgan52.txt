SEN. DORGAN SAYS IRS SHOULD DROP PLAN TO ALLOW SALE OF INFORMATION FROM TAX RETURNS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is calling on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to withdraw proposed regulations that would allow commercial tax return preparers to sell personal taxpayer information gleaned from tax returns they help prepare. 
   "It's an outrageous idea," Dorgan said Thursday. "What on Earth are they thinking?" He said 185,593 federal taxpayers in North Dakota used commercial tax preparers in 2002, the most recent year for which IRS data is available. Nationwide, that number was nearly 75 million.
   In a letter [1] to IRS Commissioner Mark Everson and Treasury Secretary John Snow, Dorgan said the plan risks "rampant distribution" of private tax information "for all kinds of unrelated marketing purposes" and that it also increases "opportunities for identity theft and other cases of financial fraud."
   With the April 15 tax-filing deadline just over two weeks away, Dorgan said the IRS should remember that the nation's tax collection system depends on the level of confidence that taxpayers have that the information they provide on their returns will remain strictly confidential. "This proposal would shatter that confidence, at least for the substantial number of taxpayers who use paid preparers," Dorgan said.
   "Instead of constructing new tax rules that could ultimately lead to widespread dissemination of personal taxpayer tax return information, we should be doing more to protect it," Dorgan wrote in his letter to Everson and Snow.
