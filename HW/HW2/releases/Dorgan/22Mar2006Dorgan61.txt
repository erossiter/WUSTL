SEN. DORGAN: UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES HAVE 'LIMITLESS FUTURE' IN RED RIVER VALLEY RESEARCH CORRIDOR
  The potential for commercial and research developments surrounding the arrival of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) mission at Grand Forks Air Force Base is "promising and unlimited at this point," said U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) at a Red River Valley Research Corridor Action Summit he hosted today at the University of North Dakota. 
   "I see an unlimited future in terms of the research opportunities in the Red River Valley that tap into the UAV mission and the technology behind it," Dorgan said. Dorgan said the UAV mission, which will come to the Grand Forks Air Force Base in the coming years and will involve Fargo's Air National Guard, represents the next generation of military technology.
   Today's Action Summit at UND's School of Aerospace Sciences convened some of the nation's top experts on UAV operations for national defense and homeland security, as well as leading businesses, such as Northrop Grumman Corp., that have a stake in the UAV industry. The keynote speaker at the summit was Major General (Select) Kevin Kennedy, who serves as the Acting Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence at the U.S. Air Force headquarters in Washington, DC. "This Action Summit was a way to bring all the interested parties and experts in the UAV industry together in one room to brainstorm how we in North Dakota can make sure we don't miss the boat on all of the opportunities for economic and research endeavors related to the arrival of the UAV mission," Dorgan said.
   Dorgan created a Center of Excellence for Defense UAV Education at the University of North Dakota last year with $1 million in federal funding. "The Center of Excellence gives us a structural hub through which we can make a concerted effort to grow the UAV industry using the existing framework of the Research Corridor," he said.
