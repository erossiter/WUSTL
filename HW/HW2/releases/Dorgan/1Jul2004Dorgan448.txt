FEMA CHIEF TOURS FLOODED AREAS AROUND DEVILS LAKE WITH SENATORS, GOVERNOR
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and North Dakota Governor John Hoeven toured the Devils Lake area Thursday with a top official of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to show FEMA firsthand the needs of the community as it confronts flooding, lost cropland, and new costs to upgrade area roads, dikes and other infrastructure.  
 The group also heard from local residents and officials at a community meeting to discuss flood issues. 
   Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary Michael Brown, who oversees FEMA, toured the area at the invitation of Dorgan, Conrad, Hoeven and Congressman Earl Pomeroy. They discussed several issues including local loss of farm income, loss of tourism and economic development, submerged roads and the need to construct an emergency outlet for the lake. 
   Dorgan has asked the Army Corps of Engineers to find a way to reduce the overall cost of a federally funded outlet for the lake in order to make it more economically feasible. 
   "Devils Lake is still rising, and that means that more work is required keeping roads open, improving the levees, and continuing efforts to build an outlet. I'm glad that Under Secretary Brown accepted our invitation to visit, because only by coming here, touring the lake and hearing the needs of residents directly can FEMA accurately understand the needs of the community," Dorgan said. "FEMA and other federal agencies must act now, not later, and this tour is a big step to making sure Under Secretary Brown understands the severity and urgency of the local needs."
