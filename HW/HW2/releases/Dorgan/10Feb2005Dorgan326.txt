   STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN (D-ND)
   "The announcement this morning that the United States had a $617 billion annual trade deficit in 2004 is devastating news for the American economy. This kind of trade deficit is unsustainable and could have long term, serious consequences for future economic growth in the U.S. and for job creation. 
   "This record trade deficit shows that our current trade policies are seriously misguided and must spur the President and Congress to some action that begins to address the seriousness of our trade imbalance 
   "The President and some in Congress have been using the term crisis to describe a number of different issues. But these record trade deficit numbers are a real crisis that demands action and leadership from this President and this Congress." 
   Dorgan has scheduled a press conference for this afternoon with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) and Representative Ben Cardin (D-MD), the Ranking Member of the U.S. Subcommittee on Trade, at 2:30 PM to unveil legislation that would set a limit on the trade deficit and compel action to reduce it. The press conference will take place in the Senate Radio-TV Gallery, Room S-325, of the U.S. Capitol.
