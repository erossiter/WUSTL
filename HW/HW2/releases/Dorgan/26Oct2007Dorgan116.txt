SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES AMTRAK RIDERSHIP JUMPS TO MORE THAN 119,000 IN NORTH DAKOTA
  More than 119,000 North Dakotans rode Amtrak's Empire Builder rail line last year, a sharp jump in ridership that is hard evidence of the rail service's importance to the nation's transportation network, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday. 
   North Dakotans logged a total of 119,586 trips on the Empire Builder in the 2007 fiscal year, a 4.2 percent increase over the previous year. Dorgan said the numbers are new evidence that the Bush Administration's efforts to shut down long-distance rail service are misguided.
   Earlier this year, Dorgan successfully fought a Bush Administration attempt to slash funding for Amtrak. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for Amtrak that will allow it to continue its long-distance routes including the Empire Builder, which serves Devils Lake, Fargo, Grand Forks, Minot, Rugby, Stanley and Williston. The Senate is currently considering the Amtrak Authorization bill, and Dorgan helped turn back an amendment earlier this week that would have eliminated some of Amtrak's long-distance routes.
   "These numbers are a clear indication that the Empire Builder is an important part of our transportation network that is consistently gaining popularity," Dorgan said. "Amtrak's ridership is rising across the nation, and this is no exception. There are some who would like to see passenger rail limited to the northeast part of the country. I think that's wrong, and I'm going to keep fighting to support Amtrak and its long-distance routes like the Empire Builder."
   The rising numbers in North Dakota mirror a nationwide trend - nationally, Amtrak set an all-time record with a total of 25.8 million riders.
