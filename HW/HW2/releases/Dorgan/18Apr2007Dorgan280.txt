SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD CHAIRMAN TO STOP PLANS TO INCREASE FILING FEE FOR RAIL RATE CHALLENGES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), along with Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Larry Craig (R-Idaho) and others, pressed Surface Transportation Board (STB) Chairman Charles Nottingham to stop plans to increase the filing fee from $140,600 to $178,200 for standard rail rate challenges brought by rail customers. In a letter, the Senators requested a more reasonable filing fee comparable to the $150 filing fee that plaintiffs pay for similar complaints filed in the United States District Courts.  
   "The increase in the filing fee charged by the STB is an outrage," said Dorgan. "The STB should be helping rail customers seek relief from unfair, monopoly pricing instead of hiking the filing fee and making the process even more difficult." 
   The letter states that a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from October 2006 "found that the STB processes that were developed to protect rail customers from railroad abuses of market power do not work." 
   Dorgan is a cosponsor of the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007, which puts an end to the high fees that the STB charges rail shippers when they want to file a complaint against railroads that overcharge them. It also gives the STB new authority to require that rail shippers are treated fairly and charged reasonable rates, particularly in areas where there is little or no rail competition.
