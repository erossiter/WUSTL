RED RIVER VALLEY RESEARCH CORRIDOR GETS MAJOR BOOST WITH $16.3 MILLION BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH GRANT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday that a major biomedical research grant awarded to North Dakota by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will benefit students and communities across the state and provide a major boost for the Red River Valley Research Corridor, Dorgan's initiative to connect North Dakota colleges, universities and businesses to federal research contracts.  
   The five-year, $16.3 million grant will create research opportunities throughout North Dakota's university system, including tribal colleges. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan had a major role in creating the research infrastructure needed to secure the grant through programs such as the NIH's Institutional Development Award (IDeA), which helps makes states with small populations more competitive for federal research funding. Before Dorgan joined the Appropriations Committee, only $2.6 million of the grant money was reserved for universities in small states. As the result of a relentless push by Senator Dorgan, that has now grown to over $200 million. That has made grants like this one possible. 
   "This grant highlights what the Red River Valley Research Corridor is doing for North Dakota's economy and future," Dorgan said. "By developing our universities as hubs for advanced research, we're attracting more federal research funding, creating good, new jobs, and nurturing a pool of home-grown talent at our undergraduate institutions. The benefits of this grant will reach nearly every public college and university in the state, and give great opportunities for our young people to explore their academic potential without having to leave North Dakota."
