CONGRESS APPROVES INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL INCLUDING $22 MILLION IN PROJECTS FOR NORTH DAKOTA, DELEGATION ANNOUNCES
  Projects in North Dakota that ensure safe water supplies, restore and improve historic sites, and strengthen Indian health and education programs will get more than $22 million in the next year under an Interior Appropriations bill that earned final passage Thursday in Congress, Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy said. Sen. Dorgan is Ranking Member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that wrote the bill and a member of the conference committee that finalized the legislation. 
   The North Dakota delegation secured funding in the bill for a variety of projects in the state. The University of North Dakota's Energy and Environmental Research Center will receive $2 million to study toxic metals in the environment. In Jamestown, their efforts will bring $740,000 to the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center for carbon sequestration research. Other funding will enable improvements to facilities at historic sites at Fort Mandan and Fort Abraham Lincoln. About $3.8 million will be used to provide a safe water supply to communities across the state.  
   The bill also funds programs that assist Native American education, including $3.5 million for United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) in Bismarck. Funding for the school from the Bureau of Indian Affairs was "zeroed out" in President Bush's budget proposal. A separate $54 million sum is split among the nation's 25 tribal colleges, including the four in North Dakota. The delegation also secured funding for programs that encourage Native Americans to enter nursing, psychology and medicine programs. 
   "This bill gives support to a wide array of North Dakota programs and initiatives that have proven effective and useful," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Whether it's supporting education for Native Americans, preserving historic sites, or making better use of our natural resources, all of these projects will help to strengthen our state." 
   Below is a list of North Dakota projects the delegation added to the bill. 
   * Center for Air Toxic Metals, UND Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) $2 million
   This funding - more than double the amount provided last year - will be used to continue research at the University of North Dakota's EERC aimed at improving the nation's air, water, and soil quality. 
   * United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) $3.5 million
   The bill restores Bureau of Indian Affairs funding to UTTC that was zeroed out in President Bush's Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal. The funding will allow UTTC to continue its unique mission of educating Indian students from tribes from across the country. The college offers 20 two-year degree programs to its 500 students.
