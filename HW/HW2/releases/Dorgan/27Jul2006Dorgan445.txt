SEN. DORGAN JOINS PRESIDENT AT SIGNING OF 'DRU'S LAW' TO CRACK DOWN ON SEX OFFENDERS
  Legislation authored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) to crack down on dangerous sexual predators was signed into law Thursday in a special ceremony at the White House Rose Garden. 
   Dorgan was joined by Congressman Earl Pomeroy and Linda Walker, mother of the late University of North Dakota student Dru Sjodin, in the bill signing ceremony Thursday afternoon. The President signed comprehensive sex offender legislation that includes "Dru's Law," which Dorgan wrote and introduced in the Senate. Pomeroy introduced a companion bill and steered it through the House.
   "I think this legislation is a big step forward and I'm happy to see it signed into law," Dorgan said. "Dru's Law will provide tough new tools that we can use to prevent known sexual predators from offending again, and I believe that it will save lives."
   "Dru's Law" will establish a nationwide, publicly available and searchable database on the whereabouts of known sex offenders. It also increases supervision and monitoring of convicted high risk sex offenders when they are released from prison. The legislation was included in related legislation known as the "Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act."
   Major provisions of "Dru's Law" in the bill include the following:
   * Establishment of a national public website, searchable by a radius defined by the user. The website, named the "Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website" was the centerpiece of Dru's Law and is designed to provide information on nearby violent sex offenders, regardless of state lines. The man charged with Sjodin's murder would not have come up on a search of the North Dakota sex offender registry, because he lived just across the Minnesota-North Dakota state line.
   * A requirement that States Attorneys be notified of the impending release of high-risk sex offenders so that they can consider seeking civil commitment.
   * Establishment of a pilot program that would use electronic bracelets with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to monitor released sex offenders 24 hours a day.
