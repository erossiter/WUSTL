SEN. DORGAN SAYS NEW TRADE DEFICIT NUMBERS MEAN U.S. ON TRACK FOR ANOTHER RECORD ANNUAL TRADE DEFICIT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said today's announcement that the U.S. trade deficit is up again means the U.S. remains on track for another record annual trade deficit. 
   "Month after month we get new evidence documenting the magnitude of the failure of current U.S. trade policies," Dorgan said. "Yet the Bush Administration and its allies in Congress just keep doing more of the same. Two weeks ago it was the Oman Free Trade deal, now it's the Peru Free Trade deal, next month it will be the Russia Free Trade deal. They all come on the heels of a long line of other failed trade agreements. It ought to be evident to anyone who takes time to read these reports that the so-called "free trade" agreements we negotiate with other countries do not advance America's interests. Instead, they sink us in an ever-growing trade deficit that weakens our country economically, sends good American jobs overseas, and carries with it the potential for serious economic trouble."
