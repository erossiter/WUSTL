SEN. DORGAN SAYS NORTH DAKOTA RENEWABLE FUELS INDUSTRY SHOULD AIM TO PRODUCE 1 BILLION GALLONS ANNUALLY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan said Friday that North Dakota could produce as much as 1 billion gallons of renewable fuels annually within five years, with the aid of legislation he is pushing in the U.S. Senate. He said he is confident the legislation will spark development of new facilities nationwide to produce ethanol, biodiesel, and other renewable fuels, and that North Dakota should capitalize on this wave to bring good-paying jobs to the state.  
   Dorgan, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, said he expects the Senate to consider energy legislation in early June. The bill includes a provision Dorgan championed requiring refineries to produce and use at least 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. 
   "I'm determined to build our renewable fuels industry to help eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and we need to work to ensure North Dakota plays a central role in this new industry," Dorgan said. "I'm confident we'll get this legislation through the Senate to boost the use of renewable fuels. That's good for our environment, good for our rural economy, and good for our nation's security." 
   Dorgan, who co-hosted the Action Summit with Governor John Hoeven, authored the original Renewable Fuels Standard that was approved by Congress and passed into law two years ago.
