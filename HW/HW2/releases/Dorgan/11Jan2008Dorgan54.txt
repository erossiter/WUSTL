SENS. CONRAD, DORGAN SAY SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE WILL TAKE UP FORMER GOV. SCHAFER AGRICULTURE SECRETARY NOMINATION ON JAN. 24
  U.S. Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) announced Friday that the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee will begin confirmation hearings on January 24 for former Governor Ed Schafer, whom President Bush nominated to become the nation's Secretary of Agriculture.  
   "It is a special honor to have someone from North Dakota nominated to serve in the President's Cabinet," said Senator Dorgan. "We look forward to the confirmation process beginning, and to supporting his nomination." 
   "I was talking to Gov. Schafer, and he said it'd be nice if he could be confirmed earlier so he could go to the State of the Union address as a member of the President's Cabinet," said Senator Conrad, who is a senior member of the Agriculture Committee. "That's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So I called Chairman Harkin, and the Chairman was gracious enough to agree to an earlier hearing date." 
   Dorgan and Conrad will formally introduce Schafer to the Agriculture Committee when the hearings begin. They said there is no indication how long the hearings may last, but added that they do not expect the nomination to be controversial or the hearings lengthy.
