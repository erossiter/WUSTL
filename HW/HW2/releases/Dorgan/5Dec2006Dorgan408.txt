   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   December 5, 2006
   "Although the agriculture disaster amendment was three votes short of the supermajority that was needed, the vote still showed that a wide majority of senators supports disaster aid. The Agriculture Appropriations bill will still contain the disaster amendment that I included in the Senate Appropriations Committee last spring. 
   "I will be a Senate conferee on the appropriations measures in January and February, and will continue the fight in the appropriations conferences to get a decent package of disaster aid for family farmers who have suffered losses. 
   "This isn't over. The next fight will be in the appropriations conference in January and February and I will be one of the Senate conferees and will continue to wage the fight aggressively on the behalf of family farmers."
