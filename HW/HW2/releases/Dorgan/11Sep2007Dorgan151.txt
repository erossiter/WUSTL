SEN. DORGAN SECURES FUNDING TO MAINTAIN NATION'S B-52 BOMBER FLEET
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) secured $19 million Tuesday to upgrade all 76 of the B-52 bombers in the Air Force fleet. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, included the funding in the Subcommittee's Fiscal Year 2008 bill, which sets budget priorities for the nation's military. He said it makes no sense to park the Air Force's most cost-effective bomber - the B-52 - when the aircraft have decades of life left in them.
   "The B-52 is still our lowest-cost bomber," Dorgan said. "It makes no sense to park these planes when they are, according to retired General John Jumper, performing 'indispensable' missions in the war on terror. This funding will help make sure we keep these planes flying."
   The Air Force now has a fleet of 94 B-52s, but plans to retire 18 of them. Dorgan included language in last year's Defense Appropriations bill barring the Air Force from retiring any of those 18 B-52s until the completion of a comprehensive bomber requirement study. The report has not yet been delivered to Congress.
