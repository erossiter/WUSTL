SEN. DORGAN SECURES $3.5 MILLION FOR UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE IN INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday a House-Senate Conference Committee approved his request for $3.5 million to support the operation of United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck.  
   Dorgan, the Ranking Member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, worked to secure funding for the college after President Bush proposed to "zero out" Bureau of Indian Affairs support for the institution. The funding will ensure the college can continue its well-regarded programs in education, tribal cultural preservation, technology, research, tribal arts and the humanities. 
   "United Tribes Technical College is a very important part of our educational system, for Native American students throughout North Dakota and the country," Dorgan said. "Anyone who is at all familiar with the work the school does and the difference it makes in the lives of its students knows how important it is to fund this college so it can continue its important work." 
   The funding is part of the Interior Appropriations bill. The bill, which has been approved by the conference committee, now returns to the House and Senate floors for a vote.
