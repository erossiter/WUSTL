SEN. DORGAN PRESSURES ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP AMTRAK
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) stood up for Amtrak and the Empire Builder train that runs through North Dakota Thursday, asking the Administration's Amtrak spokesman to explain the President's budget proposal, which calls for zeroing out all funding for the passenger rail service.  
   "A budget that calls for 'zero funding' is meant for one reason and one reason only: to kill it," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan's comments came Thursday morning at a hearing of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine. 
   President Bush requested no funding for Amtrak operations or capital needs in his Fiscal Year 2006 annual budget, and he has proposed bankruptcy as a possible method for Amtrak restructuring. Administration officials have said the proposal should be seen as a "call to action" for restructuring the rail service. 
   Rosen told Dorgan it is not cost-effective to run passenger service in rural areas like North Dakota because of low ridership. But Dorgan countered with numbers that show 90,000 North Dakotans alone ride Amtrak's Empire Builder each year. "Every other country in the world subsidizes passenger rail service," Dorgan said, "and we in the U.S. subsidize every other form of transportation-our airlines, highways and waterways. We need to decide we're going to invest in passenger rail service in the country and back it up with a budget that at the very least gives [Amtrak President] David Gunn a foundation on which to run and operate Amtrak."
