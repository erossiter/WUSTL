SEN. DORGAN PRESSES USDA OFFICIAL TO OPEN CRP LAND STATEWIDE TO EMERGENCY HAYING, GRAZING IMMEDIATELY
  The number two official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture promised Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) he will decide by Friday whether to open Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land statewide in North Dakota to emergency haying and grazing to help producers suffering from a severe drought. 
   In a phone call to Charles Conner, the agency's Deputy Secretary, Dorgan pressed USDA to expand the emergency haying and grazing from the 11 ? North Dakota counties that are now open. He also pushed Conner to open CP-23 land, which is set aside to restore wetlands.
   "The USDA has opened 11 ? counties to emergency haying and grazing. That's a good step, but we need much more land opened because the best forage is in other parts of the state," Dorgan said. "Many ranchers in North Dakota are struggling to stay in business because of this severe and growing drought, and it would be a shame to see them sell their cattle when we have good forage in other parts of the state that they should be able to use."
