SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN BILL TO CREATE NORTHERN PLAINS HERITAGE AREA
  A key Senate committee approved legislation today authored by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that would declare a scenic stretch of central North Dakota as the Northern Plains Heritage Area, a designation that would help bring tourists to the area and stimulate more investment in the state's growing tourism industry. 
   Dorgan's bill, which won the approval of the full Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would create the Heritage Area along a free-flowing stretch of the Missouri River in North Dakota. The designation allows local communities to partner with the National Park Service to attract tourists and preserve the heritage of areas of the country with important natural, historical or cultural significance. Because the National Park Service provides only financial and technical assistance to Heritage Areas, the designation does not compromise local control over the use of the landscape.
   Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) is a co-sponsor of the legislation.
   "The National Heritage Area program was created to help preserve the heritage of some of our nation's most scenic and historically important regions. I think the Missouri River in North Dakota is easily qualified for that designation," Dorgan said. "This is one of the most scenic areas of North Dakota, but also one of the most culturally significant. It includes landmarks like the Custer House and the Knife River Indian Villages, and was the path followed by Lewis and Clark on their expedition. This bill is important for the preservation of American heritage and the tourism industry of North Dakota, and I'm going to keep pushing to get it done."
   The bill goes next to the full Senate for consideration.
