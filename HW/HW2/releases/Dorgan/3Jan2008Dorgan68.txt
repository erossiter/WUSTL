SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES AIR FORCE ACADEMY NOMINEE
  During a visit to St. Mary's Central High School Thursday, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) recognized senior Alex Malm as his principal nominee to the U.S. Air Force Academy.  
   Alex was one of only four young North Dakotans who were given principal nominations by Dorgan to the U.S. military academies in 2008. As a principal nominee, Alex has a four-year, tuition-free space reserved for him at the U. S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
   "Alex exemplifies the best of North Dakota - the hardworking attitude and the dedication to our country. I was proud to nominate him to the U.S. Air Force Academy and was so glad that I could recognize his success in front of his classmates and teachers," Dorgan said. "He will be an asset to our military."
   Alex is at the top of his class, an Eagle Scout and a member of the track and soccer teams among many other activities and holding a part-time job. He is hoping to go into medicine in the military. Alex is the son of Mark and Sharon Malm of Bismarck.
   The nominations are the culmination of a rigorous selection process by Senator Dorgan that included a competitive review of the students' achievements, as well as personal interviews with military officials and a selection panel chosen by the Senator. Each appointment requires a commitment of five years on active duty following graduation.
