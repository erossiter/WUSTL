IRS COMPLIES WITH DELEGATION'S REQUEST TO PROVIDE FULL-TIME TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE IN MINOT
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) said Monday that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has complied with the delegation's request to restore operation of its Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC) in Minot to full-time service five days a week.  
   In October, the delegation convinced the IRS to provide walk-in tax help five afternoons a week, reversing a move to limit service at the office to just Mondays and Tuesdays. At that time, the delegation also wrote IRS Commissioner Mark Everson to urge that operation of the Minot office be returned to full-time hours, five days a week. 
   "With tax season coming up soon, we're pleased that IRS has decided to once again offer tax help to the people of Minot and the surrounding region on a full-time basis," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Many North Dakotans travel long distances for help with tax forms, and it's important that the IRS provide face-to-face service mornings and afternoons, five days a week, when people expect government services to be in operation." 
   The IRS office in Minot is located at 305 17th Avenue Southwest, Suite B. Walk-in taxpayer assistance is now provided from 8:30 to 11:00 AM and noon to 4:30 PM. During these hours, North Dakotans can get answers to tax questions, pick up federal tax forms and other IRS publications, get help in responding to an IRS letter or notice and make federal tax payments. Because these hours may be subject to change throughout the year, the IRS urges taxpayers to call (701) 839-7721 to check current hours. 
   Tax help is also available online at www.irs.gov and by phone on one of the IRS' two toll-free hotlines, (800) 829-1040 for individuals and (800) 829-4933 for businesses.
