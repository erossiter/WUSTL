PRESIDENT ACCEPTS BRAC REPORT
  President Bush accepted the recommendations of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission today, bringing an end to the successful effort to keep North Dakota's air bases open. Congress is now expected to approve the BRAC report.  
   Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy said the final BRAC report will become law unless both chambers of Congress vote to reject the recommendations within 45 legislative days. 
   While many communities across the country will see their bases close as a result of today's action, North Dakota's bases will remain open and active. The BRAC report makes Grand Forks Air Force Base home to the next generation of UAVs -Global Hawks and Predators - the most-sought after missions in the Air Force today. As part of the Air Force's plan, the UAVs will be launched and recovered at Grand Forks. Some of the UAVs will be operated remotely by pilots from the North Dakota Air National Guard facility in Fargo, which remains open as well. 
   In addition, the final BRAC report recommends that Grand Forks keep eight KC-135 tankers at the base until the end of 2010 - providing the bridge to a new generation of tankers expected in 2011 or 2012. The document also allows the Defense Department to replace the Hooligans' F-16s with another flying mission in the future if it chooses. 
   The BRAC Commission did not recommend any changes for the Minot Air Force Base. 
   "We are pleased with the admirable job by the BRAC Commission," the delegation said in a joint statement. "The members of the Commission came to this process with open minds, and we are happy they saw what we know to be true: North Dakota's air bases are the best in the nation and can serve our country well into the future. We are happy the President has accepted the BRAC report, and soon we'll be looking at the BRAC process only in our rear-view mirrors."
