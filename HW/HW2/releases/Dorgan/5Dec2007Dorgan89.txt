ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH CENTER ETHANOL STUDY GETS ATTENTION IN NATION'S CAPITAL
  Higher ethanol fuel blends can improve fuel efficiency and performance in many automobiles, according to a new study by the University of North Dakota's Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) that was released Wednesday in Washington, D.C. At a Capitol Hill press roundtable, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) joined Senator John Thune (R-SD) and industry and environmental officials in releasing the report.  
   The EERC study examined the effect of different blends of gasoline and ethanol on the fuel economy of several vehicles. It found that blends of 20 to 30 percent ethanol with regular gasoline often produce better fuel-efficiency results, even in non-flex-fuel vehicles. The EERC partnered with Minnesota State University to complete the study.
   Dorgan, who chairs two key energy subcommittees in the Senate, said the study provides further evidence of the need to continue to expand ethanol production and to improve the availability of ethanol fuel. Although more than 16,000 flex-fuel vehicles are on the road in North Dakota, the state has fewer than 25 pumps that supply E85 fuel.
   "This study provides powerful evidence that we need to take action to ensure consumers have access to ethanol," Dorgan said. "We've made important strides in the ethanol industry, but we need to solve the disconnect in the market and ensure it's available at the gas pump."
   Dorgan introduced legislation last month with Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) that would give a boost to the renewable fuels industry by making ethanol fuel - and vehicles that can use it - more widely available to Americans. The bill includes targets for the installation of fuel pumps that distribute E85 and other blends of ethanol fuel higher than E10.
