SEN. DORGAN MEETS WITH VALLEY CITY OFFICIALS, TESTS LOCAL PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) tested Valley City's public transit system here Tuesday, hopping on a local bus for a short ride and receiving a briefing from local officials on the progress of the program. 
   Dorgan, along with Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy, has worked to secure federal funding for the Small Urban and Rural Transit Center (SURTC), which is based at North Dakota State University. SURTC supports the transit system in Valley City through training and outreach.
   Dorgan said the South Central Transit Network provides an important service to Valley City and the surrounding area by providing elderly individuals and others who cannot drive the opportunity to continue living healthy, independent lives.
   "For North Dakotans who are elderly or disabled and can no longer drive, a public transit system is a lifeline that allows them to maintain healthy, active lives," Dorgan said. "The South Central Transit Network is clearly fulfilling that mission for the Valley City region. I'm proud of the work that's going on here and I'll keep working in Congress to support this program."
