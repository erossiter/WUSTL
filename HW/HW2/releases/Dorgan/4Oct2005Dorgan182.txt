SEN. DORGAN SAYS ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW VELVA BIODIESEL PLANT 'IS ONLY THE START' OF HOW ENERGY BILL WILL BENEFIT NORTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday the new biodiesel plant that Archer Daniels Midland Co. announced today it would build in Velva shows exactly how important the renewable energy provisions in the recently passed federal energy bill are for the nation, and in particular, for North Dakota.  
   "Today's announcement of a new biodiesel plant in North Dakota is tremendous news for the future of our state's energy industry. North Dakota is the ideal place for biodiesel production, with our abundance of crops. There is no reason North Dakota can't lead the country in biodiesel development," said Dorgan, a member of the Senate Energy Committee and the House-Senate Conference Committee that negotiated the final version of the federal bill. 
   "One of the reasons I wrote such strong provisions for ethanol and biodiesel into the federal energy bill was to encourage production of these renewable fuels in North Dakota. I hope this is the first of many biodiesel facilities that will break ground in our state. The potential for economic growth and high-paying energy sector jobs in North Dakota is limitless at this point," he said. 
   Dorgan authored the provision in the federal energy bill that requires refiners to produce and use a minimum level of 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol or biodiesel in their gasoline blends annually by 2012. U.S. consumers currently use about 3.6 billion gallons per year. This will add substantial value to North Dakota's grains and spur economic development in the state's ethanol and biodiesel industries, Dorgan said. 
   The 50 million gallon-capacity facility in Velva will use locally grown canola to produce biodiesel, a broader term for renewable fuel generated from a wide range of agricultural products. The plant will be the state's second biodiesel manufacturing facility.
