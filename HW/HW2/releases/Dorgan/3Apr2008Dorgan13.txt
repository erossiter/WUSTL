SEN. DORGAN QUESTIONS COMMODITY REGULATOR, INVESTMENT LEADERS ON MARKET SPECULATION DRIVING UP COST OF OIL
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is pushing back against escalating oil prices by raising questions about the rampant speculation in the oil market that he says is distorting prices. 
   "While hedge fund managers, investment banks and speculators continue to make big profits by buying and selling barrels of oil, consumers are paying higher prices at the gas pump," Dorgan said at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on oil speculation today. "The oil futures market has become an orgy of speculation, driving up the price of oil beyond where the fundamentals of supply and demand would put it."
   Dorgan said investors are buying and selling 30 times the amount of oil that is produced each day.
   "There is more money sloshing around these futures markets than ever before from hedge funds, investment banks and speculators who are neck-deep in futures contracts," Dorgan said. "One prominent oil analyst just told us the futures market is like a casino open 24 hours a day."
   Dorgan suggested that Congress should consider increasing marginal requirements on the oil futures market. While marginal requirements to buy stock on the stock market are about 50 percent, they are only 5 to 7 percent on the oil futures market. In effect, someone who wants to speculate can control $100,000 worth of oil by investing only $5,000 to $7,000.
   "I understand the need for a futures market and I understand the need for liquidity in that market. But what I don't understand is that people are buying oil even though they'll never get it from people who never had it, and making big profits as they run up the price of oil," Dorgan said. "Congress has a responsibility to intervene and shut down what I believe is excessive speculation in order to allow those markets to work the way they should work."
