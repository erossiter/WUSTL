SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP REDUCE HIGH SUICIDE RATE AMONG AMERICAN INDIAN TEENS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) has renewed his fight to help reduce the rate of suicide among American Indian teens. Dorgan introduced his legislation Wednesday that would direct counseling resources, professionals, and suicide-prevention materials to teenagers on American Indian reservations, where the youth suicide rate is among the highest in the nation.  
   Dorgan's bill would expand the availability of "telemental" health services - bringing more counseling, professionals and suicide-prevention materials to rural tribal communities using telecommunications technology. The rate of suicide among teenagers on reservations in the Great Plains is 10 times the national average. 
   "The suicide rate among our American Indian youth is a bona fide public health crisis, and we need to address it with more professional resources," Dorgan said. "I realize this is a sensitive issue to address publicly, but I believe we must extend a hand to these kids to tell them they are not alone, and that we are here to help." 
   Dorgan held the first-ever Senate hearings on Indian teen suicide in 2005 in Bismarck and Washington, D.C. He steered the bill through the Senate last year, but it was not passed by the House before the last Congress adjourned. Dorgan, who is now Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, said he is hopeful that the new Congress will approve the legislation. 
   Dorgan sponsored the bill along with a bipartisan group including Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Kent Conrad (D-ND), and Max Baucus (D-MT).
