INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN BILL AIMED AT REDUCING HIGH RATE OF SUICIDE AMONG INDIAN YOUTH
  The Senate Indian Affairs Committee Wednesday unanimously approved a bill sponsored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that is aimed at reducing the high rate of suicide among teenagers living on Indian reservations. 
   Dorgan, who serves as Vice Chairman of the Committee, said the action is a positive step forward for the bill, which would expand the availability of telemental health services - bringing more counseling, professionals and suicide-prevention materials to rural tribal communities using telecommunications technology.
   Dorgan held the first-ever Senate hearings on Indian teen suicide last year in Bismarck and Washington, D.C. American Indians have the highest rate of suicide of all ethnic groups in the United States. In fact, Indian youth in parts of the Great Plains are 10 times more likely to commit suicide than their non-Indian counterparts. Dorgan said it's critical to bring public attention to the issue, which has reached epidemic levels on Indian reservations across the country
   "This is a sensitive issue, and I realize there are some who say we shouldn't address it in such a public way," Dorgan said. "But I feel it is a topic we must address plainly and openly, both to get the resources to address this bona fide crisis and to say to young teens that we see there is a problem and they are not alone. I'm hopeful that as we take steps on a policy level to address the issue of Indian teen suicide, we will able to prevent the tragic loss of life that far too many in Indian Country have experienced."
   The bill is sponsored by a bipartisan group that includes Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Kent Conrad (D-ND), and Tim Johnson (D-SD). It now goes to the Senate floor.
