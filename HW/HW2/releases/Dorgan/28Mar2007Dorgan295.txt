SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO ALLOW PRESIDENT TO AWARD MEDAL OF HONOR TO WOODROW WILSON KEEBLE
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and colleagues from South Dakota, Sens. Johnson and Thune, have introduced legislation that would clear the way for the President to award a long-overdue Medal of Honor to Woodrow Wilson Keeble, a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribe who fought in World War II and the Korean War.  
   Dorgan and Conrad said the Pentagon has told them a statute of limitation prevents the President from awarding the medal to Keeble, unless he is specifically authorized by Congress. Their bill would make clear that the President has the authority to give final approval for Keeble's Medal of Honor, which has already received the endorsement of the Secretary of the Army and is now due for consideration by the Defense Secretary. Once passed, the bill would clear the way for the Secretary of Defense to send Keeble's nomination to the President for approval. 
   On Oct. 20, 1951, Keeble - acting single-handedly and while stricken with multiple wounds - crawled through heavy enemy fire and took out three four-man machine gun bunkers and two trenches of enemy troops and saved the lives of dozens of American soldiers who had been pinned down. 
   "There is no doubt that Woodrow Wilson Keeble displayed uncommon valor in battle, and no technicality should prevent him from receiving this award," Dorgan said. "The effort to award him a Medal of Honor has turned into a lengthy process, and I hope this leads the Defense Department to make a decision soon." 
   "If anybody deserves this highest recognition, it is Woody Keeble, bravest of the brave," Senator Conrad said. "Woody dedicated his life to defending our nation and preserving our freedom. For that, our nation owes him a debt of gratitude and should honor him with the Medal of Honor."
