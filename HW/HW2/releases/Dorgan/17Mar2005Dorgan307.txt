SEN. DORGAN AMENDMENT WOULD END TAX BREAK FOR COMPANIES THAT MOVE U.S. JOBS TO OTHER COUNTRIES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and other members of the U.S. Senate will attempt today to close a tax loophole that currently subsidizes companies that move American jobs overseas.  
   "I think it is nuts to allow the U.S. tax code to subsidize companies that fire their U.S. workers and move American jobs to other countries," Dorgan said. "At a time when we're losing jobs and when budget deficits are climbing higher by the hour, we need to close this loophole right now." 
   The tax break Dorgan is attempting to close allows companies to shut down their American manufacturing facilities, fire their American workers, import those now-foreign made products back into the U.S. for sale and then not pay taxes on the income from those sales. Taxes are "deferred" until the income is brought back into the United States, but many corporations simply keep those profits in their foreign subsidiaries and never pay U.S. taxes on income from those U.S. sales. 
   Dorgan said the loophole costs U.S. taxpayers about $6.5 billion over ten years, and thousands of jobs annually. 
   Joining Dorgan as co-sponsors in offering the amendment are Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Carl Levin (D-MI), Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT). 
   Dorgan will offer the amendment today to the budget resolution and the Senate is expected to vote on it today, as well.
