NORTHWEST AIRLINES AGREES TO SOME FLIGHT CHANGES AT DEVILS LAKE AIRPORT
  Northwest Airlines has told Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that beginning in September, it will adjust the time of its second flight of the day from Devils Lake to Minneapolis, which will enable passengers to make more connecting flights out of Minneapolis on the same day. The Devils Lake Airport Authority spoke with Dorgan a month ago about the problem that the two Devils Lake daily flights had in connecting with reasonable service out of the Minneapolis hub.  
   Dorgan said he has visited repeatedly with Northwest and the company has now agreed to alter the time of the second flight so that it will connect to more flights in Minneapolis. Dorgan said that Northwest has not yet found a solution for the first flight, which now leaves Devils Lake later than it previously had and misses some of the banks of flights out of Minneapolis. He said he will continue to work on that and hopes that some adjustments can be made so that both of the Devils Lake flights are useful to passengers who want to use commercial air service at the Devils Lake airport. "Air travel is an important part of the transportation system in the Devils Lake region and I'm going to continue to urge Northwest to work with the local officials to provide the best possible schedule in and out of North Dakota," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan serves on the Senate Commerce Committee, which handles airline issues, and said he appreciates the adjustment Northwest has made on the afternoon flight and hopes that progress will be made on the morning flight as well. 
   "Northwest's schedule change makes Devils Lake an easier place to reach for the Guardsmen, tourists and business people who need to get here," said Kenny Koehn, Devils Lake Municipal Airport manager. "I'm glad Northwest has listened to the community and is working to find flight times that best serve our needs."
