SENATE TAKES STEP TOWARD CREATING CUSTOMS AIR WING IN GRAND FORKS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad announced Friday that the Senate approved a provision that will establish and fund a Northern Border Air Wing for Homeland Security in North Dakota next year, most likely in Grand Forks.  
 The Senate agreed to the initiative, co-sponsored by Dorgan and Conrad, as an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2005. 
   The Northern Border Air Wing was mandated by Congress in the wake of the September 11th attacks, but has not yet been established by the Bush Administration. The Department of Homeland Security intends to have five bases, including one in Grand Forks, from which planes can be dispatched to track, identify and intercept any unauthorized aircraft detected on the Northern border. 
   However, at the funding levels called for in the Administration's budget and the original appropriations bill, the Northern Border Air Wing would not have been fully established, staffed and equipped until 2008. This amendment will allow the Department of Homeland Security to procure aircraft for and start up all five air bases planned on the Northern border in Fiscal Year 2005. 
   "We were delighted to be able to take this step towards the accelerated deployment of an Air Wing on the Northern Border," Dorgan and Conrad said in a joint statement. "We are also delighted that this amendment specifies that one of the bases would be in North Dakota. This air wing will increase North Dakota's key role in homeland security, help protect our northern border, and give a boost to the local economy." 
   The Senate is expected to approve the final Homeland Security Appropriations Bill next week.
