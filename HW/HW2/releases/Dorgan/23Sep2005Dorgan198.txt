ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN GARRISON, GRAND FORKS AND WATFORD CITY NAMED \'BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS,\' DELEGATION ANNOUNCES
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy announced Friday that three North Dakota elementary schools have won national recognition for their high performance. 
   The U.S. Department of Education has named Bob Callies Elementary School in Garrison, Phoenix Elementary School in Grand Forks and Watford City Elementary School "No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon Schools of 2005." 
   The law requires schools to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in reading and language arts and mathematics based on state standards and tests. The three North Dakota schools are among 295 across the entire country that received the honor. Schools receive the designation based on three categories: 
   * Schools with at least 40 percent of their students from disadvantaged backgrounds that dramatically improve student performance on state tests; 
   * Schools whose students, regardless of background, achieve in the top 10 percent of their state on state tests; 
   * Private schools that achieve in the top 10 percent in the nation. 
   "We congratulate the students and faculty at the schools in Garrison, Grand Forks and Watford City on their high achievement and academic improvement," the delegation said in a joint statement. "North Dakota has some of the finest schools in the country, and earning recognition for outstanding efforts should not go unnoticed." 
   The Department of Education is funded through monies appropriated by Congress.
