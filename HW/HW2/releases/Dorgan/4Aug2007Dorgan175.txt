SEN. DORGAN DISCUSSES LOCAL ISSUES, FARM BILL WITH NORTHWOOD-AREA RESIDENTS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met with community leaders and area residents at Bart's Café in Northwood Saturday. Dorgan's stop here was one of a series of visits to communities around the state to discuss issues important to North Dakota.  
   Dorgan discussed local issues and gave an update on the Farm Bill that is under debate in Congress. He is working with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), Congressman Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) and other colleagues in Congress to craft a Farm Bill that will preserve a strong safety net for producers, establish a permanent disaster aid program, and institute reforms that prevent mega-farmers from draining resources that were meant to support family farmers and ranchers.
   "Our current Farm Bill has done a pretty good job helping our family farmers and ranchers when they need it, and I'm going to work for a new bill that expands that farm safety net," Dorgan said. "It's not just our producers, but communities like Northwood that depend on the Farm Bill when times are tough. We need to make sure we have a strong farm program that plays a productive role in our agricultural industry."
