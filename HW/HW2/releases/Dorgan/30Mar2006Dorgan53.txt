SEN. DORGAN PRESSES INTERIOR OFFICIAL ON PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE FUNDING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Thursday defended United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) against the Administration's continued efforts to eliminate Bureau of Indian Affairs funding for the school, and told Deputy Secretary of the Interior Lynn Scarlett that he will fight to reverse the wrong-headed proposal. 
   At a hearing of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan said the budget proposal laid out for the Department of the Interior is an example of the Administration's misplaced priorities. For the fifth consecutive year, the budget calls for eliminating Bureau of Indian Affairs funding for United Tribes Technical College (UTTC).
   Dorgan is Ranking Member of the Subcommittee.
   "United Tribes Technical College is one of the top tribal colleges in the nation, and it is unbelievable that year after year the Administration would try to eliminate this funding," Dorgan said. "I will work to restore that funding, but this attempt to damage an institution that provides such important opportunities for many American Indians is just wrong."
