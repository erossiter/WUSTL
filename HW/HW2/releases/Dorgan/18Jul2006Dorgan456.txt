DELEGATION STATEMENT ON DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ACTION ON B-52S
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy said Tuesday the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee rejected an attempt to include funding in an appropriations bill for the attrition reserve B-52 bombers stationed at Minot Air Force Base. 
   At issue are 17 attrition reserve bombers, 18 including one loaned to NASA, assigned to Minot. No matter what happens with the attrition reserve, the air base will continue to be a home base for the 5th Bomb Wing, an active wing of B-52 bombers that has flown missions over both Iraq and Afghanistan.
   "For more than a decade, we have been able to add funding to the Defense Appropriations bill to ensure the attrition reserve B-52s remain at Minot Air Force Base," the delegation said in a joint statement. "The war in Iraq has resulted in a lack of funds, and the Air Force now has made a major push to put these planes in storage.
   "We are disappointed with this result, but the fight is not over yet. We will still push the committees working on Defense Authorization to keep the Air Force from retiring these planes. Our B-52s are the most cost-effective bombers in the military with many years of life left, and it would make no sense to take them out of our fleet. If the 18 attrition reserve bombers are put in storage, we have been informed it will affect fewer than 100 people at the base.
   "Air Force leaders have told us they are committed to retaining the bomber and ICBM missions for the Minot Air Force Base well into the future. The Minot Air Force Base plays a strong role in ensuring the nation's security and will do so for decades to come."
