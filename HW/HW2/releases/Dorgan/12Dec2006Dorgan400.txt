SEN. DORGAN SAYS NEW UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA CENTER WILL ADVANCE RESEARCH, INNOVATION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday the new Center of Excellence for Life Sciences and Advanced Technologies (COELSAT) at the University of North Dakota will further mark the Red River Valley Research Corridor as a leading center for research and innovation. He attended a groundbreaking ceremony here with UND President Charles Kupchella and other officials.  
   "The new Center of Excellence for Life Sciences and Advanced Technologies will bring vital research and opportunities to partner with top, high-tech businesses in North Dakota," said Dorgan. "This new research center will further establish North Dakota's Red River Valley Research Corridor as a leader in life science and advanced technology." 
   COELSAT will include a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory that will be used to conduct secured biological research into infectious diseases such as the Avian Flu and West Nile Virus. In addition, six companies will have facilities in the center to conduct research. These companies include Alion, Inc., Ideal Aerosmith, Prologic, Avianax, Novadigm and Agragen. 
   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Dorgan secured $300,000 for the BSL-3 laboratory in the Transportation Appropriations bill, which is still pending in the Senate. Dorgan has also worked to provide federal funding for research projects through Alion, Prologic and Avianax that will be conducted at COELSAT. He has secured more than $300 million to fund research and programs at North Dakota's schools, and develop North Dakota's Red River Valley Research Corridor.
