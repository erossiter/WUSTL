SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE TO BE INCLUDED IN EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request to include an agriculture disaster package in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that will be considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee tomorrow. He said the addition is a significant breakthrough in his push to secure relief for producers who have been hit by weather-related disasters in the last two years. The disaster package will cost $4.154 billion.  
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd (D-WV) has agreed to his request to include a disaster relief package in the emergency supplemental bill. "Senator Byrd agreed and the disaster package will be included when the Senate Appropriations Committee takes up the bill on Thursday," he said. 
   Dorgan has steered an agriculture disaster package through the Appropriations Committee and the Senate twice before. Each time, House Republican leaders, acting at the behest of the President, blocked it. 
   "We've been working for two years to get some relief to family farmers and ranchers who have been hit by weather-related disasters, and this is a significant step forward," Dorgan said. "We have producers in North Dakota and across the country who are on the verge of losing their farms because of weather-related disasters, and it's time we got them some help. 
   "I'm going to keep pushing to make sure Congress does the right thing, and I hope the President will support rather than oppose us this time around."
