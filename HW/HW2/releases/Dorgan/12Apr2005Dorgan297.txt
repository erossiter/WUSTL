SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES BIPARTISAN RAIL SAFETY BILL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced his rail car safety bill in the 109th Congress Tuesday, saying "there is a good chance" for passage of the legislation aimed at preventing another tragedy similar to the 2002 train derailment in Minot, North Dakota.  
   The Welded Rail and Tank Car Safety Improvement Act, which Dorgan is sponsoring with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), directs the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to implement recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in its report on the Minot accident. On January 18, 2002, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailed in Minot, spilling five tank cars of anhydrous ammonia. The deadly vapor killed one person and sickened hundred of others. 
   Sen. Dorgan cosponsored legislation in the last Congress to implement many of the NTSB's recommendations. The bill passed the Senate but did not make it out of the House. 
   "Three years after the tragedy in Minot, I am optimistic that we'll finally get in place some real measures to improve the safety of our rail system and tank cars," Dorgan said. "This is an issue of safety for every region of the country that has freight traffic passing along its rail lines. For too long, the need for upgrades has been ignored-and those in Minot saw the ramifications of that inaction firsthand. It's time for the system to catch up, so there's not another 'Minot, North Dakota, tragedy' somewhere else." 
   Dorgan said this year's bill includes provisions nearly identical to last year's, with an added measure that would prioritize safety upgrades to the oldest and most susceptible tank cars. Other provisions of the bill direct the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to: 
   * Require railroads to perform on-the-ground visual inspections and testing to identifying cracks in rail joint bars, which the NTSB found failed in the Minot accident. 
   * Require railroads to provide copies of their continuous welded rail programs for the FRA to use when performing the inspections. 
   * Periodically review the inspection data to determine whether improvement is needed. 
   * Develop and implement design standards for pressurized tank cars and conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the impact resistance of the steels in the shells of pressure tank cars constructed before 1989. 
   * Report to Congress with recommendations for measures to eliminate or mitigate the risks of catastrophic tank car failure.
