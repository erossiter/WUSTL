SEN. DORGAN DISCUSSES LOCAL ISSUES, FARM BILL WITH MCVILLE-AREA RESIDENTS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met with community leaders and area residents at Capone's Café in McVille Saturday. Dorgan's stop here was one of a series of visits to communities around the state to discuss issues important to North Dakota.  
   Dorgan discussed local issues and gave an update on the Farm Bill that is under debate in Congress. He is working with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), Congressman Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) and other colleagues in Congress to craft a Farm Bill that will preserve a strong safety net for producers, establish a permanent disaster aid program, and institute reforms that prevent mega-farmers from draining resources that were meant to support family farmers and ranchers.
   "We need a strong Farm Bill because it supports not just our family farmers, but the entire rural economy and communities like McVille," Dorgan said. "The last few years have made clear that what we need is a stronger farm safety net, not a weaker one. I'm going to keep working to make sure we get a strong Farm Bill that will give a hand to our family farmers and ranchers when they need it."
