SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON JAPAN TO STOP DRAGGING ITS FEET IN OPENING BORDER TO AMERICAN BEEF
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Wednesday called news that Japan has agreed to re-open its borders to U.S. beef "encouraging," but said he will push Congress to impose sanctions if Japan drags its feet in resuming imports of American cattle products. 
   Dorgan joined Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS), Kent Conrad (D-ND), and a bipartisan group of colleagues in introducing legislation calling on Japan to end by August 31 its ban on U.S. beef imports, which costs American ranchers $100 million in lost export opportunities every month. If Japan misses the deadline, the bill would impose sanctions on Japan one month later.
   After Japan agreed to re-open its borders to American beef in October 2004, it waited another 14 months before actually accepting U.S. beef imports, Dorgan noted. The border was open only two weeks before it closed again in January in response to an error by a single packing plant in the state of New York.
   "It's a good sign that Japan has agreed to accept U.S. beef imports again, but we can't wait another 14 months for relief for American ranchers," Dorgan said. "Japan's ban on American beef has gone on far too long, despite the fact that our cattle industry has bent over backwards to reassure them that we have the safest, healthiest beef in the world. We need to send a message to Japan that we need action, not lip service. And if they continue to drag their feet, we're going to stand up for our ranchers and our country's economic interests."
