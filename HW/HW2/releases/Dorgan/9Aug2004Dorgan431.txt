SEN. DORGAN DISCUSSES GARRISON WATER SITUATION WITH LOCAL CHAMBER
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met today with representatives of the Garrison Chamber of Commerce to hear the latest on low water levels in Lake Sakakawea and the effects on the regional economy.  
   Dorgan is taking a Jobs Tour of several communities in North Dakota throughout the month of August, visiting local businesses to discuss the local economy. The Senator said there a direct correlation between the situation at Lake Sakakawea and the economic future of communities like Garrison. 
   "We clearly have a two-pronged problem here. First, we need to ensure access to the lake for recreation and other purposes," Dorgan said. "But more importantly, we also need a long-term plan to once and for all get action from the Army Corps of Engineers on a water management plan that helps upstream communities and water reservoirs instead of continuing to drain them." 
   "I am in constant contact with the Corps about the situation at Lake Sakakawea because it's time for action. The people of Garrison know their economy depends on it, and meeting with them today helps me bring their message back to Washington so that together we might talk some sense into the Army Corps of Engineers," Dorgan said.
