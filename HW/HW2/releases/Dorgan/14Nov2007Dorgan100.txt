   TEXT Statement by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND)
   November 14, 2007
   "I am troubled by reports published today suggesting that a hedge fund is pushing for merger talks between United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the second and third largest airlines in our country. I hope the hedge funds and the airlines will both understand that there will be substantial resistance here in the U.S. Congress to a merger between two of the largest three airlines in America. 
   "The airline industry has had serious operating problems recently, and I think those problems will not be solved by mergers to create larger and fewer airlines. The hedge funds may have an interest in value for stockholders, but I am much more interested in providing value to air travelers. And I think that more consolidation in this heavily concentrated airline industry is not a solution to what ails this industry."
