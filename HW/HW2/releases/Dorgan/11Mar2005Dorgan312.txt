SEN. DORGAN SAYS NORTH DAKOTANS WOULD SEE STEEP ELECTRICITY HIKES UNDER BUSH BUDGET PROPOSAL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday a provision in the President's Fiscal Year 2006 budget that would force the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) to increase the rates it charges public utilities and cooperatives is a "backdoor tax on rural America."  
   According to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), that backdoor tax could cost North Dakotans more than $18 million in the first five years alone. 
   The President's budget proposal calls for the nation's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) - which deliver and market federal electricity to public utilities, cooperatives and wholesalers - to raise their prices to market-based rates. North Dakota gets its hydroelectric power and other services from WAPA, which currently provides electricity to publicly-owned utilities and cooperatives at cost. 
   Dorgan said under such a change, NRECA predicts North Dakota consumers who get their electricity from cooperatives would see increases in their electric bills of approximately $317 annually. That is unacceptable, he said. 
   "There is a proud tradition of rural electric cooperatives in North Dakota. For the Administration to propose a steep rate increase that would be passed on to co-op customers is essentially a backdoor tax on rural America," said Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "I intend to fight this proposal as we move forward in the budget debate."
