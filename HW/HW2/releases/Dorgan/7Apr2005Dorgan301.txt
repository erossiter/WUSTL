SEN. DORGAN OPPOSES PASSPORT REQUIREMENT FOR CROSS-BORDER TRANSIT BETWEEN U.S., CANADA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement today in response to new rules issued by the Departments of State and Homeland Security this week that will require all travelers entering the United States from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean to show passports upon entry. The new rules would be phased in over time, ultimately taking effect by December 31, 2007.  
   The text of Dorgan's statement follows: 
   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   April 7, 2005
   "I am supportive of efforts to improve security at America's borders, but I think imposing a passport requirement on routine cross-border traffic by Americans and Canadians is the wrong step. 
   For decades, the traffic across the border has been utilized by Americans and Canadians to conduct business, to visit relatives, and for tourism. Neither the U.S. nor Canada has required a passport for entry into either country. 
   While I understand the need for increased border security in these days of terrorist threats, I think there are better ways to provide that security than taking action that very likely would make it much more difficult for those who cross our border between Canada and the U.S. on a daily basis. 
   I want to work with the Department of Homeland Security, the Border Patrol and others to find a solution that improves border security without imposing requirements that overburden those who routinely travel across the border doing business, meeting family members, engaging in farming activities and other purposes. My hope is that through discussions with these agencies, we can modify the proposal in a manner that is satisfactory to those whose daily, weekly, and monthly activities take them back and forth across our common border with Canada."
