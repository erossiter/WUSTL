BILL GOING TO PRESIDENT INCLUDES SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING TO ADVANCE NORTH DAKOTA'S ENERGY FUTURE, SEN. DORGAN SAYS
  Flanked by energy industry leaders from across the region, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan announced funding he secured as the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that will invest millions of dollars in North Dakota's energy future. 
   Dorgan, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, played a key role in writing the Omnibus Appropriations bill passed by Congress yesterday, and now on its way to the president for signature.
   Dorgan included funding in the omnibus bill that will:
   * Provide $5.1 million to complete construction of the energy technology and training facility, complete with state-of-the-art laboratory at Bismarck State College. The facility will enhance BSC's reputation as a national leader in energy technology training. In the past year, Dorgan secured a Department of Energy designation of BSC as a National Power Plant Operations, Technology and Education Center.
   * $958,000 to develop a new Instrumentation and Control component to the nationally recognition energy technology program at BSC.
   * $250,000 to establish a Great Plains Energy Corridor Coordinating Office. This office will work with energy researchers and industry to develop new and innovative ways to increase production, invest in the region's energy infrastructure, and coordinate the energy industry's substantial growth in the northern Great Plains.
   "Our state ranks sixth in the nation in the production of energy," Dorgan said. "We are a leading producer of coal, oil, natural gas, wind, biomass and other forms of energy. But this is just a start. We are on the threshold of substantial new development with new jobs and new economic opportunity in our state. These investments that I have been able to make will expand BSC's role as a regional leader in energy training, and develop an Energy Corridor Coordinating Office that will provide significant boost to our energy future."
