SEN. DORGAN SAYS CHRISTENING OF NAVY SHIP NAMED AFTER SAKAKAWEA IS FITTING TRIBUTE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) applauded the U.S. Navy's christening of the USNS Sacagawea, a combat logistics force vessel named for the woman who guided Lewis and Clark on their expedition through the American West. The ship will be christened June 24 at a ceremony in San Diego, California, with Amy Mossett, a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota, serving as honorary matron of honor. 
   The USNS Sacagawea (whose name is spelled "Sakakawea" by the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota) is the second vessel in the Navy's "Lewis and Clark" class, after the USNS Lewis and Clark. It measures 689 feet in length, displaces about 42,000 tons, and can reach a speed of 20 knots. The ship is designed to transfer cargo such as ammunition and food to ships and other naval warfare forces at sea, and will be manned primarily by civilian crews working for the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command. The launching ceremony will be highlighted by the traditional breaking of a bottle of champagne over the bow.
   "The christening of the USNS Sacagawea is an honor for one of the most impressive women in our country's history," Dorgan said. "The importance of Lewis and Clark's expedition is legendary in America, but we in North Dakota know they wouldn't have gotten far without the Mandan-Hidatsa woman who guided them up the Missouri River with a baby on her back. The Navy has chosen a fitting tribute that should be an honor to all Native Americans, women, mothers, and North Dakotans."
