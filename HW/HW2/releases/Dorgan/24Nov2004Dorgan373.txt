SEN. DORGAN SAYS NORTH DAKOTA CITIES ADDED TO VA HEALTH CARE PRIORITY EXPANSION PLAN
  Meeting the health care needs of North Dakota military veterans is moving up on the priority list in Washington, DC, Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan said Wednesday. 
   Dorgan said he's been informed that the Department of Veterans Affairs Vision 23 regional network, which includes North Dakota, is now formally proposing that new veterans' health care clinics be opened in Dickinson, Williston and Jamestown in late 2005, and in Devils Lake and at the Grand Forks Air Force base in 2006. 
   That's a big change from earlier this year, when the VA included no expansion of North Dakota VA health care facilities on its priority list and plans. Dorgan met with VA officials several times to urge a greater "sense of urgency" and effort to meet the health care needs of North Dakota military veterans. 
   "It looks like they are getting the message," Dorgan said. "While this is a draft plan, still subject to final approval and funding by the VA, it is a very significant change to now have several new North Dakota facilities on the VA's priority list." 
   "It is simply unreasonable to ask aging veterans to travel for hours to get the health care they need and were promised," Dorgan said. "That's the case I made to them, and it appears they were, indeed, listening. That's wonderful, because military veterans deserve no less." 
   "We'll continue to press for funding and the final decision by the Department, but this is very good news, and definitely a step in the right direction," he said.
