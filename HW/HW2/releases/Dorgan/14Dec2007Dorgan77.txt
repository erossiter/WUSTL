SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD LEGISLATION BOOSTS EFFORT TO BRING BIN LADEN, AL QAEDA TO JUSTICE
  A provision which aims to step up U.S. efforts to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, sponsored by North Dakota Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, was included in the Defense Authorization bill approved by the Senate Friday.  
   The Dorgan-Conrad amendment doubles the reward for the capture, or information leading to the capture or death of bin Laden to $50 million. It also requires the White House to issue a classified report to Congress on U.S. government efforts to bring bin Laden and other top al Qaeda operatives to justice. 
   "Our intelligence agencies tell us that the greatest threat faced by the United States is Osama bin Laden, yet six years after 9/11, he remains free and continues to communicate via video tapes with the world from a secure hiding place," Dorgan said. "There shouldn't be one square inch of territory anywhere that is secure for Osama bin Laden. I hope this legislation will re-focus the administration on bringing him to justice and motivate others to help with that effort." 
   "We cannot take our eye off the ball. Six years after 9/11, the chief terrorist behind that murderous attack on American soil is still at large. I believe we must do everything we can to bring him to justice," Senator Conrad said. "This Administration has spent billions on its war in Iraq, but it wasn't Iraq that attacked us on 9/11. It was Osama bin Laden, and al Qaeda. I hope this amendment not only refocuses efforts on tracking bin Laden down, but also serves as a genuine incentive that produces solid leads on his whereabouts." 
   The legislation next goes to the White House, where President Bush is expected to sign it into law.
