SEN. DORGAN SPONSORS BILL TO SPUR KEY RESEARCH TO DEVELOP HYDROGEN-BASED ECONOMY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced legislation Thursday that would spur the development of hydrogen technology that would change the way Americans power their homes and cars, reduce pollution, and eliminate the nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   Dorgan, who sponsored the bill with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), said the H-Prize Act of 2006 will provide federal funding to award prizes to researchers who successfully develop groundbreaking new technology that paves the way toward a hydrogen economy. While the research will help strengthen the nation, Dorgan said it is of particular interest in North Dakota - where institutions such as the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) in Grand Forks are on the cutting edge of today's hydrogen research and should compete for the H-Prize awards.
   "Prices at the gas pump make plain that when it comes to how we use energy, 'yesterday forever' is not a strategy that works very well," Dorgan said. "While fossil fuels will always be a part of our energy mix, developing new domestic sources of energy is more important today than it has ever been. The H-Prize will provide a powerful incentive for research and advancement in one of the most promising new areas on the horizon - developing hydrogen fuel cells and making them an integral part of our economy.
   "I'm proud to be the lead Senate co-sponsor of legislation that will spark research and development that can take us to a more secure and stable energy future," he said.
