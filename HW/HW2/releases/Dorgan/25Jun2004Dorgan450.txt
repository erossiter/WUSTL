SEN. DORGAN CONCERNED, WANTS MORE INFORMATION FROM GREYHOUND ABOUT PULL OUT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday he is disappointed with the Greyhound bus company's announcement that it will withdraw service from North Dakota, effective August 18.  
 He said he contacted the company today to request a meeting with company officials to express his concern and to ask for additional information about the decision.
   "Transportation is incredibly important in a state like North Dakota so this is a very disappointing announcement," Dorgan said Friday. "I've requested a meeting with senior Greyhound officials to learn more about why they are making this decision and to explore any options that might still preserve Greyhound bus service in North Dakota. I want to make sure every possibility for avoiding this has been considered."
   Greyhound currently serves the North Dakota communities of Beach, Bismarck, Dickinson, Fargo, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Medora, Richardton, Steele, Sterling and Valley City. The company said it intends to continue service to and from Fargo from the east, but will no longer provide the service north or west from Fargo that it currently provides.
