SEN. DORGAN LANGUAGE REQUIRES REPORT ON ORIGIN OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS APPROVED SINCE 2000
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) included a provision in the Agriculture Appropriations bill Thursday that would require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to report the location at which prescription drugs, as well as their active ingredients, are manufactured.  
   The requirement would apply to all prescription drugs approved by the FDA since January 1, 2000. 
   The action comes on the heels of an all out attack by the big drug makers on legislation sponsored by Dorgan and Senator Olympia Snowe to allow the importation of lower priced prescription drugs from other countries. The drug makers argue prescription medicines imported from other countries are inherently dangerous and that there is no way to guarantee their safety. 
   "I am not claiming that drugs made overseas are dangerous, but if that's the argument drug manufacturers are going to make to block importation of lower priced medicines," Dorgan said, "then Americans have a right to know the origin of prescription medicines the drug companies are already selling here." 
   Billions of dollars worth of medicines widely sold and used in the United States each year are manufactured in other countries. The drug companies import them into the United States and sell them here, even as they seek to block others from importing FDA approved medicines, claiming there is no way to assure safety of drugs from outside the United States.
