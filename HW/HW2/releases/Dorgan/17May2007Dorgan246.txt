   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   May 17, 2007
   "I remain very disappointed that a few short years after receiving substantial grants and government guaranteed loans to expand their plant in Wahpeton, Imation has announced plans to close it.
   "It is my hope that Imation will consider repaying the over $3 million in grants they received to expand their Wahpeton plant so that grant funding could be used as the tools and incentives necessary to attract a new company to the Wahpeton region.
   "I support the five-point plan that was agreed to yesterday in the meeting between state and local officials and Imation, and I am eager to work with all of you as we try to rebuild the opportunities for the future in the Wahpeton area."
