SEN. DORGAN SECURES FUNDING FOR HIGH-TECH LABORATORY AT NORTH DAKOTA STATE COLLEGE OF SCIENCE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday he has secured $500,000 in federal funding to develop a laboratory at North Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS) that will help train students for jobs in the state's growing nanoscience and technology industries. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee, included the funding in the subcommittee's Fiscal Year 2007 appropriations bill to purchase equipment and develop a Nanotechnology Applied Science Lab at NDSCS. Dorgan said the lab will serve as a training ground for students enrolled in the school's two-year degree program for nanoscience technicians - a growing field in the Red River Valley Research Corridor.
   "This funding will help bring a state-of-the-art center to educate students for careers in the high-tech sector that continues to expand in the Red River Valley Research Corridor," Dorgan said. "There's some really exciting work going at North Dakota State College of Science, and I'm proud to continue to support the school. This new Nanotechnology Applied Science Lab will help continue that important work and train a new generation of students to continue building North Dakota's reputation as a center of high-tech research and development."
   Since he launched the Research Corridor in 2002, Dorgan has directed more than $300 million to high-tech projects in North Dakota.
   The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill goes next to the full Senate Appropriations Committee.
