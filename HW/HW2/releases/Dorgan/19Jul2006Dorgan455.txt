SEN. DORGAN HELPS RESTORE FUNDING FOR LONG-DISTANCE AMTRAK SERVICE TO REGIONS LIKE NORTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday he and colleagues on a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee have restored funding for long-distance rail service on Amtrak, a move that will ensure the rail service's Empire Builder line can continue serving North Dakota and other Midwestern locations. 
   Dorgan helped restore the funding for Amtrak, which was slashed in the President's budget, to $1.4 billion in the Fiscal Year 2007 Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill. Last year, more than 100,000 North Dakotans boarded Empire Builder trains. Ridership at each of North Dakota's seven stations - Fargo, Grand Forks, Devils Lake, Rugby, Minot, Stanley and Williston - increased compared to the previous year.
   Dorgan is a member of the Senate Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee.
   "The Empire Builder is an important resource for North Dakota and many other states," Dorgan said. "It is almost unbelievable that the Administration continues to try to undercut Amtrak, but I'm glad we've been able to restore this funding and keep these trains rolling. That's important for our nation's transportation network."
   The Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill goes next to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
