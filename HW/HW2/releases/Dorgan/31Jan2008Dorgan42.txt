V.A. TO INCREASE DISABLED VETERANS TRAVEL BENEFIT
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan announced today that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has confirmed in a letter to him that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will increase the amount disabled veterans are reimbursed for travel to obtain VA health care.  
   Dorgan, along with other Senators, sent a letter to the Secretary earlier this month asking for the VA to increase the reimbursement rate from 11 cents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile. The Secretary concurred with their recommendation and has announced that as of February 1, 2008, veterans will receive 28.5 cents for every mile. This is an increase of 17.5 cents. 
   "Disabled veterans have made a big sacrifice in service of their country. The least we can do is ensure that they are fairly reimbursed for the cost of getting to the medical care they were promised," Dorgan said. "This change is especially welcome in states like North Dakota because of the long distances that veterans must travel to get care." 
   The travel benefit is provided almost exclusively to veterans who are 20 percent or greater disabled. The VA reimbursement rate had remained unchanged since 1977. 
   "This is a long overdue increase and I'm pleased that the Secretary is so supportive of this action," added Dorgan. 
   The Congressional Delegation has been steadily working to have VA clinics opened around the state. Clinics were opened in Dickinson, Williston and Jamestown in 2006, adding to the clinics already in Fargo, Bismarck, Minot and Grafton. The VA has also committed to opening clinics in Devils Lake and at the Grand Forks Air Force Base. 
   "We are working to shorten the distances veterans have to travel for care but the reality remains that in a state like ours travel will be necessary and reimbursements need to be fair," Dorgan concluded.
