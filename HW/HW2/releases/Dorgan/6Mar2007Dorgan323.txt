SEN. DORGAN TO HOLD HEARINGS ON 'FAST TRACK' IN SENATE COMMERCE TRADE SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), who is Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Trade, said Tuesday he will chair a series of oversight hearings at the subcommittee this spring to examine President Bush's request for renewal of fast track trade negotiating authority.  
   Dorgan said he will convene the hearings this month and that they will continue through April, May and June. He said he intends to call as many as 20 expert witnesses to present testimony on how treaties negotiated under fast track authority have affected the interests of American jobs, American workers, environmental protection, and worker safety. Dorgan said the subcommittee will also examine the enforcement - or lack thereof - of trade agreements reached under fast track. 
   Fast track authority expires June 30. 
   The Senate Finance Committee is also expected to conduct hearings on the President's request to renew "fast track" authority. 
   "We intend to come at this question from a new and different perspective," Dorgan said. "We intend to examine whether treaties negotiated under fast track authority have advanced America's interest or simply corporate interests. As Congress considers the President's request, it's important to examine the results previous fast track negotiations have produced. The American people deserve to hear tough questions and straight answers." 
   Dorgan said he will invite a number of freshman Senators to take part in the hearings, in recognition of the fact that many were elected after calling for new trade policies that do a better job of looking out for the interests of American workers, the environment and worker safety.
