SEN. DORGAN SAYS AIR FORCE INQUIRY SHOULD HELP DOD SEE CONSEQUENCES OF B-52 CUTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has asked the Secretary of the Air Force to answer a series of detailed questions he and Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) submitted on the potential effects of the planned drawdown of the B-52 fleet. 
   Dorgan said he hopes the review by Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne will be another step in helping the Department of Defense understand the consequences of reducing the nation's B-52 fleet.
   "I think it's a positive step that Secretary Rumsfeld is taking our request seriously and will have the Air Force review our questions and the effect that cutting the B-52 fleet would have on our nation's long-range strike capabilities," Dorgan said. "The B-52s are still extremely capable of carrying out their mission, and they will remain so for at least 20 to 30 years. The best way to save money for the Air Force is to keep these bombers flying so we don't have to spend billions of dollars on a new bomber program."
