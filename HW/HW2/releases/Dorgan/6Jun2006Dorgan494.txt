REP. DORGAN TO PUSH FOR AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MEETING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday a House-Senate conference committee will meet tonight to begin negotiations for the final version of an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that includes a $4 billion agriculture disaster package. Dorgan said he'll push committee members to include the disaster relief provision despite opposition from the President and House majority, forcing a vote on the issue if necessary. 
   Dorgan said the committee, of which he is a member, will begin its deliberations Tuesday at 8:00 PM.
   Dorgan said the fight for the agriculture disaster package will be a difficult one, however, because the President has threatened to veto the bill if it includes disaster relief for family farmers and ranchers, and the Speaker of the House declared the disaster package "dead on arrival."
   Dorgan will present to conferees signatures from an online petition he started on his Web site to gather support for the agriculture disaster package. About 4,000 signed his petition. Six other senators sponsored similar petitions.
   Earlier this year, Dorgan introduced the agriculture disaster package as a stand-alone bill with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues. Dorgan then offered the package as an amendment to the emergency supplemental bill and secured a unanimous vote in the Senate Appropriations Committee.
