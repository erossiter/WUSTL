SEN. DORGAN SAYS COORDINATING ROLE FOR ENERGY DEPARTMENT WOULD HELP AVOID FUEL SHORTAGES
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan is asking Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to take action to prevent disruptions in regional gasoline and diesel supplies like the one that pushed fuel prices through the roof in North Dakota this year. 
   Dorgan held a hearing last month in Bismarck, North Dakota, and received testimony from government officials and representatives of oil refineries, pipelines and fuel providers. Witnesses indicated that a series of scheduled maintenance issues and other problems caused disruptions in refined fuel supply to North Dakota. The disruptions helped push fuel prices in North Dakota higher than in any other state except Hawaii.
   In a conversation with Bodman, Dorgan asked the Secretary to begin a rulemaking that would allow the Department of Energy to receive information from refiners about maintenance shutdowns. That would allow federal officials to coordinate shutdowns and avoid "perfect storm" scenarios like the one that affected North Dakota this year. 
   Bodman said he was interested in the proposal and is exploring the idea.
   "When farmers and others in North Dakota need fuel, they need it now," Dorgan said. "In a state where we produce far more oil than we use, it makes no sense to me that we would have shortages of gasoline and diesel. We need to take some action to ensure these 'perfect storm' scenarios can't happen, and I think we could avoid them if the Department of Energy can play a coordinating role."
