SEN. DORGAN SAYS RED RIVER VALLEY WATER SUPPLY WILL REQUIRE UNITED EFFORT FROM NORTH DAKOTA
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday that the effort to move Missouri River water to the Red River Valley is achievable, but it will not be easy. He outlined the challenges that the project faces and said a united effort will be needed to get the project done.  
   Dorgan, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, said he'll keep working in Congress to ensure the Red River Valley Water Supply project clears the hurdles it needs to come to fruition. Already, Dorgan has enlisted the U.S. State Department in the effort to address Canadian objections, and he said he will work with Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy to find a way to win congressional approval of the project. 
   But Dorgan said the project faces several hurdles: 
   * The Department of Interior must still issue a Record of Decision, which will identify the method that will be used to construct the project. The Administration must also provide a report to Congress. 
   * The State Department must complete its assessment of whether the project complies with the Boundary Waters Treaty. 
   * Dorgan asked the State Department to engage with Canada to discuss its opposition to the project and find a diplomatic solution. 
   * The state Legislature must appropriate state funds to pay its share of the project. Last legislative session, the Legislature passed a law that would use federal funds to pay half of the state's share of the project. Dorgan said this falls short of the state's commitment to invest in the project. If left unchanged, the law will also severely complicate efforts to secure congressional authorization and funding. 
   * The state must engage in talks with officials from Minnesota and Missouri to address objections that have been raised by those states. 
   * Congress is required to enact a new authorization bill in order for the project to proceed. 
   "The Red River Valley is growing very rapidly. But in order for that growth to continue, there needs to be an assured supply of water. That is why we need to complete the Red River Valley Water Supply project. And it is going to require a joint effort from everyone," Dorgan said. "The fact is, this project has already met objections from Canada, Minnesota, Missouri and all of us are going to have to work together to get the project done."
