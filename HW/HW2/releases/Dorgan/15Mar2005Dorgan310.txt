SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S LIST OF BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE COMMISSION NOMINEES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement Tuesday, in reaction to the release of President Bush's list of nominees to serve on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC).  
   The text of Dorgan's statement follows: 
   "The list of names released for the base closure commission is a first and important step in the process of closing surplus military bases across the country this year. 
   The nine members appear very well qualified, and I expect the new commission will approach this process in a fair and reasonable way. 
   We have two major Air Force bases in North Dakota that have critically important military missions, and one of the nation's outstanding Air National Guard units as well. We have worked hard with the communities and military installations to do everything possible to get ready for this base closure round. 
   The next step is May 16, when Secretary Rumsfeld will announce his list of bases to be closed or realigned. I'm proud of the three military installations in our state. And I hope that when the dust settles on this base closing commission, we will have been able to preserve the important roles for all three of our military bases in North Dakota."
