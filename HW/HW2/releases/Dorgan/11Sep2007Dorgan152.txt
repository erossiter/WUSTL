SEN. DORGAN AMENDMENT REQUIRES TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF CUSTODY, CONTROL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) won approval Tuesday for an amendment requiring a top to bottom review of policies and procedures for controlling custody of, and securing, U.S. nuclear weapons. The action comes just one week after reports that nuclear warhead equipped missiles were inadvertently mounted on an Air Force plane and flown from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.  
   The Air Force has acknowledged that a serious incident occurred, but has not confirmed whether nuclear weapons were actually involved. 
   Dorgan's amendment requires a total review of Defense Department and Department of Energy activities to monitor and control all aspects of the nation's nuclear weapons. It also requires that the review be completed within 90 days, and that a classified report be submitted to Congress at that time on its findings. 
   The amendment was adopted Tuesday by the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee as it considered the FY 2008 Defense Appropriations bill. 
   "It is critical that every area of our government that has any chain of custody of nuclear weapons, at any time, have a top to bottom review of procedures, and an evaluation of the process of ensuring the chain of custody of nuclear weapons," Dorgan said. 
   "Nothing in military procedures is more important than ensuring the control and custody of our nuclear weapons. Clearly, last week, something went wrong with a system where there can be no mistakes. We need to understand exactly what mistakes were made and what changes are needed to ensure it cannot be repeated," Dorgan said.
