SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES BURLINGTON NORTHERN AGREES TO POSTPONE INCREASE IN TRAIN SPEEDS THROUGH CASSELTON
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Friday the Burlington Northern railroad president has written to him saying that he will postpone the proposed train speed increase from 40 to 60 miles per hour through Casselton, North Dakota, until further review by the company.  
   Dorgan wrote a letter to Burlington Northern last week asking the rail line to scrap plans to increase its trains' speed through the Casselton city limits. Burlington Northern CEO Matthew K. Rose replied in a letter that he would delay the speed increase so that the rail line could consult with city officials and review the potential risks to public safety and local buildings. 
   Dorgan said that Casselton city officials indicated in previous discussions that they were concerned about public safety and potential damage to historic property as a result of the increased train speeds. 
   "The news that Burlington Northern was planning to increase its trains' speed through Casselton generated some legitimate concerns, and I appreciate the railroad's willingness to work to make sure the interests of the city are given proper weight," Dorgan said. "I believe the railroad has a responsibility to consider the views of the people of Casselton, and I'm glad that Burlington Northern has realized that as well. I intend to follow this closely."
