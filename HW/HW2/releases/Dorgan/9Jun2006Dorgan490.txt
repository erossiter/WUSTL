SEN. DORGAN: TRADE DEFICIT SURGE SHOWS U.S. TRADE POLICIES ARE INEPT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said the $63.43 billion monthly trade deficit for April 2006, announced by the Commerce Department Thursday, "underlines once again the total failure of U.S. trade policies and the injury those policies are doing to our country and to American workers. 
   Particularly troublesome, Dorgan said, is the fact that the U.S. trade deficits with China, Japan, Korea, and Canada all rose in April.
   "We're running a trade deficit of $2 billion a day. That means we're handing over $2 billion worth of our country every single day to other countries because we are importing more than we're exporting," Dorgan said.
   "The U.S. Senate just confirmed a new U.S. Trade Ambassador last evening," Dorgan noted, "yet it is clear it really doesn't matter who our Trade Ambassador is because our trade policy is inept. Our trade policy is a policy that is selling out our country and the American people shouldn't stand for it any longer." Dorgan said.
