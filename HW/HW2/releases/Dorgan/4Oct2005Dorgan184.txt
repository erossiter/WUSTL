DELEGATION ANNOUNCES FAIR HOUSING GRANT
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy announced Monday the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded a grant totaling $188,538 to Bismarck-based Fair Housing of the Dakotas, formerly known as the North Dakota Fair Housing Council. 
   The grant is part of HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program, which aims to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices. 
   Fair Housing of the Dakotas works to eradicate housing discrimination and to ensure equal housing opportunities for the greater public. It provides assistance to individuals pursuing legal issues related to fair housing, offers housing assistance and counseling, provides community education, promotes community involvement, pursues legal issues, and performs research in the area of housing. 
   "Finding safe, quality housing is not something that always comes easily," the delegation said in a joint statement. "We are pleased this grant will be able to help Fair Housing of the Dakotas work toward its mission of promoting equal housing opportunities." 
   The grant was awarded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development with funds appropriated by Congress.
