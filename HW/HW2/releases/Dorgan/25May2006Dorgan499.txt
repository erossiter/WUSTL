SEN. DORGAN CALLS FOR SENATE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION ON CAPTIVE SHIPPERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Thursday used a Senate Energy Committee hearing, which examined how the absence of competition in the rail industry affects the availability of coal, to urge the Senate to also examine the effect of monopolistic practices on agriculture producers and rural manufacturers who ship their products via rail and suffer from exorbitant rail rates. Dorgan said unreliable rail service and excessive rates threaten the ability of utility companies to have the inventories of coal necessary to provide an affordable supply of electricity to residents of North Dakota and people around the country. Dorgan introduced bipartisan legislation last year to help limit the impact of railroad monopolies on captive shippers - rail customers who don't have access to rail competition. 
   Since the railroad industry was partially deregulated in 1980, the industry has consolidated from over 40 major railroads to seven, four of which handle 90% of the nation's rail traffic. The lack of rail competition in North Dakota costs the state's farms and businesses an estimated $100 million each year. "Consolidation of the railroads in recent years has given them far too much power to hike up prices and provide second-rate service to their customers," Dorgan said. "My hope is that this bill will bring some much-needed competition to the marketplace, and allow farmers and others who need to move their product some relief from the exorbitant rail rates they're paying today."
