DELEGATION CALLS FOR APPROVAL OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO IMPROVE AIR SERVICE AT MINOT
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy today urged the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to approve federal funding that would help improve and expand service at Minot International Airport. 
   In a letter to Secretary Mary Peters, the congressional delegation said the city of Minot would use funding from the Small Community Air Service Development Program to attract a new airline to the city's airport and market the new service. Expanded service would give travelers in the region more choice and would help boost economic development in the Minot area, the delegation said. 
   "Expanded service for the airport would be a great improvement for air travel in the region and would help promote economic growth," the delegation wrote. "The Minot International Airport and local organizations have been actively working on this goal and we believe this grant will give Minot what they need to successfully launch a new service." 
   Congress created the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program in 2001 in order to provide a new source of funds to help small, underserved airports improve their air service. Congress has appropriated approximately $20 million annually since 2002 for the Department of Transportation (DOT) to award up to 40 grants each year to communities that have demonstrated a negative impact due to insufficient air carrier service or unreasonably high air fares. 
   The Minot International Airport serves about 75,000 passengers annually, and officials are working to attract service from a second airline. According to the most recent data available, the airport brings in more than $105 million annually, supporting 788 jobs in the region with total operations increasing four percent over a five-year period.
