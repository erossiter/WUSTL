DELEGATION QUESTIONS DEFENSE SECRETARY ON PROPOSED GUARD REDUCTIONS
  Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Rep. Earl Pomeroy today sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld questioning the proposed force reduction in the Army and Air National Guard.  
   "We believe such a reduction may hinder the ability of the Guard to perform its critical homeland security and state emergency roles while also posing a risk to military preparedness and security for the entire nation," the delegation wrote in the letter. 
   "Whether answering the call to serve by deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan or by helping secure clean water for the displaced residents of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, our National Guard troops have honorably and consistently fulfilled both their federal and state obligations. Any reduction in force numbers will inevitably have an effect on the ability of the Guard to perform these roles." 
   The delegation said the proposed changes by the Department of Defense are expected to decrease the number of National Guard combat brigades from 34 to 28. The Army is also expected to propose funding in its 2007 Budget request for only 333,000 National Guard troops - 20,000 less than authorized by Congress. In addition, the Air National Guard is expected to be cut by 14,464 by 2011. 
   The proposed cuts come at a particularly strenuous time for our nation's Guard troops. By the Department's own numbers, the number of "man-days" per year that reservists contribute to their respective services has increased from 13 million days averaged from the years 1996 to 2001 to 67 million days in Fiscal Year 2005. 
   "The reductions seem particularly ill-advised at a time when the Guard is deployed in record numbers and has performed extremely well in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism," the delegation said.
