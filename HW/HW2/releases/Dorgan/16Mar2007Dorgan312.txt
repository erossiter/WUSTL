SEN. DORGAN CONVENES MEETING AT VETERANS HOME, SAYS HE'LL KEEP PUSHING TO ENSURE NEW FACILITY MOVES FORWARD
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday he will continue working with state officials to address the conditions of the North Dakota Veterans Home here. He said he will also stay in close contact with federal Veterans Affairs officials to ensure the project remains high on its priority list.  
   Dorgan brought a staff member from the U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee to tour the Veterans Home Friday. He also invited veterans from North Dakota to the tour and a meeting with Veterans Home officials. Dorgan said some estimates suggest the construction of a replacement facility would cost no more than the major investments that would be required to bring the older structure up to code. 
   In response to an inquiry from Dorgan, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs officials assured him it will move forward quickly to replace or make major repairs to the Veterans Home, as long as state officials appropriate matching funds and request federal assistance. Dorgan said he would work through his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure the Department honors that commitment. 
   "I think it's clear our veterans receive quality care here at the Veterans Home, but this facility has outlived its use and we need to provide a new one for them," Dorgan said. "As soon as the state provides the needed matching funds and makes the request, we can move forward with the construction of a new facility. I'm going to stay on top of this issue and make sure we take all the right steps to get a new facility that honors and properly serves the veterans that have given our country so much."
