   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SEN. BYRON DORGAN
  DECEMBER 21, 2004
   "I am pleased to see that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced that it plans to take action on hiring more air traffic controllers and addressing the masses of retirements that are leading to extreme shortages in our air traffic control system. Although the Administration this year did not seek any funding to address this issue, I urged Congress to provide additional funding, and was gratified that such funding was provided. 
   "I hope that the FAA will continue to remain committed solving this staffing problem, and that the President's budget next year will reflect this commitment. I will continue my work in Congress as both a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee to solve this crisis."
