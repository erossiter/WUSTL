SEN. DORGAN SAYS SURGE IN U.S. TRADE DEFICIT REQUIRES ADMINISTRATION SUMMIT
  Senator Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) is renewing his call for a summit meeting of administration trade policy leaders to stop the hemorrhaging of red ink in trade deficits, after the Commerce Department reported a dramatic surge in the monthly U.S. trade deficit Friday. The nation's monthly trade deficit jumped from $57.8 billion in October to $63.1 billion in November. Dorgan said such a substantial increase warrants immediate action by the Bush Administration, in the form of a summit meeting of cabinet officials.  
   "We are running a trade deficit of over $2 billion a day, and the warning signs of serious economic trouble, including a free-falling dollar, are unmistakable. The spike in the trade deficit in November may be due in large part to rising energy costs, but that doesn't make the consequence of the trade deficit any less serious," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan noted that the trade deficit surge in November was the biggest one-month increase in two years. "This Administration has had many wake-up calls with the respect to the trade deficit in recent years, and has slept through them. The numbers released today will hopefully ring alarm bells loud enough to stir the Administration to action," Dorgan said.
