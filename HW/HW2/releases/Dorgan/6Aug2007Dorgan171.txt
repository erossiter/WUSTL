SEN. DORGAN, TOP ENERGY DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL DEDICATE NATIONAL CENTER AT BISMARCK STATE COLLEGE
  A top official from the U.S. Department of Energy joined U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) here Monday to formally designate Bismarck State College as a national hub for the training of power plant operators. Dorgan secured the designation for BSC in legislation he authored that has been signed into law. 
   Dorgan invited Kevin Kolevar, who has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary of Energy, to BSC to showcase the school's power plant training program and officially dedicate it as a National Power Plant Operations, Technology and Education Center.
   The National Center designation will allow BSC to work more closely with the U.S. Department of Energy and gives a boost to its power plant operator training program. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has secured $1.2 million in federal funding to support the first-of-its-kind program, which helps train a new workforce to manage the nation's power plants. He has secured an additional $1 million for the program in a bill pending in the Senate.
   "Bismarck State College has distinguished itself as one of the top centers in the nation for power plant training, and it will play a key role as we develop the Great Plains Energy Corridor to bring more jobs to North Dakota and help our nation achieve energy independence," Dorgan said. "One of the chief challenges to our country's energy industry in the future will be a lack of power plant operators. This designation will help BSC play a leading role in training the next generation of operators. That's good not just for the school, but for our energy industry and our entire state."
