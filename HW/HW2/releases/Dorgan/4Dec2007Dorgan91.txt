SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES ENERGY DEPARTMENT DECISION TO EXTEND CRITICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM AT EERC FOR FIVE YEARS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Energy formally renewed a cooperative agreement that will allow the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) to continue critical research aimed at finding cleaner, more efficient ways to use coal and other fossil fuels for another five years. 
   The Department of Energy agreed to the five-year extension of the program after Dorgan discussed the value of this program with Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman. Since 1998, the EERC has received nearly $40 million in federal funding through the program. As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan writes the bill that funds the cooperative agreement. 
   "The renewal of this cooperative agreement is a real vote of confidence from the Department of Energy that will allow the EERC to continue research that is critical to the future of our energy industry," Dorgan said. "As our country works to achieve energy independence, we will need to find a way to use our fossil fuels in a cleaner, more efficient way. That's why this research is so important, and the EERC is leading the way."
   EERC works collaboratively with Western Research Institute of Wyoming under the cooperative agreement. Dorgan has worked with Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy to bolster the research capabilities at the EERC.
