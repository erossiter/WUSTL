   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN (D-ND)
   OCTOBER 12, 2005 
   Selling out American farmers! That's what I think our U.S. Trade Ambassador is preparing to do once again in the Doha round of trade talks. 
   This week he proposed that the U.S. will cut its farm program safety net by 60 percent if the European Union limits their payments to only twice our level. His proposal would limit U.S. farm program payments to $7.6 billion a year, while the Europeans would be allowed to spend $15 billion a year. That doesn't meet any test of fairness that I know. 
   Once again, our negotiators are demonstrating their incompetence by negotiating bad deals, and by their failure to demand "fair trade" rules for our farmers when they compete with foreign governments. 
   Our Trade Ambassador says "the U.S. is willing to take some pain...." Really? Well it's not going to cause him any pain. He is just willing to trade away our farmers' interests because he and others in this Administration don't really support a farm safety net to help family farmers through tough times. 
   If he comes back with an agreement like that, I can promise him he is in for a tough fight from me and others in the Senate who demand fair trade rules on behalf of America's farm families.
