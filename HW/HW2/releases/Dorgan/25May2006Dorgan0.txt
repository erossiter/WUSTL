SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO ENRON CONVICTIONS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), who chaired the Senate Commerce Committee hearings on Enron in 2002, said Thursday's guilty verdicts against former Enron executives Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling "provide some justice for the thousands who lost their life savings" as a result of their actions, but cannot "repair the damage their crimes inflicted on so many." 
   "It is important that those who operated one of the biggest financial scandals in America's history be held accountable," Dorgan said. "But these verdicts cannot repair the damage to lives, hopes and dreams the Enron crimes inflicted on thousands across America. Former Enron employees who lost their retirement nest eggs, active Enron employees who lost their life savings, and west coast electricity customers who were bilked out of billions in manipulated energy prices, get some justice today," Dorgan said. "But the wreckage remains."
   "Public policy makers have a responsibility to ensure that this kind of fraud never occurs again. Proper regulation of the market-place is not an impediment to business. When done properly, it ensures the integrity of the market place. An honest market place, as we learned from this experience, is in the interest of everyone - corporations, investors, customers, and the general public."
