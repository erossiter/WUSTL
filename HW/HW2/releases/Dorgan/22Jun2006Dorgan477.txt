SENATE APPROVES DORGAN AMENDMENT CALLING FOR RETENTION OF ROBUST, MODERN INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE FORCE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday the U.S. Senate has approved an amendment to preserve and modernize the nation's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, including the wing stationed at Minot Air Force Base. 
   Dorgan, who offered the amendment with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), said the amendment underlines the need for the Air Force to retain a robust, fully modernized force of ICBMs. The Pentagon would be barred from retiring any ICBMs until a study is completed analyzing the nation's future ICBM needs. The amendment also requires the nation's Minuteman III ICBM force to be fully modernized.
   "This amendment makes clear that this nation should maintain a robust and fully modernized force of Minuteman III ICBMs," Dorgan said. "Our missile force is important to the security of our nation and for North Dakota, which is home to 150 of these missiles."
