SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES USDA AGREES TO OPEN ALL CRP LAND IN NORTH DAKOTA TO EMERGENCY HAYING, GRAZING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday the U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to open Conservation Reserve Program land across North Dakota to emergency haying and grazing. He also announced that CP-23 land, which is set aside for restoration of wetlands, is also open to emergency haying and grazing. 
   The USDA agreed to open the land after Dorgan pressed Deputy Secretary Charles Conner in phone calls last night and today to take the step to relieve ranchers suffering from severe drought in North Dakota. Conner returned Dorgan's call to inform him that he has agreed to allow ranchers in the 11 ? counties that have already been opened to emergency haying and grazing to access CRP land anywhere in the state.
   The 11 ? counties that are eligible for statewide emergency haying and grazing are McIntosh, Sioux, Morton, Burleigh, Kidder, McHenry, Pierce, Mercer, Oliver, Emmons, Grant and part of McLean. Ranchers in other counties that receive approval will also be eligible for emergency haying and grazing statewide.
   Ranchers in the approved counties may graze statewide on CRP and CP-23 lands immediately. Haying statewide may begin July 15. Dorgan also said that haying on CP-23 acres will be available after August 1.
   "This is good news for ranchers who have been hit hard by this drought," Dorgan said. "Many of our ranchers in North Dakota have been struggling to find feed for their cattle and some have been forced to sell off their herds, even though other parts of the state have plenty of feed available. This will open that land to haying and grazing and I'm glad I could help bring some relief to these ranchers."
