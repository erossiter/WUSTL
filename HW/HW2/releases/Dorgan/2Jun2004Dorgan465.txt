SEN. DORGAN: SEN. GREGG PRESCRIPTION DRUG BILL FALLS SHORT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) says Sen. Judd Gregg's (R-NH) prescription drug bill, unveiled Wednesday, falls short of what is needed to allow the re-importation of lower priced prescription drugs to occur.  
   "It is encouraging that the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is joining the ranks of those who are actively working on drug re-importation legislation," Dorgan said. "His bill is a good start, but it simply doesn't go far enough. It would allow the big drug companies to continue to thwart drug exports in the United States, as we see them already doing in Canada. That means the drug companies would retain the ability to stop re-importation before it even gets started under the Gregg bill. The bottom line is, this bill will not move prescription drug re-importation to reality." 
   Dorgan is the lead sponsor of consensus legislation which has drawn broad, bipartisan support. "After reviewing Senator Gregg's legislation, it is clear our legislation remains the only bill to have broad bi-partisan support. It remains the only bill that would actually allow the safe re-importation of prescription drugs to take place." 
   Dorgan's legislation, S. 2328, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2004, has 22 bipartisan co-sponsors, including Dorgan and lead Republican co-sponsor Olympia Snowe (R-ME).
