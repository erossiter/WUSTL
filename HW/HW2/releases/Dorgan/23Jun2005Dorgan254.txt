SEN. DORGAN RESPONDS TO APPOINTMENT OF FORMER RNC CO-CHAIR HARRISON AS PRESIDENT OF CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) had the following comment today upon the announcement that Patricia Harrison, a former co-chair of the Republican National Committee, had been selected as the President of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).  
   "I am deeply disappointed in this decision. As I have said before, I believe strongly that the appointment of a partisan political figure as the President of the CPB is a huge mistake, and undermines the spirit of nonpartisanship that has characterized CPB's leadership in the past." 
   "This is a bad decision for public broadcasting, and as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I will be watching the future actions of Chairman Tomlinson and Ms. Harrison closely. Americans believe public broadcasting is balanced, and they want it to remain independent. Rather than pursuing a partisan agenda, Chairman Tomlinson should be focused on the needs and future of public broadcasting, to ensure that its core mission and goals are fulfilled."
