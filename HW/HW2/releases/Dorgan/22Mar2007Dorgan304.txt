SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES BILL THAT DEMANDS FAIR RAIL RATES FOR 'CAPTIVE SHIPPERS'
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) along with Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Larry Craig (R-Idaho) and others introduced a bill Wednesday to prevent railroad companies from charging "captive shippers" exorbitant rates in areas where there is little or no rail competition.  
   The legislation, known as the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007, gives the Surface Transportation Board (STB) new authority to require that rail shippers are treated fairly and charged reasonable rates, particularly in areas where there is little or no rail competition. The bill also puts an end to the high fees that the STB charges rail shippers when they want to file a complaint against railroads that overcharge them. "The fees charged by the STB are almost as outrageous as the price-gouging by the railroad," Dorgan said. 
   "In recent decades, because of mergers, we've ended up with just a few railroads that operate in a near monopoly condition with almost no regulation at all," said Dorgan. "That has to stop. Our bill will provide rail costs to customers with some clout and will force the Surface Transportation Board to wake up and start helping customers who are paying unfair rail rates."
