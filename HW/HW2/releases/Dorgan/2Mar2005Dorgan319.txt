SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO FEDERAL COURT ORDER TO DELAY BORDER OPENING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement Wednesday in reaction to the decision by a federal court judge in Montana to delay the scheduled March 7 reopening of the border to Canadian beef imports.  
   The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-CALF) had asked the court to block the Department of Agriculture's effort to reopen the border, arguing that Canada doesn't sufficiently test its cattle for Mad Cow disease and that resumption of beef imports would have a negative economic impact on American producers. 
   The text of Dorgan's statement follows:
   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   March 2, 2005
   I salute the court for making the right decision. USDA was moving fast and furiously to reopen the border to Canadian beef imports, but the court stopped the agency dead in its tracks. 
   The court has issued a temporary restraining order to delay the March 7 date. That's just what the doctor ordered. The court's ruling is protective of America's farmers and ranchers, and that is what's most important here. More than that, it's just the right, fact-based decision. 
   Now my hope is that the court will issue a permanent restraining order. I hope the court will tell the USDA Secretary to stand up and do the right thing for America's farmers and ranchers, who need to have confidence in the safety of Canada's cattle inspection system before-not after-we reopen the border.
