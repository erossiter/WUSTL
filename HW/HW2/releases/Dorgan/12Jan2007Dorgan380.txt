SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIALS TO VISIT NORTH DAKOTA TO DISCUSS NEW AIR WING BRANCH
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday officials from the Department of Homeland Security will visit Bismarck, Fargo and Grand Forks next week to meet with state and National Guard officials about the new Northern Border Air Wing branch at Grand Forks.  
   The trip will be led by Michael Kostelnik, who is responsible for air and marine activities at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, is overseeing the establishment of the new air wing, which will carry out surveillance and interdiction missions with helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and several dozen staff members. 
   Dorgan and Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) worked to locate an air wing branch in Grand Forks and then to secure funding to accelerate its establishment - including $17 million in the Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill that was approved by Congress in September 
   The Department of Homeland Security has also announced plans to base unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at Grand Forks. The agency already operates a few Predator B UAVs - a larger version of the Predator A that the Air Force plans to deploy to Grand Forks Air Force Base - and hopes to expand that fleet to at least 18. The Air Wing office and its manned aircraft will be located at Grand Forks International Airport, but Homeland Security officials hope to base the UAVs at Grand Forks Air Force Base. 
   "I welcome Mr. Kostelnik to North Dakota and think he'll find that Grand Forks is the ideal location for this mission," Dorgan said. "I've had conversations with Mr. Kostelnik and Secretary Chertoff in the last few weeks about ways we could expedite and expand the role North Dakota is playing in ensuring our nation's security. I'm pleased with the progress and will continue to work with them to get this air wing up and running."
