SEN. DORGAN, NEARLY HALF SENATE SAY HEART, STROKE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) led 48 of his Senate colleagues in urging Senate leaders to invest new resources into research that would lead to better prevention and treatment of heart disease and stroke, two of the nation's top three killers. The diseases cost the country hundreds of billions of dollars in medical costs and lost productivity every year. 
   Dorgan is Co-Chairman of the Senate Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition. In a letter co-signed by 49 Democratic and Republican Senators, Dorgan said Congress must provide more opportunities for the National Institutes of Health to battle the diseases, expand the number of states that have heart disease and stroke prevention programs, and restore funding to federal programs that help save the lives of cardiac arrest victims. The letter was sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate subcommittee that approves funding for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee. The Subcommittee is chaired by Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA). Its Ranking Member is Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA).
   "Heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases are by far the leading cause of death in the United States," Dorgan said. "This is not some mysterious problem for which we don't know the cause. We know that we need to invest in quality research that will help us better understand the way the cardiovascular system works and prevent these debilitating diseases before they become a problem."
