SEN. DORGAN CALLS NEW PIPELINE CAPACITY AN IMPORTANT BOOST FOR NORTH DAKOTA'S OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday the announcement that Enbridge Energy Company will add up to 45,000 barrels per day of pipeline capacity in North Dakota is a significant step forward that will bring new investment and good-paying jobs to the state's oil and gas industry. Dorgan has worked closely with Enbridge and other energy companies to encourage them to invest in North Dakota's potentially vast oil and gas resources. 
   Dorgan, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, said North Dakota has the potential to play an important role in leading the nation to energy independence. To achieve that goal, Dorgan has pushed in Congress to help develop North Dakota's abundant oil and gas resources - including the substantial potential in the Bakken Shale formation.
   "This new pipeline capacity that will be developed by Enbridge will provide a significant boost for our state's oil and gas industry," Dorgan said. "Our state has significant reserves of oil and natural gas, but too often bottlenecks in the pipeline system prevent our producers from getting it to the market. This pipeline capacity will open many new opportunities for our oil industry, and that will bring good-paying jobs to the area and help our nation reduce its dependence on foreign sources of oil."
