SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO CORPS DECISION TO BEGIN SPRING PULSE ON MISSOURI RIVER
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday he is disappointed at reports that the Army Corps of Engineers will begin a "spring pulse" on the Missouri River tonight, depleting already-low water levels that are needed upstream to ensure residents and businesses have access to a safe water supply.

   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   May 11, 2006
   "I'm disappointed that the Army Corps of Engineers has decided to take a bad situation and make it worse by moving forward with plans to release water from reservoirs on the Missouri River.
   "North Dakota and other upstream states are struggling with a drought, and many residents and businesses have been left without a safe water supply. It makes no sense to me that the Corps would send this water downstream at this time. Draining our upstream reservoirs is bad policy when the Missouri River system is short of water."
