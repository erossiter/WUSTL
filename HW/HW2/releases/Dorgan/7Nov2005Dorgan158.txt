SEN. DORGAN SECURES FUNDING FOR METH EDUCATION PROJECT AT MINOT STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday he has secured $1.75 million funding to continue a program at Minot State University (MSU) that trains educators and law enforcement officials to fight the production, distribution and use of methamphetamine in rural America.  
   Dorgan is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that drafted the Commerce-State-Justice Appropriations bill that contains the funding, and served on the House-Senate Conference Committee that worked out final version of the legislation. 
   The program is an important component of the Red River Valley Research Corridor Dorgan is building, working from his position as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to direct federal research and training efforts to North Dakota colleges and universities. 
   The funding will help prevent the abuse of meth in rural areas, and help find better ways to treat addicts. The Rural Methamphetamine Education Demonstration Project works with educators and law enforcement to try to alleviate what has become a "scourge" for rural America, Dorgan said. 
   "Meth is a dangerous substance that quickly destroys families and entire communities," Dorgan said. "We've got to find a way to get control of this scourge, to find out why people are drawn to it, how to keep them away, and how to help them recover once they've used it. This program is one piece of that puzzle." 
   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan has secured $2.45 million for the Rural Methampethamine Education Demonstration Project since Fiscal Year 2002. Since he launched the Red River Valley Research Corridor in 2002, Dorgan has directed more than $225 million to the state's universities.
