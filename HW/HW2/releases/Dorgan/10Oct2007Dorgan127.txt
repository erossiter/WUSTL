SEN. DORGAN HAILS HOUSE VOTE TO BAR IRS FROM OUTSOURCING TAX DEBT COLLECTIONS, CALLS FOR SWIFT SENATE ACTION
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called for a prompt Senate floor vote on legislation (H.R. 3056) approved by the U.S. House Wednesday that would repeal the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to outsource federal tax debt collections to private companies.  
   Dorgan is the lead sponsor of similar legislation in the Senate, S. 335. His bill has 22 co-sponsors. Like the House bill approved Wednesday, it would prohibit the IRS from outsourcing tax debt collections to private companies. Dorgan's bill would also immediately halt the program. 
   "There is ample evidence that private debt collectors cost more and collect less than professional IRS employees do, and often engage in abusive practices," Dorgan added. "That's before we even begin to consider the question of whether the IRS should be turning over confidential, personal tax information to private companies. We need to stop this program. Today's action by the House of Representatives demonstrates that doing so is clearly within reach." 
   Dorgan noted that the IRS is responsible for collecting taxes and for protecting the confidentiality of every American's tax information. "When it turns confidential taxpayer information over to private firms and asks them to collect federal taxes, the IRS fails to meet both of those responsibilities," Dorgan said.
