SEN. DORGAN RESTORES FUNDING FOR UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee has voted to restore funding for United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) in Bismarck. 
   For the sixth year in a row, the Bush Administration proposed cutting Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funding for UTTC, a move that would have forced the school to shut its doors. Dorgan, a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, restored the funding in the subcommittee's Fiscal Year 2008 appropriations bill, which it approved Tuesday.
   "United Tribes Technical College has proven itself an important institution for American Indian education," Dorgan said. "I don't know why the President decides to try to cut this funding every year, but each year Congress has made clear that this is an important institution that deserves federal support. Thousands of students have passed through its doors on the way to successful careers, and this will make sure that many more will follow."
   The funding was included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Interior Appropriations bill, which goes next to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for consideration.
