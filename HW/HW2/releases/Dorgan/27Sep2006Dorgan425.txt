SEN. DORGAN SAYS HANNAH PORT OF ENTRY WILL MAINTAIN LONGER HOURS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection has scrapped its plan to reduce hours at the Hannah Port of Entry. Dorgan said the announcement is good news for communities in Cavalier County that depend on the port for economic activity. 
   The Hannah Port of Entry is open from 9 AM to 10 PM. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced last month it planned to reduce those hours to 9 AM to 5 PM.
   Dorgan met Saturday with residents of Langdon, North Dakota, and the surrounding area, who said the reduced hours at the Hannah port would hurt the local economy and could lead to a permanent shut-down. But after consultation with Canadian officials, U.S. Customs officials have decided not to change the hours, Dorgan said.
   "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has told me they have scrapped their plan to reduce hours at the Hannah Port of Entry and they don't expect that to change," Dorgan said. "That's good news for communities in northern North Dakota that depend on Hannah for commerce and recreation. I'll continue to monitor this situation to ensure the ports of entry are properly serving our communities along North Dakota's northern border."
