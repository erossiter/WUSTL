NORTH DAKOTA AWARDED NEARLY $25 MILLION FOR AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION PROGRAMS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy today announced that North Dakota has been awarded more than $24.8 million for several technical assistance and voluntary conservation programs for rural lands. 
   "This major investment in the effective management of private lands will help North Dakota family farmers develop conservation plans and make effective decisions on their land use," the delegation said. "These funds will help protect land, water and wildlife; enhance long-term farm and ranch productivity; and improve profitability." 
   The funds will be used for several U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs including: 
   * The Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which helps farmers and ranchers improve soil, air, and water quality on private lands. 
   * The Ground and Surface Water Conservation, to help improve water use efficiency and conserve ground and surface water. 
   * The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, offering technical and financial assistance to create, restore and enhance wildlife habitat. 
   * The Farm and Ranchland Protection Program, a voluntary program providing matching funds to state and local governments and other organizations to purchase conservation easements on farm and ranch lands. 
   The grants were awarded by USDA with funds appropriated by Congress.
