SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO FIGHT METH USE ON AMERICAN INDIAN RESERVATIONS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced legislation Thursday to help fight methamphetamine production and use on rural American Indian reservations. Dorgan said he is confident that the bill, which won Senate approval in the last Congress, has a good chance of winning approval in both chambers.  
   Dorgan, chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, is sponsoring the legislation with a bipartisan group of senators including John McCain (R-AZ) and Harry Reid (D-NV). Dorgan said the bill would make tribal governments and U.S. territories eligible for grant programs and federal funding that will help fight a "scourge" that has spread across rural America. 
   "Meth is a scourge that has affected many communities on our reservations and across rural America, and this bill will help bring the resources to these areas to put a stop to it," Dorgan said. "This is a dangerous drug that tears apart families and communities and we need to provide more resources for law enforcement and treatment programs, including increased bed space." 
   Dorgan steered the bill through the Senate last year, but the House did not approve the legislation before Congress adjourned. Dorgan called a hearing on meth on reservations last spring, and invited Karrie Azure, who coordinates the United Tribes Multi-Tribal Indian Drug and Alcohol Initiative at United Tribes Technical College. Azure testified that approximately 90 percent of individuals entering treatment programs at Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota are there because of methamphetamines, and said more resources are needed to fight the effects of a drug that is ravaging tribal communities.
