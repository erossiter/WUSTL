SEN. DORGAN SECURES COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS NOMINATION, CALLS FOR SWIFT CONFIRMATION BY SENATE
  The Senate Indian Affairs Committee unanimously approved Thursday the nomination of Carl J. Artman to be Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, and Committee Chairman Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called for a swift confirmation by the full Senate.  
   Dorgan commended Artman, a member of the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin, for his work on Indian issues and urged the nominee to "use the position to make a difference" for tribes across the country. The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs heads the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior. 
   "I'm pleased that we could move this nomination out of the committee, and I will push to make sure confirmation comes quickly from the entire Senate," Dorgan said. 
   "It is shameful, considering the serious problems we face in Indian Country, that the BIA has not had permanent leadership for nearly two years. We need to get the new Assistant Secretary in place so we can address the genuine crises our Native Americans face in education, health care, housing and a number of other issues."
