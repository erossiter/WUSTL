DELEGATION ANNOUNCES $650,000 FOR TRENTON COMMUNITY CLINIC
  Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan, and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy today announced that the Trenton Indian Service Area has been awarded a $650,000 grant to expand services at its community health clinic. 
   The Trenton, North Dakota, facility is one of 105 nationwide recipients of these grants, which are intended to create or expand community health centers, migrant health centers or health care facilities serving the homeless. The centers deliver primary or preventive health care services to their patients. 
   "We hope this grant will go a long way in helping to boost health care resources at the Trenton Community Clinic," the delegation said in a joint statement. "While the importance of addressing Indian health care issues cannot be overstated, it seems funding is always in short supply. These added resources are a welcome addition for the people of Trenton who rely on the clinic to meet their basic health care needs." 
   The grant was awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services with funds appropriated by Congress.
