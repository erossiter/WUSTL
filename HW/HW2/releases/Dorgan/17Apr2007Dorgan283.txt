SEN. DORGAN OPPOSES PROPOSED XM-SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO MERGER
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, issued the following statement Tuesday, announcing his opposition to the proposed merger of the XM and Sirius Satellite radio systems.  
   Text of the statement follows: 
   The proposed merger between XM and Sirius satellite radio companies cannot possibly be in the interest of American consumers. 
   A decade ago, two licenses were issued, one to XM and one to Sirius, to provide competing national satellite radio service. Included in their license approval was a clause that prohibits the two companies from merging into one company. 
   Now, a decade later, the two companies are seeking permission from the federal government to merge. 
   I oppose the merger. It will eliminate the competition that exists between the two separate companies and it will injure consumers. This isn't even a close call. 
   I am concerned about the increased concentration of ownership in virtually every area of broadcasting and information including radio, television and newspapers. 
   To believe that it is in the public interest to allow a merger of the only two satellite radio companies defies all common sense. The marketplace works when there are competitive forces that require competitors to compete in price and service. 
   The proposed merger of XM and Sirius would destroy the incentives that come from that competition and would, in my opinion, inevitably harm consumers.
