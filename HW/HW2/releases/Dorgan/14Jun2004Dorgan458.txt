SEN. DORGAN URGES CUSTOMS OFFICIAL TO CHOOSE GRAND FORKS FOR NEW BORDER SECURITY AIR WING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met recently with a key Department of Homeland Security official to urge him to locate one of five new northern border protection air branches in the city of Grand Forks.  
   Each branch would employ 28 agents and would represent an $80 million investment in homeland security aimed at better safeguarding the nation's northern border. 
   The branches will serve as hubs for airplanes and crews charged with monitoring the nation's northern border and responding to any border security breach within an hour's radius. Two of the five sites already have been chosen and are set to begin operating this year. 
   Dorgan told Charles Stallworth, director of Air and Marine Operations at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that Grand Forks is a practical choice for one of the other branches because of its location, and its existing airfields and flight training facilities. 
   Grand Forks is a major center for flight training, with UND's John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences training more than 1,000 airplane pilots a year and the school's program that brings West Point cadets to UND for helicopter training. 
   "The city of Grand Forks has the potential to play an important role in securing our nation's northern border against terrorist threats and other illegal activity," Dorgan said. "With its central location along the border, the first-class Grand Forks Air Base, a commercial airport and superb air training facilities at UND, Grand Forks is the ideal location for one of these new homeland security air wings." 
   The decision on where the remaining three new branches will be located isn't expected for some time, but Dorgan said he'd continue pressing Homeland Security officials on the "many obvious advantages of choosing Grand Forks."
