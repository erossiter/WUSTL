   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN (D-ND) 
  NOVEMBER 9, 2005
   "It was a foolish mistake for the Amtrak board of directors to fire President David Gunn today. This move has nothing to do with performance and everything to do with politics. 
   "David Gunn has done a great job as president of Amtrak. He has experience. He is qualified. He is nobody's crony. 
   "The President proposed in his budget to cut all funding for Amtrak. But Congress disagreed, and we have supported full funding. Amtrak is an important part of our transportation system, and we need to have passenger trains running through places like North Dakota. 
   "David Gunn also understands that America ought to have a national rail system, and one that runs well. This didn't sit well with the White House and the Secretary of Transportation, and so they had the board of directors fire him. 
   "That was a huge mistake for our country. David Gunn did a first-rate job as head of Amtrak. Shame on those who made this decision."
