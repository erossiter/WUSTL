SEN. DORGAN HEARS LOCAL IMPACT OF PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS TO SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met Wednesday with nonprofit groups from the Bismarck area to discuss the impact the President's proposed budget would have on their efforts in the community, saying he would take the accounts he heard back to Washington to fight the Administration's efforts to cut funding for important social service programs.  
   Dorgan invited Bismarck-area nonprofits to the meeting, held at the North Dakota State Capitol, to provide him with an update on their activities and to discuss the President's Fiscal Year 2007 budget proposal. The groups shared how programs slated for reduction or elimination in Bush's budget would affect North Dakotans who rely on them for education and training, domestic abuse support, child care programs and more. 
   Dorgan said he too is concerned about the impact of the cuts, and said he plans to use the examples he hears today when making the case to his colleagues in Congress that funds for many social service programs are essential and should be restored. He also urged the groups to organize an opposition effort to the proposed budget cuts and point out the devastating effects they would have on programs that help the poor, elderly, disabled and other disadvantaged groups. 
   "It's inappropriate to give giant tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent while slashing student loan programs, Medicare and Medicaid and other social services programs," Dorgan said. "The people here today will see most closely this budget's effect on our most needy. I will do my part to fight these proposals in Congress, and it's important that you become active and organize to show the Administration and their allies that we won't tolerate these irresponsible budget priorities."
