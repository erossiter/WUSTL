SEN. DORGAN REQUESTS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TO MAKE CASE FOR DISASTER RELIEF
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is leading a bipartisan group of senators requesting a meeting with the President to discuss the urgent need for a federal agriculture disaster bill.  
   Dorgan, Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and 15 other Republican and Democratic senators signed a letter Tuesday asking for a meeting with the President, who has blocked efforts to help producers by threatening to veto legislation containing disaster relief. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has added disaster assistance to a number of appropriations bills. Each time, House Republican leaders, acting at the behest of the President, have refused to approve it. In August, Dorgan, Conrad, and Congressman Earl Pomeroy invited President Bush to come to North Dakota to see the impact of the drought firsthand. Dorgan has also introduced legislation to re-establish a permanent disaster assistance disaster aid program. 
   "The President has blocked disaster relief for family farmers and ranchers over the last two years, and the fact is we need to convince him it's urgently needed if we're going to get help to them," Dorgan said. "I hope the President will at least hear our case. We have family farmers in North Dakota and across the nation who have been hit with weather-related disasters, and who, if they don't get some help, will lose their family farm. I hope this meeting will help us find some common ground and convince him to lend a hand to the producers across America that have been hit by weather-related disasters."
