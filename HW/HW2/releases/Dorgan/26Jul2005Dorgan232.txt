ENERGY BILL INCLUDES PROVISION THAT WILL BOOST ETHANOL MARKET, SEN. DORGAN SAYS
  A provision in the energy bill adopted Monday night by a House-Senate Conference Committee will provide a big boost to North Dakota's ethanol industry, said Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND), a member of the conference committee. 
   Dorgan said the committee agreed to accept his proposal for a national "Renewable Fuels Standard," which requires refiners to produce and use at least 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol in their gasoline blends annually by 2012. U.S. consumers currently use about 3.6 billion gallons of ethanol per year. The requirement will add substantial value to North Dakota's grains and spur economic development in the state's ethanol and biodiesel industries, Dorgan said. 
   "This requirement will provide a big boost to the ethanol industry," Dorgan said. "I expect that in the next six years, we will see more and more ethanol plants in North Dakota that will allow for additional markets for agricultural products." 
   North Dakota currently has two ethanol plants. Four more ethanol plants and one biodiesel fuel plant are planned. Each facility would employ about 40 workers. An expansion of ethanol production would mean a significant boost in economic opportunity in the state. 
   "Even with the good news about ethanol, I'm disappointed that the House majority stripped some of the provisions from the bill that would have gone farther in reducing our dependence on foreign energy sources," Dorgan said. "I believe it is critical from a homeland security standpoint to do more, not less, to end that addiction to foreign oil." 
   The energy bill goes next to the House floor and then to the Senate floor, where members will vote on the compromise struck by the Conference Committee.
