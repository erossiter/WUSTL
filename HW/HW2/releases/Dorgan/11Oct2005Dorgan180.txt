SEN. DORGAN PRESENTS $200,000 GIANT CHECK FOR NEW INTERPRETIVE CENTER AT FORT ABERCROMBIE HISTORIC SITE
  Standing on the site of this 19th century military fort, Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) presented a check representing the $200,000 in federal funds he secured to build a visitors center at the site, saying the park and its staff have played a significant role in preserving North Dakota's rich history for future generations. 
   Dorgan is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, enabling him to direct federal funds to North Dakota projects seeking federal funding. 
   The Senator said the funding will be used to enhance the fort's ability to tell visitors a story of early North Dakota by reconstructing a commissary storehouse, which will serve as an interpretive facility and include a visitors' center. 
   "The history at Fort Abercrombie is worth preserving for our children and our grandchildren, and I was proud to work in the Senate to bring a new interpretive center to this site," Dorgan said. "Nothing quite tells a story like visiting the actual site of historical significance, and that's what I hope we are helping to do today."
