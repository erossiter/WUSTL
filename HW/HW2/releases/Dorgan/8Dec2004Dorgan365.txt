DELEGATION ANNOUNCES $14 MILLION IN HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS FOR NORTH DAKOTA
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy announced Wednesday that North Dakota will receive more than $14 million in homeland security funding to help local communities prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. The funding, totaling $14,376,200, will help state and local agencies prepare to deal with chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive weapons, and cyber threats. 
   "Local emergency workers are on the front line of protecting rural America," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Like big cities, rural America has potential targets that we need to protect. These funds will help North Dakota communities meet that responsibility." 
   The funding represents a significant victory for the delegation, which strongly objected to an Administration plan to cut homeland security funds by 75 percent for North Dakota. The President's plan would have shifted about $11 million away from North Dakota to states with greater populations. Dorgan, Conrad and Pomeroy noted that the $11 million the President proposed taking from North Dakota would have allowed just one additional dollar per person for the state of New York - adding very little to that state's homeland security picture. It would have, however, nearly wiped out North Dakota's homeland security efforts. 
   In the end, Congress rejected the Administration proposal. 
   The grants will be awarded by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness.
