SEN. DORGAN SAYS DOT GIVES FINAL APPROVAL TO AIR SRVICE ROUTE CHANGES TO JAMESTOWN AND DEVILS LAKE
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday that the Department of Transportation has approved a plan, negotiated by Dorgan, to improve Northwest Airlines services to Jamestown and Devils Lake. This was the final step needed to allow the plan to proceed. 
   Dorgan worked for several months with local officials and the airline to get a direct flight between Minneapolis/St. Paul and Jamestown and to link Jamestown and Devils Lake. The changes will take place in May and tickets for the new flights have already gone on sale. 
   "This was the green light that we needed to make these changes a reality," Dorgan said. "People in Jamestown and Devils Lake will now have a quicker, more convenient route to Minneapolis and points beyond. This is good news for travelers to and from these two cities, which, in turn, will be good for their economies." 
   Dorgan said Northwest Airlines will create flights from Minneapolis/St. Paul to Jamestown and on to Devils Lake and flights leaving from Devils Lake to Jamestown and on to Minneapolis/St. Paul. 
   The approval of the Department of Transportation makes the new route official.
