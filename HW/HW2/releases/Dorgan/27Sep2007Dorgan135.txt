SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES NEW KEYNOTE SPEAKER FOR GREAT PLAINS TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday the Great Plains Technology Conference and Trade Show in Fargo will feature a keynote speech from the director of the high-tech federal laboratory that was the birthplace of the Internet and many other advanced technologies. 
   Anthony J. Tether, Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), will deliver a speech at the first day of the Technology Conference, which will be held October 8 and 9 at the Fargodome. Tether replaces CNN anchor Lou Dobbs, who was forced to cancel his appearance due to medical issues.
   Tether has served as Director of DARPA since 2001 after a long career in both the private sector and government service.
   "Dr. Tether has significant experience working with technology and business, and he is now overseeing some of the most cutting-edge research in the world," Dorgan said. "I think his voice will be an important addition to the Technology Conference and I look forward to hearing his keynote address."
