SEN. DORGAN SAYS SLIGHT DROP IN TRADE DEFICIT IN FEBRUARY NO CAUSE FOR VICTORY DANCE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday some may hail the decline in the monthly trade deficit in February 2006 as a success, but in his judgment it is "no cause for a victory dance by anyone." 
   "We shouldn't lose track of the fact that in all the years of record-keeping, only two months have produced higher U.S. trade deficits and that we are still on track for an annual trade deficit that is likely to be at least 10 percent higher than last year's record annual trade deficit," Dorgan said. "It's nice to see it go down for once, but we still have a massive problem and the annual trend line is still headed in exactly the wrong direction."
   The U.S. Commerce Department announced on Wednesday that the February 2006 trade deficit reached $65.7 billion, down from January's record level of $68.5 billion, but still the third highest ever.
   "What today's announcement means is that we are still piling up $2 billion in trade deficits every single day," Dorgan said. "We're still selling America piece by and piece and continuing to ship American jobs overseas. The fundamental problems brought about by flawed and failed trade policies continue to create huge trade deficits and the potential for real economic difficulties if we don't turn them around."
