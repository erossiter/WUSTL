SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES BILL TO PREVENT IRS FROM UNFAIRLY INCREASING TAXES ON CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM RENTAL PAYMENTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), along with Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS) and a bipartisan group of Senators, introduced legislation Wednesday to prevent the IRS from unfairly increasing taxes on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) rental payments.  
   The IRS has proposed a rule to require active and retired farmers to pay self-employment taxes on CRP payments that could be applied retroactively to past tax years. These farmers currently receive annual CRP rental payments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in exchange for taking environmentally sensitive lands out of farm production. 
   "The IRS's proposed rule flies in the face of what Congress clearly intended - these CRP payments should be treated as rental payments, not self-employment income," said Dorgan. "Farmers depend on CRP payments and they should not be forced to pay more taxes. This bill will send a signal to the IRS that their proposal is wrong and inappropriate." 
   Today, North Dakota has some 3.4 million acres with about $112 million in rental payments in the CRP program. Left intact, the IRS's ruling would mean that farmers in North Dakota may owe an additional $16 million in federal taxes this coming year. A typical North Dakota farmer with 160 acres of CRP would owe nearly $750 in new self-employment taxes because of the agency's ill-advised position. 
   In February, IRS Commissioner Mark Everson responded to a letter Senator Dorgan and his colleagues sent objecting to the IRS's proposal. Commissioner Everson told Senator Dorgan and his colleagues in a letter that the IRS would not change its position on CRP payments unless Congress passed new statutory language clarifying that CRP payments are to be treated as rental payments.
