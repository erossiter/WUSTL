SEN. DORGAN SAYS HIRING OF NEW SULLYS HILL RANGER IS BOOST FOR DEVILS LAKE, STATE TOURISM INDUSTRY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Thursday applauded the hiring of a permanent, full-time ranger at Sullys Hill National Game Preserve near Devils Lake, allowing the facility to remain open year-round.  
   Dorgan pushed the Fish and Wildlife Service last year to fill its vacant position at Sullys Hill, saying the preserve is an important educational and recreational destination for the Devils Lake area. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, said he would work in the meantime to direct more funding to the Fish and Wildlife Service budget, which had instituted a hiring freeze due to lack of funding. 
   "I'm pleased that the Fish and Wildlife Service was able to do the right thing here and add staff that will allow Sullys Hill to remain open year-round," Dorgan said. "Sullys Hill is one of the treasures of North Dakota's outdoors and an important resource for local residents and our state's tourism industry. We need to do all we can to make sure it is open and accessible to the public." 
   In 2005, 60,000 people from 44 States, 4 Canadian Provinces and 9 foreign countries visited the preserve.
