 Earl Pomeroy today announced that the Grand Forks consulting firm CEO Praxis Inc. has been awarded a federal grant of $296,000 to help rural businesses connect with investors, technology leaders and potential business partners to build on the growing success of the Red River Valley Research Corridor. 
   In a two-year pilot program, CEO Praxis will assess the region's trade and technology links and help arrange events such as technology summits to help rural communities benefit from the economic opportunities created by the Research Corridor. 
   "In today's high-tech, rapidly changing business environment, rural entrepreneurs face special challenges," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This grant will help provide some of the tools and connections rural businesses need to succeed in the Red River Valley Research Corridor, make the most of today's opportunities, expand the local economy and create good jobs." 
   "Connecting rural businesses, colleges and universities with science and technology-based resources and the robust markets in metro areas is key to success in today's knowledge economy," said CEO Praxis Founder and President Delore Zimmerman.
   The Small Business Innovation Research grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture with funds appropriated by Congress.
