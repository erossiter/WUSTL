SEN. DORGAN SAYS DISASTER AID FOR NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS LIKELY TO TOP $200 MILLION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday the emergency disaster aid package he and Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) helped move through the U.S. Senate last week could bring $200 million to $250 million for North Dakota farmers this year, according to preliminary estimates.  
   Dorgan made the estimate in a speech to about 50 National Farmers Union members from North Dakota who were in Washington, D.C., for their annual "fly-in" to meet with federal lawmakers. They discussed agriculture legislation, including disaster aid, country-of-origin labeling, and trade issues. The NFU also presented Dorgan with its "Golden Triangle" award for his leadership in the U.S. Senate on farm issues. 
   Dorgan said the estimate is based on information from state and federal agriculture officials, current damage levels, and a review of recent farm disasters in the state and levels of reimbursement in those instances that were covered by similar disaster legislation for the 2001 and 2002 seasons. 
   "North Dakota farmers received about $230 million for losses suffered in 2001 and 2002," Dorgan said. "By all indications, this year's triple disasters of flooding, drought and frost caused at least as much harm. We still have some roadblocks to the disaster aid even though it is now through the U.S. Senate. I intend to fight hard to get through the Congress in the coming weeks." 
   Last week, the Senate approved a disaster aid measure sponsored by Dorgan, Conrad and others that will provide about $2.9 billion nationwide in emergency aid for farmers and ranchers. Next, a joint House-Senate Conference Committee will consider the underlying bill, the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2005, possibly as soon as this month.
