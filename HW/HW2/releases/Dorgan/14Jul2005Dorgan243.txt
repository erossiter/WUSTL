SEN. DORGAN UNVEILS FIRST-EVER LIST OF CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITIES FOR AMERICAN INDIANS
  Flanked by fellow Senate colleagues and three of the nation's top tribal leaders, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Thursday rolled out the first-ever comprehensive set of federal policy recommendations for Indian Country, developed through ongoing consultation with Native American leaders across the nation.  
   Dorgan has worked throughout his career to support American Indian communities and was instrumental in putting together a set of recommendations to Congress that address issues of importance to Native Americans. The top five priorities were developed last fall through discussions among Senate Democrats and tribal leaders at the first-ever Senate Democratic Native American Forum. Dorgan unveiled the finished product at a press conference with Senators Tim Johnson (D-SD) and John Kerry (D-MA), as well as Tex Hall, Chairman of the Three Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota and President of the National Congress of American Indians; Charles Colombe, President of the Rosebud Sioux Tribes in South Dakota; and Hope MacDonald-LoneTree, Chair of the Public Safety Committee for the Navajo Nation. 
   "This is the first-ever Senate blueprint for addressing the unique and pressing needs that face Native Americans in North Dakota and across the country. We have a bona fide crisis in education, housing and health care on our reservations in this country," Dorgan said. "These policy recommendations provide a strategic approach to dealing with them once and for all. And I am proud that the conclusions we reached in this project were in cooperation between lawmakers and Indian leaders." 
   The top five priorities for American Indians, as agreed upon at the Forum, were: 
   * Trust Reform, Land and Natural Resources. The United States should work to improve its spotty record as trustee of lands, resources and funds of American Indian tribes, and consult with tribes on decisions that impact their land and natural resources. 
   * Health Care. Indians have a life expectancy that is nearly four years less than the overall U.S. population. Indians are 650% more likely to die from tuberculosis, 318% more likely to die from diabetes and 204% more likely to suffer accidental death. 
   * Education. Indians are half as likely as the overall population to graduate from college. Congress should clarify education laws, fully fund American Indian schools, and address teacher quality and recruitment efforts. 
   * Housing, Infrastructure and Economic Development. There is a serious shortage of adequate housing on Indian reservations; and a vast backlog of roads are in need of construction and maintenance. Telecommunications and water infrastructure is also far behind in Indian Country, and tax code reform is needed to spur the economy. 
   * Justice, Law Enforcement and Homeland Security. Congress should act to strengthen protections for women, and to help fund tribal police and criminal detention efforts. Tribal first responders should also be eligible to receive funding directly from the Department of Homeland Security. 
   The five priorities, and their accompanying policy recommendations, will be turned into legislative initiatives in Congress, Dorgan said. 
   "This is only the start, but it's a good start," Dorgan said.
