DELEGATION ASKS BUSH TO DISCUSS CAFTA IMPACT WITH FAMILY FARMERS DURING VISIT TO NORTH DAKOTA
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy Tuesday asked President Bush to meet with Red River Valley family farmers, particularly those who grow sugar beets, during his trip to Fargo Thursday. The delegation said that at the meeting, the President could hear concerns about the how the pending Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) would impact the futures of family farmers, plant workers and Main Street businesses in the region. 
   In a letter to President Bush, the North Dakota delegation said CAFTA is the first step to dismantling the nation's sugar program, which operates successfully and at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. CAFTA would also open the door to future trade agreements that threaten to flood our domestic market with additional cheap foreign sugar, they said. 
   "Under CAFTA, the Central American nations would have increased access to America's sugar market at a time when our sugar market is already oversupplied," the delegation wrote. 
   The sugar beet industry "provides thousands of jobs and more than two billion dollars in economic activity for North Dakota," they wrote. "Sugar beets are one of the most important crops our family farmers produce." 
   "The citizens of North Dakota rarely have the opportunity to hear directly from their President," the delegation continued. "We hope that while you are visiting Fargo you will take the opportunity to meet with a small group of family farmers to hear their concerns about the impact CAFTA will have on their futures."
