   TEXT OF STATEMENT 
  BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  February 11, 2005
   President Bush's threat to veto legislation that would allow for the reimportation of lower-priced prescription drugs or that would allow the government to directly negotiate lower drug prices from the pharmaceutical industry on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries is a major blow to American consumers who are asking for fair prices on prescription drugs. 
   I wish the President was tough enough to stand up to the prescription drug industry and stand with American consumers. 
   The President knows that Europe has allowed the reimportation of prescription drugs for over two decades without a safety problem. And the President knows that in other areas of the federal government we have successfully negotiated with the pharmaceutical industry for lower prices. 
   It's very disappointing to see this Administration refuse to stand up for the interest of American consumers in the face of pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. I believe on these two issues the Congress is going to do the right thing, despite the threat of a presidential veto.
