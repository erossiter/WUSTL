SEN. DORGAN ASKS TOP DEFENSE OFFICIALS ABOUT MEDAL OF HONOR FOR WOODROW WILSON KEEBLE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) talked to both Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England during hearings yesterday and today about the status of a Medal of Honor recommendation for the late Woodrow Wilson Keeble, a World War II and Korean War veteran from North Dakota.  
   In a hearing today of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan told Deputy Secretary of Defense England that the Medal of Honor for Keeble, a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribe from Wahpeton, North Dakota, who served in World War II and Korea, was approved by the Secretary of the Army and sent to the Secretary of Defense last year for final approval. 
   It's been nearly a year since that action took place, and Dorgan asked Secretary Gates and Deputy Secretary England to look into the status of the matter and encouraged that a decision be made. 
   "Woodrow Wilson Keeble was an American Indian from our part of the country who served with great valor in two wars," Dorgan said. "He was engaged in one heroic battle in Korea for which he was recommended the Medal of Honor, but the papers were lost. He was later recommended again for the medal and it has turned into a very lengthy process. 
   "It's not for me to decided who gets medals of honor, but I hope the Defense Department will make a decision on this soon and honor this great soldier's memory." 
   It was on Oct. 20, 1951, when Keeble - acting single-handedly and while stricken with multiple wounds - crawled through heavy enemy fire and took out three four-man machine gun bunkers and two trenches of enemy troops and saved the lives of dozens of soldiers who had been pinned down. 
   "I hope the Defense Department will honor the memory of this brave soldier," Dorgan said.
