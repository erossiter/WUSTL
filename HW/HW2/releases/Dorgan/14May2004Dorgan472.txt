DELEGATION ANNOUNCES $14 MILLION GRANT FOR QUENTIN BURDICK JOB CORPS CENTER
  The Quentin Burdick Job Corps Center in Minot, North Dakota, has been awarded a two-year grant of $14,466,616 from the U.S. Department of Labor, Sens.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND), and Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) announced Friday. 
   The Job Corps helps young people between 16 and 24 develop vocational and interpersonal skills and obtain a GED or High School Diploma while learning technical training skills necessary to compete in today's job market. 
   "The Quentin Burdick Center has a long record of helping people build skills and develop independence while contributing to their communities, and this grant will help the Center continue its good work," the delegation said in a joint statement. 
   Earlier this year, the National Job Corps Association honored Dorgan, Conrad and Pomeroy at a ceremony on Capitol Hill for their work in Congress in support of the Job Corps and on behalf of the Quentin Burdick Center.
