NORTH DAKOTA SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD, REP. POMEROY ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $864,000 FOR PRAIRIE PUBLIC DIGITAL CONVERSION
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy announced Thursday that Prairie Public Broadcasting in Fargo, North Dakota, will receive two grants totaling more than $864,000 to convert from analog to digital transmission. 
   The first grant of $489,124 is directed to Prairie Public to upgrade its statewide digital microwave radio equipment to improve system reliability and maintenance. 
   The second grant, which totals $374,989, will fund the first part of a project to transition Prairie Public's broadcasting operations from an analog plant to a digital plant. The second part of the project will involve expanding the video server to help eliminate the need for videotape machines in on-air broadcasting. 
   Prairie Public is one of 37 local public television and radio stations around the country that is receiving funding in this latest round of digital conversion grant distribution. This grant is part of the nearly $220 million in funding that Congress has provided to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. For the past six years, this funding has helped both public radio and public television stations convert from analog to digital transmission. 
   "Public radio and television provide a unique, educational broadcasting role in local communities all across this country," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Making the upgrades necessary to keep up with the latest in technology is an expensive venture. We are pleased that Prairie Public will receive this additional funding to help them make the leap to a digital system."
