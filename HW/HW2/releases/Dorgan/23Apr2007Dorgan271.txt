SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES HOUSE, SENATE AGREE ON PLAN THAT MAY SPEED UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS DEPLOYMENT TO GRAND FORKS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday he has secured a provision in the final version of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that should speed the deployment of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to Grand Forks, North Dakota. 
   Dorgan, a member of the House-Senate conference committee that negotiated the final version of the bill, pushed to include funding that will allow the Air Force to purchase 30 more Predator unmanned aircraft, some of which may be based at Grand Forks Air Force Base and operated by the Happy Hooligans of the North Dakota Air National Guard. Dorgan worked with Senator Kent Conrad, Congressman Earl Pomeroy and the Air Force to bring the UAS mission to North Dakota's military bases.
   Dorgan said the bill also includes $120 million for equipment at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The funding will help speed delivery of equipment at the nation's Northern Border Air Wing sites, including the UAS that the Department of Homeland Security will base at the Grand Forks branch. The Air Wing at Grand Forks has already begun limited operations, but it will eventually grow to include several dozen staff members that operate surveillance and interdiction missions with helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and UAS.
   "The deployment of unmanned aircraft systems is an important step in our effort to secure our northern borders and modernize our military," Dorgan said. "This agreement between the House and Senate will help direct resources to get these programs going and help improve our nation's security. It will also boost the economy of the Grand Forks area."
