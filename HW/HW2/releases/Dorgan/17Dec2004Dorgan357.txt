SEN. DORGAN SAYS NEW RECORD TRADE DEFICIT COULD DERAIL CAFTA RATIFICATION EFFORT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday reports that the U.S. trade deficit grew to a record level in October could "derail" the Administration's effort to win Senate ratification of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).  
 "I think Sens. are going to ask why we should ratify another trade agreement that is just like those that came before it, when the old agreements are producing nothing but record trade deficits month after month," Sen. Dorgan said. 
   "There was a lot of official rejoicing last month when the monthly trade deficit dipped slightly." Dorgan added. "Some of us, however, pointed out that trade deficit was still the third biggest in history, and warned that the dip was only temporary. Sadly, the new October figures confirm that view. In October, America had the biggest trade deficit in the history of any nation in the world. Clearly, things are not getting better. The same old trade policies are having the same old result: bigger U.S. trade deficits, and a weaker dollar in international trade." 
   "America needs to fundamentally reform its trade policies and start standing up for U.S. producers. Racking up a record trade deficit nearly every month is simply not an acceptable path for our country," Dorgan said.
