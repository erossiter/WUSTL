SEN. DORGAN SAYS NORTH DAKOTA SET TO LEAD WAY TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) told members of the Central Power Electric Cooperative here Wednesday that, with its abundant natural resources, North Dakota is positioned to lead the charge for energy security as our nation works to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. 
   Dorgan, who chairs two key energy-related subcommittees in the U.S. Senate, said North Dakota's abundant and diverse energy resources are boosting the region's economy and helping move the nation toward energy independence. But the state has the ability to do even more with its wind, coal, oil, biomass and other resources, he said.
   "We have an abundance of energy resources in North Dakota, which positions us to create a long-term economic foundation in our state as our country works to become more energy independent," Dorgan said. "But we have more work to do. It's important that we wean this country off foreign sources of energy, and I'm going to keep pushing to make sure North Dakota plays a central role in developing our domestic energy resources."
   Among Dorgan's efforts to boost the North Dakota energy industry are the following:
   * The creation of the Great Plains Energy Corridor Coordinating Office. Much like the Research Corridor that is based in the eastern part of the state, the Energy Corridor will work with energy researchers and industry to develop new and innovative ways to increase production, invest in the region's energy infrastructure, and develop new energy sources specific to the Northern Great Plains. 
   * Dorgan convinced the U.S. Geological Survey to complete a survey of the resources in the Bakken Shale oil fields in North Dakota and Montana. The completed survey could help boost an oil industry that is already doing well in the state, he said. 
   * He has fought for increased production of renewable energy. Dorgan has pushed for more production of wind energy. He also helped write legislation approved last year that will require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels to be used annually by 2022, and has introduced legislation to help make ethanol and other biofuels more available to consumers.
   "If we hope to grow our renewable fuels industry, I believe our state Legislature should pass a renewable fuels standard and invest more in the renewable industry," Dorgan said. "Frankly, our neighboring states have been more aggressive in promoting renewables, and their industry has grown much faster and larger. Our Legislature needs to take similar action to ensure we stay competitive and these new biofuels plants build and bring jobs to our state."
