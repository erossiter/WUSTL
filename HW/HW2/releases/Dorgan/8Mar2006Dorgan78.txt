SEN. DORGAN: LOWER ENERGY PRICES, MORE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION WOULD RESULT FROM BILL PASSED BY ENERGY COMMITTEE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has approved a bill that could help lower natural gas prices in North Dakota and across the country by opening a huge tract in the Gulf of Mexico known as Lease Hold 181 to oil and gas drilling.  
   Dorgan, a member of the committee, is an original cosponsor of the bill, which was introduced in February. Lease Hold 181 lies in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on the Outer Continental Shelf. It was scheduled to be opened for drilling in 2001, but President Bush removed the area from lease consideration. 
   Dorgan said North Dakota's rank as one of the nation's heaviest users per capita of natural gas means the state has much at stake in the bill because an increased supply would lower natural gas prices. The domestic production also would lessen the nation's dangerous dependence on foreign sources of oil, he said. 
   "It is imperative that we start to wean ourselves off the foreign sources of oil and natural gas that have us chained to other parts of the world. There's too much at stake in terms of national security, as well as economic security," Dorgan said. "The committee vote today moves us in the right direction. My hope is that this bill will now be considered by the full Senate, and that it's considered soon, so North Dakotans and others across the country can eventually have some relief on their energy bills." 
   The lease program, which would begin within a year after the bill is passed into law, will bring nearly 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to market in the near future, according to estimates by the Minerals Management Service. That is enough gas to heat nearly 5 million homes for 15 years, according to the American Gas Association.
