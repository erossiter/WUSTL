SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE'LL HOLD HEARINGS, PUSH FOR TARIFFS IF KOREA CONTINUES BLOCKING U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday the United States cannot accept actions by South Korea to block the importation of American beef. Dorgan urged Trade Representative Susan Schwab to find a way to resolve the issue, and said he will pursue hearings and legislation to fix the problem if South Korea persists in using baseless excuses to block U.S. imports.  
   Dorgan, who is expected to chair the Senate Commerce Subcommittee with jurisdiction over trade issues in the new Congress, pressed South Korea to re-open its borders to American beef after it implemented a lengthy, unjustified ban that ended in October. Since then, Korean officials have rejected all three shipments of U.S. beef - supposedly because visual inspections found bone fragments, some as small as half the size of a grain of rice, in the shipments. 
   Before South Korea implemented its ban on American beef, it was the United States' third-largest export market, accounting for more than $800 million in annual exports. 
   "The rejection of these three shipments shows that the South Korean government is not interested in abiding by science-based standards in agricultural trade," Dorgan wrote. "When I talk to ranchers in North Dakota, they ask me why America should continue to accept imports of South Korean automobiles, electronics and other goods if our beef exports are not accepted. I have no good answer for them."
