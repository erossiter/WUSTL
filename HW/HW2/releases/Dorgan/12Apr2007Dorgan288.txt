SEN. DORGAN WILL WORK WITH VA OFFICIALS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR NEW VETERANS HOME IN LISBON
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said he will work through his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has the necessary funding it needs to allow the new Veterans Home in Lisbon to move forward. With the passage of $6.4 million in state funding to fund a new Veterans Home, the VA can now fulfill their commitment Dorgan obtained to provide funding that will cover two-thirds of the total cost to construct a new Veterans Home.  
   Dorgan encouraged state officials to approve state matching funding to allow the VA to move forward with providing funds to build a new Veterans Home. VA officials have assured Dorgan that they will proceed quickly to provide federal funding to replace the Veterans Home, once state officials appropriate matching funds and request federal assistance. 
   "This is an important step forward in securing the necessary funding to replace the Veterans Home in Lisbon," said Dorgan. "This state funding now gives us the opportunity to work with the VA to move forward at the federal level." 
   "While our veterans receive quality care at the Veterans Home, it's clear the facility is in disrepair and has outlived its use. I will continue to work with the Veterans Affairs officials to build a new Veterans Home that our state can be proud of." 
   Senator Dorgan met with Veterans Home officials and North Dakota veterans in Lisbon, North Dakota in March. He brought a staff member from the U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee to tour the home during the visit. 
   Some estimates suggest the construction of a replacement facility would not exceed major investments that would be required to bring the older structure up to code.
