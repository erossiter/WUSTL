   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATORS BYRON DORGAN AND OLYMPIA SNOWE 
   December 29, 2006 
   "Today the FCC achieved a big victory in the preservation of Internet freedom through the imposition of conditions in the AT&T-BellSouth merger that will help maintain an open and neutral Internet. 
   "We particularly commend Commissioners Copps and Adelstein for their tireless efforts on behalf of consumers and the Internet-content community in the face of this enormous merger. We also commend AT&T for their acceptance of net neutrality conditions, demonstrating that business investment and broadband deployment can move ahead and thrive, while maintaining competitive and nondiscriminatory business models. 
   "We look forward to working in Congress in the year ahead to restoring these Internet freedom mandates to the entire broadband industry, ensuring that consumers can continue to receive the benefits of an open and vibrant Internet not only in the short term from AT&T, but from any broadband provider in the longer term."
