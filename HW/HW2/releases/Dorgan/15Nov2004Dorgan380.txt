   "I respect the work that Secretary Veneman did as Secretary of Agriculture. But, we were at odds on a number of issues. She was less aggressive than I would have liked on the writing of a new Farm Bill, as well as on the need to work with us in Congress to get a weather disaster bill this year. However, I respect her service to our country and I wish her well.
   "As the President selects a new Secretary of Agriculture I hope that the nominee will be someone who will not only support the country-of-origin labeling for meat and vegetables but will convince the President to implement it as well. That will increase opportunity for not only farmers and ranchers but also consumers in our country. I also hope the President will nominate someone with a family farm or ranch background.
   "The number of family farmers and ranchers in our country is declining. I hope that the next Agriculture Secretary will be someone who will make the interests of family farmers and ranchers a high priority."
