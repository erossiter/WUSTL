SEN. DORGAN'S COMMITTEE PROVIDES NEARLY $47 MILLION FOR MINOT AIR FORCE BASE CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced Thursday that the Committee voted to approve nearly $47 million in construction projects at Minot Air Force Base.  
   The funds, included in the Military Construction Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2005, includes $37 million for 142 new family housing units on the base. 
   The bill includes $9.9 million for alterations to a multi-purpose hangar for B-52s at Minot Air Force Base. The project includes a 64-foot addition to the front of the existing hangars, allowing full enclosure of the aircraft. The base has 35 B-52s, but only two hangars that provide full enclosures. Because of the harsh weather conditions in Minot, full enclosure of the bombers is important to prevent the need for extensive additional work to prevent mission disruption. 
   "North Dakota's active duty and reserve component facilities have an enormous role in our national security strategy, and these investments speak to the confidence the Senate has in the men and women stationed in the state," Dorgan said. "These long-term investments will add to our nation's readiness and improve the lives of our military personnel and their families for years to come." 
   The bill also provides $26.2 million for 90 family housing units on Grand Forks Air Force Base. 
   For the 119th Fighter Wing (Happy Hooligans) in Fargo, the bill provides $702,000 for planning and design of a new fire/rescue and deployment training facility to improve the base's emergency response capability. 
   The bill goes next to the full Senate for approval.
