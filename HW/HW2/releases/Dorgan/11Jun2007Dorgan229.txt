SEN. DORGAN REQUESTS TIMELINE, ASKS FARM SERVICE AGENCY TO MAKE DELIVERY OF DISASTER RELIEF A TOP PRIORITY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) wrote the federal Farm Service Agency (FSA) Monday to request a timeline for the distribution of disaster relief to family farmers and ranchers under the legislation he pushed through Congress last month. Dorgan asked the FSA to make it a top priority to deliver the federal assistance, which will bring an estimated $150 million in relief to North Dakota producers.  
   In a letter to Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs John A. Johnson, Dorgan pointed out that many producers in North Dakota and across America are relying on the aid to be able to continue farming. He said that he knows it will take some time for the FSA to administer the disaster relief, but he hopes the agency will make the process a top priority. 
   "Our family farmers and ranchers have been waiting a long time for some relief from the weather-related disasters they've suffered, and this aid will literally make all the difference for some family farmers," Dorgan wrote. 
   Dorgan introduced the agriculture disaster package along with Senator Kent Conrad, and he had previously attached it to several appropriations bills, only to see the President and his allies in Congress repeatedly strip it from the moving legislation. When the new majority assumed control of the Congress this year, Dorgan was able to include the disaster relief in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that has now been signed into law.
