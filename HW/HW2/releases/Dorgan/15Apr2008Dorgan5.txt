   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   April 15, 2008
   "Yesterday's news that Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines have reached an agreement on a proposed merger, and that United Airlines and Continental Airlines are said to be in discussions on a proposed merger, raises serious questions about the future structure of the airline industry.
   "I don't think the problems in the U.S. airline industry are going to be solved by creating larger airlines.
   "The merger announcement by Northwest and Delta raises specific and serious questions:
   "How would a merger affect the prices for airline travel?
   "How would a merger affect service to airline customers?
   "How would a merger affect airline service and schedules in rural states?
   "Won't this merger reduce competition and therefore result in higher ticket prices?
   "These are just a few of the questions that need to be answered as the federal government considers this proposal.
   "I understand the airlines have been hit with very high jet fuel prices, causing a significant problem for the industry. But I don't believe that problem is solved by more mergers in an industry that's already heavily concentrated at most of the major hubs in the United States.
   "As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I have asked for an immediate hearing on the Northwest-Delta proposal, as well as other proposed mergers that are under discussion.
   "The interests here are greater than just the interests of the airline companies. The public interest is involved as well, and the public interest needs to be the priority of the U.S. Congress."
