SEN. DORGAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION DELAY OF PASSPORT REQUIREMENT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued a statement Wednesday reacting to the Administration's announcement that it will begin to require Americans to show a driver's license, but not a passport, when entering the United States by land beginning in 2008. 
   Dorgan persuaded the Administration to offer a "passport card" as a lower-priced alternative to the passport for travel to Canada. He has pressed the Administration to ensure the price for the cards is as low as possible. In January, Dorgan ask the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate a Postal Service plan to charge $25 simply to accept applications for the wallet-sized cards.
   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   June 20, 2007
   "This delay in the new passport requirement comes as no surprise.
   "What the Administration really needs to do is take steps to make sure this rule is implemented fairly and in a way that does not hurt the economy of our border communities. I'm a strong advocate of stronger border security, but we must do it in a way that doesn't force a family of four to cough up hundreds of dollars just to go and see Grandma and Grandpa in Winnipeg for the weekend.
   "The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a provision last week that would prevent the Administration from requiring Americans to show passports at land borders until at least June 1, 2008. I'm going to keep pushing to make sure that stays in law, so that in the meantime we can find a better way to implement this new initiative."
