SEN. DORGAN MARKS OPENING OF NEW AIRPORT TERMINAL IN DEVILS LAKE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) helped cut the ribbon Wednesday for a new terminal at the Devils Lake Airport that doubles the facility's size and provides amenities such as office space, vending machines and wireless Internet access.  
   The new facility will accommodate the growing commercial air traffic in Devils Lake, which served nearly 3,000 passengers last year. Most of the funding for the $2.4 million project came from the federal Airport Improvement Program, which Dorgan supports through his seat on the Senate Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary and HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   The Bush Administration has once again proposed cuts to the Air Improvement Program and the Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes air service to Devils Lake and other small towns. Dorgan pledged today to work to restore funding to those programs, as he has done successfully in past years. 
   "This is a good day for the city of Devils Lake and the state of North Dakota," Dorgan said. "Air travel is an important part of our transportation network, and for providing access to businesses in the Devils Lake region who must travel for work. I will continue to work to provide funding for projects that bring air service to our rural residents."
