SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO NAME NEW STB CHAIR WHO UNDERSTANDS FINANCIAL WOES FACING 'CAPTIVE SHIPPERS'
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) sent a letter Tuesday to President Bush urging him to nominate a new head of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) with a background in agriculture or business who understands the financial challenges captive shippers face in North Dakota and other states that have little to no railroad competition.  
   The letter follows last week's resignation of Roger Nober as Chairman of the STB, which oversees railroad rate and service disputes and reviews proposed railroad mergers. 
   Dorgan has fought for years to convince Nober and the Bush Administration that current rail rates are "exorbitantly high," due to the railroad monopolies that have been allowed to grow uncontested. He said rates for shipping goods such as farm products and coal are so high that they unfairly limit access to markets and threatens the livelihood of industries in rural areas that rely on rail transport for survival. 
   Dorgan said he wants to see a change in policy, "and a good place to start helping our farmers and others is to name a new Chairman of the STB who truly understands what's going on here." 
   "I hope President Bush will make a fresh start and appoint a new STB Chairman who has been a farmer or worked in a business that has been forced to pay exorbitant rates because railroad monopolies have been allowed to flourish," Dorgan said. "First-hand experience would bring much-needed commonsense to an agency that, instead of protecting against anti-competitive mergers, has routinely favored the railroad industry. It's time for a change, one that takes into account the reality farmers are facing everyday when they try to ship their goods to market."
