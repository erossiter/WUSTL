SEN. DORGAN SAYS BUSH VETO THREAT FOR AGRICULTURE DISASTER HELP FOR FAMILY FARMERS IS BAD IDEA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday President Bush's threat to veto legislation containing disaster relief for family farmers and ranchers "is a bad idea" that would "pull the rug out from under many family farmers and ranchers who desperately need help" after being hit with drought, flooding, low commodity prices and record high energy costs. 
   Dorgan, who included the farm disaster package in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill now before the Senate, said he will work hard to keep it in the bill. Dorgan is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and he won the unanimous support of his Senate colleagues on the Committee to add the disaster package during the committee's consideration of the bill that also includes funding for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   "The President has not vetoed a single bill in his time in office, yet now the White House is threatening to veto a disaster package that would help family farmers survive some very tough times," Dorgan said.
   "Family farmers and ranchers in North Dakota and throughout the country were hit hard over the past year by weather-related disasters that threatened the economic survival of many throughout rural America," Dorgan said. "After years of big tax cuts that primarily benefited the very wealthy, it's hard to understand why the President would oppose extending an urgently needed helping hand to family farmers and ranchers who have suffered low commodity prices, high energy prices, drought and floods that threaten to drive many off the farm," Dorgan said.
   In North Dakota alone, one million acres couldn't be planted in 2005, and bad weather and torrential rains destroyed another nearly one million acres of crops that had been planted.
   "We're not going to let the President's veto threat stop us from working to obtain the emergency assistance so many family farmers and ranchers so urgently need," Dorgan said. "The President is simply mistaken if he thinks ignoring the needs of family farmers and ranchers is the right policy. It is not. The right thing to do is to extend urgently needed help that will mean the difference between economic survival and bankruptcy for thousands in rural America."
   Emergency assistance for farmers and ranchers Dorgan included in the Supplemental Appropriations bill included:
   * Crop loss and quality loss assistance similar to those in past disaster bills.
   * A Livestock Compensation Program to reimburse ranchers in disaster counties for their added livestock feed costs.
   * Supplemental energy payments equal to 30% of a producer's Direct Payment, intended to offset the high costs of energy.
   * Specific assistance for producers in Louisiana, Florida, and other hurricane states.
   * Assistance for sugarbeet growers around the U.S. and in the Red River Valley.
   * Assistance for specialty crop producers.
   * Funding for additional Farm Service Agency (FSA) personnel so the FSA can expedite the administration of the disaster program.
   * Assistance to farmers whose farmland has been lost to flooding.
