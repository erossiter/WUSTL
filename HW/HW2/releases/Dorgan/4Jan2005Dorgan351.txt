SEN. DORGAN SWORN IN FOR THIRD SENATE TERM
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) was sworn into office for a third term in the Senate shortly after 12:00 noon Tuesday.  
 The ceremony took place in the Senate Chamber in the Capitol building. He was escorted to the front of the chamber by Senate colleague Kent Conrad, as Dorgan's family watched from the gallery. 
   "Serving the people of North Dakota is an incredible honor, and one I never take for granted," Dorgan said. "I am grateful for the confidence North Dakotans have shown in me in providing this opportunity to serve, and I am ever mindful of the responsibility that comes with it. We face some enormous challenges: winning the War on Terror, reducing the budget deficit, strengthening family farmers, making our nation's trade policies work for U.S. producers, diversifying and building North Dakota's economy, and making prescription medicines more affordable, just to name a few. I intend to work hard, and look forward to meeting these challenges." 
   In the new 109th Congress, Dorgan will remain a key member of the Democratic leadership as Chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee and will serve once again on the Senate Appropriations Committee. He said he will continue to use that position to advance the Red River Valley Research Corridor project to bring high-tech research and training investment to the state, and to ensure that North Dakota receives its fair share of other federal funding. Dorgan will also serve on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Indian Affairs Committee.
