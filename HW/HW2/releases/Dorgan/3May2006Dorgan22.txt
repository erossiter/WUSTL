SEN. DORGAN BACKS LEGISLATION TO EXTEND FARM BILL, PRESERVE FARM SAFETY NET THROUGH LATEST ROUND OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday he is sponsoring legislation to extend the 2002 Farm Bill through the end of the Doha round of trade negotiations, a move that would preserve critical farm programs until lawmakers can analyze the outcome of the trade talks. 
   The bill, which includes Senators Jim Talent (R-MO) and Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) in its bipartisan group of sponsors, would extend the current Farm Bill until one year after legislation takes effect authorizing the current round of trade negotiations.
   Dorgan said the legislation would ensure family farmers can rely on an effective farm safety net until lawmakers can evaluate the work of U.S. trade representatives and write a new Farm Bill. The current Farm Bill is set to expire on September 30, 2007.
   "I've held farm shop meetings all across North Dakota, and producers have told me that our farm program is working and we should keep it," Dorgan said. "We need to make sure that our farm families have a safety net during tough times, despite what our trade negotiators are trying to do in the latest round of WTO trade talks. We have bipartisan support for this legislation and I'm going to push hard to get it through Congress."
