SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE DECISION TO GIVE WEIGHT TO INTERESTS OF CASSELTON
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) reacted Friday to reports that Burlington Northern Santa Fe will not increase the speed limit of trains through Casselton, North Dakota, from 40 to 60 miles per hour. 
   After Burlington Northern announced in January it would allow its trains to race through the city limits at 60 mph, Dorgan pressed the railroad to withdraw the plan. Burlington Northern CEO Matthew Rose agreed to maintain the 40-mph speed limit until the speed increase could be further reviewed.
   Dorgan is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the regulation of railroads.
   Dorgan's statement is below.
   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   May 19, 2006
   "The residents of Casselton have very legitimate concerns about Burlington Northern's plans to increase the speed limit on its trains traveling through the city limits. I'm glad the railroad has agreed to give some consideration to the interests of the community in this decision.
   "This decision to maintain slower speeds is a temporary one and not final. I plan to continue working closely with city officials and Burlington Northern to make sure this issue is resolved in a way that assures the safety of Casselton's residents.
   "The railroad has a responsibility to listen to the views of the people of Casselton and to operate its trains safely. The decision to suspend the plan to increase train speed suggests the railroad recognizes those concerns but the final decision will tell us whether it does definitively."
