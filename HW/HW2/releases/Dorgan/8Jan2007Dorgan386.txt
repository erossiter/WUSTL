SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO INVEST IN AGRICULTURE, RENEWABLE ENERGY PROGRAMS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues called on President Bush Monday to include a strong investment in family farms and renewable energy projects when he submits his budget to the new Congress.  
   In a letter to the President, Dorgan and a group of senators including Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) and Norm Coleman (R-MN) said U.S. farm programs have proven to be important investments that consistently fall under budget and support family farmers. Strong support for renewable energy programs also will help build the economy in the rural United States and reduce our nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy, the senators wrote. 
   The President is expected to release his budget recommendations in early February. 
   "With American producers struggling with severe drought and the situation in the Middle East looking increasingly bleak, this is no time to cut back on important farm and renewable energy programs," Dorgan said. "We need to invest in programs that will help family farmers stay in business and move our country away from its dependence on foreign sources of energy."
