SEN. DORGAN WANTS MORE INFORMATION ON NOMINEE FOR FED CHAIRMAN POST - WILL LOOK FOR POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday he wants more information about President Bush's nominee to become the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, before making a decision about whether to support the nomination.  
   Dorgan has been a frequent critic of current Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, and said the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board needs to be "truly independent" of the President, rather than the "enabler" of the President that Greenspan has been over the years. 
   Mr. Greenspan "gave the green light to policies that helped produce the biggest budget deficits in history," Dorgan said. "He worried that projected ten year surpluses - which did not yet exist - were going to be too large and that we wouldn't know what to do with them. So he backed the Bush tax cuts which not only erased the surpluses but also created massively deep deficits. In just the past fiscal year alone, our debt has increased by $551 billion. 
   "This is a very important nomination," Dorgan added. "Congress ought to scrutinize it very carefully to ensure that we move the Federal Reserve away from what it is today, an institution that is far too supportive of Bush Administration policies which have put us in a deep fiscal hole."
