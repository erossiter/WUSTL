RESTORING MEDICAID FUNDS IS 'ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL' FOR NORTH DAKOTA RECIPIENTS, SEN. DORGAN SAYS
  Left untouched, President Bush's budget proposal calling for significant cuts to Medicaid could hamstring the state and jeopardize the care of thousands of North Dakota seniors and children who receive health insurance through Medicaid, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday. 
   Dorgan's comments came at a press conference at the Bismarck Civic Center, where the Senator is hosting his eighth annual Women's Health-Women's Lives conference. 
   The President's Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposes a $60 billion reduction in Medicaid funds in the next 10 years. Under that scenario, North Dakota would receive $90 million less over the decade, Dorgan said. 
   "At a time when states are struggling to cover increasing Medicaid costs, the President aims to cut the federal portion even more, and in a very extreme way," Dorgan said. "With the amount of money the President is seeking to cut, we could instead serve up to 500 more North Dakota seniors or 3,200 more North Dakota children," he said, pointing to figures from the consumer advocacy group Families USA. Dorgan added that women in North Dakota would be particularly affected by the proposed cuts because they represent a majority of the state's 53,000 Medicaid recipients. 
   "We need to restore fiscal responsibility to this country. I just think a set of priorities that tries to do that by cutting heath care for those who can't afford it-while giving tax cuts to the wealthy-is the exact wrong set of priorities," Dorgan said. "I, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate, will fight to restore funding for the Medicaid program. There's no need for this sort of pot-shot aimed at those already trying so hard to make ends-meet." 
   Dorgan said 70 percent of North Dakota's Medicaid beneficiaries have incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
