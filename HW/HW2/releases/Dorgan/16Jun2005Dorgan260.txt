SEN. DORGAN HAILS SENATE VOTE TO REQUIRE UTILITIES TO PRODUCE MORE ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE FUELS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan said Thursday's Senate vote to require utilities to produce 10% of their electricity from renewable sources of energy by 2020 is a "big victory" that will help move the nation toward greater energy independence.  
   "This is just the spark we need," said Dorgan, a member of the Senate Energy Committee, who co-sponsored the provision along with Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). The measure was approved by a 52-48 vote Thursday. "We are dangerously dependent on foreign energy sources and this requirement will help speed up the work required to gain some independence when it comes to our nation's energy supplies." 
   Dorgan said the requirement will help diversify the kinds of energy the nation uses and spur the transition of new and developing technologies like wind, solar, and geo-thermal energy from niche energy markets to more mainstream sources. 
   "The fact is, unless we start thinking about a new energy future, and setting some goals about how and when we ought to get there, we never will," Dorgan said. "This requirement that we make more use of 'homegrown energy' is an important and real goal that will move us in exactly the direction we need to be going. Its practical impact will be to accelerate research and development, and commercialization, of a whole range of new energy technologies."
