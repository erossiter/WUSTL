SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS AWARDING OF $182 MILLION CONTRACT FOR FARGO-BASED NORIDIAN
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) congratulated Noridian Adminstrative Services Monday for winning a federal contract worth more than $182 million to process Medicare claims in six states. 
   Though contracts will be awarded for each of 15 Medicare districts around the country, Noridian's contract is the first awarded by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dorgan said. Under the contract, Noridian will process Medicare Part A and Part B claims for more than 1.2 million patients, 350 hospitals and 45,600 physicians across North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Arizona.

   "The contract awarded today to Noridian Administrative Services is no surprise. This is a company that has distinguished itself and they deserve warm congratulations.
   "North Dakota has a reputation for a talented work force and a strong work ethic. The opportunities created by information technology allow North Dakota businesses to compete successfully for federal contracts, and I hope many companies will follow Noridian's lead."
