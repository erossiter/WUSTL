SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS SWEARING-IN OF NEW ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS
  Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Wednesday applauded the swearing-in of Carl Artman as Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, saying the filling of the long-vacant position will boost efforts to address issues facing American Indian communities across the nation. 
   Artman was sworn in today in a ceremony in Washington. The position of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs was vacant for two years after President Bush nominated him, and Dorgan pushed to expedite Artman's confirmation when he took over as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.

   April 18, 2007
   "The official swearing-in of our new Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs is a welcome step forward. Our effort to improve the quality of life in American Indian communities requires leadership by an Assistant Secretary that will focus on the urgent challenges facing American Indians.
   "This position has been vacant far too long as our Native communities continued to face bona fide crises in health care, education and housing. Mr. Artman is clearly qualified for this position and I look forward to working with him to address the challenges we face in Indian Country."
