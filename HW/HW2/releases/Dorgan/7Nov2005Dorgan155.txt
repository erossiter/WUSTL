SEN. DORGAN SECURES FUNDING FOR UPPER MIDWEST AEROSPACE CONSORTIUM
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday he secured language in an appropriations bill that requires the National Weather Service (NWS) to keep its radar station in Williston open until an independent review can prove its closure will not harm local residents.  
   Dorgan, who secured the provision as a member of a conference committee negotiating the final version of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, said the development ensures farmers, ranchers, and others in the Williston area who depend on NWS forecasts will not see an interruption in service due to closure of the station. 
   The Bush Administration has expressed interest in using instead a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar in Watford City, some 35 miles to the southeast. However, it would be irresponsible to do unless an independent review shows Williston-area residents would still receive reliable, timely and prompt weather forecasts, Dorgan said. 
   "In places like northwestern North Dakota where we often have fast-changing weather conditions, the livelihood of many people can depend on accurate and prompt weather warnings," Dorgan said. "We don't yet know how well the FAA radar will serve as a substitute, but people know they can rely on National Weather Service forecasts. This bill will ensure that we don't rush into a change that will disrupt the business of our farmers and ranchers."
