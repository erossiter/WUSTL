SEN. DORGAN RESTORES FUNDING FOR UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday that his Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in the Senate has voted to restore funding for United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) in Bismarck.  
   The Administration's 2005 budget proposed the elimination of the school's $3 million general appropriation. But Dorgan, ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, successfully added the funds back into the budget, which now moves onto the full Senate Appropriations Committee for approval. "This is an excellent technical college that has made a difference in the lives of thousands and thousands of Native Americans," Dorgan said. Last year, students from over 70 tribes in 30 states attended UTTC in Bismarck. UTTC President David Gipp said the news came at an excellent time, following the college's celebration of its 35th anniversary on July 1st. 
   "It's a great birthday gift to the school to find out we would be able to maintain service to our community," Gipp said. "For us, the funding means the school is going to be able to continue its mission of serving American Indian adults and children who want to make a new life for themselves by getting the training and education they need." 
   Dorgan said this was the fourth consecutive year the Administration's budget has proposed cutting the funding for UTTC. Each year, Congress has restored the funding. 
   "This is an investment that pays big dividends by preparing American Indians for the workplace with new skills that provide new opportunity for them," he said.
