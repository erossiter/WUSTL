SEN. DORGAN BILL WOULD BLOCK PLAN FOR UNITED ARAB EMIRATES TO OPERATE MAJOR U.S. SEAPORTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said in a hearing this week he will move to block a proposal that would allow a company owned by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to manage some of America's busiest seaports.  
   Dorgan has introduced legislation to halt the sale of P&O Ports to Dubai Ports World, a port management company owned by the government of the UAE. Dorgan, speaking at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to examine the ports deal, said the decision to allow the sale is an example of "pre-9/11 thinking if there ever was one." He said he rejects the Bush Administration Homeland Security chief's view that we must "balance security threats with our desire for robust global trading." 
   "Our national security must be paramount in these decisions," Dorgan said. 
   Two of the 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE, and the UAE government was one of only five in the world to recognize the Taliban government of Afghanistan. The UAE also "rolled out the welcome mat" for Osama bin Laden, who personally visited the UAE royal family prior to 9/11, Dorgan said. 
   "I don't think we need a 45-day review of this by the same people who made the original boneheaded decision," Dorgan said. "We need to stop it." 
   "It is absurd to ask millions of law-abiding Americans to take off their shoes and belts in order to board a commercial airplane, but to turn over the operation of entire commercial shipping ports to a company owned by a government with disturbing ties to 9/11 and Osama bin Laden," Dorgan added. 
   "The operation of American ports is a responsibility with major national security implications and that work ought to be done by American companies," Dorgan said. "We need to address that broader question as well, but this legislation addresses the immediate question we now face and can do so promptly."
