SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO CONVENE EMERGENCY MEETING ON TRADE DEFICIT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called Wednesday for the President to convene "an emergency meeting of key policy makers" to develop a plan for reducing the nation's out of control trade deficit.  
 Dorgan's call came after the Commerce Department announced Wednesday morning the U.S. trade deficit reached an all-time record $60.3 billion in November, shattering the previous record set in October of $56 billion. 
   "A trade deficit of $60 billion a month is a crisis," Dorgan said, "and it needs to be addressed, not ignored. I call on the President to convene key policy makers immediately and begin making plans for reducing the trade deficit." 
   Dorgan said he will also introduce legislation when Congress returns later this month to put a trade deficit ceiling in place. If the ceiling is exceeded, Dorgan said, his legislation will require the President to develop a plan of action to reduce the trade deficit. 
   "We have a ceiling on our national debt, but we don't even bother to define a ceiling for our nation's trade deficit - and that has to change," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan's legislation would set a trade deficit ceiling at five percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in any given year. If the ceiling is reached, Dorgan said, the bill would require the Bush Administration to develop a trade deficit reduction plan within 45 days. 
   In 2003, the trade deficit reached 4.4 percent of U.S. GDP. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has cautioned that the U.S. trade deficit is reaching unsustainable levels.
