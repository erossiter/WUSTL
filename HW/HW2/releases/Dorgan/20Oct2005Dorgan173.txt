SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION AIMED AT REDUCING CHILD ABUSE ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Vice Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, introduced a bill Thursday that would improve policies for reporting and tracking child abuse cases in Indian Country and would begin to address the prevalence of suicide among Native American teenagers.  
   Dorgan, along with Committee Chairman John McCain (R-AZ), introduced a bill to reauthorize the 1990 Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act. Dorgan said the bill would: 
   * Provide additional safeguards for the privacy of information about a child;
   * Provide more involvement by the FBI and the Attorney General in documenting incidents of child abuse;
   * Direct a study to identify ways to reduce child abuse in Indian Country, as well as require data collection and annual reporting to Congress on child abuse in Indian Country;
   * And authorize the Indian Health Service (IHS) to use telemedicine in connection with examinations of abused Indian children
   Dorgan said the bill also addresses the high rate of suicide among teens living on Indian reservations. Dorgan held the first-ever Senate hearings on the subject earlier this year, and said that while it's a sensitive issue to discuss, there needs to be a public spotlight on the issue in order to get Congress to take action. 
   This bill, he said, is one step in that direction. The bill allows professionals trained in suicide prevention and treatment to be included on the staff of Indian Child Resource and Family Services Centers, which the bill establishes in each BIA region. 
   "All too often, children who attempt suicide have been abused by a family or community member," Dorgan said. "Suicide on our Indian reservations is at epidemic levels. The rate in the Upper Great Plains alone is 10 times higher than the national average. This bill is just a start, but it's a good start at improving the reporting and tracking of child abuse cases on our reservations, and gets at the tragic epidemic of suicide that is often attributed to instances of child abuse."
