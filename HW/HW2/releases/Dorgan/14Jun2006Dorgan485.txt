SEN. DORGAN URGES DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD TO QUICKLY RECOMMEND MEDAL OF HONOR FOR WOODROW WILSON KEEBLE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) urged Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld this week to recommend that the President award a Medal of Honor to the late Master Sergeant Woodrow Wilson Keeble. 
   Last week, the Secretary of the Army recommended awarding a Medal of Honor to Keeble pending the approval of the Secretary of Defense and President.
   Keeble, a full-blooded Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux, was awarded the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Silver Star and the Distinguished Service Cross for his service in the Army. On Oct. 20, 1951, Keeble - acting single-handedly and while stricken with multiple wounds - crawled through heavy enemy fire and took out three four-man machine gun bunkers and two trenches of enemy troops.
   Dorgan, in a letter to Rumsfeld, said Keeble's heroism in World War II and the Korean War clearly qualify him for a Medal of Honor, the U.S. military's highest honor for personal bravery and self-sacrifice. He asked Rumsfeld to act soon on the Secretary of the Army's recommendation to award the medal posthumously to Keeble's widow, Blossom Hawkins-Keeble.
   "The criteria for the Medal of Honor include deeds of personal bravery, self-sacrifice, or an action that conspicuously distinguishes the individual above his comrades. Certainly the courageous and patriotic acts exhibited by Mr. Keeble during times of war make him a long overdue and deserving recipient of the Medal of Honor," Dorgan wrote.
