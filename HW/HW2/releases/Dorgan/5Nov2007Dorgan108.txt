SEN. DORGAN CALLS FOR STRONG SAFETY NET FOR FAMILY FARMERS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) supported the new farm bill in opening debate on the Senate floor Monday, calling on his colleagues to work together to approve a strong safety net for family farmers. 
   Dorgan, speaking on the first day of floor debate on the new farm bill, said the Senate Agriculture Committee has put together a strong piece of legislation that will enhance the farm safety net and re-establish a permanent disaster relief program. The legislation is an important investment in family farms that will make our nation stronger, he said.
   "The Agriculture Committee has done a good job of putting together a bill that invests in family farms," Dorgan said. "This legislation makes some important improvements to our farm safety net, and adds a permanent disaster relief program that will ensure we can give a hand to producers when times are tough. Family farmers will welcome this bill, and it's important that we come together and get this done."
   Dorgan said he and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) will also offer an amendment this week to limit farm payments made to the biggest corporate agri-factories. He said the provisions will put real limits on the amount of assistance any one person can receive. Their amendment would also require those receiving federal farm program payments to be actively engaged in farming.
   "We need to put a stop to the practice of huge agri-factories - mostly down South - that are farming the farm program. They're diverting millions of dollars from family farms and hurting the reputation of the farm program," Dorgan said. "This is a strong farm bill and I will support it, but I'm going to work hard to get this amendment passed so we can target farm program payments to family farmers."
