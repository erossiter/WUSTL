SEN. DORGAN, BIPARTISAN GROUP SAY PRESIDENT'S SPEECH GIVES MOMENTUM TO LEGISLATION ON ETHANOL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of colleagues responded Thursday to President Bush's remarks in his State of the Union address, calling on Congress to embrace the goal and approve legislation they introduced that would expand the use and availability of ethanol.  
   Earlier this month, Dorgan - along with Senators Tom Harkin (D-IA), Dick Lugar (R-IN) and Barack Obama (D-IL) - introduced the Biofuels Security Act, which will require that 60 billion gallons of ethanol be sold annually in the United States by 2030. In his address, the President called for an increased mandate for renewable fuels such as ethanol to 35 billion gallons by 2017. Dorgan authored legislation passed by Congress in 2005 that requires refiners to use at least 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually in their gasoline blends by 2012. 
   "The President called for some significant action on ethanol and other biofuels, and I think he'll find broad agreement on that in Congress," Dorgan said. "We've been calling for some time for some bold new initiatives to increase the use of ethanol. It's good for our farmers, good for our environment, and good for our national security. I'm going to keep pushing to expand the use of ethanol and I'm glad the President has committed to that goal, as well."
