SEN. DORGAN TO HOLD SENATE FIELD HEARING TO INVESTIGATE USDA PUSH TO RESUME CANADIAN BEEF IMPORTS IN WAKE OF NINTH CASE OF MAD COW DISEASE IN CANADA
  U.S. Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday the report that a ninth case of mad cow disease has been confirmed in Canada is a clear sign that the U.S. Department of Agriculture needs to slow its effort to re-open the U.S. market to Canadian beef. Dorgan said he will convene a U.S. Senate field hearing in North Dakota later this month to probe the issue.  
   Dorgan, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce, Trade and Tourism, said the Administration has based its push to re-open the border to Canadian beef on politics, not sound science. He said he believes ranchers should have a voice in this matter and he will chair the hearing in Bismarck on February 21 to take testimony from ranchers and other interested parties. 
   "Yesterday's report that another Canadian animal has tested positive for mad cow disease is disturbing," Dorgan said. "The USDA has no business opening our borders to Canadian beef before implementing a country-of-origin labeling system that will allow consumers to see where the steak on their dinner plate came from. I'll be organizing a Senate hearing in North Dakota to get to the bottom of this issue and I'll keep pushing USDA to approach this issue with science, not politics, in mind." 
   Last week, Dorgan led a bipartisan group of senators in a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns calling for a halt to the push to open the U.S. market to Canadian beef. In the letter, Dorgan said such a move would be especially outrageous given USDA's foot-dragging in the implementation of country-of-origin labeling.
