SEN. DORGAN POINTS TO SUB-PRIME MELTDOWN AS PROOF AMERICANS NEED STRONG FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
  Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Chairman of the Interstate Commerce, Trade and Tourism Subcommittee, today introduced legislation that will further protect consumers from unfair or deceptive business practices and unfair methods of competition. 
   The bill reauthorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) while increasing funding to ensure the agency has greater resources to protect Americans from unscrupulous business practices. Dorgan pointed to trusting consumers who were preyed upon in the subprime mortgage mess as proof that a strengthened FTC is needed.  
   "The agency has a very important mission, but needs more resources and authority. The improvements contained in this bill give the FTC the resources to find and prosecute unscrupulous business practices like those behind the subprime mortgage meltdown," Dorgan said. "Giving the agency manpower, technology and authority will not only help them track down the culprits but will also deter those thinking about trying to pull one over on American consumers." 
   The bill provides for a 7-year Reauthorization starting in 2009 with Fiscal Year 2009 funding at $264 million. The bill then sets the budget to increase by 10 percent per year for the next seven years. An additional $20 million is provided to be used by the Commission to improve technology in support of its competition and consumer protection missions. 
   The bill extends the FTC's jurisdiction to so they can go after non-profit entities, so bad actors cannot hide behind non-profit status, and after those aiding and abetting an FTC violation. 
   "More resources are key to giving the FTC bigger teeth in protecting Americans but we've also made sure to include provisions in the bill that simplify the processes within the FTC so they can create rules in the marketplace that protect consumers," Dorgan added. 
   Dorgan and Commerce Committee Chairman, Senator Inouye (D-HI) introduced the bill today on the floor of the Senate. The bill will now be considered by the Commerce committee. 
   Other provisions of the bill: 
   * It also authorizes $10 million for FY 2009 through FY 2015 to continue and enhance the Commission's provision of international technical assistance with respect to foreign consumer protection and competition regimes. 
   * The bill gives the FTC independent litigating authority so they won't have to refer their cases to the Department of Justice. It also gives the FTC the authority to give preference in the hiring process to administrative law judges who have experience in their issues. 
   * It provides the FTC the authority to commence a civil action to recover civil penalties in a district court for any violation of the FTC Act. 
   * The bill extends their jurisdiction to allow them to go after non-profit entities as well as for-profit entities, so bad actors cannot hide behind non-profit status, and it allows them to go after those aiding and abetting an FTC violation. 
   * It provides the FTC the authority, by majority vote of the full Commission, to waive their current rulemaking requirements in favor of an APA rulemaking procedure for any rule involving a consumer protection matter. 
   * The bill requires the FTC to conduct a rulemaking under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which is faster than their current Magnuson-Moss authority, in the area of subprime loans. The Commission has brought 21 cases in the last decade, but they haven't had the ability to review the bad practices and create a rule preventing their reoccurrence. The bill gives them authority to create a rule preventing unfair or deceptive behavior by lenders and allows state Attorneys General to enforce the rule. 
   * The bill repeals the common carrier exemption, which will allow the FTC to protect consumers who are dealing with bad practices in consumer billing and advertising by phone companies and wireless service providers. 
   * It also ensures that the state Do Not Call registries are not preempted by federal regulations where the state's registry imposes stricter requirements on telemarketers than those imposed by the federal registry.
