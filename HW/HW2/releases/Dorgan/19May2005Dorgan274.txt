SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO MOVE BY HOUSE COMMITTEE TO SCUTTLE COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN LABELING LAW
  Action by a U.S. House subcommittee to delay the country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirement for meat, fruit and vegetables has drawn a sharp rebuke from Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND), who vowed Thursday to fight the proposal. 
   "Consumers have the right to know where the meat they are purchasing at the grocery store was produced," Dorgan said. "We put labels on shirts, shoes and t-shirts, as well as canned goods and dry goods at the grocery store, and there is simply no reason consumers should not expect to see origin labels on the meat products they purchase."
   "This is the second time that the big packing companies have gotten to the majority party in the U.S. House to delay country-of-origin labeling for meat. It's time for Congress to stand up for American consumers and American ranchers," he said. 
   Dorgan vowed to fight to prevent the majority party from further delaying the implementation of country-of-origin labeling for meat, fruit and vegetables.
