SEN. DORGAN'S REQUEST FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF $2.8 MILLION FOR FORT YATES WATER REPAIR APPROVED
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will reimburse $2.8 million of the funds used for the emergency repair of the Fort Yates water intake system.  
 These funds can now be used for other water and sewer projects on the Standing Rock and Fort Berthold Indian Reservations. 
   Last November, three communities on the Standing Rock Reservation lost their water supply due to low water levels at Lake Oahe. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and the Army Corps of Engineers quickly repaired the system, but a portion of the cost came out of BOR's annual funding for Indian Municipal, Rural and Industrial (MR&I) projects. In a June 2004 letter, Dorgan urged BOR to restore the funding that was used for these emergency repairs by reallocating unused funds throughout the agency. 
   "I'm pleased the Bureau of Reclamation approved my request to restore this funding," Dorgan said. "The quick action last November helped restore water to the residents of Fort Yates, Cannon Ball and Porcupine. However, by taking the money that was targeted for other projects, it compounded the problems faced by these communities. Today's action will provide needed funding for these other important community investments." 
   Dorgan serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the Bureau of Reclamation.
