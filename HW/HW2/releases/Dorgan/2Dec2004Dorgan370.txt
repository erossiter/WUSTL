   "I am pleased with today's nomination of Governor Mike Johanns. Any time you have someone who grew up on a dairy farm in Iowa, you have to believe that person understands what it means to be a family farmer or rancher and the problems they face. Nebraska has a lot of similarities to North Dakota, and I think his nomination bodes well for the Great Plains as we move forward on many important agriculture issues next year.
   "Governor Johanns has been an advocate for disaster relief for farmers and a leader in the Western Governors' Association on drought issues. He also has proven to be a strong supporter of ethanol. I look forward to working with him on those issues. While I don't know how Governor Johanns feels about country-of-origin labeling (COOL), I hope he will work to implement it as quickly as possible. COOL is the law of the land, but for too long USDA has dragged its feet when it comes to implementing it."
   "While I'm sure we may not agree on every issue, I am hopeful Governor Johanns' background will provide a new and stronger voice for family farmers and ranchers in North Dakota and across the country."
