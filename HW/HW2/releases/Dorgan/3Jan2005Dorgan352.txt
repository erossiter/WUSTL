SEN. DORGAN WANTS USDA TO IMMEDIATELY RESCIND NEW RULE REOPENING CANADIAN BORDER TO CATTLE IMPORTS
  In a letter to Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secreftary Ann Veneman, Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said she should take steps to immediately suspend the rule announced last week that would allow for the importation of Canadian cattle into the United States. 
   "In light of the fact there has now been another confirmed case of BSE in Canada, it is clear the responsibility of the USDA should be to immediately suspend efforts to open that border," Dorgan said. 
   "I know this news is a tough blow to Canadian beef producers and our sympathies go out to them," Dorgan said. "But our first responsibility is to protect the American beef industry, which has taken a significant hit in its export markets as a result of the Canadian cow that was discovered with BSE in Washington state last year." 
   "Our farmers and ranchers deserve actions by our government that stand up for our economic interests and for the protection of the American beef industry," Dorgan said.
