  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) reacted Monday to a news report [1] that a White House staff member was behind the ejection of three people from a "town hall" meeting in Denver, Colorado, last year. 
   The text of the statement is below.
   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN:
   March 20, 2006
   "What happened in Fargo, compiling a list of people - including a Fargo City Commissioner - who were to be prevented from attending a public event in a public facility featuring the President of the United States, was totally inappropriate.
   "We asked the Treasury Department last year for an explanation for this, and frankly, are still waiting for answers to the questions of who decided to do this, who approved it, who compiled the list, and who implemented it?
   "These are pretty important questions and they need to be answered, especially in light of the report from the Denver newspaper."
