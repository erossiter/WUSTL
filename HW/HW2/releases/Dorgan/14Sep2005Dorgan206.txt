SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO NORTHWEST AIRLINES' BANKRUPTCY DECLARATION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement today in reaction to the decision by the board of Northwest Airlines to file for bankruptcy.  
   The text of Dorgan's statement follows: 
   September 14, 2005
   Today's announcement by Northwest Airlines that it will file for bankruptcy is unfortunate. 
   I don't know what impact this will have on North Dakota's air service, but I intend to work aggressively with Northwest to see that the impact on North Dakota is minimized. North Dakotans need reliable and timely air service from Northwest. 
   I understand the challenges facing the entire airline industry right now are sizeable ones. Still, I am disappointed with today's bankruptcy filing by Northwest Airlines, and I intend to do everything possible to see that it continues to provide the fine service to North Dakota in the future.
