SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT AMERICANS' PERSONAL TELEPHONE RECORDS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday he is co-sponsoring legislation to close a loophole in federal law that allows strangers to obtain the personal telephone records of all Americans.  
   Dorgan said the Protecting Consumer Phone Records Act bans a practice called "pretexting," in which a person impersonates customers to gain access to their personal phone records. The bill also gives the federal government the ability to aggressively pursue phone record thieves. Dorgan said the "commonsense" legislation also improves the confidentiality of phone records and calls for a consumer outreach initiative to raise consumer awareness of the problem and help customers protect themselves against theft and misuse of their personal information. 
   "The information in phone records is private and should be guarded at least as carefully as sensitive financial information," Dorgan said. "Consumers shouldn't have to worry that personal records will be given out to identity thieves or other people who would use them for their own purposes. That's just common sense, and I intend to push Congress to end this gross invasion of privacy."
