SEN. DORGAN ACTS TO PRESERVE OPERATION OF WILLISTON RADAR
  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Thursday attached language to an Appropriations bill to preserve operation of the Williston Radar Station by the National Weather Service (NWS).
   "Farmers, ranchers and others in the Williston area depend on reliable weather information," said Dorgan. "Until the NWS can show that another radar can provide this, we must keep the Williston radar operating." 
   The Bush Administration had proposed to shut down operation of the Williston Radar Station. If the Williston Radar Station was to close, the community would have to rely on a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar located more than 40 miles away in Watford City. 
   The project is among $4.55 million Dorgan secured for North Dakota projects in the bill. Among the projects is an initiative at the University of North Dakota to provide farmers access to NASA satellite data and research for use in precision agriculture, land and soil management, and drought and flood mitigation.
   The Committee also approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which was written by Senator Dorgan and includes more than $124 million for energy-related research in North Dakota and to develop the state's water infrastructure. Both bills go next to the full U.S. Senate for consideration. A list of projects in the bills is below.
   North Dakota projects in the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill:
   UPPER MIDWEST AEROSPACE CONSORTIUM
  $3 million
   This funding will support research and educational programs at the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium (UMAC), a group headquartered at UND. UMAC takes data and research from NASA's satellites and space program and makes it available to citizens in the Northern Great Plains for practical applications such as precision agriculture, land and soil management, and drought and flood mitigation.
   MINOT STATE UNIVERSITY RURAL METHAMPHETAMINE EDUCATION PROJECT
  $750,000
   This funding will be used by Minot State University's (MSU) Rural Methamphetamine Project to continue its successful Mentoring Communities program and to develop law enforcement analysis tools, including a testing kit that will help in analyzing clandestine methamphetamine labs. The Rural Methamphetamine Education Project has reached more than 64,000 North Dakotans about the adverse effects of methamphetamine.
   WILLISTON RADAR
   The bill includes language directing the National Weather Service to maintain operation of the Williston Radar Station, a vital information link providing needed weather warnings that can save the lives of both people and livestock in northwestern North Dakota. The Bush Administration has proposed to shut down the Williston Radar System, even though that plan would require residents of the Williston area to rely on Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar more than 40 miles away. Dorgan has worked to retain the radar site until he receives assurances that the FAA radar can provide coverage for all light to heavy weather activity.
   TURTLE MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE'S TRIBAL JUSTICE PROGRAM
  $250,000
   This funding will be used by Turtle Mountain Community College to expand its Legal Studies curriculum aimed at addressing the serious shortage of Native Americans trained in tribal government or law. The college will continue development of course books and materials for its nine-month and two-year Legal Studies programs and begin planning for an online, four-year Legal Studies degree.
   CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTERS
  $400,000
   This funding will be used by the Children's Advocacy Centers in North Dakota to provide statewide training in the prevention, intervention and treatment of child abuse and assistance to law enforcement in the investigation and assessment of child abuse reports. The centers, located in Fargo and Bismarck, support child abuse victims and their families by providing a coordinated community response to child abuse reports.
   NATIVE AMERICANS INTO LAW
  $200,000
   This funding will support UND's Native Americans into Law program, which helps to recruit and retain American Indian students who are studying law. The funding will be used for scholarships, retention support needs, student outreach, and the Indian law library.
