SEN. DORGAN, COLLEAGUES URGE PRESIDENT TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and seven of his Senate colleagues called on President Bush Friday to include assistance for family farmers and ranchers in any disaster relief proposal he submits to Congress.  
   In a letter sent Friday to President Bush, the Senators noted that last year, Congress provided assistance for farmers and ranchers who suffered losses due to a series of hurricanes and other natural disasters. "We are concerned about a number of natural disasters that threaten to make this a particularly bad year for our agricultural producers," the Senators wrote. "We ask that you continue to recognize the effects of natural disasters on agriculture by providing relief for producers in your emergency funding request." 
   "Farmers in North Dakota this year have had to deal with quality losses, crop losses, and over one million acres of prevented planting due to torrential rainfall in some areas," Dorgan said. "And while ranchers in some parts of the state are facing the threat of anthrax, others are having a hard time finding forage to feed their herds. When farmers and ranchers are confronted by weather-related disasters that are beyond their control, we need to do something to help." 
   Joining Dorgan in the letter to President Bush were Senators Kit Bond (R-MO), Kent Conrad (D-ND), Mark Dayton (D-MN), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Mel Martinez (R-FL), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ken Salazar (D-CO), and James Talent (R-MO).
