SENATE VOTES TO AWARD MEDALS FOR IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN MILITARY SERVICE
  The U.S. Senate voted unanimously Tuesday to authorize the Pentagon to award two sets of war medals to honor two sets of troops - those who served in Iraq and those who served in Afghanistan.  
   Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) noted that North Dakota is among the states with the highest per capita number of National Guard and reservist troops called to active duty for service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Approximately 1,300 North Dakota National Guard and Reserve have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan so far, qualifying for the medal. Dorgan voted in favor of the bill, saying it honors troops who served in both countries for their courage, service and sacrifice. 
   "I'm pleased the Congress has voted to honor soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan for their service and dedication to our great nation, and the courage they displayed in defending it," Dorgan said. "North Dakotans who served will now know the entire nation honors their contribution to the nation made at a great cost by them and their families." 
   The bill passed both chambers of Congress unanimously. On March 30, the House of Representatives passed the bill 423-0. On Tuesday, the Senate passed the measure 98-0. The bill now goes to the President for his signature.
