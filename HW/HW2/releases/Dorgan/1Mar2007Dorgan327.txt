SEN. DORGAN TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT TO DISCUSS EMERGING RENEWABLE FUELS INDUSTRY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) will meet Friday morning with President Bush, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman and a bipartisan group of members of Congress to discuss the future of ethanol and other renewable fuels.  
   Dorgan chairs two key energy panels - the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. He said he will encourage the President to pursue policies that will increase the production and use of renewable fuels. 
   "I will tell the President tomorrow that no state has a greater capability to produce more diverse types of energy than North Dakota," Dorgan said. "Coal, oil, natural gas and all of the renewable fuels will be a significant part of North Dakota's future. 
   "I have been encouraged in the past by the President's support of ethanol. I look forward to this discussion as a way to find some common ground and talk about ways we can work together in a bipartisan way to grow the renewable fuels industry and help move our country away from its dependence on foreign sources of oil."
