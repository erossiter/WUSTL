   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   March 24, 2008
   "The Justice Department's approval of the merger of XM and Sirius satellite radio is another disappointing example of this Administration's blatant disregard for the public interest with regard to media ownership.
   "There seems to be no limit to the mergers this administration will approve. These two companies were issued licenses a decade ago to provide competing national satellite radio service. Their license approval included a clause that prohibits them from merging into one company.
   "Now the Justice Department has decided the contract they signed can't stand in the way of consolidation. That doesn't make any sense to me.
   "This merger will eliminate all competition in satellite radio, and it's the American consumer that will pay the price."
