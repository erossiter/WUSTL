SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN BILL TO HELP REDUCE HIGH SUICIDE RATE AMONG AMERICAN INDIAN TEENS
  The Senate has approved legislation authored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that would direct counseling resources, professionals, and suicide-prevention materials to teenagers on American Indian reservations, where the youth suicide rate is among the highest in the nation. 
   "The suicide rate among Indian teenagers on the Great Plains is 10 times the national average," said Dorgan, Vice Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "This is a crisis and I'm encouraged that the Senate's unanimous passage of this bill will help us bring help to youth on our reservations."
   The legislation would expand the availability of "telemental" health services - bringing more counseling, professionals and suicide-prevention materials to rural tribal communities using telecommunications technology.
   "I realize there are some who would rather not discuss such a sensitive issue in a public way," Dorgan said. "But I think we must address this issue plainly and openly to extend a hand to these kids and say, 'You are not alone.' We must take steps in public policy to put an end to this tragedy that far too many on our reservations have experienced."
   Dorgan sponsored the bill along with a bipartisan group including Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Kent Conrad (D-ND), and Tim Johnson (D-SD).
