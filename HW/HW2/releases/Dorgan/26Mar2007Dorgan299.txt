SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE'LL PUSH TO ADDRESS INDIAN HOUSING, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION SHORTAGES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) held a listening session here Saturday with members of the Spirit Lake Tribe to discuss local and national issues and hear their ideas to promote policies that address issues affecting American Indian communities.  
   Dorgan, Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, said he'll take the input he heard Saturday back to Capitol Hill. He said he'll continue to push legislation to address "bona fide crises" in American Indian health care, housing and education. 
   "Our American Indian communities face some serious challenges, and I'm going to keep pushing Congress to fulfill our trust responsibilities," Dorgan said. "We've already seen success in moving the new Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs through the Senate, and I plan to keep working aggressively to promote economic development and take better care of our children and others in need in our reservation communities."
