SEN. DORGAN PRESSES AGRICULTURE SECRETARY ON DISASTER RELIEF FOR FAMILY FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) pressed Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns Tuesday to reverse course and support disaster relief for family farmers and ranchers, but said he was "disappointed" in Johanns' response that the Administration's position on the legislation has not changed.  
   Dorgan said he will keep pushing the Administration to provide disaster assistance and will offer an agriculture disaster package as an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations request that the President has sent to Congress. 
   At a hearing of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan told Johanns the President's efforts to block a disaster package have scuttled the push for assistance. Dorgan has repeatedly attached the disaster package to appropriations bills, but the measure each time has been scuttled by the President's veto threat. 
   "It is unfair that the Administration supported disaster aid for farmers who lost their crops in Hurricane Katrina, but will not support help for farmers who lost their crops due to last year's drought," Dorgan told Johanns. 
   "I'm not going to quit in my efforts to help the farmers who got hurt by weather-related disasters," he said.
