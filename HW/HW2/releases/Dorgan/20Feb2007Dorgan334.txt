SEN. DORGAN CONGRATULATES CITY OF RIVERDALE ON ITS NEW WATER TREATMENT FACILITY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) congratulated the city of Riverdale on the opening of its new Riverdale Water Treatment Facility. As past ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan secured $1.3 million in federal funding for the project, which will help improve and safeguard the city's water supply.  
   "I commend Mayor Lingelbach on his leadership to bring this project to fruition," said Dorgan. "We've been working for a few years now to make this facility a reality, and I'm proud to see it finally open to help ensure Riverdale and the surrounding area has a safer, more dependable supply of water. This new water facility will be essential to the growth of the city of Riverdale." The Riverdale Water Treatment facility will provide not only water to the city of Riverdale, but also to the nearby communities including the City of Pick City, City of Underwood, Lake Sakakawea State Park, Fish Hatchery and local cabin areas. The facility provides an upgraded filtration system to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations.
