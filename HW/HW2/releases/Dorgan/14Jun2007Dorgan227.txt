SEN. DORGAN SAYS BILL WILL DELAY REQUIREMENT TO CARRY PASSPORT WHEN CROSSING U.S.-CANADA BORDER
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a provision delaying a requirement that Americans traveling by land to Canada carry a passport or "passport card." Without the change Dorgan helped secure, the requirement would have been triggered as early as January 1, 2008. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Appropriations Committee, said the amendment that was passed would delay implementation of the plan to June 1, 2009. If passports card are still not widely available, the plan would be delayed further. The provision was added to the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill.
   "It would be irresponsible to begin enforcing the passport requirement for land crossings before passport cards are available, and while Americans are facing such long delays in their passport applications," Dorgan said.
   Dorgan persuaded the Administration to offer the "passport card" as a lower-priced alternative to the passport for travel to Canada. He has pressed the Administration to ensure the price for the cards is as low as possible. In January, Dorgan ask the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate a Postal Service plan to charge $25 simply to accept applications for the wallet-sized cards.
   "I fully support efforts to boost security at our borders, but as we do so we need to make sure we have a good system that doesn't stifle economic activity in our border communities," Dorgan said. "It's clear that the Administration does not yet have its act together on this issue, and it would be irresponsible to implement this plan before it has solved these issues. I'm going to keep pushing to bring down the cost of these passport cards and make sure that when this requirement does go into effect, it accounts for the interest of all our citizens."
