SEN. DORGAN COMMENTS ON SOUTH KOREA'S RESUMPTION OF AMERICAN BEEF IMPORTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday the resumed imports of U.S. beef in South Korea are "a welcome sight." He said the renewed beef trade with South Korea, which was the third-largest export market for American beef before it launched an unjustified and extended ban in 2003, will be a boost to ranchers in North Dakota and across the nation. 
   Dorgan wrote South Korean Ambassador Lee Tae Sik in July to warn him that Members of Congress were growing impatient with his country's continued ban on American beef. The country announced about a month later it would again accept U.S. beef.
   "The pictures of U.S. beef shipments once again entering South Korea are a welcome sight," Dorgan said. "Our ranchers have been unfairly penalized for far too long. It's good to see South Korea finally acknowledging that American beef is the safest and healthiest in the world."
