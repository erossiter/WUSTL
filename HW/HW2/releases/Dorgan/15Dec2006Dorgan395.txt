SEN. DORGAN WANTS MORE COMPETITION, BETTER PRICES, NOT MORE AIRLINE MERGERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday the news reports of additional airline mergers among the few remaining large airlines is troubling news for American consumers.  
   "Since the deregulation of airlines we have seen too many mergers," said Dorgan. "Now we have more concentration and less competition, which translates into higher prices for consumers." 
   Dorgan has requested January hearings in a letter to the incoming chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, on which he serves, on the recent proposed mergers between US Airways and Delta Airlines and the stories of merger talks between United Airlines and Continental Airlines. 
   "Travelers in rural states are especially hard-hit with less competition and airline hubs that are dominated by major carriers," said Dorgan. "If you live in a rural state it is likely you will spend twice to three times as much to fly half as far than if you live in one of America's major cities. Additional mergers in the airline industry will exacerbate that problem, rather than correct it." 
   Dorgan said that he wants aggressive hearings and work by the Department of Transportation and Justice Department to put the brakes on more mergers in an industry that is already very concentrated.
