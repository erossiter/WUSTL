SEN. DORGAN PROVIDES FUNDING FOR NORTHWEST AREA WATER SUPPLY, OTHER RURAL WATER PROJECTS IN NORTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) acted Thursday to provide $10 million in federal funding to the Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS), a project to bring a safe, reliable supply of drinking water to Minot and other cities in northwestern North Dakota. 
   As chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan is responsible for writing the Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. Dorgan added language to the bill during a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting today that directs funding to North Dakota water projects using $69 million he provided for the Garrison Diversion.
   The Committee passed the bill, which goes next to the full Senate for consideration.
   "The funding for the Garrison Diversion in this bill is a significant increase over the amount our state has received in years past," Dorgan said. "To this date, the federal government has not lived up to its obligation to reimburse North Dakota for land it lost when a permanent 500,000-acre flood was created in the middle of our state. This funding will help move that process forward, and in the meantime, give a significant boost to the effort to bring a safe, reliable supply of water to our rural communities." 
   Dorgan's provision will direct funding to 10 rural water supply projects in North Dakota. A list is below.
   NORTHWEST AREA WATER SUPPLY, $10 MILLION. This funding will be used to install pipeline in the city of Minot and to bring the water supply to Berthold.
