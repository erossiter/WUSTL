   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   June 7, 2006
   "President Bush and the House leaders have stiffed family farmers by rejecting the Senate's agriculture disaster package. They've decided to help only farmers in the Gulf Coast who were hit by hurricanes and turn a blind eye to weather-related farm disasters that occurred in parts of the country.
   "I fought as hard as I could until 1:00 this morning. The Senate conferees re-stated their support for the agriculture disaster package, but the House conferees rejected it and family farmers will pay the price. I'm very disappointed, but I intend to continue the fight for family farmers here in the Senate."
