SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS RE-OPENING OF KOREAN MARKET TO U.S. BEEF
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) applauded South Korea's agreement Friday to re-open its borders to U.S. beef, saying the resumption of American beef imports will be good both for Korean consumers and American ranchers. 
   Dorgan, Chairman of the Senate Interstate Trade, Commerce and Tourism Subcommittee, said the opening of South Korea's markets has taken an unjustifiably long time. He said he'll continue to monitor the resumption of U.S. beef imports, and said he'll make good on his pledge to hold hearings and pursue tariffs against South Korea if the country takes a step backward and decides to once again use baseless excuses to block U.S. imports.
   Before South Korea implemented its ban on American beef, it was the United States' third-largest export market, accounting for more than $800 million in annual exports.
   "U.S. ranchers have been frozen out of the South Korean market for far too long due to unfair market barriers. The re-opening of the Korean market is welcome news," Dorgan said. "But let's be clear: The Koreans should get no bonus points for this action. U.S. beef is the safest, healthiest beef you'll find anywhere in the world. Both Korean consumers and American ranchers will benefit from this long-overdue step."
