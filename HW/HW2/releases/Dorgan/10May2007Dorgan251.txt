INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN'S LEGISLATION TO COMBAT HEALTH CARE SHORTAGE IN AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES
  The Senate Indian Affairs Committee approved legislation authored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that would renew and improve the Indian Health Care Improvement Act - directing resources to combat the chronic shortage of health care services in American Indian communities. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration. 
   Dorgan, who chairs the committee and introduced the legislation along with Senator Craig Thomas and a bipartisan group of 15 other Senate colleagues, said it would make important strides in addressing the "bona fide crisis" in health care in tribal communities. The legislation takes a comprehensive approach to improving Indian health care, including:
   * Authorizing additional tools for tribal communities to address suicide among Indian youth;
   * Seeking to address lack of access to health care services, which may be due to limited hours of operation of existing facilities or other factors, by allowing grants for demonstration projects that include a convenient care services program as an alternative means of health care delivery;
   * Addressing the $1 billion backlog in needed health care facilities, such as alcohol and substance abuse treatment centers, and $1 billion in unmet need for sanitation facilities in tribal communities;
   * Making permanent a number of successful federal programs providing services to Native Americans in long-term health care, diabetes prevention, and other key areas;
   * Expanding scholarship and loan programs that encourage more American Indian people to enter health care professions;
   * Placing a higher emphasis on Indian health care by elevating the Director of the Indian Health Service to the Assistant Secretary for Indian Health in the Department of Health and Human Services.
   "The Indian Affairs Committee's passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act today is an important step forward in the effort to address the bona fide health care crisis on our reservations," Dorgan said. "I'm going to keep pushing Congress to get this bill to the President's desk so we can fulfill our obligation to provide adequate health care for our American Indian and Alaskan Native communities."
