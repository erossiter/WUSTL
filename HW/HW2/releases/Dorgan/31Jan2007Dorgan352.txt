NORTH DAKOTA HIGHWAY FUNDING REMAINS INTACT UNDER NEW APPROPRIATIONS BILL, SEN. DORGAN SAYS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday that the full expected funding for highways in North Dakota and across the country will be included a continuing resolution that will be considered by the House today and then the Senate.  
   Dorgan is a member of the Appropriations Committee group that worked to put the continuing resolution together. The resolution is an attempt to clean up a fiscal mess left by the previous Congress, which failed to enact 10 appropriations bills. It eliminates all earmarked projects. There had been concern that North Dakota would lose $30 million in highway funding because of the failure of the last Congress to finish action on the appropriations bills. 
   Industry experts estimate the resolution will provide more than $200 million for North Dakota's highways and create 1,500 new jobs in the state. 
   "I'm pleased there will be no loss in funding for our highways," Dorgan said. "The one bright spot is that the money for work on our highways has already been collected and is in the trust fund. That will ensure we don't lose ground in our efforts to improve the highways that are so important in rural states like North Dakota."
