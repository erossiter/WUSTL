SEN. DORGAN AMENDMENT WOULD PROVIDE NEW AUTHORITY TO STOP GASOLINE PRICE GOUGING
  The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee today approved an amendment by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) to crack down on price gouging on the price of gasoline. 
   The action came as the national average price for gasoline was setting a new all time high-price record.
   The amendment gives the President authority to declare a national energy emergency and make it illegal for suppliers to sell crude oil and gasoline at excessive prices in areas declared to be experiencing an energy emergency. It also gives the Federal Trade Commission and State Attorneys General greater authority to investigate price gouging year round.
   "We learned in the Enron scandal that energy markets are not only vulnerable to market manipulation, but in fact, have been manipulated at a cost of billions of dollars to consumers. And we learned after Hurricane Katrina, that there are some who will take advantage of unfortunate circumstances to price gouge," Dorgan said.
   "Clearly, we need to better investigate energy markets to detect fraud, abuse or manipulation of oil, gas and gasoline supplies," Dorgan said. "This amendment would authorize steps to improve our efforts to monitor whether manipulation is occurring, and would give the President authority to act to stop it, where manipulation or price gouging is found to be occurring."
   "History has shown that when price gouging and market manipulation occurs, it is not originating at the retail level," Dorgan added. "This isn't an amendment to look over the shoulder of the neighborhood gasoline station operator. They are often victims of price gouging as well."
