SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO ENDORSE EXTENSION OF INCENTIVE FOR WIND, OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues called on the President Friday to include in his budget for Fiscal Year 2008 a long-term extension of a tax incentive that has been key to the development of North Dakota's vast wind energy potential. 
   Dorgan, Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and other Senate colleagues said in a letter to the President that a five-year extension of the renewable energy production tax credit would give a boost to renewable energy projects in North Dakota and across America. The production tax credit in the past has been extended only for short periods, fostering uncertainty among investors. It is currently slated to expire on December 31, 2008. 
   Dorgan authored and introduced a bill last year to extend the renewable energy production tax credit for five years. He will play a leading role in developing energy policy in the 110th Congress, where he will chair the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   "The production tax credit has proven to be a valuable tool in developing wind energy projects in North Dakota and across the country," Dorgan said. "North Dakota is the Saudi Arabia of wind power, and we need to take steps that will develop our wind resources. That will bring good-paying jobs to our state, improve the health of our environment, and help reduce our nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy."
