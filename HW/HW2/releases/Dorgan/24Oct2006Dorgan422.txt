SEN. DORGAN SAYS ADMINISTRATION'S REVERSAL ON HANNAH PORT ABANDONS COMMON SENSE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has reversed course a second time and has now decided to reduce hours at the port of entry at Hannah, North Dakota. Dorgan said he thinks the decision is a mistake. 
   "Several weeks ago, Customs officials told me that the Hannah port of entry hours would remain 9 AM to 9 PM. Now the Washington, D.C. Customs office has reversed that decision and will close the post at 5 PM," Dorgan said.
   The hours will be reduced to 9 AM to 5 PM beginning October 29. Canadian border officials will retain the current hours of 9 AM to 9 PM.
   "This decision to reverse course again stands logic on its head. Why would you have different hours at the Canadian and U.S. ports of entry?" Dorgan said.
   "I think it's a decision without common sense. This will put travelers and the communities in the region at an unfair disadvantage, and I will keep pushing Customs and Border Patrol to reconsider again," he said.
