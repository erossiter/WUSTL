DELEGATION PRESSES ADMINISTRATION TO APPROVE DISASTER DECLARATION FOR 11 NORTH DAKOTA COUNTIES
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy called on the President Thursday to approve a major disaster declaration for 11 eastern North Dakota counties that were hit by severe storms in May and June. 
   In a letter to President Bush, the Congressional delegation urged quick approval for the disaster declaration that was requested by the Governor earlier this week. The delegation said the same weather-related disasters that necessitated passage of the agriculture disaster package earlier this year have drained state, local and tribal resources that would be used to respond to this year's severe weather.
   A disaster declaration from the President would direct federal funding to the affected areas to help repair roads and other public infrastructure.
   "The storms produced precipitation that was double and sometimes triple the normal levels for parts of this area of the state. In fact, some areas experienced the fifth wettest period on record for this time of year. Excessive rainfall coupled with overland flooding, hail, and high winds resulted in more than $1.5 million in damages," the delegation wrote.
