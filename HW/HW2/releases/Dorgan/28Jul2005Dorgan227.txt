SEN. DORGAN WINS COMMITTEE APPROVAL FOR AMENDMENT BARRING COMMERCIAL SALE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) won Commerce Committee approval Thursday for an amendment prohibiting the commercial sale of Social Security numbers, part of an effort to combat identity theft, a crime that, according to the Better Business Bureau, affected more than 9.3 million Americans last year.  
   Even though Americans are told routinely to protect their Social Security number, Dorgan said those same numbers are routinely bought and sold thousands of times a day by commercial data brokers and marketers. One company alone, ChoicePoint, says it has 17,000 business customers for such information, Dorgan noted. 
   Earlier this year, ChoicePoint acknowledged that it had compromised personal identification data of about 145,000 people - some of whom were later defrauded - when it sold personal data, including Social Security numbers, to criminals posing as a legitimate business. 
   "We tell people every day to protect your Social Security number, but so far have done nothing to protect Social Security numbers from being bought and sold," Dorgan said. "Most Americans have no idea that their Social Security numbers are being brokered about in commercial transactions all across this country, every day. We need to put a stop to it." 
   The amendment was added to S. 1408, the Identity Theft Protection Act, in the Senate Commerce Committee. The bill next goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
