SEN. DORGAN HOLDS TOWN HALL MEETING WITH KILLDEER-AREA RESIDENTS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) held a town hall meeting here Thursday to discuss the economy of the Killdeer region and the concerns of local residents. He also provided an update on his work in Congress, including his efforts to help enact a strong farm bill that provides a strong safety net for family farmers and ranchers. 
   Dorgan said he is pleased to see the growing economic activity in Killdeer. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he has secured more than $4 million to partner Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing with Boeing to develop a "tool kit" to help small and medium sized companies become more competitive in securing Defense subcontracts. The work will not only help grow KMM, but will help North Dakota businesses compete for those contracts.
   Dorgan also gave attendees the latest update on the farm bill. He said the farm bill approved by the Senate would be a boost to producers in North Dakota. He said the adjustments made to target prices and loan rates for some commodities will strengthen the safety net for family farmers. North Dakota producers will also benefit from the re-establishment of a permanent disaster relief program for family farmers, he said.
   "Thanks to the hard work of this community, this is a strong and growing town that we all can be proud of," Dorgan said. "I'm going to keep working to help strengthen our small towns, and I think the farm bill before Congress will do that. We need to get this bill done and give family farmers a helping hand when times are tough."
