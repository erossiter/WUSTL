   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   January 10, 2006 
   I called Northwest Airlines today to discuss the potential impact a reduction in Mesaba Airline's fleet would have in North Dakota. Mesaba has been a commuter carrier that is a partner of Northwest Airlines. 
   It's clear this restructuring is related to the recent bankruptcy filings by both Northwest and Mesaba. It's important that as these companies move forward with their plans, we don't lose frequency of flights in and out of North Dakota. That would clearly be harmful to business activity in our state, and the ability of North Dakotans to get to the Minneapolis hub and beyond. 
   I will continue to be in contact with Northwest and Mesaba to monitor the restructuring plans.
   Contact: Barry E. Piatt and Rebecca Pollard, 202/224-2551.
