SEN. DORGAN WORKING TO CONVENE HEARINGS ON MEXICAN TRUCK TEST PROGRAM AS ADMINISTRATION IGNORES NEW LAW ENDING IT
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), who authored a new law to shut down the controversial test program by the Department of Transportation that allows long-haul Mexican trucks to operate in the United States, said Friday he is working to schedule hearings where he'll ask the Administration to justify its decision to ignore the law that cut off funding for the program.  
   Dorgan is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and chairs its Interstate Commerce and Trade subcommittee. 
   He said he will ask Transportation Secretary Mary Peters to testify. "The Department of Transportation is acting as if the law somehow does not apply to them. I want the Secretary to come before Congress and try to defend what her department is doing. Congress passed this provision by wide margins. The President signed it. Now the Department of Transportation is ignoring it. I want to know, and I think a lot of others in the Senate want to know, how she can possibly defend that." 
   Dorgan said he is working to secure a date for the hearing, but expects it will take place "as soon as possible" when Congress returns the week of January 21.
