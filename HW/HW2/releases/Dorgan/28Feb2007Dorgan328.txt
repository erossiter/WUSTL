SEN. DORGAN CHALLENGES TOP DEFENSE OFFICIAL ON EFFORTS TO RETIRE B-52S
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) challenged top Defense Department officials at a hearing Wednesday on apparent efforts to skirt a Congressional mandate to retain a robust fleet of B-52s.  
   In a hearing of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan pressed Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England on the President's budget request that funds only 56 B-52s, despite a Congressional mandate that prevents the nation's B-52 fleet from falling below 76 active aircraft. 
   Last year, Dorgan offered an amendment, which was adopted and passed into law, barring the Air Force from retiring any B-52s until the completion of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study. Dorgan said he is confident the detailed study, which would address America's long-range strike capabilities, would show the retirement would create a bomber gap. 
   "Congress has taken the position that our nation is best served by a fleet of 76 B-52 bombers," Dorgan said. "If the Air Force is allowed to move these B-52s to storage, they will very soon declare a bomber gap and want more taxpayer money to develop a new bomber fleet. Our B-52s are the lowest-cost bombers to operate and have decades of life left. Maintaining them is the best use of taxpayer dollars. It makes no sense to try to save money by cutting the most cost-efficient tool in our long-range arsenal."
