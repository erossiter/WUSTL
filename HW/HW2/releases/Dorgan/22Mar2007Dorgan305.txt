DELEGATION ANNOUNCES BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AGREES TO FUND UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy announced today that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has agreed to their request to provide as much as $3.5 million in federal grants to United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) in Bismarck to ensure the school has the funding it needs to continue its operations through Fiscal Year 2007.  
   Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne called the delegation Wednesday to tell them he had agreed to their request to provide the funding to UTTC. 
   The President has proposed for five consecutive years to eliminate Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funding for UTTC, but Congress has each time restored the funding. After the leadership of the last Congress failed to finish its appropriations bills, the delegation persuaded the BIA to fund the school through the "continuing resolution" that was passed by Congress to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year. 
   "United Tribes Technical College has distinguished itself as one of the top tribal colleges in the nation," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This school is an important resource for our American Indian communities and we're pleased this funding will come through so it can continue its important educational mission."
