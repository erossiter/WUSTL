SEN. DORGAN TO BURLINGTON NORTHERN: SCRAP PLAN TO INCREASE SPEED OF TRAINS THROUGH CASSELTON
  Sen. Byron Dorgan, in a letter to the CEO of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, asked the company Thursday to scrap plans to increase train speeds to 60 miles per hour through the main street of Casselton, North Dakota.  
 Dorgan said that if the railroad insists on increasing these train speeds he may ask Congress to intervene.
   Dorgan - who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee, which has responsibility for railroad issues - said in a letter to CEO Matthew Rose that the decision to increase train speeds through the middle of Casselton ignores legitimate concerns and objections from citizens of that community.
   "It may well be that because of a Supreme Court decision you can increase your speed and make it stick. But that doesn't make it right," Dorgan wrote. "I believe a railroad has a responsibility to consider local interests, and I think the interests of the city of Casselton should be respected by Burlington Northern."
   Dorgan said that Casselton city officials indicated in previous discussions that they were concerned about public safety and potential damage to historic property as a result of the increased train speeds. 
   "Those are legitimate concerns, and I believe Burlington Northern ought to consider them and scrap their current plans to increase train speeds," Dorgan said.
