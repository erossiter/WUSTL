SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY BODMAN TO SPEAK AT ENERGY EXPO
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Friday that U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman will be a keynote speaker at the first-ever Great Plains Energy Expo that Sen. Dorgan is hosting along with Bismarck State College and Kadrmas, Lee and Jackson. The Energy Expo will be held October 29-30, 2007, at the Bismarck Civic Center Exhibition Hall. 
   "Secretary Bodman recognizes the capacity of North Dakota to lead our country in energy development," said Dorgan. "I look forward to having discussions with Secretary Bodman and North Dakota's energy leaders on how our state can play an even larger role in shaping our nation's energy security."
   The Energy Expo will expand the work of the Energy Corridor initiative that Dorgan conceived to develop North Dakota's diverse energy resources and bring business investments to the state. The Energy Expo will feature seminars, a trade show and speakers that highlight new, innovative energy technology being developed in North Dakota.
   Secretary Bodman has served as Secretary of Energy since 2005. He has also served the Bush Administration as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Deputy Secretary of the Department of Commerce.
   As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, Senator Dorgan is pushing for a comprehensive plan to achieve energy independence by encouraging efficiency and conservation, while at the same time developing domestic fossil fuel and renewable energy sources.
