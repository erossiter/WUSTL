SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES BILL TO ALLOW PARK SERVICE TO USE NORTH DAKOTA HUNTERS TO THIN OVERGROWN ELK HERD AT THEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced legislation Monday that would allow the National Park Service to use qualified volunteer hunters from North Dakota to thin the elk herd that has outgrown Theodore Roosevelt National Park and is damaging its habitat.  
   Dorgan's bill would allow the Park Service to develop a set of guidelines that would allow qualified North Dakota hunters to help cull the elk herd, which has outgrown the park's south unit since the animals were reintroduced in 1985. The south unit of the national park can support about 360 elk, but is being overtaxed by the estimated 750 to 900 elk that now live there. 
   "Everyone agrees that the elk herd at Theodore Roosevelt National Park has outgrown its habitat, and we need to find a way to keep them from doing permanent damage," Dorgan said. "If we need to thin the herd, I don't see any sense in spending millions of dollars to bring in federal sharpshooters and helicopters when we have qualified hunters in North Dakota that would do it free of charge. This bill would allow the Park Service to set up some standards to make sure we use only qualified and responsible hunters to thin the herd and still protect the national park."
