SEN. DORGAN'S RED RIVER RESEARCH COORIDOR EFFORT GETS ANOTHER BIG BOOST FROM KEY COMMITTEE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan's effort to bring new, high paying jobs to North Dakota by using his Appropriations Committee seat to steer federal research and development projects to the state won a big vote of confidence from a key joint House-Senate committee Wednesday. It approved more than $50 million for national defense related high-tech research and training work in North Dakota as part of the Defense Appropriations bill.  
   The legislation significantly enhances micro-technology and nano-technology research work in North Dakota, initiatives which are already attracting new businesses and new, high-tech jobs to the state. The legislation includes more than $30 million for those specific efforts in the state over the next fiscal year. 
   "This is a huge step forward, and confirms that the idea I've advanced to create a Red River Research Corridor is not only a good idea, it is an idea that is working. North Dakota is clearly entering a new era of being on the cutting edge of federal high-tech research and training, and that means new jobs and better paying jobs in our state." 
   "This is very important," Dorgan added. "Much of this work is on technologies that are on the cutting edge of both national defense and private-sector commercialization. The potential for North Dakota's economy from all this is very big." 
   A joint House-Senate conference committee moved the latest round of funds forward Wednesday night when it voted to approve the Defense Appropriations bill. Dorgan was a member of the Appropriations Committee that wrote the Senate version of the bill, and served on the conference committee which worked out a final version of the bill It now goes to the House and Senate for final approval before being sent on to President Bush to be signed into law.
