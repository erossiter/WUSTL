SEN. DORGAN MEETS WITH DEVILS LAKE OFFICIALS TO STRATEGIZE ON WATER SUPPLY FUNDING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) vowed today to fight hard to get the funding needed to build a new water pipeline in Devils Lake.  
   Following a meeting in his Washington office with Devils Lake Mayor Fred Bott and City Engineer Mike Grafsgaard about the critical need for a new water supply system, Dorgan said he will use his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee in the upcoming Fiscal Year 2007 budget cycle to help convince his colleagues that the situation in Devils Lake requires emergency-level funding. 
   Six miles, or about one-third, of the city's existing water pipeline is currently underwater due to the rising waters of Devils Lake. If the line fails, the city could find itself without a water supply. Dorgan has secured $1.7 million in federal funding for the study and design of a new water supply system in the last three years. But, estimates for a new water supply total $15 million. 
   "There's no doubt these are tough fiscal times," Dorgan said. "But tough times simply require us to prioritize and make funding choices based on need. Clearly, there is a need to get the city of Devils Lake a new water supply system, and to get it soon. I intend to do everything possible to secure more federal funding to help get this project moving along." 
   The meeting was one of several the Devils Lake officials are attending with congressional members and staff in Washington this week. 
   "We had a productive meeting, and I think the efforts by Mayor Bott and Mike Grafsgaard in coming to meet with so many of the parties involved in funding this project are the best way to make the case that the Devils Lake water supply must be shored up now," Dorgan said.
