SENATE PASSES BILL ALLOWING TAXPAYERS TO CLAIM JANUARY '05 TSUNAMI AID DONATIONS ON '04 RETURNS
  Both houses of Congress passed a bill Thursday that lawmakers hope will encourage Americans to make even more donations to victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami, said Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND), a cosponsor of the Senate proposal. 
   The bill allows North Dakotans and other Americans who make cash contributions in January 2005 to help tsunami victims deduct those contributions on their 2004 tax returns. This tax relief is available for Americans who choose to itemize their deductions, and whose cash donations are made for the sole purpose of providing relief to victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami. 
   "Time and time again, when parts of the world experience unthinkable disasters, Americans have proven their generosity," Dorgan said. "I hope this bill will encourage Americans to give generously and immediately to the charities involved in the massive tsunami recovery effort. Under the bill, those who do will be able to deduct the contributions they make this month on their 2004 tax returns." 
   The bill, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent Thursday, now goes to the President for his signature.
