SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES COMPUTERS TO GO TO FIVE NORTH DAKOTA SCHOOLS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday that five North Dakota public schools will receive surplus computers from the federal government, a contribution that will help expand students' exposure to technology and enhance their education. 
   The North Dakota schools that will receive the computers are Parshall Public School, Killdeer High School, Glen Ullin Elementary School, Hatton High School and Sawyer Elementary School.
   The five schools, which Dorgan nominated for the gift under the U.S. Senate's "Computers for Schools" program, will each receive five computers that are no more than three years old. Dorgan said the program will help bolster the supply of computers and improve students' computer skills at schools that otherwise are only able to offer limited computer access.
   "Solid computer skills are crucial for today's students as they prepare for college and the working world," Dorgan said. "We know from their performance on standardized tests that North Dakota's students are some of the best in the nation, and schools can use this equipment to add another skill to the toolbox our kids will take into the world."
