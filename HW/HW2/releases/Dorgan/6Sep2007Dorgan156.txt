SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD SECURE NEARLY $66 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN MILITARY BASES IN NORTH DAKOTA
  The U.S. Senate approved an appropriations bill Thursday that includes nearly $66 million in federal funding secured by Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad to strengthen North Dakota's military bases and missions. 
   Dorgan and Conrad said the bill demonstrates Congress' strong support for our nation's military, directing more funding to programs that ensure our troops are supported by strong infrastructure and have the health care they need when they leave military service. The senators worked to add $3.6 billion to the President's request for veterans health care, benefits processing and other services. The bill calls for expedited development of community-based outreach clinics, including those planned in Grand Forks and Devils Lake, and a quick evaluation of the state's application for funding to replace the state Veterans Home in Lisbon.
   The senators also included funding in the bill to bolster several of North Dakota's military installations:
   * $33.4 million to begin construction of a new combat engineer training facility at Camp Grafton near Devils Lake. The project includes building a 182,000-square-foot facility that will be used to train combat engineers from across the United States for the National Guard and Army Reserve. 
   * $13 million to renovate Grand Forks Air Force Base's control tower. Although the tower is one of the busiest in the Air Force thanks to its support of the Grand Forks International Airport and University of North Dakota flight training program, it is undersized and its windows leak during heavy rains, putting expensive equipment in jeopardy. 
   * $18.2 million to construct a new 144-room dormitory for enlisted personnel at Minot Air Force Base. 
   * $1.28 million to convert a hangar at Grand Forks Air Force Base to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicles. The project will help ready the base for the new aircraft, which are expected to arrive at Grand Forks in 2009 and will be operated by Fargo's Happy Hooligans. 
  "The passage of this bill is an important step forward in our effort to make sure our troops and our veterans have the equipment and support they deserve," Senator Dorgan said. "Our state is home to some of the best troops and training facilities in the country, and this will make sure it stays that way."
   "I am very excited about the major investments this bill will make in our bases and the men and women who serve both North Dakota and our nation," Senator Conrad said. "This bill will transform Camp Grafton into a state-of-the-art engineer training center. It will further strengthen Grand Forks' appeal as the home for next-generation tanker aircraft. And it finally keeps our nation's promises to veterans who have made tremendous sacrifices for our country."
