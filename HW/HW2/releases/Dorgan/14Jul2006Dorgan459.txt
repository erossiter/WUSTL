SEN. DORGAN SECURES FUNDING FOR OFFICE TO COORDINATE ENERGY CORRIDOR IN WESTERN NORTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Friday he has secured $250,000 in federal funding to coordinate an Energy Corridor in western North Dakota. Dorgan has proposed creating the concept of an Energy Corridor to help tap into western North Dakota's potential to lead the Upper Great Plains in energy development - spurring the state's economy and creating new high-paying jobs. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, included the funding in the Fiscal Year 2007 Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill to develop a Great Plains Energy Corridor Coordinating Office in Bismarck.
   The office will work with energy researchers and industry to develop new and innovative ways to increase production, invest in the region's energy infrastructure, and develop new energy sources specific to the Northern Great Plains. The office also will provide educational and outreach services and serve as a clearinghouse of information for the region's energy industry, Dorgan said.
   "The potential of North Dakota's energy industry to grow is almost unbelievable," Dorgan said. "We have the country's most diverse set of resources in coal, oil, wind, biofuels and other forms of energy. By coordinating a statewide effort to harness those resources and expand our energy industry, we can spur North Dakota's economy and create good, high-paying jobs at home."
   The Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill goes next to the full Senate for consideration.
