SEN. SAYS RURAL STATES HARDEST HIT BY SPIKING GASOLINE PRICES; NORTH DAKOTANS PAYING NEARLY $500,000 A DAY MORE THAN YEAR AGO
  Sen. Byron Dorgan, in a speech on the Senate floor Friday, called on the Administration to take three specific steps to begin putting downward pressure on gasoline prices. Dorgan said that citizens in sparsely populated, agricultural states such as North Dakota are hit twice as hard by these gas price increases because they use twice as much fuel per person as do people who live in New York. Dorgan said that North Dakotans are paying nearly $500,000 a day more for gasoline than they did a year ago due to increased prices, and he called on the Administration to take the following three steps: 
   * Immediately stop putting 150,000 barrels of oil a day into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The Reserve is 96 percent filled and it makes no sense to be taking oil out of the supply line right now and putting it underground in Louisiana when doing so puts upward pressure on oil prices during a time of tight supplies.
   * The President should immediately begin using leverage and "jaw-boning" to pressure Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to temporarily increase production this summer. The Administration is silent when we should be putting heavy pressure, in particular, on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other Gulf states to increase supply. During the last Presidential campaign, then-candidate Bush spoke specifically about how he would "jaw-bone" OPEC. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is scheduled to meet with OPEC ministers this weekend at an international energy forum in Amsterdam. This is the time to begin applying pressure on the OPEC cartel.
   * This ought to be the final wake-up call needed for the President and Congress to understand that we cannot continue to be held hostage by OPEC's unwillingness to supply oil for our country. We need a Manhattan Project and an Apollo Project to dramatically reduce our dependence on OPEC's supplies, and that effort ought to begin now, not later, with a major effort to move to a hydrogen/fuel cell economy.
