SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN AMENDMENT TO NEARLY DOUBLE FUNDING FOR TRIBAL COLLEGE INFRASTRUCTURE
  The U.S. Senate approved Wednesday an amendment offered by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that will nearly double funding to help tribal colleges serve their students by making improvements to buildings and other infrastructure. 
   Dorgan's amendment, which was co-sponsored by Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), will increase to $5 million the federal funding devoted to the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program. Through the program, tribal colleges and universities receive funding on a competitive basis to improve their facilities and help expand the role of the schools in their communities.
   All of North Dakota's tribal colleges have benefited from the program. Since 2001, North Dakota's tribal colleges and universities have received more than $5.5 million for projects on their campuses.
   "Our tribal colleges provide an avenue for students who want to advance their education and their career. That's a critical function for our American Indian communities," Dorgan said. "This amendment will help make sure these schools have the resources they need to train their students and to expand their involvement with the community. That will not only improve the education for American Indian students, but can bring services like health care and job training to the community."
   Dorgan's amendment was added to the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate today. He is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
