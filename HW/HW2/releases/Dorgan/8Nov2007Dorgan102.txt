SEN. DORGAN SAYS WATER BILL WILL HELP PROTECT WATER SUPPLIES, RECREATION INDUSTRY IN NORTH DAKOTA
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Congress' action to override a presidential veto of the Water Resources Development Act will give a boost to efforts to ensure all communities in North Dakota have access to a safe, reliable supply of water. Dorgan worked with Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy to include crucial North Dakota projects in the bill. 
   "We face some significant challenges with respect to water issues not just in North Dakota, but across the country," Dorgan said. "No community should have to worry that their access to potable water will be cut off, or that their home or business will be overtaken by floodwaters. That's not good for public health and not good for the economy. This bill will provide an investment in communities in North Dakota and across the United States so they have the infrastructure they need to plan for the future."
   As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan plays a key role in setting the nation's water priorities. Among the water projects authorized by the Water Resources Development Act are:
   * $15 million to construct a new municipal water supply for the city of Devils Lake. The city's water line is currently submerged by the rising lake. A leak in the line would be almost impossible to repair and would leave the city's 7,000 residents without a source of drinking water.
   * $25 million to reduce reduce sedimentation, improve conservation practices, enhance recreation and protect historical and cultural sites along the Missouri River in North Dakota. This will safeguard water supplies and ensure recreational access to the river.
   * $15 million to help communities in North Dakota pay for construction and repair of water supply systems, wastewater treatment plants and other water projects.
   * $5 million to bolster the flood control system in Wahpeton.
