SEN. DORGAN CO-SPONSORS BILL TO TACKLE FLU VACCINE SHORTAGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) has co-sponsored a bill to give the nation's health agencies the tools to provide Americans with enough flu vaccine to ensure that every person at high risk for flu this winter can be vaccinated.  
   "America is in a flu vaccine crisis," Dorgan said. "Thousands of people, many of them elderly or very young, die of influenza each year. North Dakota, with a population that's older than average, is especially at risk. Now that our nation is faced with an unexpected shortage of vaccine, Congress needs to step in and give our health professionals the tools they need to protect the public." 
   The nation's flu vaccine supply was abruptly cut nearly in half last week when contamination problems in a plant in England prompted the British government to suspend the license of one of the two companies that make the 100 million flu vaccines United States residents are expected to seek this winter. 
   The North Dakota Department of Health reported 1,663 cases of influenza in the 2003-2004 flu season and 386 flu-related deaths. The vast majority of the fatal cases were in people over age 65. 
   The Emergency Flu Response Act of 2004 would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to purchase flu vaccine from Europe, Canada, or Japan, if the exporting nation's government has approved the vaccine. The bill would also provide funding to states to develop plans to effectively distribute the vaccine, and would guarantee that people would not lose their job or income when following a recommendation or requirement for quarantine. 
   It would also require federal agencies to follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in determining who would receive the vaccine. Dorgan said he hopes the Senate will consider the measure promptly when it resumes in November.
