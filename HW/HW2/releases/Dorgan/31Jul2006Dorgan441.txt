SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON SOUTH KOREA TO END UNJUSTIFIED BAN ON SAFE, AMERICAN BEEF
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Monday called on South Korea to end its unjustified delay in resuming imports of American beef. 
   Dorgan, in a letter to South Korean Ambassador Lee Tae Sik, warned that many Members of Congress are losing patience with South Korea's decision to continue to keep out American beef, even as other countries resume imports.
   "Mr. Ambassador, when I travel throughout North Dakota, I talk to ranchers who are extremely frustrated with the slow pace of reopening lost export markets for U.S. beef," Dorgan wrote. "Ranchers in North Dakota ask me why America should continue to accept imports of South Korean automobiles, electronics and other goods if our exports of beef are not accepted."
