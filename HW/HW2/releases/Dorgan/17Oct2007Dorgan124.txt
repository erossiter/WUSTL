SEN. DORGAN SAYS DOT PRESS CONFERENCE ON MEXICAN TRUCKS IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION NEEDED TO ENSURE SAFETY
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday the inspection of a "hand picked" Mexican truck at a Washington, D.C. press conference is "no substitute" for getting needed information about Mexican trucks and drivers entering the United States.  
   Dorgan is the author of an amendment to cut off funds for the Department of Transportation's (DOT) pilot program allowing Mexican long-haul trucks and drivers into the United States. It was approved by the Senate on a 74-24 vote on September 11, 2007, during consideration of the Transportation Department's appropriations bill. The House passed identical language. 
   "Congress has spoken loud and clear in its opposition to allowing long-haul Mexican trucks to enter the United States, based on concerns that included a lack of access to Mexican driver and vehicle safety records," Dorgan said. "Instead of responding to those concerns, the Administration rushed its pilot program into implementation and is now presenting a fancy press conference in Washington, D.C. that features the 'inspection' of one, hand picked Mexican truck." 
   That inspection "means nothing," Dorgan said. "The information we need to ensure the safety of American drivers on American highways is not available. That includes vehicle inspection and drivers' records and accidents reports. None of that information is available. An 'inspection' of a hand picked Mexican truck at a press conference doesn't change that."
