SEN. DORGAN WELCOMES WTO ACTION ON CHINA COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS, SAYS IT IS LONG OVERDUE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday the decision by the U.S. Trade Representative to file two cases at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for copyright and trade mark violations on a wide range of products by China is "welcome, but long overdue."  
   "I introduced legislation (S. Res. 142) in May of 2005 calling for a WTO case against China for piracy," Dorgan said. "Back then, I noted that Chinese violations of U.S. intellectual property rights were costing $200 billion a year." 
   "The two and a half year delay between then and now means U.S. producers lost an additional $300 billion while the U.S. Trade Representative dithered and took no action," he said. 
   "I welcome this filing - at long last - but the fundamental question is why did it take so long for the U.S. Trade Representative to act? What we have here are really two problems: China's theft of U.S. intellectual property, and the failure of the U.S. Trade Representative to act in a timely manner to stop that theft."
