SEN. DORGAN NOMINATES NORTH DAKOTA STUDENTS TO ATTEND U.S. MILITARY ACADEMIES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday he has given "principal nominations" to seven North Dakota students for appointment to U.S. military service academies in 2006. The seven students receiving Dorgan's "principal nominations," upon successful completion of a final physical and medical examination, will receive four-year, tuition-free appointments to their selected military academies - the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, NY, the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, or the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO.  
   "These nominees are outstanding students and young citizens, and have shown exceptional ability in their academic work and extra-curricular activities," Dorgan said. "An appointment to one of the United States' military service academies is an opportunity to serve our country in a challenging but rewarding way. I think these students are excellent candidates for this service and I'm proud to nominate them." 
   Dorgan also nominated 18 other North Dakotans to enter a competitive national pool for any additional slots that are available at the military academies. 
   The nominations are the culmination of a rigorous selection process that includes a competitive review of the students' achievements and physical conditioning, as well as personal interviews with military officials and a selection panel. The appointment requires a commitment of five years on active duty following graduation. 
   Dorgan's seven principal nominees are: 
   * Autumn Ericksrud, a senior at Edgeley High School, has been recommended for appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Autumn is the daughter of Steve and Twila Ericksrud of Montpelier, North Dakota.
