SEN. DORGAN ASKS SENATE TO PULL PLUG ON CISNEROS INVESTIGATION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan asked the Senate Thursday to cut off funds for the Independent Counsel's investigation of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, ten years after the investigation began, five and a half years after Cisneros pled guilty to a misdemeanor and paid a $10,000 fine, and four years after he received a presidential pardon.  
   The Independent Counsel, David Barrett, has spent $21 million so far on investigation, more than half of which - $10.6 million - was spent after Cisneros resigned from office, pled guilty and paid his fine. During that time period, no further charges have been filed. 
   "There seems to be no end to this," Dorgan said, "as Mr. Barrett continues to spend taxpayers' dollars by the millions on an investigation that should have ended years ago." 
   Dorgan noted Barrett has been promising for several years that he was wrapping up the investigation. "Since Mr. Barrett seems unable to end this himself, I think the Senate should do so," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan's amendment, to the Supplemental Appropriations bill, would cut off further funds for the investigation. It is now pending in the Senate.
