SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS ETHANOL RULING BY EPA, SAYS IT'S VICTORY FOR CLEAN AIR, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATION'S FARMERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan applauded action by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today, requiring California, Connecticut and New York to use gasoline additives like ethanol to help fight air pollution.  
   Dorgan called the EPA's findings and its order "a big victory for ethanol and for clean air." Ethanol can be produced from corn and represents a potentially huge new market for agricultural products. Dorgan is the author of a provision included in the Senate's Energy bill that would require the use of 8 billion gallons of ethanol in the nation's automobile fleets by 2012. 
   "The EPA's decision affirms the view, which is very well documented, that ethanol is a safe product that can be used as a fuel extender and that does not cause problems with national ambient air quality standards when blended with gasoline," Dorgan said. "Those who claim otherwise are just not accurate. The EPA has made the right decision, and one that will pay great dividends in reducing air pollution, giving farmers a much needed economic boost, and helping our country achieve greater energy independence from foreign oil. 
   The three states had requested a waiver to allow them to ignore Clean Air Act provisions that require use of the additives, claiming use of ethanol interfered with their ability to meet the Clean Air Act's air pollution requirements. 
   Today's EPA ruling says the states failed to show that using ethanol interfered with their ability to meet the requirements and ordered them to do so.
