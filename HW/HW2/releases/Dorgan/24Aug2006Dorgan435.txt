SEN. DORGAN HOLDS FACT-FINDING HEARING ON FUTURE WATER SUPPLY IN RED RIVER VALLEY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) held a fact-finding hearing here Thursday to help determine the best strategy for the state and federal government to ensure the Red River Valley has an adequate water supply well into the future.  
   Dorgan held an official hearing of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee on the issue. The state and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, along with other federal agencies, are considering options to bolster the water supply in the Red River Valley, which could be subject to severe water shortages if current population growth continues. Dorgan is Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, and sits on the committee that funds the Bureau of Reclamation. 
   "The federal government authorized the plan to ensure the Red River Valley has an adequate supply of water, and has an obligation to follow through," Dorgan said. "The Red River ran dry in the '30s and it likely will do so again someday. If that happens, Fargo and Grand Forks will be in trouble. I hope our discussion today will help us better understand these challenges and choose the best route to establish a water supply that will support the growing population of the Red River Valley."
