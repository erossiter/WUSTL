SEN. DORGAN SAYS PENTAGON ANNOUNCEMENT CONFIRMS AIR FORCE'S COMMITMENT TO GRAND FORKS, FARGO
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday the Pentagon's announcement released this week about the emerging Air National Guard and Air Force missions at Grand Forks and Fargo are further proof of the commitment the Air Force has made to North Dakota's military installations. 
   Dorgan, along with Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy, received the announcement Tuesday.
   While Predator Aircraft are not due to be based in North Dakota until 2009, Dorgan said the Happy Hooligans are scheduled to begin piloting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in combat missions over Iraq and Afghanistan from their base in Fargo by next March.
   Dorgan also noted that the Happy Hooligans in Fargo are expected to start operating C-21 LearJets sometime this fall. The C-21s are small eight-passenger jet transports that are used for cargo and passenger airlift and for aeromedical evacuations. The Air Force agreed to send the C-21s to Fargo after the delegation requested an interim manned flying mission for the unit until the larger Joint Cargo Aircraft is deployed in around 2010.
   "The Pentagon's announcement confirms what Air Force Chief of Staff General Mike Moseley told me and the other members of the delegation two weeks ago about the emerging missions at Grand Forks and Fargo," Dorgan said. "We know that Grand Forks Air Force Base will be home to a full fleet of Predator and Global Hawk UAVs. The Air National Guard in Fargo will collaborate with this mission, and also operate a new fleet of Joint Cargo Aircraft. I hope we'll also see a new generation of tankers return to Grand Forks. "This is great news for the Red River Valley and for the state of North Dakota. It's clear that the Air Force envisions a robust role for North Dakota in maintaining the security of our nation for decades to come."
