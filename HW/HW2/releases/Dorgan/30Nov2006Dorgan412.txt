   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   November 30, 2006
   "Today, I met with U.S. Secretary of Defense nominee Robert Gates. Mr. Gates has a distinguished record, having previously served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. His confirmation could mean a crucial turning point for our current situation in Iraq. 
   "Although I will want to see what the Senate hearing discloses, unless something unusual arises I am inclined to support the Gates nomination. 
   "We need new leadership at the Pentagon, and we need to move forward as quickly as possible to fill this vacancy. As we enter the 21st Century, the U.S. faces many complex threats throughout the world and we need creative leadership at the Department of Defense that can work with Congress and our allies to protect and promote our interests."
