SEN. DORGAN PUSHES DRU'S LAW THROUGH SENATE
  "Dru's Law" won unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate Thursday evening, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), the author of the bill, announced today.  
   Dorgan's legislation - named after Dru Sjodin, who was abducted from a Grand Forks shopping mall two years ago and murdered - would require significant monitoring of known violent sex offenders judged to be at high risk for re-offending when they are released from custody. It would also give local prosecutors new tools to keep known violent sex offenders institutionalized even after completing a prison term if their mental state was determined to place them at high risk for committing another violent sex crime. 
   "This is a significant step forward in protecting the public from dangerous sexual predators that we know are at high risk to re-offend," Dorgan said. "This bill is named in memory of Dru Sjodin, but as you know, there have been far too many other cases - including the recent case involving repeat sex offender Joseph Duncan III - that underscore exactly why this legislation is needed. It's time to really start protecting our kids by increasing the tools available to justice system and to the public." 
   The bill, which Dorgan cosponsored with Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), passed under an agreement Dorgan brokered with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist Thursday. Dorgan said the timing was particularly important because Congress is set to recess for the month of August this weekend. 
   "Dru's Law" also creates a national sex offender registry that allows the public to search by zipcode across state lines. The Department of Justice is in the process of implementing a registry, but this legislation would make that registry bound by law. 
   Dorgan said he is hopeful that the House will act on its companion bill to "Dru's Law" this fall.
