SEN. DORGAN AMENDMENT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED U.S. MILITARY BASE CLOSURES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) teamed with Republican Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS) and others Tuesday in leading an effort in the U.S. Senate to limit the next round of military base closures to bases located overseas only.  
 The amendment would have prevented another round of base closings in the United States until at least 2007. 
   "We believed we should put first things first," Dorgan said. "The Cold War is over, and the world has changed. Now we face the prospect of terrorism at home as well as abroad. We have troops all over the world, including more than 70,000 in Germany alone. Before we close any bases in the United States, it seems to make sense that we should know first what bases overseas will be closed, and where we are going to put soldiers now at those bases when they are closed. Let's know what our real needs are before we close bases here in the United States." 
   Dorgan said that because the margin of defeat was just two votes, and there were three Senators missing, the measure could be reconsidered in the next several days, although that decision has not yet been made. 
   Dorgan noted that the Pentagon forecast for 2005-2009 assumes a military force the same size as it is now and assumes that forces based overseas would remain overseas. "Those are not realistic assumptions," Dorgan said. "We don't know what our military needs will be in the future, especially in 10 or 20 years. If anything, the uncertainty of the current times and the ongoing war against terrorism suggests we'll need more forces, not less. This is no time to be closing bases."
