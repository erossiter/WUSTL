OMNIBUS BILL INCLUDES SEN. DORGAN MEASURE FOR HYDROGEN RESEARCH CENTER AT EERC
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), ranking member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, said Saturday that House and Senate conferees reached agreement to include and fund Dorgan's proposal for a new center for hydrogen fuel cell research at the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota (UND).  
   "This funding is another significant step in building world-class research capabilities at the EERC on an issue that I believe is going to be front and center in America's drive to reduce its dependence on foreign oil," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan, who has led the way in Congress pushing for a hydrogen fuel cell future that would replace the internal combustion engine with fuel cells that use hydrogen for fuel, believes that would remove our dependence on oil from the Persian Gulf. 
   The funding will move the EERC in the direction of becoming one of the top hydrogen fuel cell research facilities in the nation, Dorgan said. 
   The Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2005 provides $10.3 million in advanced research projects at the EERC, including $3 million to create the hydrogen fuel research center. 
   Dorgan said these projects will continue to enhance the Red River Research Corridor, his initiative to connect North Dakota companies, universities and colleges with federal research and training contracts in order to develop the North Dakota economy and create good jobs. 
   The House approved the Omnibus Bill Saturday and quick approval is expected in the Senate before the bill goes to the White House for the President's signature.
