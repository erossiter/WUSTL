SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE TO SLASH AMTRAK FUNDING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) reacted Wednesday to a House subcommittee vote to cut funding for Amtrak and its Empire Builder route, saying he will push in the Senate to give the rail service the funding it needs to serve all Americans.  
   The U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation voted to give Amtrak only $550 million for the next fiscal year, far short of the $1.8 billion Amtrak says it needs to fully fund operations and new capital investments. The cut would mean the end of cross-country routes such as the Empire Builder, which serves 90,000 North Dakotans every year. 
   "This vote is not the final answer," Dorgan said. "Those in this subcommittee agree with the President that we should shut down long-distance trains, but there are many more in the House and Senate that disagree. Long-distance trains are an important part of our transportation network." 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee and Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, said he would work to restore funding for Amtrak. "We're going to fight very hard to save these trains," Dorgan said. "Cross country trains are very important to our national network and the Empire Builder is very important to North Dakota. We're determined to keep them running."
