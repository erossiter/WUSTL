PROPOSAL FILED WITH DOT TO ADD THIRD FLIGHT FROM WILLISTON, DICKINSON TO DENVER
  On Monday, October 23, Great Lakes Airlines filed a proposal for adding a third flight from Williston and Dickinson to Denver under the Essential Air Service (EAS) program through the Department of Transportation. Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) has supported adding a third flight and is encouraged by the proposal issued by the current carrier servicing these airports, Great Lakes Airlines. The communities have been asked by DOT to submit comments. 
   "With increased economic development and exploration into oil reserves, these communities in western North Dakota need this third flight," said Dorgan. "I will continue working with the local communities to encourage the Department of Transportation to approve a third flight on this route."
   There are currently only two flights servicing Williston and Dickinson daily. Estimates show this year, boardings at Williston increased by 23 percent and Dickinson by 12 percent. In August, the state's total airline boardings were at an all-time historical high.
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has supported funding for the Essential Air Service program, which lends critical support to airline service in several North Dakota cities.
