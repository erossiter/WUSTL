SEN. DORGAN SAYS ARMY CORPS MOVING FORWARD ON NEW FORT STEVENSON MARINA, CONTRACT COULD BE AWARDED AS EARLY AS THIS WEEK
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday the Army Corps of Engineers expects to formally award a contract to a North Dakota construction firm for a new marina at Fort Stevenson in North Dakota, perhaps as early as the end of the week.  
   The firm, Martin Construction of Gladstone, North Dakota, submitted a bid of $6.1 million for the work. Dorgan said the Army Corps of Engineers said there are some technical issues to be worked out before the contract is formally awarded, but added, "It looks like we'll be moving forward very shortly." 
   Dorgan is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee which funded the water project. He pushed for and won a commitment from the Army Corps of Engineers to replace the marina, and then funded it through his subcommittee. 
   "It has taken the Army Corps of Engineers longer to make good on their commitment, but they are doing so, and that is great news for North Dakotans and the regional economy. It will be a big boost for recreation, sportsmen and women, and the economy to have a Fort Stevenson marina back in operation."
