SEN. DORGAN SAYS MINIMUM WAGE HIKE WILL HELP THOUSANDS OF NORTH DAKOTA WORKERS
  The U.S. Senate voted Thursday evening to raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), who voted to approve the legislation, said the move will give a wage hike to tens of thousands of North Dakota workers.  
   About 21,000 workers - or 7.2 percent of the state's work force - will receive a well-deserved raise as a direct result of the legislation, Dorgan said. The ripple effects of the minimum wage hike will give a pay increase to another 27,000 North Dakotans. 
   Workers making $5.15 an hour make about $10,700 per year, just barely more than poverty level, Dorgan noted. A recent North Dakota State University study estimates the cost of living for a family of three in North Dakota to be $33,660. 
   "It's been nearly 10 years since we increased the minimum wage," said Dorgan. "A substantial number of people in North Dakota and across the country are at the bottom of the economic ladder, and we need to provide them with some help. Today's passage of the minimum wage was the right thing to do."
