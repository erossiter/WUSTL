SEN. DORGAN PRESSES U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY TO CONCLUDE STUDY ON BAKKEN SHALE OIL RESERVE IN NORTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is pressing the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to complete its evaluation of resources in the Bakken Shale oil field in North Dakota, and oil reserve that could be larger than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Prudhoe Bay combined. He said a completed report would help attract new development of the state's booming oil industry. 
   "If some of the estimates about the Bakken Shale are anywhere near accurate, there may be substantial new oil production in North Dakota's future," Dorgan said. "This could create a new, long-term boost to North Dakota's economy and help move our country toward energy independence. I think USGS has an obligation to put the completion of this study on the fast track."
   Dorgan has held discussions with the Acting USGS Director, Dr. P. Patrick Leahy, on what the agency needs to complete its review of a report on the Bakken Shale oil field in western North Dakota, and when the work might be finished. A USGS scientist, Dr. Leigh Price, studied the untapped reserve in the Williston Basin in 1999 and 2000 but died before the study was fully completed and peer-reviewed.
   Dorgan - the Ranking Democrat on the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds USGS - said that initial estimates in Dr. Price's work indicate that the Bakken Shale could hold between 200 and 400 billion barrels of oil, and that the release of the study would give the oil industry and investors an important new estimate of what resources the region may contain.
