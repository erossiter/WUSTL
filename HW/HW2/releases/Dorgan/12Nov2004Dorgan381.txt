DELEGATION URGES AGGRESSIVE USDA ACTION ON SOYBEAN RUST
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy today urged the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) to aggressively protect the nation's soybean crops from soybean rust, an enormously destructive disease recently found on two soybean leaf samples in Louisiana.  
   The delegation noted that soybean production in North Dakota has increased nearly five-fold in less than a decade and is the state's fifth most valuable crop, with a harvest worth more than $600 million in 2003. 
   "Soybean rust is a devastating disease which has caused yield losses of up to 80 percent in some parts of the world," the delegation said in a joint letter to Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman. "The discovery of this disease in the continental United States, which until now was the last major soybean growing area without soybean rust, is very troubling." 
   Because soybean rust spores are easily transported by wind and can spread rapidly over wide distances, the delegation warned that additional cases of soybean rust may still be discovered in the United States. 
   To ensure measures are in place to protect the soybean crop by 2005, the delegation urged Veneman to immediately determine the extent of the disease, to support increased funding for research on plant resistance to the disease, and to develop an aggressive public education campaign to assist producers in identifying the disease. 
   "Soybean production is a vibrant and crucial component of North Dakota's economy. An outbreak of soybean rust could be catastrophic to our family farmers and rural communities," the delegation said in a joint statement. "The USDA must take every step to ensure that this disease is stopped before it spreads."
