SEN. DORGAN PRESSES TOP U.S. AIR FORCE OFFICIAL TO MAINTAIN FLEET OF B-52S
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) pressed General T. Michael Moseley, United States Air Force Chief of Staff, at a hearing Wednesday to maintain the required fleet of B-52s.  
   In a hearing of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan challenged General Moseley on President Bush's proposed budget to only fund 56 B-52s, despite a Congressional mandate to keep the fleet from not falling below 76 B-52s. 
   "There is no replacement for the B-52s," said Dorgan. "The B-52s are the least expensive bomber to operate and have the longest reach and biggest payload of all of the bombers." 
   "I believe that an Air Force study will soon show that if we allow 38 of the B-52s to be retired, we are going to end up with a bomber gap," said Dorgan. "It makes no sense to reduce the number of B-52s." 
   "At the start of the Iraq War, the Air Force used more than 80 B-52s so it could sustain a force of 42 B-52s at bases overseas," said Dorgan. "This is not the time for the Bush Administration to be reducing the fleet of B-52s." 
   Last year, Dorgan offered an amendment, which was adopted and passed into law, barring the Air Force from retiring the B-52s until the completion of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap Study.
