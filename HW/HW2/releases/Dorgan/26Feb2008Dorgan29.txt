SEN. DORGAN SAYS AGCAM LAUNCH WILL BE BOOST FOR FAMILY FARMERS, RED RIVER VALLEY RESEARCH CORRIDOR
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday the expected launch of the "AgCam," a camera built by University of North Dakota students that will be mounted on the International Space Station, will be the culmination of a long effort that will help family farmers involved in precision agriculture programs. He said it will also stand as another major achievement of the talented students and professionals in the Red River Valley Research Corridor. 
   "The news that the AgCam project will be launched on the space shuttle later this year is good for UND and the Red River Valley Research Corridor," Dorgan said. "This project demonstrates the exciting capabilities we have at UND and around the state. This will help further raise North Dakota's profile as a center of high-tech research and help our farmers keep better track of their crops at the same time."
   The AgCam project was developed using funding Dorgan secured for UND's Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium (UMAC). Through his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan secured federal funding to help build the groundbreaking program. 
   The powerful camera will take snapshots of farmland throughout the Upper Great Plains that will help farmers and ranchers analyze plant stress, soil deterioration, pesticide application and other factors. The information will help producers make informed decisions on planting, crop rotation and disease control.
   Dorgan helped bring NASA to UND through the creation of UMAC several years ago and since then has worked on the Appropriations Committee to link UND researchers and facilities to NASA's research needs. The AgCam is one of the major projects launched under that effort.
