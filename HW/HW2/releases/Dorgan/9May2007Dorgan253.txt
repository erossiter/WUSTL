SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES $2.4 MILLION CONTRACT FOR ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH CENTER TO DEVELOP HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday that a $2.4 million contract has been awarded from the Department of Energy to the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota to continue their research into cutting-edge hydrogen technology. 
   As Chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Committee, Senator Dorgan helped secure this funding through the Department of Energy for EERC's National Center for Hydrogen Technology (NCHT) to continue its third year of research to develop hydrogen as a practical fuel.
   "This contract from the Department of Energy is evidence of the leading role the National Center for Hydrogen Technology is providing to develop hydrogen as a national energy source," said Dorgan. "NCHT's research will be essential to producing hydrogen from many feedstocks such as coal or renewables for use in the hydrogen economy. This research will help reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil."
   "Their work is further marking the Red River Valley Research Corridor as a leading center of research, and will significantly impact the economic growth of our state. I congratulate them on the work they are doing. This contract shows the impact they are having at the national level."
   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Dorgan included a provision in a 2004 appropriations bill to secure the initial funding to establish the National Center for Hydrogen Technology.
