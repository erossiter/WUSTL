SEN. DORGAN HONORS NORTH DAKOTA VETERANS OF PEARL HARBOR
  Saying their service through one of our nation's most trying times has earned them a debt of gratitude that couldn't possibly be repaid, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) honored three of North Dakota's surviving veterans of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor in a ceremony Friday at the AMVETS Club here.  
   Dorgan presented American flags that were flown over the Pearl Harbor memorial to John Martin, a Navy veteran from Bismarck; Clem Lonski, a Navy veteran from Jamestown; and Harold Bruchwein, an Army captain who lives in Wahpeton. All three were serving in Hawaii on what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called "a date which will live in infamy." 
   Dorgan also sent a flag and certificate to Agnes Shurr, a Navy nurse from Grand Forks who could not attend Friday's ceremony. 
   "Our nation was attacked on December 7, 1941, and the men and women who survived that day helped lead the United States and our allies to victory in World War II," Dorgan said. "We owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who served their country through that struggle. It was their commitment and dedication to the cause of freedom that made possible what we have today, and it's appropriate that we pay tribute to their bravery and valor."
