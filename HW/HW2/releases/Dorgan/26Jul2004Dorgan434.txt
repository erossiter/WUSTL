NORTH DAKOTA'S WORLD WAR II VETERANS HONORED ON PERMANENT SECTION TO SEN. DORGAN'S WEB PAGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Monday unveiled a new section of his Senate web page that honors North Dakota's World War II veterans.  
 The site, located at dorgan.senate.gov, features interviews of North Dakota World War II veterans and photographs of the National World War II Memorial and a Capitol Hill event Dorgan, along with Sen. Conrad and Rep. Pomeroy, hosted for World War II veterans. 
   The new section includes first-person audio accounts from World War II veterans from Velva, Sheyenne, Wahpeton, Pembina, Hankinson, Bismarck, Taylor, Minot and Devils Lake. The veterans were interviewed in Washington, D.C. while attending events surrounding the dedication of the National World War II Memorial. 
   "This new addition to my Senate web page will help us all honor the World War II generation and better understand the commitment and contribution they made to keep our country free and safe," Dorgan said. "The men and women who grew up during this period indeed are the Greatest Generation. It is important their stories and heroic contributions to our country continue to be told and saved for future generations."
