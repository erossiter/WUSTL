U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE INJURIES, RETIREMENT SYSTEM
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday he will chair a hearing by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday, September 18, to conduct oversight of the National Football League's (NFL) retirement system and its provisions for former players who are disabled as a result of long-term injuries related to their NFL career.  
   The hearing will begin at 10:00 AM in Room 253 of the Russell Senate Office Building. 
   Dorgan said two football legends are scheduled to testify: former NFL player and Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka, and former Chicago Bears star Gale Sayers. Both are members of football's Hall of Fame. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and NFL Players Association Executive Director Gene Upshaw will appear before the panel as well. 
   "Football generates billions of dollars in revenue each year, but injuries - many of which last a life time - are also part of the game," Dorgan said. "Many players say the NFL's retirement system seeks to delay, or avoid altogether, paying disability payments to players with long term injuries. The NFL says those complaints are over-stated. The committee wants the facts."
