   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   February 10, 2006
   "These trade deficits show that our trade policy is an unbelievable failure that is selling out American jobs and weakening our country. If these new trade deficit numbers don't finally wake up the President and Congress, nothing will. 
   "I think we've reached a tipping point. Despite all the assurances that our trade policies are working, this is pretty damning evidence that they are not. Particularly disturbing is the news that our trade deficit with China is two and a half times bigger than it was when we signed a trade agreement with them in 2000. That's pretty compelling evidence something has to change. Yesterday, I introduced legislation that would rescind Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China and subject our relationship with them to an annual review by Congress. Today's reports make that legislation all the more compelling."
