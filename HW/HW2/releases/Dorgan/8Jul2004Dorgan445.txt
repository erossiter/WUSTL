BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENIOR COMMERCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS CALLS FOR WHITE HOUSE ACTION ON RE-NOMINATION OF FCC COMMISSIONER
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and John McCain (R-AZ) are leading a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators in urging President Bush to nominate Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein to a second term.  
 The White House has held Adelstein's re-nomination for more than a year without sending it to the Senate. 
   The group includes Ernest F. Hollings (D-SC), Conrad Burns (R-MT), and Daniel Inouye (D-HI), all senior members of the Senate Commerce Committee. McCain chairs the committee and Hollings is the Ranking Member. 
   Adelstein's current appointment expired last year. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) submitted Adelstein's name for reappointment in February, 2003, as the nominee for one of the FCC's Democratic seats. "Absent re-nomination, he must leave the Commission at the end of the current Congressional session, leaving an open seat at the five-commissioner agency. A significant number of issues critical to American consumers are pending before the Commission. We need someone with his knowledge and experience on the job at the FCC." 
   "Please inform us of the status of this nomination," the Senators wrote. 
   Adelstein is one of five FCC Commissioners. The FCC regulates the broadcasting and telecommunications industries and is currently considering a number of major issues including those relating to broadcast decency.
