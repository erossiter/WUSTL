DELEGATION WORKS TO IMPROVE MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT
  Responding to senior citizens' growing concerns with the implementation of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Rep. Earl Pomeroy urged Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt today to make several specific improvements to the program. 
   "The new Medicare drug benefit will make it easier for seniors in our state to afford the drugs they need, but this program has been poorly implemented," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Medicare has created an unnecessarily complicated benefit that has left seniors and their families confused, and has placed significant burdens on our pharmacists. It is crucial that immediate action is taken to resolve this problem."
   North Dakota has one of the highest percentages of Medicare beneficiaries, yet only 37 percent of seniors in the state have drug coverage - the lowest rate in the nation. Also, many seniors have found the program confusing. There are more than 40 government-approved private prescription plans in North Dakota, each with its own price structure and list of covered drugs. In the letter to Secretary Leavitt, the delegation called for the following steps to improve the program:
   * Provide better information to Medicare beneficiaries: Seniors throughout North Dakota are finding the educational materials inadequate and confusing and some continue to express frustration with the Medicare website and the 1-800-MEDICARE line. In response, the delegation called on Secretary Leavitt to improve these tools and give more funding to agencies like the North Dakota Seniors Health Insurance Counseling (SHIC) Program, which provides vital one-on-one counseling.
   * Reimburse Dual Eligible Seniors: Many seniors enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid were assigned to plans that did not cover the drugs they need or plans that were not accepted at their local pharmacy. In fact, some seniors have been over-charged, forcing them to pay hundreds of dollars extra for their medications.
   * Strengthen Plan Oversight and Investigate Complaints: A number of North Dakota seniors have said that plans are engaging in questionable practices that undermine the integrity of the Medicare drug benefit. For example, the delegation has heard that some insurance companies are dropping certain prescription drugs from their plans mid-year, and forcing them to pay the additional costs.
   * Increase Assistance to Pharmacies: Several pharmacies in North Dakota are having difficulty responding to the challenges that Medicare has presented. Many pharmacists have gone weeks without receipt of payment from the plans, with some taking out loans to stay afloat.
   "We are committed to making this benefit work," the delegation said. "But it is clear that immediate action is necessary before seniors lose faith in the Medicare program."
