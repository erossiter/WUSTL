SEN. DORGAN, AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER JOHNSON SAY STATE DEPARTMENT REFUSES EFFORT TO HELP NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS GAIN GREATER ACCESS TO CUBA MARKETPLACE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson met with top State Department officials in the Senator's Washington office today to urge the agency to approve a visa for a top agriculture official from Cuba who is interested in brokering a deal to purchase North Dakota farm products.  
   Dorgan said the State Department officials refused to agree to grant a visa to Pedro Alvarez, Chairman of Cuba's food import company Alimport, so that he could travel to North Dakota and other states interested in selling their agriculture products to Cuba. The officials said the visa would violate the Administration's policy toward Cuba. 
   Dorgan said that instead of having a serious discussion about how to help American farmers sell to the Cuban market, State Department officials only gave "more rhetoric about an outdated foreign policy toward Cuba. There is no valid reason to withhold food from the Cuban people, and to deny American farmers the business that would come from facilitating agriculture sales to Cuba." 
   "North Dakota producers had a big win earlier this year when we brokered a trade deal with Cuba. We're just going to have to keep fighting for additional agreements like that despite the hurdles the State Department is putting in the way," Johnson said. 
   Dorgan said the State Department officials told him they would consider granting a visa to lower-level Cuban officials. Dorgan said, "that would be better than nothing, but I will not let up on challenging the Administration on this Byzantine policy that relies on using food as a weapon in the name of democracy. It's outdated, ineffective, and overall absurd."
