SEN. DORGAN SAYS NEW TRADE FIGURES SHOW U.S. TRADE CRISIS WORSENING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is renewing his call for the President to convene an emergency summit to deal with the nation's increasing trade deficit.  
   The new trade deficit figures released Friday, which revealed the nation racked up a $58.3 billion trade deficit in January - the second highest monthly trade deficit in history - "makes clear we have a crisis in international trade and it is getting worse, not better. We need trade reform and need it on an urgent basis," Dorgan said. 
   "The Bush Administration and the Congress have to stop ignoring this crisis in international trade," Dorgan said. "The longer we ignore it, the more American jobs will move overseas. It's just that simple." 
   "These sky-rocketing trade deficits have fueled dangerous growth in our foreign debt, which now exceeds $3 trillion - or $10,000 for every man, woman, and child in our country - owed to countries like China and Japan," Dorgan wrote in a letter to President Bush asking him to convene an emergency trade policy summit of key officials from each Cabinet department. The summit would initiate a review of the nation's trade policies and devise a plan of action to reduce the trade deficit. 
   "These statistics ultimately mean lost U.S. jobs and a declining standard of living for our people. The Administration must take action now."
