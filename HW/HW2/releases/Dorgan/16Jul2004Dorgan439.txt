SEN. DORGAN JOINS IN GROUNDBREAKING FOR OJIBWA MILLENNIUM SCHOOL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), who helped secure funding for construction of the Ojibwa Millennium School, joined local residents Friday in a groundbreaking ceremony celebrating the community's future with a new, modern school that he said is long overdue on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation.  
   "This day has been a long time in coming," Dorgan said. "I am so pleased to be here at long last - not to tour an old and deteriorating Ojibwa School but to break ground on an Ojibwa Millennium School we can all be proud of and in which kids will be eager to learn." 
   Dorgan is Ranking Member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which sets funding levels for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). In 2001, he helped secured funding for the school. But even after Congress allotted the funds, it took three years to overcome other obstacles, such as finding the right site for the school and overcoming foot-dragging by the BIA. 
   Because the main Ojibwa School building has been condemned, students for years have attended school in temporary portable classroom units, forcing them to walk between buildings up to six times per day in sub-freezing winter temperatures. The trailers are unsafe and insufficiently weatherized, and the school does not provide services the children deserve, such as an art classroom, science labs, or a vocational shop. 
   "Today is a day for celebration. This groundbreaking is the result of the vision, persistence and hard work of tribal leaders, teachers, school board members and many others," Dorgan said. "We owe it to our children to ensure that they are attending modern, safe schools that are conducive to learning."
