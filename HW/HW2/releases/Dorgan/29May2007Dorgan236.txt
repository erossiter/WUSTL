SENS. DORGAN, GRASSLEY INTRODUCE BILL TO LIMIT PAYMENTS UNDER FEDERAL FARM PROGRAM
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced legislation Thursday to close loopholes in the farm program that allow some mega-farms and corporate farms to collect seven-figure government checks each year.  
   The legislation provides that funds saved by this measure would be used to create a permanent agriculture disaster relief program. 
   The legislation, known as the Rural America Preservation Act, S. 1486, would set a limit of $250,000 for farm payments in an attempt to better target farm program payments to family farmers. 
   "It is unfair to family farmers and to American taxpayers that the government has been awarding seven-figure payments to corporate mega-farms," said Dorgan. "This bill would set limits on these payments, and target the money saved to use for a disaster title in the farm program."
