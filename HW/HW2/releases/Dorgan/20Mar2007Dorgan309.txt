CORPS OF ENGINEERS AGREES TO SEN. DORGAN REQUEST TO BUILD NEW MARINA AT GARRISON BAY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to his request to construct a new marina at Garrison Bay on Lake Sakakawea. The funding clears the way to replace the current marina in de Trobriand Bay, which was built in 1982 but has not been usable due to the low water levels on the lake.  
   Dorgan, chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, included funding for the marina in the Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. After the leadership of the last Congress failed to move that bill to the President's desk, Dorgan worked closely with the Corps to persuade them to fund the project through the "continuing resolution" that was passed by Congress to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year. 
   "The Corps made a promise some time ago to complete this marina, and I am pleased they have followed through on it," Dorgan said. "Our recreation industry on Lake Sakakawea has suffered from the extended drought we are experiencing, but this new marina will ensure that boaters and tourists have a base in Garrison Bay." 
   "The Corps of Engineers has a responsibility to construct a new deep-water marina that will provide access to the lake even during drought recess," Dorgan said. "I'm pleased they have now agreed to proceed."
