SEN. DORGAN SAYS PRESIDENT'S DECISION NOT TO FUND UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE IS 'FLAT WRONG'
  For the fifth consecutive year the President's budget proposes to eliminate Bureau of Indian Affairs funding for Bismarck's United Tribes Technical College (UTTC), and for the fifth consecutive year Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) pledged to try to put back money for the school he has called "critical to expanding opportunities on our nation's Indian reservations." 
   "This is one of the top tribal colleges in the country, and has been the driver for change in the lives of thousands of Native Americans in North Dakota and from reservations across the country who come to United Tribes Technical College for a chance at a better life," Dorgan said. "To continually offer zero funding for this school is to fail to recognize the important role UTTC plays, so I will fight to restore funding for the school again." 
   Dorgan, Vice Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, also serves as ranking member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee. Those roles have given him the opportunity to restore funding for UTTC in each of the last four years. Last year, Dorgan helped to restore $3.5 million for the school. He said he'll do everything he can to repeat that effort again this year, but it shouldn't have to come to that. 
   "We are in a fiscal crisis in this country, with record budget and trade deficits. But that means we need to decide as a country what our priorities are, and to me, that's taking care of the people who need it most, first. This President's budget represents the wrong priorities," he said.
