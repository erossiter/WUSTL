SEN. DORGAN SECURES $18.2 MILLION TO BUILD NEW HOUSING AT MINOT AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday he has secured $18.2 million in federal funding to construct new housing facilities for service members at Minot Air Force Base. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding in the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction Appropriations bill to build a new 144-room dormitory for enlisted personnel at the base. The Appropriations Committee approved the bill Thursday.
   Dorgan is working with Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy to ensure Minot Air Force Base and North Dakota's other military installations have the resources they need to play a strong role in maintaining national security.
   "This is an important investment that shows the commitment the Air Force has to maintaining Minot Air Force Base as a dual-mission facility for decades to come," Dorgan said. "This project will ensure our service members have the housing facilities they deserve, and I'll keep pushing to get this funding through Congress and to the President's desk."
   The bill goes next to the full Senate for consideration.
