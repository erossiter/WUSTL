SEN. DORGAN APPLAUDS SOUTH KOREA'S QUICK RESUMPTION OF U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) applauded the announcement Friday that South Korea will resume issuing import certificates for U.S. beef, days after the practice was suspended because two shipments of U.S. beef meant for domestic consumption were mistakenly sent to South Korea. He said he will continue to monitor the situation, but that the move is a good sign that South Korea will work constructively with the United States to import its safe, healthy beef. 
   Last December, Dorgan, chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce, Trade and Tourism, pledged to hold hearings and pursue tariffs against South Korea if the country takes a step backward and decides to once again use baseless excuses to block U.S. imports.
   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   June 8, 2007
   "I'm pleased to hear reports that South Korea has agreed to resume imports of American beef after this shipping error.
   "South Korea is an important market for our ranching industry, and our producers are still recovering from the ban on American beef imports that Korea instituted several years ago. I felt that South Korea's ban was based on politics, not sound science, and went on far too long. I hope this new development is a sign that those days are over and that South Korea will now play a constructive role in ensuring American beef imports are continued.
   "South Korea should recognize that American beef is the safest and healthiest in the world."
