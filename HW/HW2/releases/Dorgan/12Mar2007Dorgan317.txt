SEN. DORGAN SAYS FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE COMMITTED TO REPLACING VETERANS HOME
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday that federal Veterans Affairs officials have told him they are prepared to address the need to replace the aging Veterans Home in Lisbon, North Dakota, as a result of inspections that demonstrate serious problems with the facility.  
   Dorgan will visit the Veterans Home Friday with a staff member from the U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee to tour the facility and meet with staff and other interested parties about how to proceed. 
   Dorgan said officials from the federal Department of Veterans Affairs have told him that repair or replacement of the Veterans Home in Lisbon would be a top priority. They told him the federal government is prepared to build a new facility but will need matching funds from the state and a request from state officials for such a federal grant. 
   "Our country owes our veterans a debt of gratitude for their service, and although I believe our veterans receive quality care at the North Dakota Veterans Home, it is pretty clear from inspections that have revealed a series of code violations and other problems that action must be taken to either provide major repairs or build a new facility," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan said some estimates suggest the construction of a replacement facility would cost no more than the major investments that would be required to bring the older structure up to code. 
   Dorgan will be accompanied on his tour and meeting at the Lisbon facility by a staff member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, who will work with Dorgan to address the issue.
