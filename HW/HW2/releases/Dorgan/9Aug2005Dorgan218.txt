DELEGATION SECURES EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR NORTH DAKOTA RANCHERS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy announced today they have succeeded in prompting the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to bring relief to flood-stricken North Dakota ranchers by opening Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land for haying and grazing in five North Dakota counties. 
   In response to a letter written by the delegation calling for assistance to North Dakota ranchers, USDA announced today that CRP emergency haying and grazing has been approved for Bottineau, Pembina, Pierce, Rolette, and Sargent Counties. 
   "Inundated fields and pastures have seriously hurt the ability of North Dakota's ranchers to feed their herds," the delegation said in a joint statement. "These CRP lands will now provide ranchers from several counties with the assistance needed to get back on their feet." 
   In the letter sent to Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns last month, the delegation urged USDA to allow North Dakota livestock producers affected by flooding to utilize CRP lands. They also called on Johanns to allow livestock producers in emergency counties to use CRP land in non-emergency counties. 
   "We are glad the USDA responded in part to our request. All too many of our ranchers are suffering due to floods and excessive rainfall," the delegation said. "We will continue to press USDA to give our ranchers any additional assistance they may need."
