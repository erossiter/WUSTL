SEN. DORGAN PRESENTS CHECK FOR $400,000 TO COMPLETE RUGBY JAIL CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) provided the final lump of funding Tuesday for the new North Central Correctional and Rehabilitation Center when he presented Rugby-area officials Tuesday with a symbolic check for $400,000.  
   Dorgan was able to secure the funding through his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Dorgan met in June with Rugby officials involved in planning the new jail, which replaces a 100-year-old facility. They told Dorgan they were about $400,000 short of the total $7.6 million needed to complete construction of the facility, which will include 128-beds for incarceration and drug rehabilitation, a booking area, an investigation area, and law enforcement offices. 
   Dorgan said he was able to add the remaining funding into the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill, which passed both Houses of Congress last week. The bill now goes on to the President for his signature. Other funding sources for the center include: U.S. Department of Agriculture grants and loans, federal Community Development Block Grants, and local funding provided by the City of Rugby and Pierce County. 
   "Building this new jail and treatment facility has been a true team effort," said Dorgan. "I am very impressed by the vision this community has shown in realizing it had a problem to address and then finding a way to make it happen. This facility is particularly unique because of its rehabilitation component. It's one thing to put criminals behind bars, it's quite another to provide professional treatment to those who need to get a handle on their drug addictions, so they can eventually return to their families and society."
