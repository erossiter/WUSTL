SEN. DORGAN PRESSES INTERIOR SECRETARY ON FUNDING FOR UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) pressed the U.S. Secretary of Interior on Tuesday on the Bush Administration's attempt to eliminate Bureau of Indian Affairs funding for United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck. 
   At a hearing of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan challenged Secretary Dirk Kempthorne on the Administration's budget proposal, which for the seventh consecutive year proposes to shut down the important tribal college. For each of the last six years, Dorgan has restored the funding in the bill that funds the Department of the Interior.
   "United Tribes Technical College is judged to be one of the finest tribal schools in the country," Dorgan said. "This is a facility that allows American Indians to pursue a better education and a better career. That's something everyone should be proud of, so it is so disappointing to me that the Administration continues to propose to shut it down. Congress has always insisted that we need to fund this school, and as a member of this committee I'm confident that we will do so again."
   After Dorgan's comments, Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said she believes "members of this committee agree with" Dorgan, and said she will work with him on the appropriations bill.
