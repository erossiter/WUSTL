DELEGATION TO USDA, ?DISASTER PROGRAM MUST COVER QUALITY LOSSES'
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy sent a letter Thursday to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, asking that the agency implement the disaster bill Congress passed in October 2004 in a way that ensures North Dakota farmers receive the quality loss payments they deserve.  
   The delegation is urging Floyd Gaibler, Deputy Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services at USDA, to allow the Farm Service Agency's state committees to create their own quality loss tables. That would ensure farmers' quality loss payments reflect regional variations in crop quality losses. If USDA does not allow states to create their own quality loss tables, payments would be based on a more rigid national-average table-meaning some North Dakota farmers might not get their payments at all. 
   "North Dakota farmers and ranchers endured some very hard times last year," the delegation said in a joint statement. "We worked hard to get a disaster bill passed in the House and the Senate. Now we need to make sure it's implemented in a way that reflects the crop losses that are distinct to our state. Without taking into account regional variation in quality discounts for say, wheat crops, farmers in North Dakota might be subject to the same payments as wheat farmers in Kansas, which may have had a completely different growing season." 
   Two weeks ago, the delegation met with USDA and members of the North Dakota Grain Growers Association and the U.S. Durum Growers Association in Washington, D.C., to discuss the issue. The farm groups provided USDA with several examples of farmers who would not receive any quality loss payment if regional variations are not taken into account, despite having experienced significant losses.
