SEN. DORGAN WELCOMES CHINA'S WITHDRAWAL OF UNOCAL BID, BUT SAYS POLICY QUESTION REMAINS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday a Chinese oil company's decision to drop its bid for Unocal is "welcome news," but said policy makers still need to address the larger question of whether to allow China to purchase other major U.S. energy assets.  
   "I'm pleased that CNOOC is dropping its bid, but the underlying policy question remains and we ought to address it," Dorgan said. "Will we allow China to buy major U.S. energy assets, when China will not allow a U.S. corporation or the American government to buy Chinese energy assets? Will we, at a time when we are at war, allow major strategic assets to be sold to a foreign government?" 
   Dorgan and U.S. Rep. Richard Pombo (R-FL) authored a provision in the Energy bill now awaiting President Bush's signature that requires a 120 day review by the Departments of Energy, Defense and Homeland Security of potential impacts on U.S. energy and national security of sales of U.S. energy assets to China. A separate review by the Treasury Department, already required by current U.S. law, of any specific sale of an energy asset to China, could not conclude until 21 days after the study approved by the conference committee is finished. That's to ensure Treasury's review has the benefit of the findings of the Energy, Defense and Homeland Security Departments review. 
   The study required by the Dorgan-Pombo amendment goes beyond the specific Unocal-CNOOC proposed sale to look into the impact of China acquiring any major U.S. energy asset. 
   Dorgan said that study will go forward. "We still need the answer to those questions," he said.
