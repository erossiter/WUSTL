SEN. DORGAN THANKS COLLEGE OF NURSING GRADUATES FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO SERVICE, PLEDGES TO WORK TO REDUCE NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Friday thanked graduates of MedCenter One's College of Nursing for their commitment to helping others and advancing public health, and called for a strong national effort to help ease the nursing shortage in North Dakota and throughout the nation.  
   Giving the commencement address at the College of Nursing, Dorgan noted that even with the graduation ceremonies, North Dakota still faces a shortage of about 500 registered nurses (RNs), according to a University of North Dakota (UND) study. By 2013, one in five RNs in North Dakota is expected to retire, and the statewide shortage will increase to 2,000 RNs. Nationwide, there are 140,000 RN vacancies in hospitals and nursing homes. "This problem is not going to go away. We need to act to resolve it," Dorgan said. 
   A member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan expressed his support for the federal Nurse Reinvestment Act, which would provide scholarships and loan repayments for nurses, health care facilities, and nursing schools to provide more training and advancement opportunities for nurses. He also said he will continue to work strengthen nurse education programs. 
   "We are all so proud and grateful that you have chosen a career in nursing, choosing this path of service to society," Dorgan said. "We cannot thank you enough for the health and comfort and healing you will bring to thousands of people in the years and decades ahead." 
   On a positive note, Dorgan said that the new Medicare law, which he supported, will increase Medicare payments to North Dakota health care providers by $170 million over the next 10 years. Those funds should help ensure that North Dakota nurses are paid at more competitive levels, allowing them to continue to live and work in North Dakota.
