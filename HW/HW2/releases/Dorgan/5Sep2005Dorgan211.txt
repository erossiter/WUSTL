SEN. DORGAN COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement Monday, in reaction to President's Bush's announcement that he is nominating Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice.  
   "The President's decision means that instead of three separate sets of confirmation hearings - two for the two vacancies and one for the Chief Justice position - there will be only two sets of hearings. 
   "That makes good sense to me. 
   "Although the Senate has not yet begun its hearings, if, when the hearings are completed, the Senate decides to confirm Judge Roberts, it is almost certain that the Senate would confirm him for the position of Chief Justice as well. 
   "The Senate will begin the hearings to make those decisions this month."
