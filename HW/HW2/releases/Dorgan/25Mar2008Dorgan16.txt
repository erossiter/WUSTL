SEN. DORGAN BRINGS SENATE OFFICIAL TO VISIT GRAND FORKS HUMAN NUTRITION RESEARCH CENTER
  Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) visited the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center (GFHNRC) Tuesday with a professional staff member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. Dorgan invited the committee clerk to tour the lab so he could see first-hand the importance of the work done there. 
   The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which Dorgan is a member of, is responsible for writing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) budget, which includes the Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The nutrition lab is part of the ARS. The committee clerk, who travelled to North Dakota, works directly for the subcommittee's Chairman Herb Kohl (D-WI).
   "The more people we tell about the good work going on here at the Nutrition lab, the more support we will have to keep the lab open. Clerks are the eyes and ears of the committee leadership and bringing the majority clerk to North Dakota helps our case," Dorgan said.
   Dorgan and the clerk met with employees, community leaders and supporters of the center.
   During a visit to the GFHNRC in February, Dorgan vowed to stop the proposal to close the lab, which is doing important research into obesity, the nation's number one health problem. Dorgan has spoken with Chairman Kohl and Ranking Member Robert Bennett (R-UT) about the importance of keeping the lab open and fully funded.
   The President's budget called for the shutdown of the GFHNRC, a leader in research into obesity, diabetes, heart disease and depression. Final action on the appropriations bill is not expected until much later in the year.
