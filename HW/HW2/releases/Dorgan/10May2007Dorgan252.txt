SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO ANNOUNCEMENT TRADE DEFICIT SURGED TEN PERCENT IN MARCH
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday the Commerce Department's announcement of a dramatic surge in the U.S. trade deficit to $63.9 billion "is an urgent reminder that we need to fix the current trade agreements that have led to these deficits before rushing to sign new ones." 
   He noted the trade deficit had surged in particular with Canada and Mexico, which are among America's largest trading partners. "The answer to our massive trade deficits is not going to be new trade deals with Peru, Panama, Colombia, or Korea. Our current trade agreements aren't working for our country. The solution is not more of the same," Dorgan said.
