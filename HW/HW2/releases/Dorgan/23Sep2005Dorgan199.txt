SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO RESIGNATION OF FDA COMMISSIONER
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement in reaction to the resignation Friday of Lester Crawford as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner: 
   "The American consumer should shed no tears at Mr. Crawford's resignation. The fact is, he took the side of the pharmaceutical industry and against consumers at virtually every opportunity. I voted against his confirmation because it was clear that was what he would do. Perhaps now we'll finally get an FDA Commissioner who will stand for the interests of American consumers, both in safety and fair pricing."
