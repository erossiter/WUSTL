SENATE VOTES TO UPHOLD AGRICULTURE DISASTER LEGISLATION
  The United States Senate today voted overwhelmingly to retain farm disaster legislation and provide badly-needed aid to farm families devastated by years of weather-related disasters.  
   The legislation -- championed by Senators Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan -- is part of an emergency supplemental bill now before the Congress. The Senate voted 74-23 to defeat an effort by Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn to strip farm disaster assistance from the emergency bill. 
   Senator Conrad described today's vote as a "big, big victory." He said the vote defeating the Coburn amendment sends a "powerful signal that senators understand how important it is that we get emergency assistance to family farmers and ranchers who have suffered disastrous losses." 
   "It has been a long, hard fight but our farmers and ranchers are one step closer today to getting the assistance they need," Senator Conrad said. 
   "The U.S. Senate cast a crucial vote today in support of farmers and ranchers who have lost their crops as a result of a weather disaster," said Dorgan. "It's now clear that we are going to get a farm disaster package to the President's desk. That is a big step forward." 
   The broader supplemental bill contains funds to help fight the war in Iraq and other emergency spending. President Bush has threatened to veto the bill. 
   The agriculture disaster package would provide $4.15 billion in emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather-related crop production shortfalls, quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies. It will also provide payments for the loss of livestock. The disaster package would mean about $200 million for North Dakota.
