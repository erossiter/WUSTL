SEN. DORGAN OFFERS BIPARTISAN BILL THAT AIMS TO LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is sponsoring bipartisan legislation that, if enacted, could help lower natural gas prices in North Dakota by opening a huge tract in the Gulf of Mexico known as Lease Hold 181, which currently is off-limits, to oil and gas drilling.  
   The legislation was offered Wednesday by Dorgan and the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). Senator James Talent (R-MO) also joined as an original co-sponsor. With such strong bipartisan backing, Dorgan said he thinks chances for enactment this year are "excellent." 
   He said the bill offers something consumers need urgently: a way to lower natural gas prices. 
   "This area holds six trillion cubic feet of natural gas," Dorgan said. "We know it is there. We know it can move to the market pretty rapidly. It's clear that opening that much new domestic supply will have a downward effect on market prices, and that's something consumers need as soon as possible." 
   North Dakota, as one of the heaviest users on a per capita basis of natural gas in the nation, would benefit substantially from lower natural gas prices. "North Dakota will see an immediate benefit in terms of lower prices when this area comes into production," Dorgan said. "The savings could be in the millions of dollars annually." About 40 percent of North Dakota homes are heated by natural gas. Agriculture is another heavy user of natural gas in the state. 
   Lease Hold 181 lies in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on the Outer Continental Shelf. It was scheduled to be opened in 2001, but President Bush removed the area from lease consideration.
