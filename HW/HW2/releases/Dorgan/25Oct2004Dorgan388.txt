CORPS AGREES TO REQUEST BY N.D. DELEGATION TO FUND GARRISON MARINA PROJECT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday that the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to the request by Garrison officials and the North Dakota Congressional delegation to move the marina at Fort Stevenson State Park to deeper water using existing Corps funds.  
   In September Corps officials met with Dorgan, U.S. Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), Fort Stevenson State Park Superintendent Dick Messerly and Garrison Chamber of Commerce President Sue Schreiner to discuss the plan to move the marina across Garrison Bay. 
   "The result of that meeting was assistance from the Corps to relocate the marina facility elsewhere in the park, using existing appropriated funds," wrote Corps Deputy Director of Civil Works Thomas F. Caver Jr. 
   The letter from the Corps to Dorgan is the first formal confirmation that the Corps will undertake and fund the project. 
   Dorgan said the presentation by Messerly and Schreiner was enormously influential to the Corps' decision. 
   "Dick and Sue made an extremely clear and convincing case to the Corps that low water levels were devastating to the local economy and to the recreational opportunities on Lake Sakakawea," Dorgan said. "This latest statement from the Corps shows that they were listening." 
   "I am aware that the continued drought is taking its toll on local economies throughout the Missouri River main stem system, and the Omaha District [of the Corps] is working to alleviate those effects wherever possible with available resources," Deputy Director Caver wrote Dorgan. "An example is our effort to provide lake access by extending and relocating boat ramps. Your past and continued support in this effort is critical and very much appreciated."
