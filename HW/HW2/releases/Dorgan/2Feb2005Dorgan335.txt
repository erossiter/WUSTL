   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   We will be debating and possibly voting on the Judge Gonzales nomination that day, and I also will be chairing a luncheon of the Democratic Policy Committee to discuss with former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin President Bush's Social Security privatization plan. 
   I welcome the President to our state. But I respectfully disagree with his plan to borrow money for the purpose of partially privatizing the Social Security system. 
   My goal is to strengthen and preserve the Social Security program. 
   I support more incentives for IRAs, 401Ks, and private pension plans. But I cannot support the weakening of the Social Security program itself, which is the risk-free foundation of retirement security that has lifted tens of millions of America's elderly out of poverty over many decades.
