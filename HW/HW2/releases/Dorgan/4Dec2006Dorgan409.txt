SEN. DORGAN NAMED CHAIRMAN OF ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday he will take over in the 110th Congress as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee - a post that will give him extensive influence over funding legislation that could help boost North Dakota's growing energy industry and address water issues in the state.  
   As chairman of the subcommittee in the 110th Congress, Dorgan will oversee the writing of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which provides the funding necessary to implement the federal government's energy and science programs, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation and other programs. Dorgan will also chair the Subcommittee on Energy in the Energy and Natural Resources authorizing committee, which helps chart the nation's energy policy. 
   "Some of the most important issues that North Dakota faces involved energy and water, so I see this chairmanship as an opportunity to help move our state forward in a significant way in those areas," Dorgan said. "I'm eager to take over this new post and help chart a course that will improve our nation's energy security and our water and science programs, as well as to help address our state's water issues and grow the energy industry that has the potential to bring significant new jobs to North Dakota." 
   Dorgan's other posts in the new Congress include chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee and a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. He will also remain a top member of the Democratic leadership as chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee.
