SEN. DORGAN GRILLS ARMY CORPS OFFICIAL ON MISSOURI RIVER WATER 'ABSURDITY'
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) applied more pressure to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Thursday, asking Assistant Secretary John Woodley, Jr., in a hearing on the Corps' budget, how the agency can justify its water management policies with communities in North Dakota facing the prospect of going dry.  
   "I want to know how the Corps can justify managing the Missouri River in a way that favors a minuscule barge industry, which the Corps itself admits has only an $8 million annual economic benefit, at the expense of towns in North Dakota that run the risk of having their faucets run dry," Dorgan said. "We're seeing nothing but absurdity here." 
   Dorgan questioned Woodley at a hearing of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, of which Dorgan is a member. The subcommittee is the first body in the Senate to review the Fiscal Year 2006 budget for the Corps, among other agencies. 
   Dorgan said he "didn't receive much of an answer" from Woodley, who said the Corps is doing all it can under its current Master Manual. 
   "I have yet to get a satisfactory or appropriate answer on the question of why the federal government continues to subsidize a dying barge industry when upstream states struggle with basic water needs. And I don't intend to stop asking those questions until the Corps can explain its actions or until they make appropriate changes," Dorgan said.
