SEN. DORGAN TO SPOTLIGHT NORTH DAKOTA BUSINESSES ON JOBS TOUR
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) will meet with city officials, business leaders, and local economic development agencies as part of a "Jobs Tour" throughout the month of August, while Congress is in recess.  
   "Small businesses are the engines for our economy," Dorgan said. "The purpose of my Jobs Tour is to highlight companies that are creating jobs in our state and to discuss successful strategies for both growing and attracting new businesses that will expand job opportunities in North Dakota." 
   The Jobs Tour will include briefings by local officials on their activities to expand jobs, as well as tours of successful businesses in various communities to discuss the local economy. 
   Dorgan also is hosting an Action Summit in Fargo on Wednesday, August 11, to focus on expanding the Red River Valley Research Corridor, which he pioneered with federal funding. Dorgan said his goal is to attract new companies to North Dakota and to grow companies already here by creating world-class research centers in the state. 
   The Senator's Jobs Tour this week includes stops in Velva, Harvey, New Rockford, Carrington, Cooperstown, Lisbon, Oakes and Hankinson.
