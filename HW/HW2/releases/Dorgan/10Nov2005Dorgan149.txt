SEN. DORGAN SAYS NEW RECORD TRADE DEFICIT IS ALARMING, SHOWS ALL 'EXPERTS' ARE WRONG
  Sen. Byron Dorgan said Thursday's announcement by the Commerce Department that September's U.S. trade deficit established a new all time record of $66.1 billion - shattering the previous record of $60.1 billion in February - is "devastating" news and should serve as a "wake up call" for policy makers.  
   The U.S. trade deficit with China also reached a new record, $20.1 billion for September. 
   "Not only are the trade agreements we're negotiating around the world not turning things around, they are making things much worse, and doing so at an accelerating pace," Dorgan said. "This is devastating news. All the "experts" are wrong. Our trade policies are not working. They are a colossal failure. The sooner our trade policy makers, and the pundits who cheerlead them on, recognize that fact the better it will be for our country." 
   "The President and Congress need to get their collective heads out of the sand," Dorgan said. "We've got a serious, significant and chronic problem and it requires urgent action." 
   "The trade deficit report measures the rate at which we are selling our country off, piece by piece, shipping American jobs overseas, and draining our national financial resources. What today's report reveals is that we are doing all three at an alarming rate," Dorgan said.
