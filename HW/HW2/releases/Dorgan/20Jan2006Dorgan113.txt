SEN. DORGAN SAYS JAPAN OVERREACTED, SHOULD RE-OPEN ITS BORDERS TO U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Friday called Japan's decision to close its borders once again to American beef "an overreaction" and said that the Japanese government should accept assurances from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and re-open its market.

   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  January 20, 2006
   Today the Japanese government announced it was halting imports of U.S. beef in response an error made by a packing plant in the state of New York. 
   Our agreement with Japan said that we would remove certain types of material from any beef that we shipped to them. But this packing plant sent a shipment of beef to Japan that did not comply with the agreement. 
   This was a big mistake on the part of the plant that processed the beef, and the USDA inspector who approved it for shipment. But for Japan to shut down all U.S. beef imports in response is an overreaction.
   It took us two years to restore beef trade with Japan after one Canadian cow with BSE was found in Washington State. How long it will take Japan to reopen its markets now?
   Today, USDA Secretary Johanns announced steps he was taking to ensure a mistake like this doesn't happen again. The Japanese government should look at the additional protections he has established, and re-open their market immediately so Japanese consumers can again have access to the best-tasting, safest beef in the world.
