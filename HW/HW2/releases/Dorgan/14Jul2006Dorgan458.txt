SENS. DORGAN, CORNYN LAUNCH BIPARTISAN SENATE CAUCUS TO PROMOTE RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) launched a Senate caucus this week to help promote good public policy for radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Dorgan said the caucus will help foster more high-tech research and development into RFID, including the work done at the Red River Valley Research Corridor that has spurred the region's economy and is bringing high-paying jobs to the area. 
   Dorgan has worked to promote research into RFID technology since he helped bring Alien Technology to Fargo to work with North Dakota State University on battlefield microsensors. Officials from Alien Technology, Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing, and North Dakota State University displayed their work at a Capitol Hill event launching the caucus.
   "In North Dakota, RFID technology creates some exciting possibilities in areas such as agriculture, securing our northern border, and in high-tech research and development," Dorgan said. "RFID has the potential to change the way business and government works in America and around the world, and some of the top research in this field is being done in the Red River Valley Research Corridor. The goal of the RFID Caucus is to help people understand the benefits of this technology. That's good for America and good for the growing high-tech sector in North Dakota."
