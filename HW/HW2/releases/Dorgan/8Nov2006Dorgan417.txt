   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   November 8, 2006
   "The American people voted for change yesterday and they got it today. I congratulate President Bush on hearing the American people and accepting the resignation of the Secretary of Defense.
   "Of course, this alone is not enough. Policy changes must follow personnel changes. We have a long way to go and many more changes to make. But this change is good for America and it's a good beginning on the new direction America wants."
