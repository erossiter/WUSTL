SENATE APPROVES AGRICULTURE DISASTER AID PACKAGE CHAMPIONED BY SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD
  The U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to an emergency appropriations bill that includes a provision championed by Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad that would bring relief to family farmers and ranchers who have been hit by weather-related disasters.  
   Dorgan and Conrad called the Senate vote a major victory, and said they are confident the bill will emerge from a House-Senate conference committee with the disaster aid package intact. They called on the President, who has blocked disaster aid in the past, to stand up for family farmers and ranchers and sign the bill into law. 
   "The Senate has spoken strongly in favor of disaster aid, and that's good news for our family farmers who have been hit hard by weather-related disasters in the last few years," Dorgan said. "I'll be on the House-Senate conference committee that negotiates the final version of this bill, and I'm going to make sure the final version includes disaster relief. Congress has made clear that it supports our family farmers, and now we need the President to do the same." 
   "This is a big victory for family farmers and ranchers in North Dakota and across the nation," Senator Conrad said. "Today, we are one step closer to getting them the assistance they so desperately need to stay in business. The final roadblock we face now lies at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We need to send a clear message to the White House - don't turn your back on our farm families."
