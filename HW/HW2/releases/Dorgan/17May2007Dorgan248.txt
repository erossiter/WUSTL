SEN. DORGAN WILL OPPOSE NEW GUEST WORKER PROVISION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday he will offer an amendment to strike the guest worker provision that apparently will be included in the immigration legislation announced earlier in the day. 
   The provision says the number of guest worker visas each year would be limited to 400,000, but that cap would be increased depending on demand.
   "The guest worker program would bring millions of new immigrants over a period of years to take jobs in sectors of our economy like construction, manufacturing, and transportation. It is just a fiction that these are jobs Americans aren't willing to do - the fact is that the overwhelming majority of these jobs are currently done by Americans. The main reason that big corporations want a guest worker program is that it will drive down U.S. wages," Dorgan said.
   "America's workers have enough downward pressure on their wages because of unfair trade deals and corporate outsourcing of millions of jobs every year. The last thing they need now is to have an inflow of millions of more immigrants competing for their jobs at substandard wages.
   "We already have a system that allows for legal immigration under a quota system. It needs to be respected. Beyond that, what we really need is to enforce our borders. The last thing we need is a guest worker program that pretends to prevent future illegal immigration by just declaring it legal."
