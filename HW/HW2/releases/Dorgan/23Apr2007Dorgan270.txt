SEN. DORGAN SECURES $3.5 BILLION AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE IN U.S. HOUSE-SENATE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
  As a member of the U.S. House-Senate conference committee, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) worked to secure a $3.5 billion agriculture disaster package that the U.S. House-Senate conference committee approved Monday as part of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
   Dorgan pushed for this agriculture disaster package to help family farmers and ranchers who have been hit by weather-related disasters in the last three years.
   "We are now one step closer to bringing some help to our family farmers and ranchers," said Dorgan. "It is now up to President Bush to join us in helping family farmers and ranchers who have lost their crops and livestock as a result of weather-related disasters. I hope he will drop his previous opposition and join us in supporting this provision."
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked to include an agriculture disaster package in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that passed the Senate on March 29, 2007.
   On two prior occasions Dorgan has steered an agriculture disaster package through the Senate Appropriations Committee and the full Senate. Each time, House Republican leaders in the previous Congress, acting at the behest of the President, blocked it. Dorgan worked with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and others in constructing the farm disaster plan.
