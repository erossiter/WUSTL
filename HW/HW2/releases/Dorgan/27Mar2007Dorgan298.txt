SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO DROP RESISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE
  Flanked by farmers from across the United States, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called on the President Tuesday to drop his resistance to a family farm disaster aid package and sign into law a provision that would bring relief to family farmers and ranchers who have been hit by weather-related disasters in the last three years.  
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked to include a $4.15 billion agriculture disaster package in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill now under consideration on the Senate floor. He said he is confident the bill will emerge from a House-Senate conference committee with the provision intact, and called on the President to drop his opposition to legislation that would help family farmers and ranchers who have lost crops and livestock to drought, flooding and other natural disasters nationwide. 
   "The House and Senate have both spoken in favor of lending a helping hand to our family farmers and ranchers, and I'm confident that when the emergency supplemental appropriations bill hits the President's desk, it will include an agriculture disaster package," Dorgan said. 
   "Now it's time for the President to fulfill the promise he made to us years ago - that when the heartland needed help, he'd be there. I hope that he will recognize the very real need that our producers have for this assistance. It's time to put them at the front of the line and deliver help to them right away."
