SENS. DORGAN, WYDEN ASK GAO TO INVESTIGATE POLITICAL PAYOLA AT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, ELSEWHERE
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) are calling for a formal investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) into the "political payola" scandal involving the Department of Education and conservative columnist and TV show host Armstrong Williams.  
   In a letter to the GAO on Friday, Dorgan and Wyden noted reports that the U.S. Department of Education apparently contracted with a public relations firm to pay Armstrong Williams to tout the Bush Administration's "No Child Left Behind" program. The two senators said that this relationship may involve the illegal use of taxpayer funds and certainly involves an attempt by the Department of Education to deceive the American public through this columnist and commentator. 
   In asking the GAO to investigate, Dorgan and Wyden wrote, "Did the Bush Administration's payments to Armstrong Williams violate the ban on the use of government funds for publicity and propaganda? ... Have there been other instances where the Bush Administration paid journalists, commentators, or talk show hosts, to endorse or publicly advocate for any other programs, legislation, or positions supported by the Administration?" 
   "This is not just a waste of taxpayers' money," Dorgan said Friday. "This is a possible illegal use of funds to perpetrate a fraud on the unsuspecting public. We want answers and we want to know who is accountable for it." 
   "There's not a parent in America who can't imagine the good that $240,000 could do for their neighborhood school, and it's hard to believe the Department of Education couldn't find a more beneficial and ethical way to use these funds," said Wyden.
