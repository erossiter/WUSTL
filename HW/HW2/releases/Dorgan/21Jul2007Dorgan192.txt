SEN. DORGAN SAYS RECORD NAWS FUNDING WILL SPEED DELIVERY OF SAFE, RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY TO MINOT REGION
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) convened a meeting Saturday in Minot to discuss progress that will be made with the record amount of funding he has secured in the Senate Appropriations Committee for the Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS). He said he'll keep working to make sure the project has the resources it needs to bring a safe, reliable supply of water to everyone in Minot and surrounding communities. 
   Dorgan, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, included $10 million for NAWS in the subcommittee's appropriations bill, which he authored. He included a record amount of funding for NAWS and other projects in the Garrison Diversion to help the federal government fulfill its obligation to compensate North Dakota for the land it lost when the Garrison Dam was built.
   The Energy and Water Appropriations bill is now pending action by the full Senate.
   "The funding that NAWS will receive under the Energy and Water Appropriations bill is a significant step forward in our effort to bring a good supply of water to Minot and other communities in the area," Dorgan said. "The federal government has not met its obligation to reimburse North Dakotans for the land we lost when we turned 500,000 acres of our state into a permanent flood. This is another step in forcing the government to keep its promise and my efforts will continue as long as I'm in charge of energy and water appropriations. I look forward to working with the citizens in this area to make sure we complete this project."
