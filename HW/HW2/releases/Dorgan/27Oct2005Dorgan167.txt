   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   October 27, 2005
   "I'm disappointed that the Congress and the American public did not have the opportunity to hear Harriet Miers testify before the Senate. I would have liked to hear her views and judicial philosophy from her personally, not just from the detractors on the far right wing that were unhappy with her nomination. 
   "Ms. Miers clearly distinguished herself in Texas, as head of a major law firm and the president of the State Bar Association. We don't know the extent of her experience with issues of Constitutional law, but we would have been able to learn more in the Senate hearings. 
   "I don't know whether the Senate would have confirmed Harriet Miers, but I regret she never had the opportunity to speak for herself. 
   "I hope the President, in his next nomination, recommends someone who both Democrats and Republicans can agree should serve in one of our country's most important roles: a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court."
