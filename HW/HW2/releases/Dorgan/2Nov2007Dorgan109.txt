SEN. DORGAN WANTS EXPLANATION FOR UNFAIR OVERCHARGES FOR PASSPORT FEES
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is asking the U.S. State Department and Postal Service to account for what he says are "hundreds of millions of dollars" in overcharges both have billed travelers for in the form of passport application acceptance fees.  
   He is also asking that the State Department use the excess funds to lower the cost of passport cards the State Department plans to begin issuing soon, for purposes of travel to Canada. North Dakotans and others who live along the northern border would especially benefit from that proposal, since they frequently cross the U.S.-Canadian border. 
   Dorgan and Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) released a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study Friday which they requested. It reveals that the State Department and Postal Service charged travelers an acceptance fee that was double the actual cost of handling passport applications. In 2002, alone, the over charges totaled $112 million. 
   The overcharging revelation comes on the heels of long backlogs - delays of up to three months were not unusual - for processing passport applications this past summer, delaying or disrupting thousands of planned vacations, honeymoons and other summer travel. 
   "The fee for accepting passport applications isn't supposed to be a profit making venture," Dorgan said. "It's supposed to cover their costs. Period. Yet the overcharges total in the hundreds of millions of dollars. It adds insult to injury for those whose summer travel plans were disrupted by long delays. Now we know they were being price gouged, as well." 
   New passports cost $97, and $82 for kids under 16. Of that cost, $30 is the acceptance fee which was set in 2002. The GAO said the cost involved in accepting the passport application in 2002 was $16.20 at the State Department, and $13.31 at the Postal Service.
