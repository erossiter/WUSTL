SEN. DORGAN PAYS TRIBUTE TO NORTH DAKOTA SOLDIERS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) paid tribute Saturday to the men and women who serve in the U.S. armed forces, saying he'll continue to work in Congress to make sure our troops have the resources they need to carry out their missions and the medical care they deserve when they return home from service. 
   "Our troops serve our nation selflessly and with honor, and I always remember that in my work in Congress," Dorgan said as part of a Military Appreciation Day ceremony. "The men and women in the armed services put their lives on the line for our freedom. When there is trouble in some remote part of the world, they're the ones that step forward and say, 'Send me.' We could never fully repay them for their sacrifice, but I hope this ceremony makes clear that they are appreciated and that this is a nation that greatly values their service."
   Dorgan, Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Congressman Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) earned Congressional approval to expand the mission of Camp Grafton. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured $34 million in the pending Fiscal Year 2008 Military Appropriations bill to begin construction of a new combat engineer training facility at Camp Grafton. The project includes building a 182,000-square-foot facility that will be used to train combat engineers from across the United States for the National Guard and Army Reserve.
