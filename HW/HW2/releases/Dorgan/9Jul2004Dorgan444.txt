MCHENRY, PIERCE COUNTIES, TURTLE MOUNTAIN INDIAN RESERVATION DECLARED DISASTER AREAS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) announced Friday that McHenry and Pierce counties in northeast North Dakota and the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation have been declared federal disaster areas due to this spring's flooding, opening the door to federal disaster relief. The areas join 10 other North Dakota counties and the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation in the disaster declaration. 
   "Farmers and entire communities in North Dakota have endured flooded fields and had crops ruined this spring, causing enormous economic damage," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Despite their hardship, these communities were not included in the federal government's earlier disaster declaration. Federal authorities have now chosen to rightly recognize these additional areas and we're glad that they will qualify for the disaster assistance they deserve." The delegation has called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and President Bush to widen the disaster area, noting the enormous economic damage in the affected counties. 
   The three new disaster areas join Benson, Cavalier, Grand Forks, Griggs, Nelson, Pembina, Ramsey, Steele, Traill and Walsh Counties and the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation in the declaration. These areas are now able to receive federal aid to cover 75 percent of public property damages. The declaration also opens access to FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grants and Federal Highway Assistance Funds.
