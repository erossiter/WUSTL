SEN. DORGAN NOMINATES NORTH DAKOTA STUDENTS FOR U.S. MILITARY ACADEMIES
  Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday he is nominating five outstanding North Dakota students for appointment to military academies in 2005. The five students receiving Dorgan's "principal nominations," upon successful completion of a final physical and medical examination, will receive four-year, tuition-free appointments to their selected military academies - the Military Academy in West Point, NY, the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, or the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO. 
   "These nominees have shown exceptional ability in their academic work and extracurricular activities. They are outstanding students and young citizens. They are a credit to North Dakota, their families and their schools," Dorgan said. "Their selection is the result of years of hard work, consistent excellence, and achievement. I am extremely proud of what they have accomplished and their desire to serve their country in the United States military."
   The nominations are the culmination of a rigorous selection process that includes a competitive review of the students' academic and leadership achievements, physical conditioning, and personal interviews with military officials and a selection panel.
   Dorgan's five principal nominees are: 
   * Briana Stremick, a senior at Langdon Public School, has been recommended for appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY. Briana is the daughter of Trent Stremick and Lisa Howatt of Langdon, ND.
