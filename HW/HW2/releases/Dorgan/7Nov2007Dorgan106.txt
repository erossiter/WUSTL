  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday one of the world's leading experts in the development of vaccines will headline a Red River Valley Research Corridor Action Summit November 19 in Fargo. 
   The Life Sciences Action Summit, which will be held at Pracs Institute in Fargo, will focus on building a bioscience industry in North Dakota. The event's keynote speaker will be Dr. Gregory Poland, who heads the effort by the Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group to improve the health of individuals across the world by finding ways to stop infectious diseases and threats from bioterrorism.
   The Action Summit will also feature bioscience experts from the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and other top research centers in North Dakota and across the nation.
   "Life science - the search for new ways to improve health and prevent and conquer diseases - is emerging as one of the most promising industries in the Red River Valley Research Corridor," Dorgan said. "This Action Summit will give us an opportunity to speak with some of the nation's top experts in this field and think about ways we can expand our role here in North Dakota."
