   "This is a welcome decision that will allow the survivors of the Minot derailment to move forward with their case against Canadian Pacific Railway. 
   "There have now been two conflicting judgments made on the issue of preemption in these lawsuits against Canadian Pacific. I don't believe that federal law was intended to preempt the right of citizens to have their day in court, but that will be resolved by subsequent court decisions. 
   "At the end of the day, people should have the right to seek redress from a railroad that caused significant damage to them or their community."
