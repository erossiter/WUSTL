SEN. DORGAN, SENATE COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BILL TO STRENGTHEN LONG-DISTANCE AMTRAK SERVICE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues have introduced comprehensive legislation that would help strengthen Amtrak and ensure the rail service's long-distance trains - such as the Empire Builder, which serves North Dakota - keep running.  
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee, has fought in years past to restore cuts called for in the President's budget that would have forced Amtrak to end its long-distance service. 
   The bill authorizes cost-cutting, upgrades to equipment, restructuring and other reforms that help ensure the health of Amtrak's routes. Last year, Amtrak served more than 114,000 people traveling to or from North Dakota. 
   "The Empire Builder is an important service for many North Dakotans, but we've had to fight hard every year to reverse the President's proposed budget cuts and make sure these trains keep rolling," Dorgan said. "This bill takes a comprehensive approach that will strengthen Amtrak's entire system. That will help the Empire Builder, too, so we don't have to worry whether the President's budget will cut off an important part of our transportation network. Amtrak carries over 100,000 persons in North Dakota each year. Clearly it is a transportation service that is important to our state."
