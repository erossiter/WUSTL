SEN. DORGAN WORKING TO CLOSE LOOPHOLE ALLOWING COMPANIES TO DODGE ETHANOL IMPORT TARIFFS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday he is working to close a loophole in the trade law that would allow Cargill Inc. to import Brazilian ethanol tariff-free into the Unites States.  
 Dorgan met recently with the CEO of Cargill and urged him to scrap the plan and invest instead in ethanol facilities in the United States.
   Cargill recently began negotiations to invest in an ethanol drying tower in El Salvador that would import hydrous ethanol from Brazil, remove a small amount of water, and export the fuel to the U.S. tariff-free under a provision in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a trade agreement passed in 1983 with the aim of helping Caribbean nations develop their economies. These imports could double the current amount of imported ethanol and undercut the domestic market for ethanol production. 
   "This is the problem with a number of our foreign trade agreements," said Dorgan, a longtime proponent of domestic ethanol production. "We give too many incentives for companies to invest in foreign joint ventures, and too few incentives for them to invest domestically. The Caribbean Basin Initiative was passed to help improve the region's industrial base - not to provide a loophole for multinational corporations to get around import tariffs by essentially creating shell industries."
   Dorgan said he is supporting legislation in the Senate to close the loophole. "In North Dakota, we will harvest over 180 million bushels of corn this year and it only makes sense to develop domestic facilities that will produce ethanol from domestically grown crops," he said.
