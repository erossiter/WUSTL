SEN. DORGAN SAYS IRS PROPOSED RULING WOULD UNFAIRLY INCREASE TAXES ON CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM RENTAL PAYMENTS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Sam Brownback (R-KS) led a bipartisan call Friday for the Administration to back off a plan that would hike taxes on landowners' Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) rental payments. Dorgan and a bipartisan group of high-ranking Senate colleagues said they would push legislation in Congress to prevent the tax hike.  
   In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and IRS Commissioner Mark Everson, Dorgan said a ruling proposed recently by the IRS would unfairly subject CRP payments to new self-employment taxes. Today, North Dakota has some 3.4 million acres with about $112 million in rental payments in the CRP program. Left unchanged, the IRS's ruling would mean that farmers in North Dakota may owe an additional $16 million in federal taxes this coming year. A typical North Dakota farmer with 160 acres of CRP would owe nearly $750 in new self-employment taxes because of the agency's ill-advised position. 
   Dorgan's letter was signed by a number of senators who lead committees with jurisdiction over the issue, including Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT), Budget Chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Agriculture Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA). Dorgan said their presence on the letter should be a strong signal that the Administration should back off. 
   "The payments these landowners receive are rental payments, not self-employment income, and Congress has been very clear about that," Dorgan said. "There is no reason for the IRS to make this change other than to force landowners to pay more taxes, and I'm going to fight that. This letter should be a strong signal to the Administration that they need to re-think the stance they're taking or we'll do it for them."
