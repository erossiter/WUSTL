SEN. DORGAN SPEAKS TO STUDENTS, TOURS FACILITES AT MINOT HIGH SCHOOL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Friday toured the Northwest Career and Technology Center, a high-tech educational center he helped establish at Minot High School. Dorgan told students at the school that the center is evidence that a high-tech industry is developing in North Dakota that is creating good career opportunities for North Dakota youth.  
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked with Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy to secure $1.1 million in federal funding for the center, which includes classrooms, offices, computer rooms and state-of-the-art workspaces for career and technical classes. 
   Dorgan toured the center, which opened in the fall. He also spoke to students and fielded questions on a range of local and national issues. 
   "We began working on the Northwest Career and Technology Center to help enhance the education of students in technical course and help encourage more to join, and I'm glad that has been successful," Dorgan said. "Technology is truly changing the way we live our lives, including the way we learn. It's my hope that it also allows young people in North Dakota pursue fulfilling careers in the high-tech industry we are building through the Red River Valley Research Corridor."
