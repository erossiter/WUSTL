AIR FORCE CHIEF TELLS SEN. DORGAN THAT UAVS ARE ON WAY
  Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Moseley told U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) during a hearing Wednesday that the procurement program for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is on track to deliver the aircraft to Grand Forks Air Force Base on schedule. 
   Dorgan questioned Moseley on the UAV program during a hearing of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Under the budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2009, the Air Force would add 148 Predator UAVs, 47 Reapers and 25 Global Hawks to its arsenal over the next five years.
   That would put the Air Force on track to base Predator and Global Hawk UAVs at Grand Forks Air Force Base starting in Fiscal Year 2009. Members of Fargo's Happy Hooligans have already begun to fly the aircraft from their base at Hector International Airport.
   "General Moseley indicated today that the program to add more UAVs to the Air Force's fleet is on track. That's encouraging news for Grand Forks and Fargo," Dorgan said. "The role of UAVs in our Air Force will only grow. Since we landed this new mission for Grand Forks Air Force Base and the Happy Hooligans, that means North Dakota's role in our military operations will also grow. I'll continue to follow this issue closely, but I'm pleased by the progress the Air Force is making."
   Moseley also noted that the Air Force has requested additional funding from Congress to meet ever-increasing demands for combat commanders for UAV support. Dorgan said that, as a member of the subcommittee that appropriates defense funding, he would push for even more support for UAVs.
