FEDERAL AGENCY TELLS SENATE HEARING WET CYCLE TO CONTINUE: MORE FLOODING FOR DEVILS LAKE LIKELY
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan chaired a hearing of his Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee in Devils Lake today to begin planning for the federal, state, and local government response to potential future flooding of the lake. 
   Dorgan said the testimony of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that the wet cycle could last another 10 to 30 years is "ominous news for the potential future flooding in the Devils Lake region."
   The USGS testified that there is a 72 percent chance that Devils Lake will continue rising for another 10 years, and a 37 percent chance it will continue rising for another 30 years. The agency estimates there is a 5 percent chance the lake will rise 10 feet by 2025.
   With these sobering facts, Dorgan wanted to hear from local, state and federal officials about the plans in place to deal with the flooding potential posed by Devils Lake now that Stump Lake no longer can serve as an outlet. In the past two years the Devils Lake water has also filled Stump Lake, essentially filling up what had served as the outlet to Devils Lake.
   "The threat of continued flooding in Devils Lake is a serious problem. We need to start planning and preparing today so that we can protect the homes and infrastructure in the Devils Lake Basin," Dorgan said.
   Also appearing before the committee were representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers, Spirit Lake Nation, the Federal Highway Administration, and the State of North Dakota. Devils Lake Mayor Fred Bott and Ramsey County Commissioner Joe Belford also testified.
   "This hearing offered the opportunity for all different agencies and levels of government to share their plans with each other and with me. We need to start working together today to ensure the community is protected," Dorgan concluded.
