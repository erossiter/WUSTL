SEN. DORGAN HERALDS SUCCESS ON FARGO-MOORHEAD METROPOLITAN QUIET ZONE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) congratulated the leaders of Fargo and Moorhead on their leadership in coming together to create the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Quiet Zone. Dorgan was instrumental in bringing Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) together with Fargo and Moorhead to collaborate on a solution for the zone. Today marked the dedication of the rail zone, which will reduce the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) train noise in the downtown areas.  
   "I commend local leaders for their hard work and planning to provide for the safety of their communities," stated Dorgan. 
   Senator Dorgan helped to arrange a meeting between the BNSF and the cities of Fargo and Moorhead to enable plans for the quiet zone to move forward. In addition, Dorgan supported federal funding through the North Dakota Department of Transportation. 
   The Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Quiet Zone will include various safety features along the track including a fence along the entire zone corridor and double arm crossings at 11 downtown rail crossing locations. These upgrades are expected to be completed this fall or winter.
