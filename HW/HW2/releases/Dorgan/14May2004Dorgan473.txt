SEN. DORGAN HELPS LAUNCH LEWIS & CLARK STAMP AT FORT MANDAN
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) helped the U.S. Postal Service launch its new U.S. postage stamp honoring the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition Friday at national First Day of Issue ceremonies in Washburn.  
   "Today's First Day of Issue ceremony in Washburn for the Lewis and Clark postage stamps is a great honor for Washburn and for North Dakota," Dorgan said. "It lets the nation and the world know just how important the time spent in North Dakota was to the success of the Corps of Discovery, and to our nation's history." 
   Dorgan was among those who first urged the Postal Service to issue the stamp featuring Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and honoring the bicentennial of their expedition. He also founded the Congressional Lewis and Clark Caucus and urged the federal government to organize widespread bicentennial events and observances. A senior member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, Dorgan secured $200,000 this year for federal/private partnerships for the Fort Mandan Interpretive Center, which was in addition to more than $300,000 in federal funding from the National Park Service.
