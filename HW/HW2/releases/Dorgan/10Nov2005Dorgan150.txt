SENS. DORGAN, GRASSLEY SAY USDA MUST COMPLY WITH 2002 LAW, MAKE FARM PAYMENTS MORE TRANSPARENT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter Thursday to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns reminding him of his legal obligation to track payments to mega-farmers, a requirement of the 2002 Farm Bill aimed at ensuring the federal farm program is available to family farmers and not misused by large farms.  
   Dorgan said that although the 2002 Farm Bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to track the ultimate recipient of farm payments, no such system has been developed. Millions of dollars in farm payments go to a small percentage of recipients, straining the farm program that was intended to support family farmers, Dorgan said, and more transparency is needed to ensure accountability in government spending. 
   "It's been three years since Congress passed the 2002 Farm Bill, but USDA still hasn't acted," Dorgan said. "We shouldn't be paying millions of dollars to corporate mega-farms that don't need the help, when at the same time we're making cuts to the farm safety net. These farm payments are supposed to be as transparent as possible. The Secretary needs to implement a system to track these payments, so we can know exactly who is reaping the benefits from a program that is supposed to support family farmers."
