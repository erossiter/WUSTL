SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROMOTE COMPETITION IN AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues introduced legislation Thursday to protect producers from market manipulation by big meat packers and other groups willing to abuse their monopoly power. 
   Dorgan, who introduced the bill along with Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Russ Feingold (D-WI), said he hopes to include the legislation in the new Farm Bill. 
   Provisions in the bill that would promote competition include the creation of an Office of Special Counsel at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate and prosecute violations of competition laws. The bill also prohibits discrimination against producers who belong to co-ops and amends federal law to make it easier to prove and prevent anti-competitive behavior. 
   "I hear far too often from family farmers and ranchers in North Dakota that are victimized by meat packers and other businesses that use their monopoly power to undercut fair market prices," Dorgan said. "When these groups are successful at using their raw muscle to eliminate competition, they get to set the price, not the market. That's not fair. The fact is that our producers are at a disadvantage when it comes to stopping this kind of behavior, and this bill will put a few more tools at their disposal to make sure they get a fair shake when they take their livestock or crops to market."
