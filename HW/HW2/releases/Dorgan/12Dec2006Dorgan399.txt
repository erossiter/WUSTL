   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  December 12, 2006
   "Although the trade deficit has decreased, largely because of the value of oil imports from OPEC, our trade deficit with China and Japan reached all-time highs in October. 
   "So, in fact, the trade deficits that are causing the loss of jobs and opportunities in the U.S. are getting worse, not better."
