SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON BUSH TO INCLUDE NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS IN DISASTER RELIEF BILL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) today called on President Bush to include disaster relief for Northern Great Plains farmers in the emergency funding package for the victims of Hurricane Charley that the President has said he will send to Congress September 7.  
   In a letter to the President, Dorgan said that farmers in the Northern Great Plains have been hit hard by torrential rains in the spring and freeze and frost in August and have suffered major economic losses as a result. Other farmers in the regions have suffered from drought conditions, also resulting in real economic hardship. 
   In his letter to the President, Dorgan pointed out that in North Dakota alone 1.7 million acres could not be planted this year because of torrential rains in the spring. He also pointed out that in August, at the very time that millions of acres of beans and corn and other crops needed heat units to grow, North Dakota suffered an extreme drop in temperature resulting in a freeze as well as a subsequent frost on successive August days. That has caused severe damage to many crops. 
   "Weather related disasters, whether they come in a fast-moving hurricane or a slow-motion series of devastating weather events over several months, leave victims in the same place," Dorgan said. 
   "I will support disaster emergency funds for Hurricane Charley, but I'm asking the President to also include some funding for those family farmers who have suffered a weather-related disaster this year in North Dakota and other parts of the Northern Great Plains," Dorgan said.
