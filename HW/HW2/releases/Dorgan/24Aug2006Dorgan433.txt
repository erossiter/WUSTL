SEN. DORGAN MEETS WITH FARGO-MOORHEAD NONPROFITS ON EFFECTS OF FEDERAL BUDGET CUTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) commended local nonprofits in the Fargo-Moorhead area today for uniting to provide valuable local services for their communities and fighting to sustain their organizations despite President Bush's budget cuts. "Waking the Sleeping Giant," an alliance of over 50 Fargo-Moorhead nonprofit organizations, hosted a community forum to examine the economic and social impact of the federal budget cuts on the health and human service sector.  
   "President Bush's budget cuts are detrimental to the vitality of local nonprofits in North Dakota," stated Dorgan. "Our nonprofits must be able to continue to provide services that are essential for the survival of low-income and disadvantaged citizens across the state. Many of them are stepping up and trying to fill the gaps, but what we really need is the White House to adopt more sensible budget policies that value education, health care, and other important social services for our communities." 
   The forum focused on "Making People a Priority," and featured testimony from local nonprofits on the impact of budget cuts. In addition, presentations highlighted the contributions of the health and human service nonprofits that provide housing, food and medical services to their communities.
