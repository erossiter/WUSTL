SEN. DORGAN SAYS REPORT BY TAXPAYER ADVOCATE BOLSTERS CASE FOR ELIMINATING PRIVATE TAX DEBT COLLECTORS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday a report by the National Taxpayer Advocate that calls for an end to the Internal Revenue Service's use of private federal tax debt collectors adds weight to the effort he and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) have waged to suspend the wasteful practice.  
   Dorgan and Murray have introduced legislation in the past to bar the IRS from hiring private debt collectors, instead of professional IRS employees, to collect unpaid taxes. The IRS has continued to proceed with that plan even though its own reports suggest private collectors would cost taxpayers more and collect less unpaid debt that IRS employees. The use of private debt collectors also puts confidential taxpayer information at risk and adds "hidden costs" to the process, the report concluded. 
   In fact, the report found the IRS program is littered with hidden costs and inefficiencies - such as using at least 65 IRS employees to monitor the work of 75 debt collector employees. 
   The National Taxpayer Advocate is an independent arm of the IRS created to protect the interests of taxpayers. 
   "This report by the National Taxpayer Advocate further verifies that the IRS' use of private debt collectors is a waste of taxpayer money," Dorgan said. "It also unnecessarily puts confidential taxpayer information at risk and potentially subjects taxpayers to abusive collection practices. That makes no sense to me and I'll continue to push Congress to put an end to this plan."
