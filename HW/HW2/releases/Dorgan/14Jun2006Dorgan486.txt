ADMINISTRATION AGREES TO DORGAN REQUEST TO REMOVE HOLD ON NORTH DAKOTA WIND ENERGY PROJECT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday the Bush Administration has agreed to remove the hold it has placed on a wind energy project in North Dakota. Sen. Dorgan, at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing Wednesday, also called on the Administration to work with wind turbine developers to address concerns in the future, saying he would offer legislation to fix the problem if officials continue to needlessly delay important renewable energy projects. 
   The Department of Defense and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had ordered a halt in construction of wind energy projects that are near radar installations - even those that are unlikely to interfere with air navigation. At least one project in North Dakota - a 50-megawatt, 22-turbine project in Oliver County that will generate enough electricity to power 16,000 homes - received a "notice of presumed hazard" from the FAA.
   Dorgan, Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and other Senate colleagues called on Administration officials earlier this month to allow the projects to move forward, saying any concerns could be addressed without delaying important renewable energy projects.
   Dorgan said he has been informed that the Administration's concerns regarding the Oliver County project have been addressed and the project will now be allowed to move forward.
   "The Administration's decision to allow this wind energy project to move forward is good news for our state and our nation's energy security," Dorgan said. "Most of these projects, including the one under construction in Oliver County, will not interfere in any way with radar installations. The new wind farm in Oliver County is important to our local economy and our nation's energy independence, and I'm glad the Administration has agreed to drop its objections and let it move forward."
