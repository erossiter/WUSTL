SEN. DORGAN CONVENES MEETING WITH U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, FARGO OFFICIALS ON STATUS OF CITY'S FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) convened a meeting Friday with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Fargo city officials to evaluate the city's response to spring flooding. Dorgan, who chairs the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Corps, said he will keep working to ensure Fargo has all the resources it needs to protect itself from flooding. Dorgan, city officials and representatives of the Corps of Engineers discussed the city's response to the spring flooding earlier this month that triggered action to protect parts of Fargo from inundation.  
   As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan was here to identify potential new funding needs and to assess how well previous federal investments here in flood control and prevention have worked. 
   "After the Flood of 1997 we made some significant investments in flood control that have done well to protect Fargo and other communities on the Red River, but it's important that we continue to evaluate the flood control system and identify areas where it may need improvement," Dorgan said.
