SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES ALLISON BINNEY AS NEW SENATE INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE STAFF DIRECTOR
  U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday he is naming Allison Binney, an expert in American Indian law and current General Counsel, as Staff Director and Chief Counsel of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. 
  Binney, a member of the Sherwood Valley Band of Pomo Indians and a graduate of Arizona State University's College of Law, has served for two and a half years as general counsel for the Indian Affairs Committee. Before joining Dorgan's committee staff, she specialized in American Indian law for six years at private law firms in Washington, D.C. She will replace Sara Garland, who is leaving the Committee Staff Director position to become Chief of Staff to Senator Kent Conrad.
  "I've worked with Allison for a number of years, and she's distinguished herself as an expert in American Indian issues and law," Dorgan said. "I'm pleased to see Allison step into this leadership role. She is a steady hand and capable leader who will help navigate our effort to address the chronic shortages of health care, housing, law enforcement and education that we face in Indian Country."
