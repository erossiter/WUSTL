SEN. DORGAN PRAISES HAPPY HOOLIGANS FOR THEIR 60 YEARS OF SERVICE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) applauded the distinguished service of the 119th Air Fighter Wing, also known as the Happy Hooligans, as they celebrated today their 60th birthday in Fargo and conducted a ceremony today honoring the final flight of their F-16s. The Happy Hooligans will now fly light transport aircraft and control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mission.  
   "Since 1947, North Dakota has been home to some of the best fighter pilots in the world," said Dorgan. "I will never forget looking up in the sky on September 11, 2001, and seeing fighter pilots above the Nation's Capitol and learning later that these were the Happy Hooligans from Fargo, North Dakota. The Happy Hooligans have protected our country at crucial moments in our country's history, and they will continue to lead the way in serving our country as they take on new missions." 
   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Dorgan helped secure $5.5 million in the Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations bill, still pending before Congress, to construct the Predator Operations Complex at Hector International Airport in Fargo. The facility is key to the emerging UAV mission that will pair the Happy Hooligans with Grand Forks Air Force Base. With the facility, the Happy Hooligans will control flying operational and training missions around the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
