SEN. DORGAN HEARS LOCAL IMPACT OF PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS TO SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met Monday with nonprofit groups from the Grand Forks area to discuss the impact the President's proposed budget would have on their efforts in the community. 
   Dorgan convened the meeting with local nonprofits to provide him with an update on their activities and to discuss the President's Fiscal Year 2007 budget proposal. The groups shared how North Dakotans they work with, and who struggle to get by, would be affected by the President's budget, which proposes deep cuts or outright elimination of programs many depend on.
   Dorgan said he also is concerned about the impact of the cuts on low-income citizens, and said he plans to use the examples he heard today when making the case to his colleagues in Congress that funds for many social service programs are essential and should be restored. He also urged the groups to organize an opposition effort to the proposed budget cuts and point out the devastating effects they would have on programs that help the poor, elderly, disabled and other disadvantaged groups.
   "We need to tighten our belts and get the budget deficit under control, but it is simply wrong to hand out giant tax cuts to the richest 1 percent while slashing programs like Medicaid and Medicare," Dorgan said. "Those are the wrong priorities for North Dakota and our country."
