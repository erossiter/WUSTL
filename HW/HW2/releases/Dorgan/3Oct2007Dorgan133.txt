SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE'LL KEEP PUSHING TO EXPAND HEALTH INSURANCE FOR LOW-INCOME CHILDREN
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday he was "deeply disappointed" by President Bush's decision to veto a bill that would provide health insurance to about 6,000 additional low-income children in North Dakota who otherwise could not afford it. He said he will push in the Senate to override the President's veto.

   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN'
   October 3, 2007
   "I think the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program bill is a serious mistake.
   "The CHIP program works and works well. It has provided health coverage to millions of children whose families otherwise could not afford it. In North Dakota, more than 6,000 low-income children have been helped, and this bill would double that number.
   "If providing health care to children doesn't rank first on our list of priorities, I don't know what does. No child should go without medical care when they are sick, and that's what this bill is about - keeping kids health and getting them needed care when they are sick.
   "At a time when we're spending billions of dollars every month in Iraq and Afghanistan, surely we can afford to provide health coverage to children from low-income families. It's time to take care of things here at home.
   "I'm going to push hard to override this veto."
