INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN BILLS TO COMBAT YOUTH SUICIDE, CURB CHILD ABUSE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan's (D-ND) effort to curb child abuse and teen suicide in American Indian communities received a boost Thursday. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee approved two bills sponsored by Dorgan that provide resources and training to combat those problems.  
   "These bills are both aimed at protecting our Native American children, and I'm going to push hard to get the Senate to approve them quickly," Dorgan said. "We have a bona fide crisis on our hands with the high rate of suicide among our American Indian teens. Unfortunately, child abuse is also a heartbreaking reality. These bills put the resources in place to address these problems and tell our kids, 'You are not alone.'" 
   Dorgan, Chairman of the Committee, held the first-ever Senate hearings on Indian teen suicide in 2005 in Bismarck and Washington, D.C. His legislation addressing the issue would expand the availability of telemental health services - bringing more counseling, professionals and suicide-prevention materials to rural tribal communities using telecommunications technology. 
   The Indian Child Protection Act amendments, which Dorgan introduced with Senator John McCain (R-AZ), provide treatment programs for children who have been victimized, and require annual reporting to Congress on the incidence of child abuse in Indian Country.
