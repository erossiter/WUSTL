DELEGATION TO HOST MILITARY ACADEMY DAY; EVENT WILL HELP NORTH DAKOTA STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT PRESTIGIOUS SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Rep. Earl Pomeroy announced today they will host a special Military Academy Day in Fargo on April 8. The afternoon event will help local high school students learn how they can apply to one of the nation's military academies. 
   "Our nation's military academies are among the world's finest institutions of higher learning. They not only offer a first-rate educational experience, they also offer the opportunity to proudly serve our great nation," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Military Academy Day will give North Dakota students the chance to learn more about an exciting future at one of the nation's military academies."
   Nominations to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Military Academy (West Point), and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy come principally from Congressional nominations from either a Senator or Representative. Staff members from the Congressional delegation will be on hand at the event to provide information about admissions and how to prepare for the nomination process.
   In addition, high school students will be able to speak with students who currently attend each of the service academies, allowing them to ask questions about life at the academies and careers in the military.
   "Each year North Dakota's best and brightest seek admission to this country's military academies," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This event is a forum where the future leaders of our nation can get the guidance and information they need before they apply to these prestigious institutions."
   Military Academy Day will be held April 8, from 12:30 to 3:00 p.m. at Fargo North High School in the south lobby area. The delegation plans to organize a similar event in western North Dakota later this year.
