   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  March 12, 2007
   "The CEO of Halliburton has decided to leave this country to move his offices to Dubai because he says it is 'a great business center.' That is a bizarre announcement. 
   "This is one of the country's larger defense contractors. It has gotten billions of dollars in defense contracts, many of them no-bid contracts, and has been accused of under-performing and over-billing. 
   "I want to know, is Halliburton trying to run away from bad publicity on their contracts? Are they trying to run away from the obligation to pay U.S. taxes? Or are they trying to set up a corporate presence in Dubai so that they can avoid the restrictions that currently exist on doing business with prohibited countries like Iran? 
   "I think Congress ought to hold hearings to try to determine why one of this country's major defense contractors has decided to move its principal offices off-shore. What's behind it, and what obligation should we, as a country, expect from companies like this?" 
   Dorgan, as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said he is going to ask the Commerce Committee to investigate the circumstances of Halliburton's announced move to Dubai.
