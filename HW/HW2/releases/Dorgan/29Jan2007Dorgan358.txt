SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP PREVENT CHILD ABUSE, TEEN SUICIDE IN INDIAN COUNTRY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, introduced legislation last Thursday along with Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to help end child abuse and teen suicide in Indian Country. The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act of 2007 would improve the reporting and tracking of child abuse and address the high number of youth suicides throughout Indian Country.  
   This legislation will provide treatment programs for children who have been victimized, and require annual reporting to Congress on the incidence of child abuse in Indian Country. In addition, the bill will authorize background checks for employees who work with Indian children, involve participation by the FBI and Attorney General in documenting and tracking the incidents of child abuse, and require training in suicide prevention and treatment for professional staff at the regional Indian Child Resources and Family Services Centers. 
   "Suicide is often linked with child abuse, and we must put an end to the high number of cases of suicide and child abuse in Indian Country," said Dorgan. "Indian Country has some of the highest rates of child abuse and youth suicide in the U.S., and this bill will provide more resources for protecting youth and tracking the cases of abuse." 
   The rate of suicide among teenagers on reservations in the Great Plains is 10 times the national average. Dorgan held the first-ever Senate hearings on Indian teen suicide in 2005 in Bismarck and Washington, D.C.
