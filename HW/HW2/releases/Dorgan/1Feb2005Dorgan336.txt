SEN. DORGAN WELCOMES PARTIAL RELEASE OF LIHEAP FUNDS, BUT SAYS ADMINISTRATION MUST GO FURTHER
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday he's pleased the Bush Administration has agreed to release some of the emergency Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds, but said the President needs to go further. Sen.  
 Dorgan and 40 other Senators wrote the President last week calling on the President to release all $200 million appropriated by Congress to help low income Americans pay their heating and electricity bills this winter. He said the President still needs to do that. 
   North Dakota residents are expected to receive about $950,000 from the recently released funds, an amount Dorgan said could double if all $200 million is released.
   The text of Dorgan's statement follows:
   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   February 1, 2005
   I'm pleased the Administration has released some of the LIHEAP funds, but the need is great and the full amount Congress appropriated is required. The President needs to release all $200 million Congress has provided. This is not a time for half-way measures. The lives and well-being of thousands of North Dakotans and Americans depend on it.
