SEN. DORGAN MEETS WITH TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY MINETA IN EFFORT TO SAVE LONG-DISTANCE AMTRAK SERVICE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta late Monday to urge the Bush Administration to reverse its course and support funding for Amtrak that would allow the service to continue routes through the Midwest.  
   In the meeting, Dorgan described to Mineta the importance of routes such as Amtrak's Empire Builder, which served nearly 90,000 North Dakotans last year. The Bush Administration has proposed funding Amtrak at a level that "zeroes out" long-distance rail passenger service, effectively eliminating long-distance train travel altogether. 
   Last week, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation voted to give Amtrak less than one-third of the funding Amtrak's president says the rail service needs to fully fund operations and new capital investments. Dorgan vowed to restore the funding in the Senate, and said support from the Administration would bolster his case. 
   "I hope the Administration will rethink its position on this issue," Dorgan said after the meeting. "You don't have to live on the east coast to depend on public transportation. Amtrak's long-distance routes are important to Americans across the country, and we need to continue to support them."
