SEN. DORGAN SAYS METEORITE THAT FELL ON NORTH DAKOTA IN 1936 IS RETURNING HOME
  A 44-pound meteorite that fell to earth on a farm near New Leipzig, North Dakota, in 1936 is being returned for exhibit in North Dakota under an agreement that Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) reached with the Smithsonian Institution last week. 
   The meteorite will be displayed in the North Dakota Heritage Center's new "Corridor of Time" exhibit, which focuses on the state's geological history.
   Dorgan, who is the ranking member on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Smithsonian, worked with Merlan Paaverud, Director of the State Historical Society, and Lynn Helms, Director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, to bring the meteorite back to North Dakota for exhibit. The Heritage Center will receive the specimen on a 3-year, renewable loan from the Smithsonian.
   The meteorite was sold to the Smithsonian Institution by Daniel Buckwitz, Jr., on whose farm the meteorite landed in 1936. After selling it for $150 in the midst of the Great Depression, Buckwitz called the meteorite "a blessing from Heaven."
   "This will be an exciting addition to the North Dakota Heritage Center's collection, and I hope it will encourage more visitors to learn about our state's rich history," Dorgan said.
   "A meteorite from North Dakota will help us tell the story of our geology and dinosaurs and development of what we call home," Paaverud said. "We are thankful for Senator Dorgan's assistance and support in getting an agreement to bring the meteorite to North Dakota."
