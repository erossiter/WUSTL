SEN. DORGAN WILL PUSH TO INCLUDE AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE IN HOUSE-SENATE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan has been named a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee that will begin meeting on Tuesday, April 17, to negotiate a final version of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill. Dorgan says he will push to ensure the bill's final version includes the agriculture disaster package to bring some help to family farmers and ranchers who have been hit by weather-related disasters in the last three years.  
   "Our farmers and ranchers have waited patiently for some help," said Dorgan. "Both the Senate and House have shown support for an agriculture disaster package, and I will work to get the bill out of the House-Senate Conference Committee with an agriculture disaster package attached. I hope the President will relent and be willing to help family farmers and ranchers who have lost their crops and livestock as a result of weather-related disasters." 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked to include a $4.15 billion agriculture disaster package in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that passed the Senate on March 29, 2007. 
   He steered an agriculture disaster package through the Appropriations Committee and the Senate twice before. Each time, House Republican leaders in the last Congress, acting at the behest of the President, blocked it. Dorgan worked with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and others in constructing the farm disaster plan. 
   The Senate-House Conference Committee is expected to finish the bill by Monday, April 23.
