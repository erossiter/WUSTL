DELEGATION ANNOUNCES $411,000 FEDERAL GRANT TO BOOST ECONOMY IN GRAND FORKS AREA
  U.S. Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy announced today the University of North Dakota (UND) has been awarded a $411,000 federal grant to develop a strategy to boost the economy in Grand Forks and the surrounding region.  
   The grant will help the Grand Forks area adjust to the changing mission at Grand Forks Air Force Base by establishing an economic development strategy that supports private capital investment and retention and the creation of jobs in the region. The effort will help strengthen and expand the partnerships between UND and private companies in the area, the delegation said. 
   "Grand Forks is a vibrant community that is on the move, thanks in no small part to the activity at the University of North Dakota," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This funding will help us find ways to expand on the partnership between UND and the community." 
   The federal grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce with funds appropriated by Congress.
