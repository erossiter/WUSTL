SEN. DORGAN WILL DELIVER DEMOCRATS' RADIO RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT JAN. 26 MORNING
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) will deliver the Democratic response Saturday to the President's weekly radio address. Dorgan's speech will air at 10:06 AM Central Time on ABC Radio network stations, as well as hundreds of other radio stations nationally. 
   Both the President and Dorgan, who is Chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, will talk about the economy and the economic stimulus package Congress is developing. 
   On Friday, Dorgan said it is a "hopeful sign" the President and Congress are working together to get the economy back on track. He said he supports a short term stimulus "but the medicine needed to improve the health of our economy also has to include fixing our trade and budget deficits, and getting regulators to put the brakes on sub-prime mortgage abuses and excessive financial speculation in hedge funds and derivatives that pose a danger to our economy."
