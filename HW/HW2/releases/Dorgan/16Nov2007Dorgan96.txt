MANY NORTH DAKOTANS MISSING OUT ON THEIR FEDERAL TAX REFUNDS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced today that many North Dakotans have unclaimed federal tax refund checks waiting for them because the Internal Revenue Service has been unable to locate them. North Dakotans are owed $128,175 with the average individual unclaimed refund being $872.  
   In many cases, the refunds were undeliverable because the postal service did not have a current address for the recipient. Some North Dakotans have more than one check waiting for them. To help the 147 North Dakotans get their refunds, Senator Dorgan has posted the list of unclaimed refunds on his website at www.dorgan.senate.gov. 
   "North Dakotans deserve to have the money that is owed to them," Dorgan said. "To help those who are owed money, I've posted the list on my website. I urge people to check it out and if they find their name, to claim their tax refund." 
   The number of North Dakotans who have not received their refunds has risen about 25 percent this year and the amount of the refunds has nearly doubled from last year's total of $64,200.
   To claim their refunds, the North Dakotans on the list can contact the IRS directly by visiting their website at www.irs.gov and then clicking on Where's My Refund. North Dakotans can also reach the IRS via telephone toll free at 1-800-829-1040.
