FALL INTERNSHIPS AVAILABLE IN SEN. DORGAN'S WASHINGTON OFFICE
  Internships are available the fall semester of 2007 in U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan's Capitol Hill office, but space is limited so students should apply soon. 
   Interns assist staff with research, special projects, constituent services and clerical support. They also have opportunities to attend hearings, briefings, seminars and workshops on issues that are of interest to them. In addition, interns can tour popular sites such as the White House, Library of Congress, Pentagon, State Department, Washington Monument and Supreme Court.
   Beginning and ending dates are flexible and a monthly stipend is provided. Spots fill quickly so interested students should apply soon.
   Interns must have strong research and verbal and written communications skills. Qualifications are generally not based upon an individual's area of study or GPA, but rather their ability to manage a variety of tasks and responsibilities and a willingness to contribute to the operations of a Senate office.
   "An internship is an excellent opportunity for any young student interested in public service," Dorgan said. "Our interns get an up-close look at the way our nation makes its most important decisions. That's a valuable experience that helps expand their career skills and open doors."
   Students interested in learning more about this exciting experience and outstanding educational opportunity should call Senator Dorgan's Washington, D.C., office at (202) 224-2551 and ask for Melissa.
