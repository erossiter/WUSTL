SEN. DORGAN WILL FORCE SENATE VOTE TO BLOCK UAE PORT DEAL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday he will force a vote in the U.S. Senate on blocking the proposed deal that would allow a company owned by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to operate several major U.S. ports. 
   In a speech on the Senate floor, Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he will offer the exact same amendment approved by the House Appropriations Committee Wednesday to block the deal, when the Senate Appropriations Committee considers the Supplemental Appropriations bill.
   "I expect it will pass overwhelmingly in the Senate Appropriations Committee, as it did in the House Appropriations Committee, and that the full Senate will vote to block the sale by a large margin as well," Dorgan said. "That's obviously why those who control the Senate have virtually shut down the Senate today, rather than allow a vote on the floor on an amendment offered there that would also block the deal."
   "It makes no sense to require law abiding American citizens to take off their shoes and belts in order to board a commercial airline but then turn the operation of major U.S. ports, through which millions of tons of cargo enter our country, over to a company that is owned by a government that has direct ties to Osama bin Laden, and from which two of the 9/11 hijackers came," Dorgan said.
   "The Senate is not going to avoid this issue, which is an important one for our national security," Dorgan said. "We need to face it and we will."
   If the Appropriations Committee votes, as expected, to add Dorgan's amendment to the "must pass" Supplemental Appropriations bill, Senate leaders will be unable to avoid having the Senate vote on blocking the port deal. "The voice and will of the American people will be heard on this important national security issue," Dorgan said.
