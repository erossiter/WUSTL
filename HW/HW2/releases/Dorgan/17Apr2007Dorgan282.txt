SEN. DORGAN SPONSORS BILL TO INCREASE NATION'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and a bi-partisan group of senior members of the Senate, including the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, introduced legislation Tuesday to save energy by improving the efficiency of how Americans use energy.  
   "Increasing energy efficiency is the most over-looked of all the areas when it comes to working our way to greater national energy security," Dorgan said. "Yet we can save tremendous quantities of energy with just minor adjustments in how we use it, if we set some national goals and work together to achieve them." 
   The legislation promotes advanced lighting technologies, expedites new energy efficiency standards, and promotes high efficiency vehicles, advanced batteries and energy storage. 
   It also sets aggressive national goals for reducing gasoline usage, and re-authorizes weatherization assistance programs. 
   The bill would also make the federal government a leader and example in adopting new, more efficient energy technologies. Federal automobile fleets would be required to reduce petroleum consumption by 30 percent by 2016, compared to consumption levels in 2005. It also requires the federal government to increase its purchases of electricity generated from renewable sources to 10 percent by 2010 and 15 percent by 2015. 
   Energy use in federal buildings would also be required to be reduced by 30 percent by 2015. 
   In addition to Dorgan, original co-sponsors of the bill include Senate Energy Committee Chair Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Ranking Member Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), and Senators John Kerry (D-MA), Richard Lugar (R-IN), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Ken Salazar (D-CO) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine).
