SEN. DORGAN RENEWS PUSH IN CONGRESS FOR EXPANSION OF AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) renewed his push in Congress this week for an expanded agriculture disaster package that will bring relief to family farmers and ranchers who have suffered not only from weather-related disasters in 2005, but also the severe drought that has affected much of the Midwest this year. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, Thad Cochran and Robert Byrd, that he will push to expand the agriculture disaster package he already included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. That legislation is now awaiting action by the full Senate. Dorgan wrote that his tour through drought-stricken areas of North Dakota last week convinced him that the disaster relief package must be expanded.
   Dorgan also urged colleagues in a speech on the Senate floor to expand disaster relief to provide help during the drought, citing stories he heard from producers at meetings in North Dakota.
   "In the areas of North Dakota that have been affected by the drought, the pastures look like a moonscape," Dorgan said. "The ranchers who can't feed their cattle are sending them to market and closing up shop. We need to act soon to bring some disaster relief to these producers or many of them will go out of business."
