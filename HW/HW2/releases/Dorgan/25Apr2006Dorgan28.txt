   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   April 25, 2006
   "I support the decision by the Minneapolis court that the victims of the Minot derailment are entitled to their day in court. This order reaffirms that decision.
   "I don't think a citizen's right to go to court should be preempted by federal statute. At the end of the day, people should have the right to seek redress from a railroad that caused significant damage to them or their community."
