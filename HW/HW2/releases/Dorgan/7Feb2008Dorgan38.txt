SEN. DORGAN VOTES FOR STIMULUS PACKAGE, APPLAUDS ADDING REBATES FOR SENIORS, DISABLED VETERANS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) voted for the stimulus package that passed the U. S. Senate Thursday, calling it "not only a boost for our economy but a victory for seniors and disabled veterans who were on the verge of being left out" of the package. 
   The Senate bill, which Dorgan supported, made changes that will allow tens of thousands of North Dakotans, who were left out of the original package negotiated by the President and U.S. House leaders, to receive rebates. 
   "This package is good for the economy," Dorgan said. "I regret that the White House and its allies blocked any extension of unemployment benefits in this tough job market, and that they also blocked home heating assistance for low income families. I am very happy, however, that we were able to include more seniors and disabled veterans who were left out of the original proposal but who certainly deserve to be included. Seniors have contributed a lifetime of income to this economy, and disabled veterans risked their lives to protect it. We can't tell them now that they don't count."
