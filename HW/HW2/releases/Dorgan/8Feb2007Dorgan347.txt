SEN. DORGAN SAYS RENEWABLE-ENERGY POWERED LANDFILL MAKES FARGO A NATIONAL LEADER
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Thursday applauded the city of Fargo's implementation of a new system, which city officials dedicated today, that will power its landfill using renewable energy.  
   The Fargo landfill project was established using federal Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, which Dorgan championed as part of the 2005 federal Energy Bill. The project will make a new Fargo landfill station powered entirely by renewable energy - from sources including methane that is collected on-site, an array of solar panels, and a wind turbine that will be installed this spring. Excess energy will be sold to Cass County Electric Co-op. 
   "This project establishes Fargo as a renewable energy leader in North Dakota and the nation," Dorgan said. "I pushed for Clean Renewable Energy Bonds in Congress so they'd be used in projects just like this, and it's good to see them being put to use right at home in North Dakota."
