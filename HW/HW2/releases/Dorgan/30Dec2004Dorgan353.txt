   Text of Statement by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan, December 30, 2004
   "The decision of when to open our border to live Canadian cattle must be based on science, not on politics. We need to ask some hard questions of the Department of Agriculture. At the same time that USDA officials declared there was a 'minimal risk' of BSE in Canada, Canadian officials were investigating yet another suspected case of BSE inside their borders. Did USDA know this while they were calling Canada a minimal risk country?"
   "The priority of the USDA and the Congress should be to stand up for the interests of beef producers in this country. That doesn't mean that we should arbitrarily keep Canadian cattle out, but the most important issue for us is to protect our domestic industry. Keeping our beef herds healthy and free from BSE should be the highest priority of the USDA on this issue."
