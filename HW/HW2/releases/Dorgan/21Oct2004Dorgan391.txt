SEN. DORGAN URGES THOMPSON TO EXPLAIN CONTRADICTION IN OPENING CANADIAN BORDER TO FLU VACCINES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), in a letter Thursday to U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tommy Thompson, asked him to "explain the obvious contradiction" in the Administration's stances of seeking flu vaccine from Canada, while simultaneously blocking attempts to allow consumers and pharmacists to obtain less expensive prescription drugs from Canada.  
   "It is an interesting contradiction to have the Administration tell us on one hand that there are potential safety problems with respect to the importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs from Canada, and yet you turn to the Canadian drug supply to help meet the flu vaccine shortage," Dorgan wrote in the letter. 
   Dorgan's Prairie Prescriptions Pilot Project, a two-year plan to allow North Dakota pharmacists to obtain medications from licensed Canadian distributors, has languished in Thompson's office awaiting approval. Dorgan wrote a measure in the nation's new Medicare law that would allow such a pilot project if the HHS Secretary certifies that the plan would provide safety and cost savings. So far, Thompson has not issued a decision. 
   In addition, the Administration has opposed Dorgan's bipartisan bill to allow the reimportation of FDA-approved drugs from Canada and other nations. 
   "If the Canadian drug supply is safe for American consumers when it comes to flu vaccine, then you ought to be supportive of the efforts of myself and others to pass our bipartisan prescription drug reimportation legislation to put downward pressure on prescription drug prices," Dorgan wrote. "You insist that you have not yet resolved the safety issues with respect to the importation of prescription drugs from Canada, but your actions with respect to the flu vaccine demonstrate that you believe the Canadian drug supply is safe."
