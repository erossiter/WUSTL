SEN. DORGAN SAYS DESIGNATION SHOULD NOT BE EXCUSE FOR USDA TO EXPAND IMPORTS OF CANADIAN BEEF
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday the designation of Canada as a "controlled risk country" by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) should not be an excuse for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to loosen restrictions on the importation of Canadian beef. He called on the USDA to implement a country-of-origin labeling program and use sound science, not politics, to make decisions on the importation of Canadian cattle.

   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   May 22, 2007 
   "This designation by the World Organization for Animal Health should not be an excuse for USDA to expand imports of Canadian beef. Frankly, I doubt the accuracy of this designation, since it puts the United States and Canada in the same category despite Canada's ongoing problems with BSE. 
   "I held a field hearing in Bismarck, North Dakota, earlier this year and pushed USDA officials to put a stop trying to expand imports of Canadian cattle. At that time, they told me they would not expand imports of Canadian beef until the OIE had completed its list. 
   "Since that hearing, even more cattle have been found infected with BSE in Canada. I have introduced legislation to prevent USDA from doing expanding Canadian beef imports unless a country-of-origin labeling program is implemented. If USDA insists on taking this ill-advised step, the least it can do is allow American consumers to see where the steak on their dinner plate came from. 
   "I feel badly that the Canadians are having problems with their beef supply, but the fact is we need to stand up for our beef industry first. I'm going to keep pushing USDA on this issue until they decide to make this decision based on sound science, not politics."
