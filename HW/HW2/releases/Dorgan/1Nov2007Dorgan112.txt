   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   November 1, 2007
   "Today is the first day of National American Indian Heritage Month, and I join all Americans in honoring the contributions that Native Americans have made to our country.
   "Native Americans were the first Americans. They were here long before the rest of us, and created a culture and traditions that enrich our nation. And today, American Indians are contributing to our progress as a society through their leadership in business, government, the military and the arts.
   "Our nation is strengthened by the contributions of American Indians, and we have an obligation to fulfill our trust responsibilities. I plan to keep fighting in Congress to improve educational opportunities, health care and housing for our tribes."
