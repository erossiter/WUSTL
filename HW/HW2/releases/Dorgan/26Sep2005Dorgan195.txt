APPROPRIATIONS BILL RESTORES FUNDS FOR 18 ATTRITION RESERVE B-52 BOMBERS AT MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD ANNOUNCE
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) announced Monday the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has approved funding that will maintain 18 attrition reserve B-52 bombers at Minot Air Force Base.  
 The action reverses an Administration plan to scrap the bombers, which have proven to be one of the Air Force's most effective weapons in military operations. Dorgan is a member of the Subcommittee, which restored approximately $80 million in the Fiscal Year 2006 for the aircraft. The Senators said the B-52 bomber fleet is a critical part of the nation's military capacity, and that the planes still have an important role to play our nation's defense strategy. 
   "I am proud that these planes will remain at the Minot Air Force Base for many years to come," Dorgan said. "Keeping the B-52s in our defense inventory is important for America's military strength in the years ahead. These B-52s are fully paid for, and, according to Defense Department estimates, will be usable for several more decades." 
   "Our air base in Minot plays a critical role in protecting our nation, and we\'ve all seen how many missions the B-52 bombers have flown in Afghanistan and elsewhere," Senator Conrad said. "This plane is unmatched in its range and payload ability. It is a plane that we\'re going to be using more than 30 years from now." 
   The bill funds the B-52s for one year, beginning October 1, 2005. The bill now goes to the Senate Appropriations Committee for approval.
