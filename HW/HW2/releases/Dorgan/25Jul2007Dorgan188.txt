   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   July 25, 2007
   "It is almost unbelievable to me that the President would threaten to veto the Farm Bill at this early stage.
   "After unanimous, bipartisan agreement among members of the House Agriculture Committee, a veto threat at this point is a clear sign that the President's priorities are not in line with those of rural America.
   "The Senate will take up its version in September, and I will push for a bill that preserves a strong safety net, establishes a permanent disaster relief program, and makes reasonable reforms to commodity support programs that will strengthen our farm program, and improve quality of life in rural America.
   "I hope the President will work with us rather than issue needless threats."
