SEN. DORGAN HONORED WITH 'BELL RINGER AWARD'
  The North Dakota Association of Elementary School Principals (NDAESP) presented Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) with its "Bell Ringer Award" in Washington Tuesday as an acknowledgement of his successful efforts to overturn a controversial U.S. Department of Education ruling and help thousands of North Dakota teachers remain qualified to teach. 
   More than 3,800 North Dakota elementary school teachers would have failed to be considered "highly qualified" under the Department of Education's interpretation of the No Child Left Behind Act without intervention by Dorgan and the other members of the state's delegation. Dorgan, Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Representative Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) held several meetings with high-level officials at the federal Department of Education, including Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, calling on them to reevaluate the teaching requirements and bring some common sense to the No Child Left Behind law. 
   Senator Conrad and Rep. Pomeroy also received Bell Ringer Awards from the NDAESP. 
   "I am honored to accept this award on behalf of all the highly qualified educators in our state who go to their classrooms everyday and just do an admirable job of teaching our state's children," Dorgan said. "I am fully convinced that North Dakota has some of the finest teachers in the nation, and I'm glad the Department of Education was able to do an about-face on their Byzantine ruling. Finally, we see some common sense in the way this law is being implemented."
