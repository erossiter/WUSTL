SEN. DORGAN HIGHLIGHTS NEW TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE SECURITY OF NATION'S FOOD SUPPLY AT ANIMAL ID ACTION SUMMIT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday the animal identification technology being developed at Dickinson State University and North Dakota State University will help ensure the security of the nation's food supply, and help U.S. ranchers break into new markets around the world. Speaking at an Action Summit on Animal Identification, Dorgan urged U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Under Secretary Burton Eller to work closely with ranchers as the agency develops its animal ID system. 
   Dorgan co-hosted the Animal ID Action Summit at Dickinson State University to give local ranchers an opportunity to hear an update on the USDA's proposed national Animal ID program. Other co-hosts included Dickinson State University (DSU), North Dakota State University (NDSU), NDSU Research Extension Center and the Red River Valley Research Corridor Coordinating Center.
   "Animal identification technology will help expand and open markets around the world for American meat products. But the USDA needs to include our ranchers as this program is developed, and I hope Under Secretary Eller will continue to consult them as this program moves forward," said Dorgan. "Dickinson State University and North Dakota State University have been leaders in developing advanced RFID technology to track livestock, further marking the Red River Valley Research Corridor as a high-tech center." 
  The summit provided producers with a forum to ask questions about the cost, confidentiality and operation of USDA's proposed national Animal ID program. The event also featured demonstrations of a radio frequency identification (RFID) research project at North Dakota State University and Dickinson State University, which is supported by funding Dorgan secured through his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
