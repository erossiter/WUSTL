SEN. DORGAN SAYS NEW NORIDIAN PROVIDER CALL CENTER IN LEEDS WILL BOOST LOCAL ECONOMY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday that the new Noridian Administrative Services (NAS) data provider call center will bring good-paying jobs and economic development to the city of Leeds. He attended the open house for the new call center that will become a significant employer in Benson County.  
   The new call center in Leeds is a part of the nation's first Rural Economic Area Partnership (REAP) Zone that Dorgan created to bring businesses and create jobs to revitalize rural areas suffering from out-migration. Dorgan introduced REAP to NAS at his Federal Information Technology Roundtables. 
   "This new call center is a great example of how the REAP Zone in Leeds is helping to revitalize the community," said Dorgan. "After first introducing REAP and NAS together several years ago, I am excited to see this new call center come to fruition." 
   Dorgan has secured $3.9 million for two North Dakota REAP Zones. Since 1999, the two REAP Zones in North Dakota have created or retained 446 jobs in 14 counties and established 50 new start-up businesses.
