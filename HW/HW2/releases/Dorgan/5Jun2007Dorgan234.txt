   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan
   June 5, 2007
   "I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Senator Craig Thomas last evening. I had the opportunity to work closely with him on a number of committees and issues. He was a wonderful man whose word was his bond and who cared deeply for his home state of Wyoming and for the future of this country.
   "We served together on the Energy Committee and on the Indian Affairs Committee. Prior to being elected to the Senate, we served together in the House of Representatives. He was a kind and thoughtful man; a proud son of the American West who never forgot about the people and the places he represented.
   "For the past six months, I was privileged to have Senator Thomas serve as the Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, which I chair. His commitment to American Indians, and particularly to those living on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming was evident in his strong support for Indian health care and other services to Native Americans.
   "In recent months, Senator Thomas faced a challenging illness with great courage and grace. He was an inspiration to all of us who served with him and who were his friends. We will miss him in the United States Senate. My deepest sympathies go to his wife, Susan, and their four children."
