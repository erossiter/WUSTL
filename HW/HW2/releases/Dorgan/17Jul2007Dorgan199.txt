SENATE APPROVES BILL CO-SPONSORED BY SEN. DORGAN TO IMPROVE CARE FOR WOUNDED AMERICAN SOLDIERS
  U.S. Senate has approved legislation co-sponsored by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) to end shortfalls in the care and treatment of wounded American soldiers. 
   The action seeks to speed access to, and improve, care for the thousands of soldiers returning from duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the nearly 1,800 soldiers from throughout the region who have applied for VA health care services through the Fargo VA Hospital.
   By requiring the Department of Defense to establish a comprehensive health care policy, enhance the care available to injured soldiers, and improve substandard military health care facilities, the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act will help ensure wounded soldiers returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and other missions will receive the first-rate health care they were promised and deserve, Dorgan said.
   The legislation also addresses inadequate care for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder by directing new resources to prevent, diagnose and treat the ailments that result from such injuries. It also expands assistance to veterans who have become disabled as a result of their service to the nation.
   "Our soldiers and veterans have given much to this nation, and we have to make sure they receive the best health care in the world," Dorgan said. "Never again should our soldiers be faced with conditions like those discovered earlier this year at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Those who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the nation deserve better, and this legislation will make sure they receive the care they need."
