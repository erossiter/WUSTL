SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE WILL OPPOSE EXTENSION OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND IF IT IS NOT CHANGED
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday he will oppose the renewal of the No Child Left Behind federal education program when Congress takes it up later this year unless it is modified.  
   Dorgan said he is convening a task force of education experts from across North Dakota to help determine whether there are any reforms that could be made to salvage the poorly implemented program. 
   "Unfortunately the program has become a one size fits all approach for the federal government to measure the progress of local schools, and I don't think it is working to measure real learning," Dorgan said. 
   Dorgan said that while the No Child Left Behind Act was passed with good intentions, the Administration's implementation of the program has been plagued by a lack of funding and flexibility. He said he will use the task force he has formed to help determine "common sense" reforms to make the program worthwhile, or whether we should chart a new course for the nation's education policy. 
   Dorgan made the announcement after a series of meetings with education leaders from around North Dakota. 
   "Some of the concepts behind the No Child Left Behind program were positive, but it's clear now that the implementation of this program has been a failure," Dorgan said. "When Congress takes it up later this year, I'm going to push to scrap this program unless it is substantially improved."
