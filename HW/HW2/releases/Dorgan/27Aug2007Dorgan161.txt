   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN (D-ND)
   "The resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is the right thing for the country. The Department of Justice is a critically important department and it has lost a great deal of credibility during the tenure of Attorney General Gonzales.
   "I hope this resignation means the President will now select someone who is extremely qualified and who will engender a great deal of confidence as we go forward."
