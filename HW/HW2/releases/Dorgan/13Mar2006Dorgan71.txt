SEN. DORGAN CALLS ON BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE TO WITHDRAW CASSELTON TRAIN SPEED PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF LATEST DERAILMENT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said in a letter today to Burlington Northern Santa Fe that this morning's derailment of a train carrying products ranging from battery acid to paint illustrates exactly why the railroad's move to increase train speeds through Casselton, North Dakota, would pose an undeniable safety risk to the community. 
   In a letter to BNSF President Matthew Rose, Dorgan noted that this is the third derailment in the Casselton/Mapleton area in the last two years. In addition to today's derailment, 32 cars went off their tracks on December 30, 2004; and 25 cars derailed on May 5, 2005. An increase in the speed limit could result in worse damage if derailments occur in the future, Dorgan said.
   "I am very relieved to hear that today's derailment did not injure anyone and hasn't caused any environmental damage that we know of," Dorgan said. "But we need to think, 'Would we be able to breathe this sigh of relief if that train had been traveling at 60 miles per hour, the rate BNSF is seeking?' The answer is: We just don't know, but I think the risk is great enough to refrain from any sort of significant speed increase in this region."
   "I hope that you will abandon this proposal in light of all the risks that are involved," Dorgan stated in his letter.
