SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE WILL PUSH FOR AN INCREASE IN ETHANOL USE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) co-sponsored legislation Thursday to increase the use and availability of ethanol, legislation he will be in a key position to help move through Congress as the new Chairman of the Energy Subcommittee. Dorgan said the legislation will help spur the use of renewable fuels throughout the country and encourage more production of ethanol in states like North Dakota.  
   Dorgan is a cosponsor of the Biofuels Security Act of 2007 that will increase the amount of ethanol sold in the United States. Under the Biofuels Security Act, the Renewable Fuels Standard will be increased to require that 60 billion gallons of ethanol be sold in the United States by 2030. Oil companies will be required to provide pumps that dispense E-85 fuel at their wholly-owned or branded retail stations. In addition, automobile makers will be required to increase the number of duel fueled vehicles and make all cars duel fueled by 2016. 
   "Requiring more use of ethanol will help boost ethanol development and production in North Dakota and around the nation, leading to a decrease of our nation's dependence on foreign sources of oil," said Dorgan. 
   Dorgan was an original author of the Renewable Fuels Standard that was included in the 2005 energy bill that requires U.S. refineries to use at least 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually by 2012.
