SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE'LL PUSH TO EXPEDITE NOMINATION OF NEW ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called Thursday for a speedy confirmation of Carl Artman as the next Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs as soon as possible, saying it is "shameful" that the position at the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been vacant for nearly two years.  
   Though Artman's nomination was approved by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee last year, it was held up in the full Senate. Dorgan - who is Chairman of the Committee - said he will hold a hearing next week on the nomination and he hopes to report it out of the committee the same day. 
   "Our American Indian communities face genuine crises in health care, housing, education and a number of other areas," Dorgan said. "It is just wrong that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has not had permanent leadership for nearly two years. I'm going to push this nomination so we can get to work and begin solving problems."
