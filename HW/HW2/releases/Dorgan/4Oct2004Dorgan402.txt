SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN'S MEASURE TO IMPLEMENT SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS PROMPTED BY MINOT DERAILMENT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday the Senate has approved a bill that includes his legislation to implement the railroad track and tank car safety measures prompted by the derailment of a train carrying anhydrous ammonia near Minot in January 2002. The recommendations were made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), following its investigation of the accident.  
   The NTSB report on the derailment of 31 Canadian Pacific Railway cars recommended greater oversight of railway joint maintenance and measures to improve "fracture toughness" for the tanker cars. Congressional action is required for the recommendations to become law. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, wrote legislation to implement them and the Committee approved that measure in April as part of a broader rail safety bill. The Senate approved that bill Friday by unanimous consent. It goes next to the House for consideration. 
   "No other community should have to experience a tragedy like the Minot derailment, which we now know was preventable," Dorgan said. "Thousands of train cars full of hazardous materials travel through communities all across America everyday. I'm pleased that Congress has acted to implement these recommendations." 
   Under the bill, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) would: 
   * Improve procedures for identifying cracks in rail joint bars, which the NTSB found had failed in the Minot accident. 
   * Develop and implement design standards for pressurized tank cars. 
   * Analyze the impact resistance of steel in tank cars constructed before 1989 (which were made with non-normalized steel and found to be less crash resistant). 
   * Report to Congress with recommendations for measures to eliminate or mitigate the risks of catastrophic failure. One person was killed and hundreds sickened by anhydrous ammonia that spilled from ruptured tankers in the Minot accident. 
   The bill would also beef up national railway safety and better coordinate rail safety with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to more effectively protect against potential acts of terrorism. It would authorize grants to upgrade security, improve the methods of hazardous materials transportation, and provide more vigorous and comprehensive screening of passengers, baggage and cargo.
