SEN. DORGAN SAYS DEFENSE BILL GIVES BOOST TO NORTH DAKOTA MILITARY PERSONNEL
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan said Tuesday the Defense Authorization Bill, which has been signed into law by President Bush, will give a well-deserved pay raise and other important support to military personnel serving in North Dakota and across the world.  
   Dorgan worked with colleagues in the Senate to ensure the bill includes a 3.5 percent pay raise. It also makes substantial improvements in health care for members of the military. He also worked with Senator Kent Conrad to author a provision in the bill to double the reward for information leading to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and requiring classified reports to be made to Congress detailing efforts to apprehend the al Qaeda leadership. 
   "Especially in a time of war, it's important that we show the men and women serving in our military that their nation is grateful for their service," Dorgan said. "With our Air Force installations in Minot, Grand Forks and Fargo, we have a particularly close tie to our military. This bill will give them a needed boost and make sure they have the support they need to carry out their missions." 
   The legislation also includes a provision, authored by Senator Dorgan, which requires the Bush Administration to establish a system for tracking and monitoring weapons the U.S. sends to Iraq. The amendment was prompted, Dorgan said, by reports that the Defense Department cannot account for about 200,000 pistols and rifles it provided to Iraqi security forces. The Department has no system in place to track and monitor weapons provided to Iraq. There have been reports that many have fallen into the hands of insurgents fighting U.S. soldiers. 
   The bill includes a provision authored by Senator Conrad and co-sponsored by Senator Dorgan that prevents the Air Force from lowering the readiness status of any of the 76 B-52s that it is required by law to keep in service. 
   The bill incorporates the Wounded Warrior Act, which improves the benefits and healthcare for veterans, service members and their families. It has recently come to light that wounded service members at Walter Reed have been forced to recover in deplorable conditions and have been subjected to bureaucratic backlog and sub-standard outpatient care. The bill also reforms the evaluation systems of the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that the conditions improve. 
   The bill also: 
   * Continues to prevent the Department of Defense from increasing the fees and co-pays paid by retirees and reservists for the TRICARE health program; 
   * Increases the funding for the Defense Health Program, which provides medical and dental care for active military worldwide; 
   * Gives members of the National Guard and Reserves up to 10 years to use their educational benefits after they have left the service. Currently, reservists are only able to use their educational benefits while serving but long deployments have made it impossible for many reservists to take advantage of the benefits; 
   * Increases the size of the Army and Marines by 13,000 and 9,000 respectively.
