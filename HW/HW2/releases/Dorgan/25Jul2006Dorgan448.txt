SEN. DORGAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINAL PASSAGE OF DRU'S LAW IN CONGRESS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) reacted Tuesday to the final passage of Dru's Law, which he authored and introduced in the spring of 2004, as part of comprehensive sex offender legislation. Rep. Earl Pomeroy subsequently introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. 
   One provision of Dru's Law creates a national database of sex offenders called the "Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website," named after the University of North Dakota student who was abducted and murdered in 2003. The bill goes next to the President, who is expected to sign it Thursday.

   July 25, 2006
   "I welcome the passage of Dru's Law by the House of Representatives. That completes the bill's movement through Congress.
   "The President has invited me to the White House on Thursday for a bill signing ceremony, and I will be honored to attend. It's taken two years to get the provisions of Dru's Law signed into law. It will be a culmination of some important work that will protect our children from dangerous sexual predators."
