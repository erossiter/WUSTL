DELEGATION ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR NORTH DAKOTA'S CHILDREN, FAMILIES
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy today announced that the Grand Forks, North Dakota, Public School District has been awarded more than $1 million to support Head Start programs for children and families. 
   "Head Start is an essential first step to learning for many North Dakota kids and families," the delegation said in a joint statement. "Head Start programs are giving children across our state an early start in preparing them for school and life." 
   Head Start is a child development program that serves low-income pre-school children and their families. Since 1965, Head Start programs have been serving families in North Dakota, providing education, health, nutrition, and social services. 
   The grant, which totals $1,087,309, was awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services with funds appropriated by Congress.
