SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES BILL TO STOP OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN ABUSES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced legislation Thursday along with Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) to help put an end to offshore tax haven abuses and make sure that U.S. companies pay the taxes they owe.  
   "It is outrageous that many U.S. companies have escaped paying tens of billions of dollars in taxes each year by shifting their profits to foreign tax havens," said Dorgan. "It is wrong to give these companies an unfair advantage over other domestic companies on Main Street, and unfair to businesses and families who pay their taxes in full." 
   This legislation would deny the tax "deferral" benefit to U.S. multinational companies that set up controlled foreign subsidiaries in tax haven countries, and instead continue to treat these foreign corporations as U.S. companies as if they never left. The bill includes a list of tax haven countries and gives the Secretary of the Treasury the ability to add or remove a foreign country from the list. Businesses would have until December 31, 2008, to restructure their operations before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) enforces these tax policies.
