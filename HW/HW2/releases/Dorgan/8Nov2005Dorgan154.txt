SEN. DORGAN SECURES FUNDING FOR JAIL, TREATMENT FACILITY IN RUGBY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday a House-Senate conference committee agreed on a bill that directs funding toward the construction of a new jail and treatment facility in Rugby.  
   Dorgan, a member of the conference committee on the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill, secured $400,000 for the project, which he said will help the state bolster its treatment program for individuals addicted to drugs, especially methamphetamine. With the help of about $7.1 million in federal grants and loans - as well as other state and local funds - the center should be completed by July 2006. 
   "Meth is a devastating drug that is affecting communities throughout North Dakota, and we need to make sure we have the resources to fight its spread," Dorgan said. "This drug treatment center will help fill a gaping hole in our state." 
   The facility, which will serve Pierce, McHenry and Wells counties, will include 116 beds overall, with 40 beds specifically slated for treatment purposes. 
   The legislation now goes back to the full House and Senate for final approval.
