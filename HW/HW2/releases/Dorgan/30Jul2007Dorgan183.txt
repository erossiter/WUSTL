   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan
   "I was informed this morning by the CEO of Ingersoll-Rand about the sale of Bobcat to a South Korean company called Doosan Infracore.
   "I am not surprised that Bobcat was sold because Ingersoll-Rand had previously announced its intentions to sell its Bobcat division.
   "However, I am surprised that it was sold to a South Korean company. And I am always concerned about the risk of U.S. manufacturing being moved to low-wage manufacturing facilities in Asian countries.
   "I intend to meet with the Doosan representatives next week when they are in North Dakota, and I hope they will make a commitment to keep the Bobcat production facilities operating and expanding in North Dakota in the long term.
   "Bobcat is one of the top American brands and the jobs that exist to manufacture the Bobcat products in North Dakota are good-paying jobs with strong benefits. It's a very important part of our state's economy, and I hope we will get a commitment from the Doosan Company to maintain those facilities in North Dakota in the long term."
