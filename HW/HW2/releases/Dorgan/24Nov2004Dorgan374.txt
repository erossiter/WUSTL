SEN. DORGAN JOINS IN OPENING NEW IMPROVED MAIN AVENUE BRIDGE HE HELPED FUND
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) joined state and local officials Wednesday in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the improved and expanded Fargo-Moorhead Main Avenue Bridge, which he called "a signature bridge that will connect Fargo and Moorhead in a unique way."  
 A member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan secured $2.5 million for the improvements to the bridge. 
   "This bridge, its plazas, walkways and safety enhancements, will draw residents and visitors downtown and help make both sides of the bridge special places for the community," Dorgan said. "This bridge will be wonderful new asset in its own right, in addition to its key role in transportation. It draws attention to the natural beauty of the Red River and is sure to become a centerpiece of the continuing rejuvenation of the Fargo-Moorhead area. I'm pleased that the work of so many members of the community has created this new landmark that will benefit both sides of the river for decades to come."
