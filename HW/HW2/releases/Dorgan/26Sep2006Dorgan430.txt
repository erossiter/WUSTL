SEN. DORGAN SAYS HOUSE, SENATE AGREE ON BILL THAT INCLUDES FUNDING TO ESTABLISH FACILITY AT STANDING ROCK
  An appropriations bill that has cleared a major hurdle and is set for final passage includes $2.5 million in federal funding to establish a manufacturing facility on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that will produce parts for U.S. Army vehicles, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday. 
   Dorgan, a member of the House-Senate conference committee that negotiated the final version of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill, said the facility will significantly reduce the idle days that result when military vehicles have to wait for needed parts from the standard supply network, particularly for parts that are in short supply or no longer manufactured.
   Senator Dorgan also credited Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Congressman Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) for their work in helping move the bill through Congress.
   The new precision manufacturing facility will be located in Fort Yates, North Dakota. The funding will be used to establish the facility and to hire and train tribal members to manage the company, operate precision machining equipment and market its products.
   "This is an exciting opportunity for Standing Rock that will bring good-paying jobs to the reservation while making our military stronger," Dorgan said. "The Department of Defense awards a significant number of contracts to produce parts, do cutting-edge research and give logistical support to the military. I believe North Dakota's talented workforce make our state a logical place to do that work. That helps our communities by bringing economic activity and good jobs, and helps our military too."
