   "Former President Ronald Reagan was a man of great charm and was a remarkable storyteller.
   "I remember sitting behind him on the steps of the Capitol at his first inauguration. It was a gray day, but when he started speaking the sun came out. He inspired the country with the spirit of hope and optimism.
   "He will be remembered, however, for far more than the power of his personality, and his remarkable abilities as a leader. He will be remembered for his role in bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union, tearing down the Berlin Wall and winning the Cold War. He applied relentless pressure on the Soviet Union, and that had a great impact on ending the Cold War.
   "I join the Reagan family, and the American family, in mourning his loss."
