SEN. DORGAN SAYS CHINA'S AGREEMENT TO RESUME IMPORTS OF SAFE AMERICAN BEEF IS LONG OVERDUE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Friday called the announcement that China will resume imports of U.S. beef "long overdue," but said he was disappointed that Chinese officials still imposed needless restrictions on the beef they will accept. 
   Dorgan joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers last week in signing a letter, authored by Senators Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Pat Roberts (R-KS), calling on Chinese President Hu Jintao to resume beef imports immediately. Although China announced today its agreement to resume U.S. beef imports, they did not set a date to resume imports and agreed only to accept boneless beef from cattle 30 months old or younger, Dorgan noted.
   Dorgan said today's announcement is a positive step, but said the United States must keep the pressure on China until the exports actually begin.
   "China's unjustified ban on American beef has gone on far too long, so it's good news for ranchers in North Dakota and across the country that they will begin accepting some of our beef," Dorgan said. "But this agreement won't end the penalty against the American cattle industry until the first shipments of U.S. beef arrive in China. Our trade negotiators need to keep pushing China to open their borders immediately, as well as to expand the types of beef they will accept."
   China shut its borders to U.S. beef in December 2003 after a single Canadian cow was discovered with BSE in Washington State. Before the ban, China was the seventh-largest export market for U.S. beef.
