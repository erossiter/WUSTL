SEN. DORGAN APPOINTED TO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE NEGOTIATING BILL INCLUDING AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) has been appointed to a House-Senate conference committee that will negotiate the final version of the emergency spending bill that includes agriculture disaster relief for farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods have been threatened by weather-related disasters and skyrocketing energy prices. 
   Dorgan said he'll use his seat at the table to push for disaster relief for producers in North Dakota and across the country, but said it will be a "tough fight." The President has threatened to veto the emergency bill if it contains an agriculture disaster package, and the Republican Speaker of the House said last week the package is "dead on arrival."
   "The President has decided he doesn't want an agriculture disaster package and the House majority may join him, but I'm going to fight hard to convince them we need to stand up for family farmers and ranchers," Dorgan said. "Many producers in North Dakota and across the country suffered weather-related disasters last year and are in a tight spot through no fault of their own, and we have an obligation to help make sure they can stay in business."
   Dorgan said he expects the conference committee to begin meeting by next week.
   Dorgan and Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) introduced the agriculture disaster package as a stand-alone bill. They were joined by a bipartisan group of farm-state senators. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, then secured a unanimous vote of Committee members last month to add the disaster package to the emergency supplemental bill.
