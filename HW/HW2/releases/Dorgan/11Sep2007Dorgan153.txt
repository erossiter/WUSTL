  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement Tuesday night, after the U.S. Senate voted 74-24 to approve his amendment cutting off funds for a pilot program the Administration rushed to implement that would have allowed Mexican trucks to haul freight throughout the United States.  
   Text of the statement follows: 
   STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN (D-ND) 
   9/11/07 Washington, D.C.
   "Tonight's vote is a victory for safety. It also represents a turning of the tide on the senseless, headlong rush this country has been engaged in for some time, to dismantle safety standards and a quality of life it took generations to achieve. 
   "It also rejects the Administration's action to push a program many of us believe would compromise the safety of American drivers. 
   "Tonight, commerce - for a change - did not trump safety. 
   "Because my amendment is identical to language already included in the House-passed version of this bill, I expect this provision will not be altered in the House-Senate conference committee and that we have, effectively, stopped this pilot program. 
   "I thank every Senator who voted tonight to stand up for the safety of American drivers on America's roadways."
