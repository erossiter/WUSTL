SEN. DORGAN: NEW TRADE AMBASSADOR WON'T MEAN NEW TRADE POLICIES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday he does not expect much change in America's trade policies despite the fact that President Bush has nominated a new U.S. Trade Ambassador. 
   "The President sets the nation's trade policies," Dorgan said. "Even though those policies are clearly failing, there's no evidence any of them are about to change. It'll be the same policies, just a different implementer."
   On Tuesday, President Bush nominated Susan Schwab, Deputy Trade Representative, to succeed U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman, whom the President named to become the new head of the Office of Management and Budget.
   Dorgan, who is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, is a frequent critic of U.S. trade policies which he points out have created the largest trade deficits in world history and caused good U.S. jobs to be shipped overseas. "This appointment is sort of like the old Pony Express," Dorgan said. "They're changing riders, but the basic horses haven't changed. And if you are riding in the wrong direction, which is certainly the case here, it really doesn't make much difference whether you change riders."
   "What we really need are new trade policies," Dorgan said.
