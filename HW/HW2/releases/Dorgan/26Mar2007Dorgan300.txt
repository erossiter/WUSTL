SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL COULD HELP SPEED UAS MISSIONS AT GRAND FORKS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Monday the emergency supplemental appropriations bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee last week includes funding that may speed the deployment of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to Grand Forks Air Force Base and the Northern Border Air Wing in Grand Forks. Dorgan, a member of the Committee, worked to include the funding in the bill.  
   Dorgan, speaking at an Action Summit he organized to discuss the growing role of UAS in North Dakota, said the bill includes funding that will allow the Air Force to more quickly purchase 30 Predator UAVs, some of which may be based at Grand Forks Air Force Base and operated by the Happy Hooligans in Fargo. 
   The bill also includes $75 million for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to expedite the placement of unmanned aircraft systems and other equipment at its five Northern Border Air Wing sites, including Grand Forks. The Grand Forks branch of the Air Wing has begun limited operations, and Customs officials hope to add UAVs to the Air Wing's fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. 
   "This is important funding not only to bolster our military missions and border protection across the nation, but also because it will speed up the arrival of the Air Force and Customs and Border Protection missions at Grand Forks and Fargo," Dorgan said. "Our region is quickly becoming a center for UAV capability and research, and this will give us a boost as we work to grow and enhance the UAV missions in the Red River Valley."
