SEN. DORGAN PRESSES USDA TO STOP PLANS TO EXPAND IMPORTS OF CANADIAN BEEF, CATTLE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) pressed U.S. Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns Friday not to expand imports of Canadian beef and cattle. Dorgan said it would be irresponsible to open the U.S. market to more Canadian beef, especially considering the USDA's continued foot-dragging in the implementation of Country-of-Origin labeling requirements that would allow consumers to see where their beef came from.  
   In a letter to Secretary Johanns Dorgan objected to U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) proposal issued on January 9, 2007, which would allow the importation of live Canadian cattle born after March 1, 1999 and beef from animals of any age. 
   Dorgan also urged the USDA to fully implement mandatory Country-of-Origin labeling that was included in the 2002 Farm bill. In 2006 five cases of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease, were discovered in Canadian beef. 
   "American cattle is the safest in the world," said Dorgan. "U.S. consumers should not have to worry about the uncertainty of older beef from Canada, and be able to tell the difference between American beef and Canadian beef."
