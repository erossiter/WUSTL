SEN. DORGAN AND SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE APPROVE PROVISION TO INCREASE USE OF RENEWABLE FUELS
  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved Wednesday a provision cosponsored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that will continue to boost the production of biofuels in North Dakota and other states. The provision would increase the Renewable Fuels Standard to require refiners to produce and use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022. 
   "North Dakota has vast corn and biomass resources to produce these renewable fuels, which will create more jobs and spur North Dakota's economic growth," said Dorgan. "This increase in the Renewable Fuels Standard will stimulate production and use of renewable fuels in North Dakota and across the country and will help decrease our dependence on foreign sources of oil."
   This provision would increase the current Renewable Fuels Standard, which Dorgan authored in 2005, that requires the use of 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012. This increase in the Renewable Fuels Standard would include the use of cellulosic and other feedstock as well as conventional cornstarch-based fuels, all of which can be produced in North Dakota.
   In the next two years, North Dakota is on pace to produce about 400 million gallons of ethanol.
