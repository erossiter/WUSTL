   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  December 6, 2006
   "The release today of the Iraq Study Group's report and recommendations provides some new thinking and a fresh analysis of our course in Iraq. It is now clear that our course and our policies in Iraq must change. 
   "The Iraq Study Group's report gives the President some thoughtful analysis and advice from some of our country's most respected foreign policy experts. 
   "I hope the President will give the report the careful and close attention it deserves. 
   "The report states what almost everyone has known for a long time: The situation in Iraq is deteriorating. Our policy has not been working and it must change, now. The President must take this report and urgently begin a new diplomatic initiative and change our military approach. That means redeploying our troops, which will require Iraqis to make the difficult decisions and assume more responsibility for the security of their own country. 
   "Today, the Senate will vote on, and confirm, Robert Gates to be the new Secretary of Defense. I intend to vote to confirm him. 
   "The confluence of these two events - the release of the Iraq Study Group report and the confirmation of a new Secretary of Defense - presents the President today with a rare opportunity. Fresh thinking and new perspectives are urgently needed, and today the President is being given the opportunity for both. 
   "Now is the time for the President to begin anew."
