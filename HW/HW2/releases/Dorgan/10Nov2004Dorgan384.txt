SEN. DORGAN TRADE DEFICIT NEWS NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said new trade deficit levels announced Wednesday "are not a sign that things are getting better," despite claims to the contrary by Bush Administration officials.  
   "While the monthly trade deficit last month was slightly less than the month before, it is still the third highest trade deficit increase in history. There is no cause for cheering here. We're still on course to have a trade deficit at the end of the year that dwarfs all others before it - in fact, the biggest trade deficit in the history of any nation." 
   Dorgan renewed his call for the President to convene a trade summit and begin "fixing problems in old trade agreements and halt negotiations on new ones" until those problems are fixed. 
   "The trade deficit has become a massive lead weight for the economy, and left unchecked, it means higher interest rates, lower growth, and further decline in the value of the dollar in international trade."
