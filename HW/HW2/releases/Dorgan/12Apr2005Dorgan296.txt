   Statement by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan
  On New Trade Deficit Record
   April 12, 2005
   "Today's announcement about the record monthly trade deficit once again demonstrates the bankruptcy of our current trade policies. 
   "A $61 billion monthly trade deficit is a real crisis that, if not dealt with, will have serious long term consequences for American jobs and future economic growth. 
   "I call on the President to park Air Force One and work with us to develop a trade policy that works for America. 
   "The trade deficit today is one more chapter in a book of failures on trade policy. 
   "Uncle Sam has been played for Uncle Sucker by incompetent trade negotiators, a failure to enforce trade agreements and by our trading partners who see the U.S. as a patsy, importing food and oil while exporting jobs, and ignoring the long term consequences of our actions. 
   "Our country deserves public officials and a trade policy that demands "fair trade," and they should expect that we have the courage and the will to stand up for our economic interests."
