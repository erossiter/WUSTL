SEN. DORGAN MEETS WITH SUPREME COURT NOMINEE JUDGE ROBERTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met with Supreme Court nominee John Roberts in his Capitol Hill office Wednesday evening as part of a series of visits with Senators in preparation of upcoming confirmation hearings this fall.  
   Joining Dorgan and Judge Roberts were former Senator Fred Thompson and Jamie Brown, Special Assistant for Legislative Affairs at the White House. 
   Dorgan had never met Roberts before Wednesday, but said the visit was pleasant. 
   "The meeting offered me an opportunity to sit down and become acquainted with Judge Roberts," Dorgan said. "Judge Roberts clearly has an impressive set of credentials, and we will continue to learn more about his record when the Senate moves forward with its confirmation hearings this fall. This is one of the most important decisions that the U.S. Senate and a President can make. There will likely be many close, 5-4 decisions on the court in the years ahead, and this nominee could represent that swing vote in any number of cases."
