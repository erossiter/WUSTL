SEN. DORGAN ISSUES STATEMENT REACTING TO CANADIAN BORDER RULE CHANGES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement Wednesday in reaction to the announcement by Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns that he would change a portion of a proposed rule to reopen the border to Canadian beef.  
 The newly revised rule would prohibit the importation of beef products from cattle over 30 months of age. The previous version of the rule only allowed live cattle under 30 months of age to be imported, but had no age restriction on the importation of beef products. 
   The text of Dorgan's statement follows: 
   Text of Remarks By U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan, February 9, 2005
   USDA officials may think its changes to the rule are an improvement, but as long as they plan to go ahead with their effort to allow Canadian cattle to enter this country-on the heels of two more recently confirmed cases of BSE-I can't support them. 
   The rule is wrong-headed, and no amount of tinkering around the edges is going change that. I think they should go back to the drawing board and come up a rule that makes sense for the country's farmers, ranchers and consumers of American beef.
