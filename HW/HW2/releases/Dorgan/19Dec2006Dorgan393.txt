SEN. DORGAN SAYS ENERGY DEPARTMENT'S NEW OUTLOOK SHOWS NORTH DAKOTA WILL LEAD WAY TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday a new Energy Outlook report from the Department of Energy shows that North Dakota's Bakken Shale formation will play an increasingly large role in the effort to eliminate our nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy.  
   Dorgan, incoming Chairman of both the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, said the agency has substantially increased its estimate of how much domestic oil the United States will produce between 2017 and 2030. The Department of Energy says revelations that the Bakken Shale may hold a significant amount of oil played a significant role in the more optimistic outlook. 
   "This new Annual Energy Outlook from the Department of Energy amounts to a statement of confidence in the potential of the Bakken Shale," Dorgan said. "North Dakota has the potential to lead our nation to energy independence, and I'm going to keep pushing to encourage development that helps boost our domestic oil and gas production as well as developing renewable energy to bring good-paying jobs to our state." 
   Dorgan has pushed to increase development of the Bakken Shale, pressing the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to release a study of the formation's oil reserves. Last month, he brought USGS officials to Bismarck, North Dakota, for a meeting with key officials from the state's oil industry to discuss ways to boost development of the formation.
