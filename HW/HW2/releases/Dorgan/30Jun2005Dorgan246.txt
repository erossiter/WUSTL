SEN. DORGAN DISAPPOINTED AFTER CAFTA VOTE IN SENATE, HOPES IT CAN STILL BE STOPPED IN HOUSE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday night he is "disappointed" with the Senate's approval of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), but still holds out hope that it can be stopped in the U.S. House.  
   "CAFTA simply continues the failed trade policies of the past which have produced the biggest trade deficits in the history of the world and exported American jobs by the millions. It does nothing to improve the lives of workers in CAFTA countries or in the United States. In fact, it asks U.S. workers to compete with workers in countries where there are little or no worker or environmental protections in place, and where wages are as low as $2 a day." 
   "I am also very concerned about the precedent this agreement sets for the sugar industry. Sugar workers and producers in the U.S. will be hurt and hurt deeply by this agreement." 
   "I expect there will be a tougher time winning CAFTA approval in the U.S. House. Traditionally, trade agreements are a tougher sell in the House than in the Senate, and that appears to be the case today. So there is still hope, but the fact is, American workers and producers - particularly sugar producers - have been dealt a very bad blow by the U.S. Senate tonight, and by an Administration that has once again negotiated an agreement that shows little evidence that the interest of American workers and producers were given much, if any, thought at all."
