SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES EFFORT TO PARTNER RESEARCH CORRIDOR WITH NATIONAL LABORATORIES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Friday he is working to expand the Red River Valley Research Corridor by facilitating partnerships between North Dakota's research institutions and U.S. national laboratories such as Sandia and Los Alamos. Dorgan said he will bring representatives of the national laboratories to visit North Dakota later this year.  
   Dorgan oversees funding of the national laboratories as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. He and the directors of several national laboratories have discussed forging partnerships with the Research Corridor. Dorgan said such a partnership would not only help the laboratories expand their capabilities, but also provide valuable educational opportunities to North Dakota students and researchers and bring more federal funding and good-paying jobs to the state. 
   Dorgan made the announcement at a press conference commemorating the five-year anniversary of North Dakota State University's (NDSU) Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering. A member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan has secured more than $100 million to develop the center and support its ground-breaking research. 
   "The Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering is an example of the success we've had building a high-tech economy through the Red River Valley Research Corridor," Dorgan said. "I have had discussions with the heads of some of our national laboratories, and I think there is a real opportunity for us to partner with them to bring more research opportunities to our area and give another significant boost to the Research Corridor."
