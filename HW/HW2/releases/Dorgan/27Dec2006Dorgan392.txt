   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   December 27, 2006 
   "President Ford assumed the Presidency under the most difficult circumstances. And yet, in the shadow of an impeachment proceeding and upon the resignation of President Nixon, he offered a steady hand to give the American people a sense of hope. He dedicated much of his life to serving our country. Today, I join our nation in mourning his death."
