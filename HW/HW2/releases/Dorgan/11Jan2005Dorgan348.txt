SEN. DORGAN CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF PLANS TO RE-OPEN U.S. BORDER TO CANADIAN CATTLE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called Tuesday for the immediate suspension of efforts to re-open the U.S. border to cattle from Canada, after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said it has confirmed yet another case of Mad Cow disease in that country.  
   "This ought to demonstrate to the U.S. Department of Agriculture that they need to suspend action immediately on plans to re-open the border to Canadian cattle. We simply can't be opening our border to cattle from Canada at the same time we're having a series of discoveries of new cases of Mad Cow disease in Canada." 
   "We mean the Canadians no harm by this, but our first obligation is to protect the U.S. beef industry from what is apparently an on-going problem in Canada with Mad Cow Disease," Dorgan said. "The Canadian inspection system has certainly made improvements in the last year, but until we know a lot more about what is going on in Canada with regard to this disease, I think it is simply thoughtless to proceed with the rule to re-open the border. What we need now is more information and answers."
