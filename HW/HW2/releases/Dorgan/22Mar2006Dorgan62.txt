   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   March 22, 2006
   I'm pleased United Airlines has decided to continue to upgrade air service in North Dakota. This new flight from Fargo to the United Airlines hub in Chicago is helpful to our state's economy and encourages competition in the market. I hope this flight, along with the Delta flight to Salt Lake City announced earlier this month, is a positive indication of what's to come for North Dakota air service.
