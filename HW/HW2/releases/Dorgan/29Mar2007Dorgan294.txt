SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROVAL OF BILL THAT COULD SPEED ARRIVAL OF UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AT GRAND FORKS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad announced Thursday the U.S. Senate has given final approval to an emergency appropriations bill that includes funding that may speed the deployment of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to Grand Forks, North Dakota.  
   Dorgan and Conrad said the bill includes funding that will allow the Air Force to purchase 30 more Predator unmanned aircraft, some of which may be based at Grand Forks Air Force Base and operated by the Happy Hooligans of the North Dakota Air National Guard. The Senators worked with Congressman Earl Pomeroy and the Air Force to bring the UAS mission to North Dakota's military bases. 
   The senators said the bill also includes $75 million to speed the placement of equipment at the nation's Northern Border Air Wing sites, including the UAS that will be based at the Grand Forks branch. The Air Wing at Grand Forks has already begun limited operations, but it will eventually grow to include several dozen staff members that operate surveillance and interdiction missions with helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and UAS. 
   "The potential for UAS to revolutionize our military, government and the private sector is almost unlimited, and North Dakota is quickly becoming a hub of activity," Dorgan said. "This funding will help stand up the UAS missions at Grand Forks and Fargo more quickly, and that's good for the security of our nation and for our local economy." 
   "The approval of this funding in the Senate today is another important step for both Grand Forks and the Happy Hooligans in Fargo. This funding will allow the Pentagon to purchase 30 more Predators. And while they are headed to a war zone for now, it is a good bet that some of these Predators will eventually find themselves in Grand Forks," Senator Conrad said.
