SEN. DORGAN SAYS $69 MILLION FOR GARRISON DIVERSION WILL HELP FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REPAY DEBT TO NORTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) provided the largest-ever increase for North Dakota water funding in a bill approved by his appropriations subcommittee yesterday. Dorgan included $69 million for the Garrison Diversion project to help the federal government fulfill its obligation to compensate North Dakotans for the land it lost when the project was built. 
   The funding will be used primarily for rural water programs that bring a safe, reliable supply of water to all regions of North Dakota. In more than 40 years, the federal government has made good on less than half its obligation to the state of North Dakota.
   As chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan writes the bill that includes funding for the Garrison Diversion. He said he was able to cut some funding items in other areas of the bill in order to increase funding for water projects, including the $69 million allocation for the Garrison Diversion project - which is more than triple the average funding it's received over the last four decades.
   "When the citizens of North Dakota agreed to let the federal government create a permanent 500,000-acre flood in North Dakota, the federal government promised to repay them. North Dakota lived up to its end of the bargain, but the federal government has failed to fulfill its obligation," Dorgan said. "They built a flood that came and stayed in our state and promised benefits to us as a result. We are a state with 15 to 17 inches of annual rainfall, and the water projects that will move forward as a result of this funding are crucial to North Dakota's economic success."
