SEN. DORGAN BRINGS U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OFFICIALS TO BISMARCK TO DISCUSS WAYS TO BOOST DEVELOPMENT OF BAKKEN SHALE FORMATION
Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) convened a meeting of representatives of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and North Dakota petroleum experts Wednesday to discuss ways to increase development of the Bakken Shale oil fields. 
 "The research findings of USGS on the potential oil reserves in the Bakken Shale formation could lead to significant investments in our oil industry and economic growth for North Dakota," said Dorgan. "I look forward to learning the outcomes of the USGS studies, and I will continue to push in every way I can to spark the development of North Dakota's petroleum resources."
 Dorgan has pressed USGS to release the Bakken Shale study by USGS scientist Dr. Leigh Price, who studied the untapped reserve in the Williston Basin in 1999 and 2000 but died before the study was fully completed and peer-reviewed. Dorgan has also included language in the Interior Appropriations bill, still pending before the U.S. Senate, telling USGS to expedite its resource assessments of this region.
