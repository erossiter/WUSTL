SEN. DORGAN HEARS FROM TURTLE MOUNTAIN BAND OF CHIPPEWA TRIBE AS SENATE PREPARES TO CONSIDER HIS BILL TO ADDRESS INDIAN HEALTH CARE CRISIS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, met here Wednesday with leaders and members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa community to hear first-hand their experiences with the health system on tribal lands and their hopes for the future of Indian health care. 
   During his stop here, Dorgan toured the Indian Health Services facility and met with the Tribal Council to discuss issues of concern to the tribe. He then conducted a "listening session" for the general membership to discuss Indian health care and other issues.
   The meeting was particularly timely, as the Senate will take up the Indian Health Care Improvement Act on January 22. Dorgan authored the legislation which seeks to address what Dorgan describes as a "genuine Indian health care crisis." 
   Dorgan said the bill will authorize and strengthen a wide range of Indian health care programs. "There is a crisis in Native American health care and it's time that we address it," Dorgan said. "With the higher than average rate of diabetes and a high rate of youth suicide, reservations are faced with significant issues that require specific responses, we must act and we must do so now."
   Dorgan noted the bill takes special aim at diabetes and youth suicide among Native Americans, two of the most critical issues facing Indian communities. Native Americans are three times more likely to die from diabetes than the general population in this country and have the highest rate of suicide of all ethnic groups in the United States. Indian youth in parts of the Great Plains are 10 times more likely to commit suicide than their non-Indian counterparts.
   The Senator asked for reactions to key provisions of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which he outlined at the listening session. Major provisions of the bill include the following:
   * Authorizing additional tools for tribal communities to address suicide among Indian youth;
   * Seeking to address lack of access to health care services, which may be due to limited hours of operation of existing facilities or other factors, by allowing grants for demonstration projects that include a convenient care services program as an alternative means of health care delivery;
   * Addressing the $1 billion backlog in needed health care facilities, such as alcohol and substance abuse treatment centers, and $1 billion in unmet need for sanitation facilities in tribal communities;
   * Making permanent a number of successful federal programs providing services to Native Americans in long-term health care, diabetes prevention, and other key areas;
   * Expanding scholarship and loan programs that encourage more American Indian people to enter health care professions.
