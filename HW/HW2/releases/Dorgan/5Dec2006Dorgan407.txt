DELEGATION APPLAUDS $4.8 MILLION AWARD TO PRODUCE JET FUEL FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES AT ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH CENTER
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy said Tuesday a project at the University of North Dakota's Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) to produce jet fuel from renewable sources will help spur the use of renewable fuels in the U.S. military and help boost the renewable energy industry in North Dakota.  
   The EERC has been awarded $4.8 million to produce JP-8 jet fuel from vegetable oils and other renewable fuels for the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). 
   "The bio-jet fuel that EERC is developing has the potential to replace the jet fuel we currently use with fuel that comes from renewable sources, which are better for the environment and help reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This award to produce renewable jet fuel further demonstrates the world-class capabilities of the EERC and is good news for our state and for our nation's military." 
   The delegation has led the push to use more renewable fuels in the U.S. military. In September, the delegation met with Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael T. Moseley and urged him to invest in energy from renewable sources in North Dakota. The U.S. military uses 97 percent of the petroleum consumed each year by the U.S. government. Half of that is jet fuel consumed by the Air Force. 
   The funding was awarded by DARPA with funds appropriated by Congress.
