SEN. DORGAN SAYS HOUSE, SENATE AGREE ON BILL THAT WILL BRING NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPANY TO MINOT
  An appropriations bill that has cleared a major hurdle and is set for final passage includes $1.8 million in federal funding that would bring an information technology company to Minot to help create a state-of-the-art, global information network for the U.S. military, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday. 
   Dorgan, a member of the House-Senate conference committee that negotiated the final version of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill, said funding would be used by New York-based InfoTech to hire staff in Minot to do information technology development work for the Navy and other Defense customers.
   Senator Dorgan also credited Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Congressman Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) for their work in helping move the bill through Congress.
   The project will focus on creating a secure Web service the Department of Defense can use as a one-stop source providing access to diverse types of information, such as intelligence, satellite images and weather. The service would keep information secure while allowing almost real-time access by an authorized consumer anywhere in the world.
   "This project is an exciting opportunity for Minot that will spur the local economy while strengthening the U.S. military," Dorgan said. "This new capability will help our service members get the information they need, when they need it, so they can better do their jobs protecting America around the world. At the same time, the Red River Valley Research Corridor will gain an important new company in Minot that will further bolster our state's growing high-tech sector."
   House and Senate negotiators, including Dorgan, have agreed on a final version of the Defense Appropriations bill and will now send it to the House, then the Senate, for final approval.
