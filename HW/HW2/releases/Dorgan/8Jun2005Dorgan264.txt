SEN. DORGAN SECURES MORE THAN $22 MILLION FOR NORTH DAKOTA INDIAN HEALTH, WATER, CULTURAL PROJECTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), ranking member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, won approval Tuesday for more than $22 million in North Dakota water, Indian health and education projects in the Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill. The federal investments include advanced research projects, initiatives to promote Indian education, upgrades to cultural facilities in North Dakota, and water treatment and infrastructure projects throughout the state.  
   The bill restores $3.5 million in funding for United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) in Bismarck, after the President once again proposed eliminating funds for the school entirely. The bill also includes $54 million for the nation's 25 tribal colleges, four of which are in North Dakota and will receive a portion of that money. There also are significant continued investments in education programs aimed at encouraging Native Americans to pursue various medical fields. 
   The University of North Dakota's Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) will receive $2 million-double last year's funding level-for continued research aimed at improving the nation's air, water and soil quality. 
   Newly funded projects include $200,000 for the International Peace Garden, which will partner with Minot State University-Bottineau to study methods for growing specialty organic vegetables in North Dakota; and the Garrison Dam National Fish Hatchery, which will receive $200,000 to replace and repair infrastructure. 
   Dorgan also expects to add funding for several North Dakota water projects when the full Appropriations Committee takes up the bill, which is expected to occur later this week. 
   Below is a list of North Dakota projects currently included in the bill. 
   UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE (UTTC)

The funding will allow UTTC to continue its unique mission of educating Indian students from tribes from across the country. The college offers 20 two-year degree programs to its 500 students. UTTC also educates 100 pre-school and 175 elementary school children, and has an 80% job placement rate over the past decade.
