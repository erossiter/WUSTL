SEN. DORGAN SAYS NEW MARINA AT GARRISON BAY IS VICTORY FOR RECREATION IN NORTH DAKOTA
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) commemorated the breaking of ground for a new marina here Tuesday, saying its relocation to Garrison Bay will provide an important resource for area residents and a boost to the state's recreation industry.  
   Dorgan led the effort to convince the Army Corps of Engineers to improve lake access at Fort Stevenson State Park He secured a commitment from the Corps in 2004 to build a new marina at Garrison Bay, and then moved legislation through Congress to clear bureaucratic hurdles that popped up along the way. 
   "Lake Sakakawea is a wonderful resource, but our state doesn't get the full economic benefit unless there are boat ramps in place to allow access to the lake," Dorgan said. "Opening this new marina will be a shot in the arm for our economy." 
   Dorgan - who chairs the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Corps - included funding in that subcommittee's appropriations bill last year to construct the marina. When Congress adjourned without approving 10 of 12 appropriations bills, he worked with the Corps to ensure it used the funding already in its budget to get the project done. 
   "This marina has been a long time coming, and it's a welcome addition to our access points on Lake Sakakawea," Dorgan said. "I've worked with the Corps for several years to get this project going, so it's good to see the dirt start to move on a new marina that will be valuable to local residents and North Dakota's recreation industry."
