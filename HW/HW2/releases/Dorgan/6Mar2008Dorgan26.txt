DELEGATION, TASK FORCE 21 MEET WITH PENTAGON OFFICIALS ON MINOT AIR FORCE BASE MISSIONS
  U.S. Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy held a series of meetings with members of Task Force 21 and Pentagon officials on Capitol Hill Thursday to get an update on issues critical to the missions at Minot Air Force Base. 
   The delegation, along with Task Force 21, took the opportunity to reiterate the strategic value and high quality of Minot Air Force Base, as well as to get the latest information that will help them promote the base.
   Minot's B-52 mission got a boost recently when the Air Force listed it as one of its top priorities for extra funding in the Fiscal Year 2009 budget. The delegation has steered legislation through Congress prohibiting the Air Force from dropping the number of in-service B-52s below 76.
   "The Air Force has repeatedly told us it is committed to Minot Air Force Base as a dual-mission base well into the future, and that's not likely to change," the delegation said in a joint statement. "We're particularly encouraged by the news we've heard recently from the Air Force on B-52s. These planes are crucial to our military and we're going to keep pushing to ensure we make good use of them. In addition, we're happy that all indications are that the Air Force intends to keep a fleet of 450 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles, some of which are stationed at Minot, for the foreseeable future."
