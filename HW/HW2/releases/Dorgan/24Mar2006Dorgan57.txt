SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES $8 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDS FOR NORTH DAKOTANS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Friday that North Dakota will receive more than $8 million in additional federal funds for low-income heating assistance this year, providing significant help to those challenged most by rising energy costs. 
   In a hard-fought battle earlier this month, Dorgan said the Congress passed an additional $1 billion in funds for the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The Department of Health and Human Services announced today how much each state will receive as an allotment. North Dakota will get $8,404,497--50 percent more than what the state already had received this year. In total, the state will receive $24,679,616 in Fiscal Year 2006 LIHEAP funds.
   "Energy costs in the country are sky-high right now, and that most hurts low-income families who struggle to keep their heat on during the winter months," Dorgan said. "We fought hard in Congress to secure these extra LIHEAP funds, and I am proud that we succeeded because it means a world of difference to those most in need."
