SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE'LL KEEP PUSHING VA TO MAKE NORTH DAKOTA VETERANS HOME A TOP PRIORITY
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) met with officials at the North Dakota Veterans Home here Saturday. He briefed them on Senate action last week that will help ensure the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs puts the replacement of the Veterans Home at the top of its priority list. 
   VA officials assured Dorgan earlier this year that the replacement of the Veterans Home, which is suffering from safety-related structural problems, would be among their top priorities for the next fiscal year. Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, added a provision to the bill that funds the VA encouraging officials to promptly review the Veterans Home's application for funding and place the project among its top priorities.
   "Our veterans are receiving quality care at the North Dakota Veterans Home, but the building itself is old and facing some structural problems. The veterans who live there made significant sacrifices for their country, and its the least we can do to make sure they have a Veterans Home that reflects that," Dorgan said. "Now that the state has invested in this project, the VA has assured me they will make this a top priority."
