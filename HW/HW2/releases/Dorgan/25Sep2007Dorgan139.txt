SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES VERIZON WIRELESS WILL BRING PERMANENT CELL PHONE TOWER TO NORTHWOOD
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday that Verizon Wireless has agreed to install a permanent cell phone tower in Northwood, North Dakota, ensuring the community has reliable service as it recovers from a devastating tornado. 
   After the tornado swept through Northwood last month, Verizon Wireless rushed to the area and erected a temporary cell phone tower. Dorgan and Congressman Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) have pushed Verizon to keep the tower in the city. Senator Dorgan has continued to work with them as they evaluated the possibility of installing a permanent tower.
   Dorgan said Verizon Wireless officials informed him today they have agreed to install a permanent tower in 2008. A temporary tower will remain in place until the permanent tower is operable to ensure service is not interrupted as residents rebuild their lives. 
   "This decision by Verizon Wireless should give hope to the residents of Northwood trying to rebuild their homes and businesses after this devastating tornado," Dorgan said. "This town suffered extensive damage, but the residents have shown they are determined to rebuild a thriving community. I'm glad that Verizon Wireless has shown it is willing to invest in the future of Northwood as it gets back on its feet."
