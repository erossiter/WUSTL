DELEGATION ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $553,000 FOR TRANSMISSION LINE UPGRADES THROUGHOUT STATE
  Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy today announced that the North Dakota Maintenance Office of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) has procured $553,750 to improve electricity transmission lines throughout North Dakota. 
   The Fargo-based division of WAPA will use the funds to purchase cranes for maintenance and upgrades to 2,200 miles of electricity lines throughout the state. 
   "We are an energy-producing state, and we must have reliable, up-to-date transmission lines to distribute that power," the delegation said in a joint statement. "We are always looking for ways to improve energy transmission as we continue to invest in our energy industry, and that means making needed improvements to existing lines. These funds are a positive step for energy transmission throughout North Dakota." 
   The grants were awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy with funds appropriated by Congress.
