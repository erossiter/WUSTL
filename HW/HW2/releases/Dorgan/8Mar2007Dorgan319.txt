SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES BILL TO ENCOURAGE NEW CHARITABLE DONATIONS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced bipartisan legislation Thursday to allow taxpayers to make tax-free distributions from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) as gifts to charities. This bill, Dorgan said, would encourage billions in new donations to charities that provide essential support and services in local communities, and encourage donors to keep giving without unfavorable tax consequences.  
   His legislation, known as the 2007 Public Good IRA Rollover Act, has been endorsed by over 530 charitable organizations in 46 states and the District of Columbia. 
   A current temporary IRA rollover provision that Senator Dorgan pushed is in effect through 2007, and allows for direct gifts from IRAs from taxpayers age 70 ? and above. This temporary provision has been credited with significant gifts in North Dakota and around the country in 2006. 
   "A recent survey suggests that this IRA rollover legislation will result in new, sizable donations to support charities, small and large, that depend on the generous gifts of individuals," said Dorgan. "I want Congress to encourage charitable giving, which helps charities strengthen our communities and provide assistance to families and individuals who need it most." 
   The Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007 would make last year's temporary provision a permanent part of the tax code, and expand the amount than an individual can donate. 
   In addition, this bill would permit taxpayers who have reached age 59 ? to make tax-favored, life-income gifts to charities from their IRAs. Life-income gifts help charities secure funding commitments now to help plan for their future needs, and also encourage additional charitable giving. 
   Representatives Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) and Wally Herger (R-CA) have introduced a companion bipartisan bill in the U.S. House of Representatives.
