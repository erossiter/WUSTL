   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   I am very pleased with today's news that Northwest airlines officials and pilots seem to have reached a deal and will avoid a strike at this time. 
   Northwest is the dominant air carrier in North Dakota, and any disruption in service to our state would have a serious impact on commerce and general airline travel in our state. 
   Small states like North Dakota depend more heavily than most on a single air carrier because of a lack of competition in the marketplace. I know these are difficult financial times for all of the airlines, and that the pilots, flight attendants and others have made many sacrifices to keep the company afloat. I hope that as Northwest continues to restructure and get itself on sound financial footing it will remember that North Dakota has a stake in the process. 
   The relationship our state has with Northwest has been a very good one, and I expect it will continue well into the future.
