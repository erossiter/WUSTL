SEN. DORGAN SAYS REOPENING OF CHINA MARKET TO U.S. BEEF IS WELCOME FIRST STEP TOWARD FAIR TRADE POLICY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called today's announcement that China has agreed to reopen its market to American beef "welcome but long overdue," saying he will continue to monitor the situation and push the Administration to pursue a trade policy with China that stands up for America's economic interests. 
   Dorgan, along with a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues, sent a letter to President Bush last week urging him to make opening China's market to U.S. beef a priority in his talks with President Hu Jintao. Dorgan also has pressed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to convince other Asian nations to open their markets to American beef.
   The text of Dorgan's statement is below.
   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   April 12, 2006
   "China has agreed to reopen its market to American beef, and that is a good thing for ranchers in North Dakota and across the country. We've known for some time that U.S. beef is the safest in the world, so this announcement is welcome but long overdue.
   "There are still a lot of unknowns in this agreement. We don't yet know what rules will be put in place or how soon the Chinese will begin accepting our beef. But this is still good news and I plan to monitor this situation closely in the coming months.
   "However, our trade policy with China is still hopelessly one-sided, and I hope the Administration will take this victory further. China continues to saturate our country with their products and close their markets to ours, and it's time we show we have a backbone when it comes to trade with China."
