DELEGATION URGES VA SECRETARY TO PROVIDE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR VETERANS HOME
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy today urged U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary James Nicholson to give North Dakota the "highest priority" for providing federal funding to replace the Veterans Home in Lisbon, North Dakota. With the passage of $6.4 million in state funding, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is now able to proceed with their pledge to provide the necessary federal funding to construct the new home.  
   The VA has indicated that once the matching state funding was secured, the VA would make providing federal funding to build a new Veterans Home a top priority. Inspectors have raised safety concerns over significant structural design problems with the existing Veterans Home. 
   "The Veterans Home is in significant disrepair and needs to be replaced," said Senator Dorgan. "Our veterans deserve to have a Veterans Home that our state can be proud of. I will work in the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure that the VA has the necessary funding it needs to allow the new Veterans Home in Lisbon to move forward." 
   "It is vital that North Dakota receive this federal funding as soon as possible to construct a new Veterans Home for our state's wounded warriors," Senator Conrad said. "These brave men and women have given so much to our nation. They have made great sacrifices in defense of our freedom. We have a responsibility to care for them and must do everything we can to enhance the quality of life." 
   "North Dakota's veterans have bravely served our country. It is critical that the VA provide our former service members with the quality care that they deserve," Congressman Pomeroy said. "By providing funding for the North Dakota Veterans Home, we are fulfilling our promise to those who have sacrificed so much for our country."
