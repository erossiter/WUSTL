SENS. DORGAN, GRASSLEY CALL FOR RESOURCES TO MAKE USDA FARM PAYMENT PROGRAM ACCURATE, EFFICIENT
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to outline the staff and resources it needs to fix chronic problems with its farm payment program, saying they are "troubled" by reports that $2.8 billion was improperly distributed by the agency last year.  
   Dorgan and Grassley said that although much of the payments were classified as improper because paperwork was missing or incomplete, reports indicate that a lack of staff and resources is to blame. In a letter to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns, the senators said the agency should request the resources it needs to do its job accurately and efficiently. 
   "As you know, we represent agricultural states with many farm families that depend on a strong farm safety net," Dorgan and Grassley wrote. "We believe that openness and transparency in the distribution of our farm payments is important to maintaining the public's confidence in, and the integrity of, our farm programs." 
   In the 2002 Farm Bill, Dorgan and Grassley included legislation creating a database that would track payments to cooperatives and corporate mega-farmers, and allow policy makers to better target the farm program to help support family farmers. The senators have pushed USDA to complete work on the database and explain why it has continued to drag its feet in making the payment information publicly available.
