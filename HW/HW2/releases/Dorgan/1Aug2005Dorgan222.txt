SENS. SMITH, DORGAN LEGISLATION WOULD STRENGTHEN UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND, SPUR BROAD-BAND BUILD OUT TO UNSERVED AREAS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) introduced legislation Friday July 29, to accelerate the build-out of broadband communication networks to unserved parts of the country - primarily rural areas - where the cost of providing such service often proves to otherwise be prohibitive.  
   "We believe all Americans - rural or urban - should have access to high speed internet service," Dorgan said. "It's really not an option any more. It's rapidly becoming a fact of life that in order to be competitive, business and industry simply must have it. Increasingly, individual consumers are also demanding it. Our bill would help make access to such service a reality in areas that otherwise would get left behind." 
   "High speed internet has become an essential tool at home, the workplace and the classroom," said Smith. "The expansion of broadband services allows students, business and consumers in previously unserved communities to pursue the new opportunities provided by the instantaneous exchange of information." 
   The bill also authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broaden the types of communications services that contribute to the fund. Currently some kinds of communications services are required to contribute to the universal service fund, but not all are, creating inequities and incentives for companies to avoid contributing to the fund. 
   The bill authorizes up to $500 million a year from the Universal Service Fund for build-out to unserved areas. The fund currently provides financing for broadband networks only for schools and libraries. 
   The legislation would strengthen the Universal Service Fund and do so in a fair and equitable way, Dorgan said.
