SENS. DORGAN, WYDEN CALL FOR GSA ADMINISTRATOR DOAN TO RESIGN, ASK WHITE HOUSE FOR ANSWERS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) called Monday for the resignation of General Services Administrator Lurita Doan after multiple ethical lapses marred Doan's first year on the job. 
   They also released a letter, which was signed by 25 Senators, asking the White House to answer specific questions whether similarly inappropriate political activity may have taken place elsewhere in the Executive Branch prior to last fall's election.
   "The Executive Branch is not an extension of the Republican National Committee, nor of any political party," the lawmakers wrote. "Those who treat it as such must be held accountable."
   "Having a White House aide make a presentation at a government agency about what that agency can do to help elect Republicans is way out of bounds," Senator Dorgan said at the press conference Monday. "It goes well beyond anything I am aware of, by any administration of either party, and likely violates the law. It tears at the fabric of professionalism and nonpartisan civil service in our government. We need to hold those who thought it appropriate to hold such a meeting accountable, and to learn where else in the federal government similar presentations may have been made."
   "In less than a year on the job, Ms. Doan has shredded her own credibility," Senator Wyden said. "Good government and accountability are nowhere to be found at the General Services Administration under Ms. Doan's tenure. It's time for her to go."
   Administrator Doan has come under heavy criticism on Capitol Hill and in the media after she:
   * Hosted a White House political strategy session with GSA officials in government offices, at which she asked those officials to consider how GSA could help Republicans in the 2008 elections.
   * Personally signed and awarded a no-bid, $20,000 contract to a company run by a friend, disregarding objections by GSA's general counsel and other GSA officials.
   * Intervened on behalf of a contractor that had apparently overcharged the government, disregarding GSA's Inspector General and removing GSA officers who objected to the deal - and costing taxpayers an estimated $5 million.
   * Sought to cut the budget of GSA's independent Inspector General's office by $5 million, reportedly characterizing the IG and his staff as "terrorists."
   Dorgan said Doan's congressional testimony, in which she denied any wrong-doing, despite sworn statements from numerous GSA officials, including career civil servants and political appointees, "was not credible." She claimed not to remember asking GSA employees to find ways to help elect Republicans.
