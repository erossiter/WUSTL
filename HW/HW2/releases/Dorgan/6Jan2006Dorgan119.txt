SEN. DORGAN SAYS FUNDING WILL HELP LOW-INCOME FAMILIES HEAT THEIR HOMES, BUT MORE IS NEEDED
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday he is pleased at the announcement that North Dakota will receive $685,262 in federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds to help offset energy costs during cold winter months, but that more needs to be done to ensure Americans can afford to heat their homes.

   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  January 6, 2006
   "This funding will provide some crucial help to low-income families who struggle to heat their homes through the winter, but it still falls short of what needs to be done. 
   "With the price of heating oil and other fuel at a record highs, many Americans are being forced to choose between feeding their families and heating their homes. My colleagues in the Senate and I have argued that we can do better by fully funding the LIHEAP program, but the Administration and the majority in Congress have resisted our efforts. 
   "I will continue to fight in Congress to appropriately fund this program and make sure all Americans can afford to keep their families warm."
