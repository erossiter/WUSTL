SEN. DORGAN HONORS NORTH DAKOTA NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS FOR THEIR HEROIC SERVICE IN IRAQ
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) commended members of the Alpha Company of the 164th Engineer Battalion for their heroic service in Iraq. Dorgan attended the Freedom Salute Saturday to recognize 122 members of the National Guard company, also known as "Trailblazers," who returned last November after serving their mission in Iraq.  
   "I thank these brave men and women for their heroic efforts and sacrifices they made in serving their country," said Dorgan. "Our state is honored to have such a distinguished group of soldiers that led important missions, and we are glad to have them home." 
   Currently, 500 members of the North Dakota Army National Guard are mobilized or have been alerted for mobilization. Since 9/11, 3,700 National Guard soldiers and airmen have been mobilized for the global war on terrorism.
