AIR SERVICE PROBLEMS ON AGENDA OF SEN. DORGAN'S MEETING WITH NORTHWEST AIRLINES
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) brought Northwest Airlines executives here Wednesday to meet with state and city officials from across North Dakota to discuss concerns about recent troubles with the airline that have led to frequent flight cancellations and service disruptions.  
   In addition Dorgan said he wants to know the type of equipment and the frequency of flights the airline has planned for our state in the future.
   "Northwest Airlines is a major air carrier in North Dakota. Their service, and the delays and cancellations of the type we've experienced recently, have a significant effect on our state's travelers and our economy," Dorgan said.
   "Our communities depend on Northwest, and the lack of available seats and problems with travel delays have been troublesome. We want to understand what the airline is doing to correct the problems and what equipment they will be using in North Dakota in the future."
   Northwest is not alone. According to the Department of Transportation, 26 percent of all commercial airline flights in the first five months of 2007 were either delayed or canceled.
   But Northwest has had some equipment, scheduling and other problems as it has come out of bankruptcy, and it has a big impact on a state that relies on Northwest.
   "I hope recent actions by the company will put these problems behind them. The purpose of the meeting today is to learn from NWA officials what their recent actions will mean to air service in North Dakota."
