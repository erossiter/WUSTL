NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE RADAR IN WILLISTON WILL CONTINUE OPERATION, SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced Thursday that a bill approved by the Committee ensures the National Weather Service will continue to use its radar in Williston to produce regional forecasts.  
   The Williston radar provides crucial weather forecast information for northwestern North Dakota and northeastern Montana. However, the National Weather Service has expressed interest in using instead a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar in Watford City, some 35 miles to the southeast. 
   Unless it can be demonstrated confidently that the switch would not hurt the quality of weather forecasts in the Williston area, the National Weather Service should keep using its own radar, Dorgan said. A provision he secured as part of the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2006 ensures just that. 
   "Folks who live in North Dakota and make their living off the land know the value of reliable weather forecasts," Dorgan said. "Unless someone can prove to me that switching to the FAA's radar wouldn't hurt our farmers and ranchers, it just makes good sense to keep Williston's National Weather Service radar running."
