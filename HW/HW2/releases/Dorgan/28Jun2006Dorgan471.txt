SEN. DORGAN SECURES ADDITIONAL $5 MILLION FOR NEW MARINA ON LAKE SAKAKAWEA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday he has secured $5 million in an appropriations bill for a new marina at Garrison Bay on Lake Sakakawea. In addition, Dorgan secured language in the bill instructing the Army Corps of Engineers to use internal funds for any additional costs required for the marina. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, secured the funding and language in the Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The bill clears the way to replace the current marina in de Trobriand Bay, which was built in 1982 but has not been used on a consistent basis due to the continued drought and the mismanagement of the Missouri River system by the Army Corps.
   "This funding should ensure that boaters and tourists can make use of a new marina on Garrison Bay," Dorgan said. "The Corps made a promise to complete this marina, and I expect them to keep it. This funding, and the language in this bill, should clear up any ambiguities so they can move forward in a timely manner."
   The marina relocation project, originally authorized to be constructed using internal Corps funding in 2004, has been delayed due to higher than anticipated cost projections and internal regulations within the Corps. The Garrison Chamber of Commerce asked Senator Dorgan to pursue a new marina during a meeting in 2004. Dorgan received a commitment from the Army Corps to fund the project later that year.
