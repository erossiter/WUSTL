SENATE REJECTS PROPOSAL FOR SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO STOP IRAQ CONTRACTING WASTE, FRAUD, ABUSE
  For the second time in two weeks, the U.S. Senate on Tuesday rejected legislation that would have provided greater oversight of the billions of tax dollars being spent in Iraq reconstruction, despite congressional hearings chaired by Sen. Byron Dorgan that have documented what Dorgan describes as "the greatest amount of waste, fraud and abuse in the history of the country." 
   Voting along party lines, 44-52, the Republican majority rejected an amendment Dorgan offered to set up a special oversight committee, similar to the committee then-Senator Harry S Truman (D-MO) formed during World War II to root out war profiteering, waste, fraud and abuse. It was the fourth time the Senate has rejected such a proposal
   In addition, last week, Dorgan offered - and the Senate rejected - a separate amendment that would have reformed contracting procedures for Iraq reconstruction and other spending to protect taxpayers.
   Since traditional standing committees are providing "virtually no oversight" of this spending, Dorgan argued the Senate needs a special oversight and investigations committee like Truman's to keep an eye on war spending.
   "With one-party rule at the White House and in Congress, the problem is that nobody around here wants to embarrass anybody," Dorgan said. "Taxpayers are taking a bath because of it. Harry Truman, who was a Democrat, knew this isn't about embarrassing somebody. It's about protecting taxpayers. He established his committee when there was a Democrat, Franklin Roosevelt, in the White House. This Congress ought to be just as diligent and just as blind to partisanship as Harry Truman."
   Dorgan, as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, has chaired eight hearings investigating reports of waste fraud and abuse in Iraq reconstruction spending and plans more.
