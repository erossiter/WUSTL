SEN. DORGAN TAKES GAVEL AS CHAIRMAN OF SENATE INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) was elected chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee Thursday at the body's first meeting of the 110th Congress.  
   Dorgan said he will work closely with the committee's vice chairman, Senator Craig Thomas (R-WY), to ensure it continues to operate in its traditional bipartisan fashion. Dorgan said he is hopeful that the committee will address the most critical issues that face American Indian communities. 
   "I believe there is a bona fide crisis in Indian health care, education and housing, and this committee has an opportunity to make a real difference on those issues during this Congress," Dorgan said. "I look forward to charting a course that will help move our American Indian communities forward."
