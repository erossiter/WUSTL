SEN. DORGAN: 'DRU'S LAW' CLOSE TO PASSAGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Thursday Congress appears ready to send "Dru's Law" to the President to be signed into law. 
   Dorgan authored "Dru's Law," legislation which was named to honor the memory of the late Dru Sjodin, a young University of North Dakota student who was abducted in November 2003, and found murdered in April 2004 in Minnesota. The legislation would establish a national, public database on sex offenders that would allow searches across of state lines. It would also put in place new monitoring and supervision requirements for violent sex offenders who are released from prison. Rep. Earl Pomeroy introduced the companion bill to Dorgan's legislation in the House.
   Dorgan said a House-Senate agreement appears to clear the way for action on the bill, perhaps as early as today. Dorgan said the agreement makes "Dru's Law" part of broader legislation known as the "Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act," a bill that standardizes the tracking and data reporting of sex offenders across states, which is important to the success of a public national website.
