SEN. DORGAN PRESSES JAPAN TO RE-OPEN MARKET TO AMERICAN BEEF
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) called on Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi Wednesday to re-open his country's borders to American beef before his scheduled visit to the United States in June. 
   Dorgan, in a letter sent with Senator Jim Talent (R-MO) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues, said Japan's continued ban on American beef imports is "unfounded" and has had severe economic consequences on the U.S. beef industry. The U.S. cattle industry loses $100 million every month that Japan does not accept its imports.
   "Japan's ban on American beef imports has gone on far too long, despite the fact that we have taken aggressive steps to ensure the meat we export is completely safe," Dorgan said. "This ban started after a mistake by one processing plant in the state of New York. We have taken steps to ensure this doesn't happen again, and Japan should recognize that and end this ban or Congress may have to act to stick up for our nation's economic interests."
