SENS. DORGAN, SHELBY BILL WOULD HELP NATIONAL GUARD, RESERVISTS CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY RECOUP LOST PAY
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Richard Shelby (R-AL) introduced legislation Thursday to provide a tax credit that would allow National Guard and Reservists ordered to active duty to recoup at least some of the wages or salaries they lose when on active duty.  
   The two lawmakers said the difference between active-duty pay and what the citizen-soldiers earn in their civilian jobs is often substantial and represents a significant hardship for families left behind. Recent surveys have revealed losses of up to $3,000 per month and more. 
   The legislation provides a fully refundable, 100 percent tax credit - up to $20,000 a year - equal to the difference between the soldier's active duty pay and civilian pay. The credit cannot exceed $54 per day of active duty. Members of the National Guard or Reserve who serve more than 90 days would be eligible for the tax credit. 
   "In the past, when deployments were infrequent and of short duration, families absorbed this burden, but as deployments become more frequent and lasting a year or more, it is clear we are asking families to assume financial costs which were never anticipated. It is not appropriate to ask this level of financial sacrifice from those who already sacrifice so much for their country," Dorgan said 
   "Since September 11, 2001, more than 2,000 North Dakota Guardsmen and Reservists have been called to active duty," Dorgan said. "This bill will not fully compensate those called up for active duty, but it is a step to providing some help for them and their families."
