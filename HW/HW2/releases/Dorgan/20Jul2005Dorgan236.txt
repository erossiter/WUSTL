SEN. DORGAN'S AMENDMENT BLOCKS ENFORCEMENT OF 'CASH IN ADVANCE' RULE FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE SALES TO CUBA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) won approval Tuesday in a Senate subcommittee for legislation that would bar enforcement of at least one of the roadblocks the Bush Administration has erected to U.S. farm product sales to Cuba.  
   The provision, which Dorgan added to the Treasury-Transportation Appropriations bill, bars any expenditure by the Treasury Department to enforce a rule put in place by the Treasury Department in February requiring that Cuba pay in cash and in advance before any U.S. farm products leave the United States bound for Cuba. 
   "That rule is clearly intended to make it more difficult, if not impossible, for American farmers to sell farm products to Cuba, which is the exact opposite of what Congress intended when it lifted the more than 40 year old embargo on food and medicine sales to Cuba. It is clear the Bush Administration prefers to play South Florida politics, rather than do what is best for America's family farmers," Dorgan said. 
   "This provision would effectively remove the roadblock they put in place, and allow America's farmers to compete on a more equal playing field with farmers from the rest of the world who are able to sell to Cuba, and do so, without such a restrictive requirement." 
   Dorgan's provision, now part of the Treasury-Transportation Appropriations bill that will be considered by the full committee later this week, states simply: "None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to administer, implement or enforce the amendment made to section 515.533 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, that was published in the Federal Register on February 25, 2005."
