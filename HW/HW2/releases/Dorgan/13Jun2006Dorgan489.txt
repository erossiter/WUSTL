SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO BOOST MEDICARE PROGRAM FOR RURAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Tuesday joined Senate colleagues in introducing legislation that would help eliminate inequities for rural health care providers in the Medicare program - a move that would help ensure residents of sparsely populated regions have convenient access to medical care. 
   Dorgan, who offered the bill along with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of Senators, said the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity, or R-HoPE Act, would help rural hospitals stay afloat in North Dakota, where more than 100,000 seniors access their health care through the Medicare program. The bill would extend several programs that provide payments, loans and other incentives to health care facilities that serve rural populations.
   "When we talk about health care in our rural areas, the most critical issue is access," Dorgan said. "Many of the patients in our rural areas depend on the Medicare system, and we have to make sure the program gives a fair shake to health care facilities in smaller communities."
