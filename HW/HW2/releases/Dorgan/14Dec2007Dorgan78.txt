SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD VOTE YES AS SENATE PASSES DEFENSE BILL
  On Friday the U.S. Senate passed the Defense Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 2008, which gives all men and women in uniform a 3.5 percent raise across-the-board and makes substantial improvements in healthcare for members of the military in response to the deplorable conditions at Walter Reed Medical Center. Senators Dorgan and Conrad voted in favor of the bill.
   Included in the bill is a provision sponsored by Dorgan and Conrad that aims to step up U.S. efforts to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. 
   "The men and women at the bases in Grand Forks, Fargo and Minot and in the reserves across the state have dedicated themselves to supporting our country and we must ensure that they have quality healthcare while serving, in retirement and in the unfortunate case they are injured," Dorgan said. "I'm proud to have gotten a provision included in the bill that requires a tracking system for weapons we send to Iraq. We can't have the weapons we send to Iraq used against our own soldiers."
   "The brave service men and women protecting the nation at our bases in Minot, Grand Forks and Fargo are also our friends and neighbors and deserve nothing less than the finest medical care we provide," Senator Conrad said. "I'm also very pleased to have secured an amendment that will require technological upgrades to the nation's entire B-52 fleet, ensuring the planes are using the latest in defense technology."
   The legislation also includes a provision, authored by Senator Dorgan, which requires the Bush Administration to establish a system for tracking and monitoring weapons the U.S. sends to Iraq. The amendment was prompted, Dorgan said, by reports that the Defense Department cannot account for about 200,000 pistols and rifles it provided to Iraqi security forces. The Department has no system in place to track and monitor weapons provided to Iraq. There have been reports that many have fallen into the hands of insurgents fighting U.S. soldiers.
   The bill incorporates the Wounded Warrior Act, which improves the benefits and healthcare for veterans, service members and their families. It has recently come to light that wounded service members at Walter Reed have been forced to recover in deplorable conditions and have been subjected to bureaucratic backlog and sub-standard outpatient care. The bill also reforms the evaluation systems of the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that the conditions improve.
   The bill authorizes the Pentagon to spend almost $700 billion through September 30, 2008, including approximately $189 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The legislation next goes to the White House, where President Bush is expected to sign it into law.
   Senator Conrad authored an amendment to the bill that will upgrade the nation's fleet of B-52s and block a Pentagon plan to dramatically reduce America's bomber force. Both Senator Conrad and Senator Dorgan, an original co-sponsor of the bill, convinced colleagues that it was in the strategic interest of the country that we maintain a sizeable bomber force and that each plane is outfitted with the most technologically advanced equipment.
   The bill also:
   * continues to prevent the Department of Defense from increasing the fees and co-pays paid by retirees and reservists for the TRICARE health program; 
   * increases the funding for the Defense Health Program, which provides medical and dental care for active military worldwide;
   * gives members of the National Guard and Reserves up to 10 years to use their educational benefits after they have left the service. Currently, reservists are only able to use their educational benefits while serving but long deployments have made it impossible for many reservists to take advantage of the benefits;
   * establishes a commission to oversee the federal agency contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Titled the Commission on Wartime Contracting, the commission will have the power to investigate and study the contracting for reconstruction, logistics support and security functions;
   * increases the size of the Army and Marines by 13,000 and 9,000 respectively.
