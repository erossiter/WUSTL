SEN. DORGAN SAYS SAKAKAWEA WATER RELEASE IS CONTINUATION OF FAILED CORPS MANAGEMENT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' announcement that it will release water from Lake Sakakawea, dropping the lake's level by at least half a foot or more, shows that the Corps is continuing a failed management strategy that drains vital water resources upstream in favor of a small downstream barge industry.  
   The text of Dorgan's statement is below. 
   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  August 23, 2006
   "The announcement by the Army Corps of Engineers that they will release more water from Lake Sakakawea is an indication that the Corps will continue to injure upstream communities in favor of a relatively small barge industry downstream. 
   "This decision makes no sense when the severely low water levels in Lake Sakakawea are causing significant damage to North Dakota's much larger recreation industry and fisheries and depleting the water supply for communities near the lake. Many businesses and residences no longer have access to running water. At a time like this, the Lake Sakakawea reservoir should be filling up, not being drained. 
   "The Corps knows there is a drought and that water it sends downstream has to come from somewhere. Yet instead of holding water in upstream reservoirs, they continue to release water to keep a very small barge industry afloat. 
   "This is a continuation of a deeply flawed management strategy by the Corps, and it needs to change."
