SEN. DORGAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO COMBAT HEALTH CARE SHORTAGE IN AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES
  Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Byron Dorgan (D-ND) has introduced legislation that would renew and improve the Indian Health Care Improvement Act - directing resources to combat the chronic shortage of health care services in American Indian communities. Dorgan is the principal author of the legislation and was joined by Sen. Craig Thomas (R-WY) and a bipartisan group of 12 other Senate sponsors. 
   Dorgan has made expanding and improving health care services a top priority, saying there is a "bona fide crisis" in health care in tribal communities. The legislation takes a comprehensive approach to improving health care, including:
   * Authorizing additional tools for tribal communities to address suicide among Indian youth;
   * Seeking to address lack of access to health care services, which may be due to limited hours of operation of existing facilities or other factors, by allowing grants for demonstration projects that include a convenient care services program as an alternative means of health care delivery;
   * Addressing the $1 billion backlog in needed health care facilities, such as alcohol and substance abuse treatment centers, and $1 billion in unmet need for sanitation facilities in tribal communities;
   * Making permanent a number of successful federal programs providing services to Native Americans in long-term health care, diabetes prevention, and other key areas;
   * Expanding scholarship and loan programs that encourage more American Indian people to enter health care professions;
   * Placing a higher emphasis on Indian health care by elevating the Director of the Indian Health Service to the Assistant Secretary for Indian Health in the Department of Health and Human Services.
   "We urgently need to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and find a way to address the bona fide health care crisis in our American Indian communities," Dorgan said. "I'm going to push hard to get Congress to bring this legislation to the Senate floor so we have an opportunity to address the fundamental need for, and right of, American Indians and Alaskan Natives to obtain adequate and innovative health care."
