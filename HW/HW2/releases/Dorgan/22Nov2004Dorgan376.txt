CONGRESS APPROVES FUNDING TO SAVE AMTRAK, ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy announced Saturday that Congress has approved a spending package that includes about $3 million to help provide affordable air service for North Dakota through the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, rejecting an Administration plan to cut EAS funding in half and impose difficult new matching requirements on local communities. The Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2005 also includes nearly $1.2 billion for Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail system, rejecting the Administration's proposal to cut Amtrak's funding by about $300 million.  
   Under the Administration's plan for EAS funding, air travel in and out of Williston, Dickinson, Devils Lake and Jamestown would have been curtailed. Under the Administration's plan to cut Amtrak funding, the system's operations outside the nation's Northeast Corridor would have been jeopardized. 
   "Cutting funding for North Dakota would have been a terrible idea, especially as North Dakotans continue to increase their use of trains and planes to keep in contact with family and friends," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This would have been the wrong time to cut these valuable programs." 
   The bill includes $25.2 million for the Garrison Diversion Project, allowing the continued construction of the Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS) project and development of municipal, rural and industrial (MR&I) water systems in communities around the state, including on Indian Reservations. 
   In addition, the bill includes major funding for research, technology, economic development, cultural and educational projects across North Dakota. The bill goes next to the White House for the President's signature. 
   Among the many North Dakota projects funded by the bill are the following: 
   * Dorgan's proposal for a new center for hydrogen fuel cell research at the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota (UND). The bill provides more than $11 million for advanced research at EERC including $3 million to establish the hydrogen research center. 
   * $34 million for the Grand Forks Flood Control project, allowing that construction to continue on that crucial project. 
   * $6 million to improve airports in the state - $4.5 million for Jamestown Municipal Airport and $1.5 million for Fargo Hector International Airport. * $3.8 million for United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) in Bismarck (including $300,000 for dormitory construction), rejecting an Administration plan to cut that funding entirely. The bill also includes $53.9 million for the nation's 22 tribally controlled colleges, including four in North Dakota. 
   * $3 million for Statewide Transit Improvements. This funding will improve transit programs around the state, including the following programs:
   Grand Forks: To procure a senior ride dispatch system, allowing increased service levels.
   Bismarck: To complete the purchase of three fixed-route buses and upgrade the city's dispatch system.
   Fargo: To replace four transit vehicles and construct a joint maintenance and storage facility.
   Minot: To purchase a replacement bus coach and a wheelchair-accessible van.
   Other Rural Systems: To purchase replacement buses and vans and construct a rural transit bus garages.
   * $2 million for improvements along Interstate 29 between Fargo and Grand Forks. 
   * $1 million for the Methamphetamine Demonstration Project at Minot State University, to help continue operations of the Project including law enforcement training, education and research to fight the meth epidemic.
