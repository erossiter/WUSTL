   TEXT OF STATEMENT
   BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
   June 4, 2007
   "It has been 18 years since a peaceful pro-democracy protest in Tiananmen Square ended in a violent crackdown by the Chinese government. Today we join millions worldwide in remembering this day with sadness.
   "In the nearly two decades since this tragic incident, China has changed dramatically. Although we have seen some encouraging signs that the government is recognizing more legal rights for its citizens, the Chinese government still has much work to do to build a system based on the recognition of human rights and the rule of law.
   "Nearly two decades after being arrested in the brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square, some prisoners, such as factory workers Liu Jian and Liu Zhihua from Hunan, are reportedly still in prison. The central government in Beijing has continued to use censorship of the Internet and other Chinese media to try to cover up the truth of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
   "The disturbing trend continues today with the jailing and harassment of those who try to stand up against abuses of power and force the Chinese government to obey its own laws.
   "As we recall the somber events of June 4, 1989, we must continue urging the Chinese government to become a system that respects and protects the legal and democratic rights of all citizens."
