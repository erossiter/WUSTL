DORGAN APPLAUDS WORK OF NORTH DAKOTA DRUG COURTS AT 'BIRTHDAY' CELEBRATION
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) helped celebrate the seventh "birthday" of Bismarck's Drug Court Friday. He said the program has proven to be one of the justice system's most valuable tools in the effort to help individuals overcome drug addiction. 
   Dorgan was recognized at the event for his support of the Drug Court program and efforts to increase funding for it.
   "I appreciate the recognition, but the real credit should be given to the individuals who have made this program successful," Dorgan said. "Drug Courts are the most successful program we have found in the last 50 years to deal with the issue of drug addiction and crimes. The involvement of the judicial system, counselors and others has given new opportunity and second chances to a lot of people who have been addicted to dangerous drugs. The success of this program has been documented all across the country in a very significant way, and we need to continue to invest in it."
   Drug Courts use a successful model of bringing together judges, law enforcement, and counselors to examine each case and develop a strict and intensive sentence that encourages recovery and rehabilitation. Each sentence includes substance and mental health treatment, drug testing, probation supervision and regularly scheduled status hearings before a judge. A 2005 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that Drug Courts result in lower re-arrest and conviction rates and fewer recidivism events for participants. A study of a county in Oregon found that for every dollar spent, Drug Courts saved $10 in taxpayer money that would have been spent on legal proceedings, incarceration and other outcomes of repeat drug abuse.
