NORTH DAKOTA NATIVE HONORED FOR BRAVERY
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) applauded a Williston native for his work of heroism and skill as a member of the Coast Guard, to save the lives of foundering sailors during a tropical storm. 
   Lieutenant Junior Grade Aaron Nelson was awarded the Coast Guard Commendation Medal Wednesday for actions and aeronautical skills "essential in saving three lives" the Coast Guard said. Serving as the co-pilot on the MH-60 helicopter on May 7, 2007, Nelson and the rest of the crew are credited with scooping from the ocean three sailors who had to abandon their ship during sub-tropical storm Andrea. 
   Lieutenant Nelson grew up in Williston and graduated from Williston High School. 
   Based at Air Station Elizabeth City in Elizabeth, North Carolina, the crew rescued the sailors during seas that climbed to 50 feet and winds that reached 70 knots. Lieutenant Nelson maintained a steady hover 100ft over the ocean in the trying conditions while skillfully lowering the rescue swimmer into the water to recover the sailors. It was necessary for Lieutenant Nelson to repeat this feat twice more so the sailors could be saved and the rescue swimmer could be recovered safely. 
   The medal was presented by Rear Admiral Fred Rosa, Commander of the Coast Guard Fifth District today at the Coast Guard Air Station in Elizabeth City, NC.
   "Aaron Nelson is a true credit to North Dakota and the Coast Guard. His actions saved the lives of three people who are undoubtedly grateful, but so are the rest of us to know that we have such a dedicated person serving our nation," Dorgan said. "I'm so proud to say that Lieutenant Nelson has been recognized for his heroism. He makes North Dakota proud."
