SEN. DORGAN SAYS TREASURY RULING IS UNDERHANDED ATTEMPT TO BLOCK U.S. FOOD SALES TO CUBA
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Tuesday the Treasury Department appears to be "deliberately injuring farmers and ranchers" with a ruling he says is intended to block the sale of U.S. farm products to Cuba.  
   Currently, Cubans are required to pay cash before they take delivery of any U.S. farm commodities they sell. Today, the Treasury Department announced it is changing the rule to require Cubans to pay cash, in advance, before U.S. farm commodities can even leave the port of origin in the United States, long before they get delivery of the product. 
   "All this ruling is designed to do is shut down U.S. farm sales to Cuba," Dorgan said. "This is nothing more than an underhanded attempt to shut down the ability of U.S. farmers and ranchers to sell to Cuba." 
   "I wrote the law that they are now misinterpreting. It does not require the wrong-headed action they are taking today," Dorgan said. 
   Nationally, U.S. food sales to Cuba topped $392 million in 2004.
