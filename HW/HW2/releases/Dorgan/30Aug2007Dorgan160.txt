SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES KEYNOTE SPEAKERS FOR NINTH ANNUAL GREAT PLAINS TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) unveiled a list of prominent keynote speakers today that will headline the ninth annual Great Plains Technology Conference on October 8 and October 9 in Fargo, North Dakota. He was joined in the announcement by David Martin, President and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Fargo Moorhead. 
   Dorgan said the 2007 Technology Conference will focus on technological innovations that will have a significant effect on the way companies in the Upper Midwest do business. Those attending the conference will hear from a diverse and prominent group of keynote presentations, including:
   * Lou Dobbs, anchor and managing editor of "Lou Dobbs Tonight" on CNN.
   * Fred Smith, President and CEO, and Robert Carter, Executive Vice President of FedEx Corporation.
   * Kyle Warnick, Microsoft, will give a demonstration of Surface, the company's latest cutting-edge technology. More information is available at www.microsoft.com/surface
   * Jonathan S. Adelstein, member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
   * Tom Hunter, President and Laboratories Director at Sandia National Laboratory, one of the federal government's top research labs.
   "The lineup of speakers at this year's Technology Conference includes some exciting names that I think will add a lot to our conversation about technology and business in the Great Plains," Dorgan said. "To have some major figures from the business world, media and government come for a conference in the middle of a thriving Red River Valley Research Corridor says good things about the reputation of our state. Nearly everyone will be able to find something that interests them at this conference, and I look forward to kicking it off in October." 
   "We're delighted to co-sponsor the Technology Conference again this year," Martin said. "We believe we have a stellar lineup of keynote speakers, another good array of breakout sessions and trade show display opportunities, and a clear focus on the interests of the business community. The opportunity to do a Web stream to students makes it more broadly available to the technology users in our region. Senator Dorgan is a technology leader, not just in our region and our state but nationally."
