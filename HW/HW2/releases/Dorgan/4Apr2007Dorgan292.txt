SEN. DORGAN SAYS HE'LL WORK WITH CORPS, BUREAU TO ENSURE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS WATER EMERGENCY
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) commended Gov. Hoeven's drought emergency declaration Wednesday and said he will work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the federal Bureau of Reclamation to ensure funding is provided to preserve the supply of potable water during the extended Missouri River drought.  
   Dorgan - Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Corps and the Bureau of Reclamation - called a meeting earlier this year with stakeholders from across the Missouri River system to discuss the area's drought, which is currently in its eighth year and has dropped the river water level from its normal 55 million acre-feet to just 34 million acre-feet. 
   At the meeting, Corps and Bureau of Reclamation officials said they would require a drought emergency declaration from state and tribal officials to trigger emergency assistance to preserve potable water supplies. Dorgan announced at the meeting that he would request the state and tribal officials adopt the necessary emergency assistance declarations that would allow the Corps and Bureau of Reclamation to be more flexible in providing assistance. 
   "This is an important step that will allow the Corps and the Bureau of Reclamation to step in and help our communities along the Missouri River," Dorgan said. "I'm going to keep working with these agencies and state and tribal officials to make sure they are communicating and prepared. We've seen in Fort Yates what happens when a town loses its water supply, and we need to do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen again."
