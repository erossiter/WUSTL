SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO USDA DECISION TO REVERSE MASSIVE CLOSURE OF LOCAL FARM SERVICE AGENCY OFFICES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), said Tuesday the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) decision to abandon plans to close more than 700 local offices of the Farm Service Agency "is the right decision."  
   Six of the 713 FSA offices that were slated for closure are located in North Dakota. On October 7, Dorgan, along with Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-ND), sent a letter to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns expressing concern about how the office closures would impact North Dakota's producers. The delegation said closing offices would force farmers to travel longer distances to access the farm programs they depend on and would have a serious impact on local communities. 
   USDA said the office closures were necessary to save money that could be used to update FSA's computer system, but the delegation questioned that reasoning in their letter. "In many parts of North Dakota, Internet availability is limited and costly. Web-based assistance is a poor substitute for the kind of face-to-face assistance our farmers and ranchers depend on." 
   "If USDA wants to improve its computer systems, I'm all for it," Dorgan said. "But they shouldn't try to pay for those upgrades by closing the FSA offices our farmers depend on. It never made sense to me that the way to save money was to force farmers and ranchers to drive farther or go online to get their questions answered. I had serious reservations about this plan, as did many Members of Congress. I'm glad USDA listened to those concerns and has decided to scrap this plan."
