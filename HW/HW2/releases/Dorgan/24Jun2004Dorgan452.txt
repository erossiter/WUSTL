   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN
  June 24, 2004
   The Third Circuit Court of Appeals' decision today on the FCC's media ownership rules is excellent news. It is a victory for localism and ownership diversity. The FCC's action on June 2nd of last year to relax existing media concentration rules totally sacrificed the public interest in favor of media consolidation. The Court, which stayed those rules in September of last year while it considered the case, has now sent the rules back to the FCC, for the FCC to reevaluate the rules and the methodologies by which they were developed.
   I support the decision of the Court, which found that the majority of the FCC acted unreasonably in relaxing media ownership limits, and extended the stay of the rules while the FCC acts on the Court's decision. This decision ensures that we preserve a diverse media that will serve the public interest, and that the FCC's decision-making is more open and inclusive to the public as it moves forward on this issue.
   I will continue to work in Congress to ensure that the FCC gets it right this time, so that we do not sacrifice localism and diversity for consolidation and media monopolies.
