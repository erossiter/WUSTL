SEN. DORGAN SAYS BILL WILL BRING WAGE HIKE TO U.S. SERVICEMEMBERS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday a bill that cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee will bring a well-deserved raise to personnel at Grand Forks Air Force Base and Minot Air Force Base and other North Dakotans serving in the U.S. military. Dorgan also worked to include funding to make sure North Dakota's military bases and National Guard units have the equipment they need to carry out their missions. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Committee, helped draft the bill. It will provide a 3.5 percent raise to military personnel - a larger raise than recommended in the President's budget. He said the wage hike, which was included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations bill, is much-needed at a time when the country is asking much of its servicemembers.
   "The men and women who serve in our military have some of the most difficult jobs in the world," Dorgan said. "They have volunteered to serve their country, and go often into situations that are dangerous in order to serve our country. One need look no further than the Grand Forks Air Force Base, the Minot Air Force Base, and our other military personnel in North Dakota to see the dedication with which U.S. military service members serve our country. They deserve a raise, and I'm proud to support it."
   The bill also includes:
   * $914 million for the Air Force to purchase 5 Global Hawk, 24 Predator, and 5 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This funding should keep plans to base UAVs at Grand Forks Air Force Base on track. 
   * $314 million to keep the Air Force's program to build a new air refueling tanker on schedule. Grand Forks is a leading candidate for the home of the next generation of tankers.
   * $1 billion to help alleviate substantial shortfalls in National Guard equipment stocks, including in North Dakota.
   * $519 million to upgrade Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and security.
   The bill also includes more than $50 million secured by Dorgan for high-tech research and training projects in the Red River Valley Research Corridor. Dorgan said those projects, which he announced after the bill was written yesterday, will help strengthen the U.S. military and boost the growing high-tech industry in North Dakota.
   The bill goes next to the full Senate for consideration.
