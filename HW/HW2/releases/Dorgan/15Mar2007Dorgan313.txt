SEN. DORGAN PLEDGES TO PUSH FOR FAIR RAIL RATES, PROTECT SHIPPERS FROM EXORBITANT RATES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday that he will introduce legislation along with a bipartisan group of senators later this month to help increase rail freight competition and prevent railroad customers from being charged exorbitant rates where there is little or no competition. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Dorgan said he is also looking to increase accountability from the Surface Transportation Board, which is supposed to ensure fair rates and reliable schedules for rail shipment arrivals.  
   Dorgan joined a bipartisan group of members of Congress and shippers from North Dakota and across the country at a press conference and breakfast rally on Capitol Hill to call for reform. 
   "Our rail system is dominated by unregulated monopolies that are able to demand unfair prices from shippers in North Dakota and across the country," said Dorgan. "This is especially the case in rural areas, where shippers are often getting poor service and paying high prices for rail service." 
   Dorgan introduced a bipartisan bill, the Railroad Competition Act of 2005, in the last session of Congress to combat monopolistic practices facing agriculture producers and manufacturers that ship their products by rail service.
