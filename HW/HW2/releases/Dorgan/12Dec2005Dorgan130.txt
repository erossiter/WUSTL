SEN. DORGAN SAYS PRESSURE ON JAPAN TO RESUME U.S. BEEF IMPORTS HAVE PAID OFF
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Monday that Japan's long-awaited decision to end its scientifically unjustified ban on U.S. beef will be a relief to American ranchers, who will regain an export market worth $100 million per month.  
 The country's decision to reopen its borders to U.S. beef means ranchers in North Dakota and other states will again have access to the important Japanese market, following a two-year ban the country imposed on their products, he said. 
   Dorgan said the move will provide much-needed relief to American ranchers, who were shut out of Japan in December 2003 after a Canadian cow with BSE was found in Washington State. Dorgan, along with Senators Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Pat Roberts (R-KS), introduced a bill in October that would have imposed $3.1 billion in tariffs on Japanese goods if beef exports did not resume by the end of the year. 
   "This is a positive, but long overdue, step by the Japanese government," Dorgan said. "Obviously, they were feeling some heat for their baseless decision to ban American beef, which has been proven to be completely safe. Our ranchers produce the best beef in the world, and the removal of this barrier will be good for Japanese consumers and good for our ranchers."
