SEN. DORGAN SAYS USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN CLASSROOM WILL GIVE STUDENTS AN EDGE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) visited students Tuesday at Northern Cass High School to discuss the growing use of technology in the Red River Valley Research Corridor. Dorgan met with juniors and seniors who are using laptop computers in their classrooms.  
   "By providing students with laptop computers, Northern Cass High School is becoming a leading school in providing students access to technology and giving them a competitive advantage," said Dorgan. "I am especially interested in how the students are using cutting-edge technology in the classroom. The development of technology has been an essential part of the Red River Valley Research Corridor that is growing our area into a center of high-tech research." 
   In December 2006, North Dakota State University researcher Dr. Larry Leistritz released an economic study that showed that the Red River Valley Research Corridor initiative, a concept created by Senator Dorgan in 2002, has generated $759 million in positive economic impact and added thousands of jobs to the regional economy.
