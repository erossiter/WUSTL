SEN. DORGAN PUSHES AGRICULTURE DISASTER PACKAGE TO HELP WITH FARM ENERGY COSTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) pushed again Wednesday for an agriculture disaster package he included in the Supplemental Appropriations bill, a bill President Bush says he'll veto if help for farmers is included. 
   Speaking at a press conference outside a Washington, D.C. farmers' market, Dorgan said farmers need help in order to survive a wide range of weather disasters last year and rapidly escalating energy costs, which decreased the average North Dakota farmer's income by $18,000 in 2005 from 2004 to 2005.
   Noting that family farming is a very "energy intensive" operation, Dorgan pointed out that unlike other businesses "family farmers have no way to pass on rapidly increasing energy costs. They bear that load alone. It is crushing many in farm country and family farmers need some emergency help if they are to survive."
   "Today's fuel and fertilizer prices are more than just painful for many family farmers. They are devastating," Dorgan added. "I just don't understand how the President could threaten to veto the Supplemental Appropriations bill if it includes disaster aid for family farmers."
   Dorgan said Bush's veto threat is "not good policy" and urged him to drop it, and take some positive action with regard to energy prices.
   "We have a do-nothing Congress and a do-nothing President when it comes to energy prices," Dorgan said. "Consumers have all the pain and the big oil companies have all the gain."
   Dorgan is also pushing a windfall profits rebate proposal which would rebate some of the big oil companies' windfall profits to consumers if the major oil companies do not re-invest those funds in ways to increase domestic energy supplies and help tamp down energy prices.
