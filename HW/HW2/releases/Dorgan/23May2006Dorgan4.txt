SEN. DORGAN PRESSES FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIR ON FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATE GASOLINE PRICE GOUGING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) pressed the chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Tuesday on the agency's failure to conduct a complete investigation into the possibility of gasoline price gouging. 
   Dorgan, at a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, quizzed FTC Chair Deborah Platt Majoras on why the report released this week by her agency ignores the activities of much of the oil industry. The FTC investigation looked only at refining and never "upstream" at possible price gouging in the price of oil, even though the price of oil is the largest component in the cost of gasoline, Dorgan said.
   "I'm disappointed that this investigation covered only refining and never looked at the price of oil and the speculators and OPEC ministers that control it," Dorgan said. "The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to be a regulatory agency that sinks its teeth into these issues on behalf of American consumers, but I think what we have here is a failure to investigate."
   Dorgan and Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) offered the amendment that required the FTC to investigate gasoline prices during consideration of the 2005 Energy Bill. It directed the FTC investigation because of rapid and steep price hikes taking place at the pump, as big oil company profits soared to record levels. Many observers said such rapid and large increases could not possibly be explained as the simple result of the market.
