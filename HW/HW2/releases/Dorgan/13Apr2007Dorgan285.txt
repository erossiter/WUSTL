SEN. DORGAN SAYS DECLINE IN TRADE DEFICIT IS GOOD NEWS, BUT HARDLY GROUNDS FOR CELEBRATION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) released the following statement Friday, reacting to the announcement by the Commerce Department that the nation's trade deficit for February was $58.4 billion, compared to $58.9 billion in January: 
   "It's good news that the trade deficit went down slightly in February, but the deficit is still huge and represents a growing debt to foreign countries that will have to be repaid. Our country just took on $58.4 in foreign debt in just one month, after taking on $58.9 billion in foreign debt the previous month. That's hardly grounds for celebration," Dorgan said.
