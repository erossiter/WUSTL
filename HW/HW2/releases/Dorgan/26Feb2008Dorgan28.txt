SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN BILL AIMED AT IMPROVING HEALTH CARE IN AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES
  The U.S. Senate approved legislation Tuesday authored by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that will improve and expand health programs in American Indian communities in North Dakota and across the nation. It was the first improvement in Indian health care passed in 16 years by the Congress. 
   "This is a big step forward for Indian health care, and the Senate can be proud of its action today," said Senator Dorgan, Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "I have traveled around our country and seen the appalling conditions in many Indian health care facilities - even in North Dakota. People are literally dying because we have not acted. This bill is a first step that will help put an end to health care rationing and move the health care system in Indian Country in the right direction."
   The bill takes a comprehensive approach to help bring more health care professionals to reservation communities, improve infrastructure, and expand and improve the services provided to American Indians. Among the key provisions in the bill are those that will:
   * Authorize additional tools for tribal communities to address suicide among Indian youth;
   * Allow members of tribes to access health benefits in both states if their reservation straddles a state line. This will be helpful to members of the Standing Rock and Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribes, whose reservations include land in both North Dakota and South Dakota;
   * Seek to address the lack of access to health care services, due to limited hours of operation of existing facilities and other factors, by establishing grants for demonstration projects that include a convenient care services program as an alternative means of health care delivery;
   * Address the $1 billion backlog in needed health care facilities, such as alcohol and substance abuse treatment centers, and $1 billion in unmet need for sanitation facilities in tribal communities;
   * Make permanent a number of successful federal programs providing services to Native Americans in long-term health care, diabetes prevention, and other key areas;
   * Expand scholarship and loan programs that encourage more American Indian people to enter health care professions.
