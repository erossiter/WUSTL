SEN. DORGAN OFFERS BILL IN SENATE TO OUTLAW CHINA'S PLAN TO BUY UNOCAL
  The proposed acquisition of a major U.S. oil company, Unocal, by the Chinese Oil Company (CNOOC) would be prohibited by law under a bill[1] introduced in the U.S. Senate Friday by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND).  
   Petroleum and natural gas resources are a strategic asset, Dorgan said, and should not be owned by a foreign government. The People's Republic of China own 70 percent of CNOOC. 
   "This really isn't very complicated," Dorgan said. "Unocal is located in the United States and has approximately 1.75 billion barrels of oil. It would be foolish, to say the least, to allow a foreign government, particularly one that remains committed to national one-party rule by the Communist Party, to own that much of such a strategic resource so vital to the U.S. economy and the national defense." 
   He noted no U.S. corporation or the U.S. government would be allowed to make a similar purchase in China. The Chinese government retains majority ownership in all four of the Chinese oil companies that dominate oil production in that country. "It would be impossible for a foreign company to purchase a controlling share of a Chinese energy company," Dorgan said. 
   "Would the Chinese government allow an American company to purchase a controlling interest in a company in their energy sector? The answer is no. There is no disagreement on this. Given this unlevel playing field," Dorgan said, "China should be barred from owning a U.S oil company, at least until it allows American companies to purchase controlling interests in Chinese energy companies." 
   "What's good for the goose is good for the gander. When the Chinese let us acquire controlling interests in their energy companies fairly, then so shall we. But let's hold their feet to the fire until then," Dorgan said.
