SEN. DORGAN STATEMENT ON SOUTH KOREA'S RESUMPTION OF AMERICAN BEEF IMPORTS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Friday he is pleased about reports that South Korea has finally cleared a shipment of U.S. beef after an unjustified three-year ban on the imports. 
   Dorgan, chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce, Trade and Tourism, said he will continue to monitor the situation and will make good on his pledge last December to hold hearings and pursue tariffs against South Korea if the country takes a step backward and decides to once again use baseless excuses to block U.S. imports.
   Before South Korea implemented its ban on American beef, it was the United States' third-largest export market, accounting for more than $800 million in annual exports.
   "I don't think any American rancher would be surprised to hear that inspections found U.S. beef to be safe and healthy, but it's good for our beef industry to hear South Korea finally acknowledge that fact," Dorgan said. "Our ranchers have been penalized unfairly for far too long, and I'm going to keep monitoring this situation to make sure they are treated fairly."
