SEN. DORGAN URGES BUS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PICK UP SERVICE IN NORTH DAKOTA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday he has talked to leaders of regional bus companies about picking up the service that Greyhound has announced it will discontinue from Fargo through North Dakota to Billings, MT, effective August 18.  
 The Senator said he was encouraged by his conversations with the three leaders. He indicated that those companies, along with several others, met Wednesday afternoon in Minneapolis, MN, to discuss the opportunity for a company to fill the gap in service. 
   Dorgan said he would follow up with these companies after Wednesday's meeting, and he remains hopeful that someone will find a way to provide service without disruption after August 18. "Bus service remains a very important part of our transportation system in North Dakota for people who have relied on it for many, many years," Dorgan said. "Greyhound served for 70 years in our state. Their CEO has told me that they are pulling out their service and don't intend to revisit the issue, but he also indicated that Greyhound wanted to be helpful to another company that might want to pick up that service." "There are no guarantees, but I'm encouraged by the contacts I've had with regional bus companies who are taking a look at this in recent days," he said.
