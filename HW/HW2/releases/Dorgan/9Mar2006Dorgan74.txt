SEN. DORGAN PRESSES SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE JOHANNS ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR NORTH DAKOTA PRODUCERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) questioned U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns Thursday on the Administration's refusal to support emergency assistance for farmers and ranchers in North Dakota and across America who have struggled in the last year with the effects of weather-related disasters. 
   Dorgan, at a Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, said that while he supports emergency assistance for farmers in Gulf Coast states who were affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and other weather problems, farmers across America have also struggled with destructive weather that threatens their livelihoods, as well as record-high energy costs and low commodity prices.
   "I fully support providing emergency assistance to family farmers in Gulf Coast states, but if we are going to help some farmers who lost their crops to a weather-related disaster, then I believe we should help all farmers who have lost their crops to a weather-related disaster," Dorgan said. "I hope the Administration will realize that this is the fair approach and support emergency assistance for family farmers in North Dakota and across America."
   Dorgan said he will work with a bipartisan group of farm state Senators to include an agricultural disaster package in any Hurricane Katrina funding legislation that moves through the Senate. Dorgan said such an effort may come in the next few weeks.
   Dorgan also pressed Johanns on the Administration's failure to provide sufficient funding for employees at county offices of the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Dorgan said that staffing shortages at county FSA offices have led to needless delays for producers who depend on timely service from the FSA when signing up for farm programs.
