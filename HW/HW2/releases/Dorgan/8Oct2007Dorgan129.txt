SEN. DORGAN KICKS OFF NINTH ANNUAL GREAT PLAINS TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan kicked off the ninth annual Great Plains Technology Conference at the Fargodome Monday, saying the event offers the opportunity to showcase the growth of the Red River Valley Research Corridor as high-tech hotspot and discuss ways businesses in the region can use technology to expand their reach.  
   Dorgan is co-hosting the event with the Chamber of Commerce of Fargo-Moorhead, Spider and Company and the Information Technology Council of North Dakota. The conference's opening day featured a diverse menu of workshops on technology for businesses, a 121-booth trade show showcasing the work of area companies, and a keynote address from Dr. Anthony Tether, who directs the federal research laboratory that includes the invention of the Internet among its claims to fame. 
   "I'm proud of the lineup we've put together for the ninth annual Technology Conference," Dorgan said. " Fargo's reputation is growing fast, not just in the Research Corridor, but nationwide as a hub of innovation and high-tech research. This event fits right in with that theme, and I think everyone who attends - whether they're looking for ways to improve their business or are just interested in seeing some of the latest technologies to come on the market - will find something here." 
   The Technology Conference will continue Tuesday. Attendees will have the opportunity to see a demonstration of Microsoft's ground-breaking Surface technology, as well as keynote addresses from technology and business experts such as Dr. Thomas Hunter, Director of Sandia National Laboratory, Jonathan Adelstein, member of the Federal Communications Commission, and Frederick Smith, founder and CEO of the FedEx Corporation.
