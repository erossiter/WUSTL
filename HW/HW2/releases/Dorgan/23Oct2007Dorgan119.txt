SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN'S AMENDMENT TO HELP RESTORE HEART AND STROKE PROGRAM IN NORTH DAKOTA
  The U.S. Senate late Monday approved an amendment offered by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that would help restore funding for a program aimed at reducing heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in North Dakota. 
   Dorgan offered the amendment on the Senate floor to add $3 million to the State Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program. North Dakota has in the past used the program in successful efforts to reduce cardiovascular disease, but funding cuts terminated the program last year.
   "Cardiovascular disease affects more than 80 million people in this country, but there are things we can do to help reduce its impact," said Senator Dorgan, co-chair of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition. "The Heart and Stroke Prevention Program has proven itself to be a useful way to help reduce the risk of a heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular problems. This is an important investment in public health in America, and I'm proud the Senate has supported it."
   Although cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in every state, the CDC currently has resources to provide funding to only 33 states. This amendment will ensure that more states, including North Dakota, are covered and receive funding to develop plans to reduce the burden of heart disease and stroke.
   The amendment was co-sponsored by Senators Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The funding was added to the bill that will fund the Department of Health and Human Services for Fiscal Year 2008.
