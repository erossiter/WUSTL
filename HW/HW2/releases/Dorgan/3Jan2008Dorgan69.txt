SEN. DORGAN PLEDGES TO KEEP PUSHING TO IMPROVE INDIAN HEALTH CARE
  U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Byron Dorgan (D-ND) held a public meeting here with members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to discuss health care issues on the reservation. He pledged to renew his fight when Congress reconvenes later this month to combat the chronic shortage of health care resources in American Indian communities. 
   Dorgan has authored bipartisan legislation to address the "bona fide crisis" in health care in tribal communities. He secured a commitment from Majority Leader Harry Reid to bring up the legislation on the Senate's first legislative day of 2008, which is currently scheduled for January 22.
   "I have worked on the issue of Indian health care for a long time, and I have heard some heartbreaking stories of pain that has been caused by the federal government's lack of attention to our trust responsibilities," Dorgan said. "Now I have the commitment of the Majority Leader to bring my legislation to a vote. This bill has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of a lot of people, and I'm not going to stop pushing until we get this done."
   Dorgan's legislation, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, takes a comprehensive approach to improving Indian health care. Among the key provisions:
   * Authorizing additional tools for tribal communities to address suicide among Indian youth;
   * Addressing the lack of access to health care services by allowing grants for demonstration projects that include a convenient care services program as an alternative means of health care delivery;
   * Addressing the $1 billion backlog in needed health care facilities, such as alcohol and substance abuse treatment centers, and $1 billion in unmet need for sanitation facilities in tribal communities;
   * Making permanent a number of successful federal programs providing services to Native Americans in long-term health care, diabetes prevention and other key areas;
   * Expanding scholarship and loan programs that encourage more American Indian people to enter health care professions;
   * Placing a higher emphasis on Indian health care by elevating the Director of the Indian Health Service to the Assistant Secretary for Indian Health in the Department of Health and Human Services.
