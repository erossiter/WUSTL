CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION ENCOURAGES NORTH DAKOTA YOUTH TO APPLY FOR MILITARY ACADEMY POSITIONS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep. Earl Pomeroy are accepting applications from college-age North Dakotans interested in attending one of the nation's military service academies for a four-year college education.  
   All three offices will accept applications for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the Air Force Academy, the Naval Academy in Annapolis, and the Merchant Marine Academy. 
   The deadline for submitting an application is November 1, 2004. Interviews with applicants are scheduled to be held November 18 in Bismarck and November 19 in Fargo. The delegation will make its nominations to the military academies in December. 
   North Dakotans who are high school graduates and between 17 and 23 years old by July 1, 2004 are encouraged to apply. Applicants must be U.S. citizens, unmarried and have no dependents. Those who attend military academies, which are among the world=s finest institutions of higher learning, are committed for a time to serving their country in the military. 
   AEvery year, we get North Dakota's best and brightest seeking admission to the country's military academies. It is a great way to get a free college education at a top-notch school, but more than that, it is an opportunity for young people to serve our country," the delegation said in a joint statement. 
   Students should have demonstrated excellence in academics, athletics and personal character. Applicants should also possess strong leadership qualities.
