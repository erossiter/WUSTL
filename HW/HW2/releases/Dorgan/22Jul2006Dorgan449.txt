SEN. DORGAN CITES HYDROGEN SHOWCASE AS PROOF THAT NORTH DAKOTA IS LEADING WAY TO HYDROGEN ECONOMY
  Flanked by examples of hydrogen technology harnessed to power cars, forklifts and other equipment, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Saturday North Dakota is positioned to play a leading role in the creation of a hydrogen-based economy that will change the way Americans power their homes and vehicles. 
   Dorgan, Congress' leading advocate of a hydrogen economy, was joined by Ron Harper, CEO of Basin Electric Power Cooperative; Gerald Groenewold, Director of the Energy and Environmental Research Center; and Bruce Carlson, General Manager of Verendrye Electric Cooperative at the event at the North Dakota State Fair to showcase the cutting-edge research and development in hydrogen technology going on across North Dakota.
   Dorgan, a long-time advocate of hydrogen technology, has helped Basin Electric, Verendrye, EERC and other partners secure federal grants to support a project that will use wind energy to create hydrogen, which will in turn power vehicles. A member of the Senate Appropriations and Energy committees, Dorgan also designated EERC as a National Center for Hydrogen Technology and helped direct funding to research into hydrogen at the facility.
   "Hydrogen is one of the most exciting energy technologies that we see on the horizon. North Dakota is leading the country into a new economy where we fill our cars with hydrogen fuel, get twice the power to the wheel, and emit nothing but water vapor from our tail pipes," Dorgan said.
