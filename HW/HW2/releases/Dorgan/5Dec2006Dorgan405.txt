SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES AMTRAK TO CONTINUE OFFERING CHICAGO-TO-DEVILS LAKE FISHING PROMOTION
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Tuesday Amtrak has agreed to continue offering its "Perch Express" service, which offers a discount fare to bring Chicago-area residents to Devils Lake for guided tours of the area's top-notch fishing holes.  
   After Amtrak decided to end the Perch Express, Dorgan contacted the rail service and urged them to continue the promotion. The company agreed to negotiate a new contract with the city of Devils Lake to maintain the Perch Express - which brings customers from Chicago to Devils Lake, where they are picked up by a local volunteer who takes them fishing. 
   "This new agreement to extend the Perch Express service from Chicago to Devils Lake is good news for the city and our tourism industry," Dorgan said. "Devils Lake is home to some of the best fishing in the nation, and Amtrak's increasing ridership clearly indicates that people think its long-distance trains are a great way to travel. This partnership is a natural fit and I'm glad to see the Perch Express will keep running." 
   "We're appreciative of Senator Dorgan's office, the Chamber of Commerce, and all the people who helped convince Amtrak of the value of the Perch Express program, not only to Amtrak but also to the state of North Dakota and the Lake Region area," said Richard Brueckner, territory director for AAA of North Dakota. 
   Last year, the Perch Express brought between 250 and 300 Chicagoans to North Dakota to take advantage of Devils Lake's world-class fishing, Brueckner said.
