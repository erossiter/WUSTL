SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES DAVID GIPP, UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE PRESIDENT, TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Wednesday that David Gipp, president of United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck (UTTC), will testify before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee this week at a hearing on the challenges facing Indian higher education. 
   Dorgan, Vice Chairman of the Committee, invited Dr. Gipp to testify on the needs of American Indian higher education and the opportunities presented by tribal colleges and universities. Dr. Gipp has a reputation as a national leader in higher education for American Indians and will bring a unique and valuable perspective to the committee hearings, Dorgan said.
   "Schools on our reservations are facing a number of challenges as enrollment rises and resources remain scarce, and I'm proud that North Dakota has such a well-known expert in this important field as Dr. Gipp," Dorgan said. "We need to devote more resources to education, as well as to health care, housing and other infrastructure, to make sure the growing number of students on the reservation get an equal opportunity to succeed in life."
   "It's vitally necessary to describe how American Indian people are better off because they've had access to higher education?especially to members of Congress, who have the ability to provide necessary funding, and to people in the executive branch and aides to the President," Dr. Gipp said.
   Dorgan is a long-time supporter of Indian education. A member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan has fought to reverse the elimination of Bureau of Indian Affairs funding for UTTC that the President has called for in five consecutive budget proposals.
