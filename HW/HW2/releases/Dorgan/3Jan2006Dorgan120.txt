   TEXT OF STATEMENT 
   "Senator John McCain and I have worked for more than a year to expose the corruption of Jack Abramoff. Today's announcement by the Justice Department that it has secured a guilty plea from Jack Abramoff confirms much of the work that we have done and much of what we have found. 
   I welcome today's development because it provides some justice to the Indian tribes that Jack Abramoff defrauded of tens of millions of dollars."
