AIR FORCE PUTS ACQUISITION OF NEW UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES ON TOP OF PRIORITY LIST, SEN. DORGAN SAYS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said the Air Force notified him on Monday that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are now its No. 1 priority for emergency funding in the worldwide war against terrorism. Sen.  
 Dorgan, a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said this is a change from the funding priorities they had requested earlier this year. This bodes well for the Grand Forks Air Force Base, which is slated to become the third major UAV base in United States, Dorgan said. The news comes one day before the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission is scheduled to vote on adding bases to its list of military installations recommended for closure. 
   At a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission hearing today, General T. Michael Moseley said the Air Force is responding to the rapidly escalating requests from combatant commanders around the world for UAVs, which have proven valuable in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   "This is good news for the Grand Forks Air Force Base because it shows once again that UAVs are the future of the nation's defense strategy," Dorgan said. "While we have to remain cautious, we can't help but be optimistic at this point. We are well-placed to not only stay open, but to gain a new, emerging UAV mission in the near future. I have confidence the BRAC Commission will see that as well."
