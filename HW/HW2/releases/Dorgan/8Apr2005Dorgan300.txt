SEN. DORGAN ORGANIZING EFFORT TO DEFEAT CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is leading an effort, which includes a wide group of organizations, to defeat the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) when it comes to the Senate for ratification.  
   Dorgan hosted the first meeting of the groups late Thursday afternoon to begin developing strategy. Among those participating in the meeting were representatives of Public Citizen, National Farmers Union, AFL-CIO, Americans for Fair Trade, and the American Sugar Alliance, among others. 
   "Free trade must first be fair trade, and that is not the case with CAFTA," Dorgan said. "It is just one more in a series of trade agreements that give away the interest of American producers for very little in return. NAFTA, for example, has cost nearly 900,000 American jobs. Our trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, since NAFTA, has increased twelve fold to $110.8 billion last year. Our agriculture trade surplus has all but vanished." 
   "Recent trade agreements have resulted in the largest trade deficits in history. We ought to fix previous agreements before pushing new ones," Dorgan said. 
   "As written, CAFTA makes many of the same mistakes. It opens the door for intrusion into the American market by countries which pay very low wages, provide few worker protections, and have environmental standards that are well below ours." 
   "CAFTA will result in even more U.S. jobs being shipped overseas," Dorgan added. "With the combined wealth of CAFTA nations only slightly larger than that of New Haven, Connecticut, and 40 percent of their workers earning less than $2 a day, we have very little to gain and a great deal to lose by granting CAFTA countries unfettered access to the $11 trillion American market."
