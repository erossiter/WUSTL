SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD CALL ON ADMINISTRATION TO EXTEND TAX RELIEF TO HELP DROUGHT-STRICKEN RANCHERS
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) Thursday called on the Bush Administration to extend a tax break that would help ranchers who have been forced to sell their herds because of drought. 
   Dorgan and Conrad joined Senator Ben Nelson (D-NE) and a bipartisan group of farm-state lawmakers in calling on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to extend a tax deferment period for weather-related sales of livestock.
   The extension would help ranchers who have been forced to sell portions of their herds since 2002 because of drought conditions, Dorgan and Conrad said. Because drought conditions have persisted, ranchers have not been able to replenish their herds. Unless the deferment is extended, these ranchers will be forced to pay a capital gains tax on the sale of their cattle at a time when they are struggling to recover from severe drought, Dorgan and Conrad said.
   "Many ranchers in North Dakota and across the country are going to be struggling to rebuild their herds after a period of severe drought. It would make no sense to penalize them while they are trying to recover," Dorgan said. "This drought that has hit much of the country shows no sign of letting up, and we need to do what we can to help the ranchers who are wondering how they are going to stay in business."
   "Our ranchers are facing a serious disaster. They need our assistance and they need it now," Conrad said. "Excessive days of triple digit temperatures have destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of grasslands forcing many ranchers to sell off their entire herds. This tax break may help some of those ranchers make it through this difficult drought."
