SEN. DORGAN ASKS DOD INSPECTOR TO DETERMINE HOW MANY IRAQI SECURITY FORCES SHOW UP
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) is asking the Department of Defense's Inspector General to determine how many U.S. trained Iraqi Security Forces are actually available for duty.  
   In a letter to Inspector General Stuart W. Bowen, Jr., Dorgan wrote that "no one in any official capacity seems to know the answer to this critical question." 
   The question is an important one, Dorgan said, because the Administration's October 17 Weekly Status Report says the U.S. and its Coalition partners have trained 359,700 Iraqi Security Forces. Yet, the Pentagon's own September 2007 Report to Congress acknowledges that only 40% to 70% of the Iraqi police we have trained are still on the force. 
   "How meaningful is the 2007 year-end objective of training 389,400 Iraqi Security Forces personnel if we cannot certify how many of them remain in the force after they are trained and equipped?" Dorgan asked. 
   "Taken in combination with the fact that we don't know the status of almost 200,000 of the weapons we've provided, I think that this is something that you should investigate," Dorgan wrote. 
   Specifically, Dorgan asked the Inspector General to determine how many U.S. trained and equipped Iraqi Security Forces remain in the force and are available for duty. He also asked the IG to determine what procedures are in place to track the status of Iraqi troops trained and equipped by the U.S. and its coalition partners.
