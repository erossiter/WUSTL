SEN. DORGAN BRINGS CORPS OFFICIALS TO WAHPETON TO DISCUSS PROGRESS OF FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) brought officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to Wahpeton Saturday to meet with city officials and discuss progress on a flood control system aimed at protecting the community from floods. Dorgan - Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Corps - said he convened the meeting to bring federal and city officials together to discuss the city's response to flooding earlier this month and what additional resources it needs to ensure the city stays dry.  
   As a member of the Subcommittee, Dorgan has secured federal funding for a flood control project in Wahpeton and its sister city of Breckenridge, Minnesota. 
   "This spring's flooding was a test of the flood control system in Wahpeton and Breckenridge, and this meeting will give us a chance to discuss how it worked and what improvements we need to make in the future," Dorgan said.
