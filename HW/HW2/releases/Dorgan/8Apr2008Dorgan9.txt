SENATORS CALL ON IRS COMMISSIONER TO 'RECONSIDER MISGUIDED IRS POLICY OF USING PRIVATE DEBT COLLECTORS'
  U.S. Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Patty Murray (D-WA) are calling for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Douglas Shulman to conduct a prompt review of the failing private tax collection program.  
   In a letter sent Monday, the Senators wrote "there is compelling evidence that the ...private tax collector initiative is a dismal failure." They went on to say, "we feel confidant that once you take a close look at the program, you will determine it is a waste of taxpayer dollars and use your authority to terminate it."
   The program to outsource federal tax debt collection to private firms lost $50 million in its first year and is expected to lose more in the future. The private debt collection workers have also violated federal debt collection laws and disclosed confidential taxpayer information. 
   "IRS officials have acknowledged all along that professional IRS workers can do a far better job collecting tax debts than private collection firms," the Senators continued. "Since the initial rationale for using private tax collectors was to raise revenues, there is no justifiable reason to continue this wasteful government program when the IRS can bring in far greater amounts at a far lower cost."
   "We urge you to focus the resources of the IRS where they can bring in a substantially greater return on investment and properly safeguard taxpayer rights and privacy in the process," the Senators concluded.
