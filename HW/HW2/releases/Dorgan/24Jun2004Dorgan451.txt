SEN. DORGAN COSPONSORS FEDERAL DISASTER AID BILL TO HELP FARMERS, RANCHERS RECOVER LOSSES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) cosponsored a bill he and Sen.  
 Kent Conrad introduced in the U.S. Senate Thursday that is aimed to provide financial assistance to farmers and ranchers who have suffered crop losses from this year's severe weather conditions.
   The bill is designed to help both livestock producers and crop farmers. It would make farmers who experienced crop losses over 35% eligible for disaster payments. Ranchers who suffered grazing losses over 40% for three consecutive months would be eligible for payments to reimburse feed costs.
   "Farmers and ranchers in the state are facing drought in some areas and too much rain in others, with early estimates of crops unable to be planted or destroyed after planting as high as 2 million acres," Dorgan said. "This bill aims to offer help in recovering from these losses because family farmers ought not have to bear this burden alone."
   Senator Dorgan will be touring a large portion of the damaged region Friday, making his way through Minot, Mohall, Bottineau and Langdon. At Dorgan's request, he will be accompanied by Byron Anderson, Associate Administrator for the federal Risk Management Agency - a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
