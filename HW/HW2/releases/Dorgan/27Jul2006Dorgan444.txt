SEN. DORGAN: CONSUMERS DESERVE REBATE AS WINDFALL PROFITS FOR OIL COMPANIES CLIMB
  Sen. Byron Dorgan said Thursday the $10 billion second quarter profit report from Exxon-Mobil represents "billions in windfall profits" and that consumers "need and deserve some relief." 
   Unless a substantial portion of those windfall profits are invested in expanding America's domestic energy production, the windfall profits should be rebated to consumers through a windfall profits tax which would return 100% of the funds collected to consumers, Dorgan said.
   The major oil companies often claim they are doing that, but Dorgan noted the major integrated oil companies are hoarding cash and buying back their own stock with much of the windfall profits.
   "Exxon is not alone," Dorgan said. "All the major integrated oil companies are reaping huge multi-billion dollar record windfalls. To put this into perspective, major oil company profits have increased more than 100 percent since 2004, through little or no additional effort or expense to the oil companies. These profits come at the expense of American families, farmers, and motorists, all of whom are struggling painfully to pay their fuel bills. They need and deserve some relief," Dorgan said.
