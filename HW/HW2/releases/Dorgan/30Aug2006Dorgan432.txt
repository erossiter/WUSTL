SEN. DORGAN SAYS DROUGHT DISASTER AID ANNOUCEMENT IS TARDY, ENTIRELY INADEQUATE
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), the lead sponsor of legislation now pending in Congress that would provide $4 billion in disaster aid for farmers and ranchers, said Tuesday that Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns' announcement that the Bush Administration will make $800 million available to farmers hit by the drought is a "belated, but welcome acknowledgement" by the Bush Administration that farmers need help, but that it falls far short of what is needed.  
   "The reaction by the Bush Administration to the drought disaster gripping much of America's heartland is entirely inadequate," Dorgan said. "I'm pleased they are finally acknowledging farmers and ranchers need help. But given the size and severity of the drought, the amount of money Secretary Johanns is talking about is going to leave many farmers and entire counties without any help at all." 
   The package also includes very little new money - $700 million of the $800 million package is simply accelerated farm program payments farmers were due to receive anyway, he noted. 
   Dorgan vowed to continue pushing in Congress for his disaster aid package, which the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved three times, and the full Senate has approved once. The U.S. House, however, has yet to approve it because of President Bush's veto threat and opposition from U.S. House Republican leaders.
