DELEGATION ANNOUNCES $1.56 MILLION FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PREPAREDNESS IN NORTH DAKOTA
  Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and Rep.  
 Earl Pomeroy announced Monday the state of North Dakota has been awarded $1.56 million in federal funds to bolster the state's defenses against natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other incidents that put public safety at risk. 
   The grant will help North Dakota's state and local governments improve their capability to prevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies by ensuring that trained and experienced personnel are on-hand throughout the state. The goal is to give local governments the necessary resources to deal with potential disasters, the delegation said. 
   "Disasters can strike anywhere and we must ensure we are prepared for emergencies," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This grant will help us build and maintain a system that can keep our state safe in the event of a tragedy." 
   The funds were awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Emergency Management Performance Grant Program with funds appropriated by Congress.
