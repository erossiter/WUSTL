DEMOCRATS UNVEIL NEW LEGISLATION TO REFORM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING
  Senate Democrats introduced legislation Thursday to implement major reforms in government contracting. Their proposals, introduced by Sen. Byron Dorgan and 25 others, would put in place tough new punishments for war profiteers, crack down on corporate cheaters and force real competition in the award of government contracts.  
   Dorgan, as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee (DPC) has presided over a series of hearings on contracting abuses plaguing both Iraq reconstruction and recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. 
   The legislation, he said, seeks to stop many of the abuses exposed in those hearings. 
   "The DPC hearings have revealed waste, fraud and abuse on a massive scale in government contracting," Dorgan said. "We need to stop it. This legislation would accomplish that by putting tough new penalties in place for war profiteers, eliminating conflicts of interest, insisting on transparency, and putting an end to cronyism in key government appointments relating to federal contracting and public safety." 
   "Taxpayers deserve to know that their tax dollars will be spent wisely, not left wide open to be snatched up by fast-buck artists with friends in high places," Dorgan added. "This legislation will restore integrity to a federal contracting process that has too often failed to guarantee that taxpayers get a fair return on the money they entrust to their government." 
   Key provisions of the bill include: 
   * New penalties of up to 20 years in prison and at least $1 million in fines for war profiteering. 
   * Restoration of a rule, dropped by the Bush Administration, that prohibits awarding federal contracts to companies with a pattern of failing to comply with contracting laws. 
   * Establishment of a "Truth in Contracting" public website identifying significant over-charges by major contractors. 
   * A prohibition of huge monopoly contracts, in order to ensure price competition from multiple companies. 
   * A requirement that federal agencies conduct their own contract oversight, rather than paying contractors, often with conflicts of interest, to oversee each other. 
   * Strengthening conflict of interest rules that now allow federal contracting officials to take jobs representing companies to whom they once awarded contracts. 
   * Requiring that political appointees to key federal jobs relating to federal contracting and public safety have credentials and experience that qualify them for those positions.
