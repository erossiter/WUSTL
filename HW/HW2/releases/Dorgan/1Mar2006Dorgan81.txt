SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS DECISION NOT TO CONDUCT 'SPRING PULSE'
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday he is pleased the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has decided not to conduct a "spring pulse" in March, a practice that depletes water supplies in the Upper Missouri River Basin and two reservoirs in North Dakota.

   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
  March 1, 2006
   I am pleased with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision not to conduct a spring pulse that would lower water levels in the drought-stricken Upper Missouri River Basin even further. 
   North Dakota and other states are struggling with water levels that have left some residents without a safe water supply and some businesses operating on mud flats. It would make no sense to aggravate that problem by sending water downstream. 
   I hope the Corps will continue to take this commonsense approach in the future when deciding whether to maintain water levels in upstream reservoirs or send it downstream for a handful of barge interests.
