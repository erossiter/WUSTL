SEN. DORGAN SAYS CAFTA WILL BE REJECTED AS CONGRESS DRAWS LINE ON FAILED U.S TRADE POLICIES
  The two Senate leaders in the effort to defeat the U.S.- Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) - one Democrat and one Republican - said Thursday Congress is "drawing the line with CAFTA" on failed U.S. trade policies that have created a string of record-breaking trade deficits where once there were U.S. trade surpluses.  
   U.S. Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) are co-chairs of the Senate's CAFTA Action Caucus, which is leading efforts to defeat the trade deal in the Senate. 
   "I welcome the Presidents of the six CAFTA nations to America and to Washington, D.C.," Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said, "But they need to know there are plenty of people in Congress who see things quite differently than the President on trade policy in general and on this treaty in particular." 
   "I believe CAFTA is where Congress draws the line on America's failed trade policies. This trade deal was negotiated over a year ago and has not been submitted to Congress for a vote in all that time because the Administration knows the votes are not there to pass it." 
   Dorgan described the visits the six Presidents made on Capitol Hill yesterday as "unprecedented and desperate lobbying" of Congress by foreign heads of state, launched by an Administration that knows Congress "isn't buying a new trade deal that simply repeats the colossal failures of NAFTA and other flawed trade agreements."
