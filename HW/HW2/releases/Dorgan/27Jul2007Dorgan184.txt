SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN AMENDMENT BOLSTERING SECURITY ON NORTHERN BORDER
  The U.S. Senate approved a provision offered by Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Pete Domenici (R-NM) late Thursday night that will bolster border security along the northern border and around the country. The provision was added to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which was approved by the full Senate 89-4. 
   Dorgan's amendment boosts personnel at the nation's ports of entry - adding 100 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 200 Customs and Border Patrol agents annually, beginning in 2009. It also requires biannual reports from the Department of Homeland Security on the need for upgrades to ports of entry and the national land border security plan, and establishes a demonstration program on the northern border to test new technology for use at ports of entry.
   "With the recent warnings in mind regarding the threat of international terrorism to the United States, it is important that we take steps to boost security at our borders in a way that does not impede economic activity in our border communities," Dorgan said. "This bill will direct more resources to our border with Canada and across the United States. That's a critical step forward in our effort to secure our homeland and stop the flow of illegal immigration."
   The provision strengthens a bill that also calls for 5,000 new Border Patrol agents nationwide, four new unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, and other measures to help secure the border.
