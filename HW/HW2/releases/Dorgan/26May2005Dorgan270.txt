SEN. DORGAN SAYS COMMITTEE?PASSED ENERGY BILL PROVIDES 'HUGE BOOSTS' FOR NORTH DAKOTA'S ENERGY INDUSTRY
  The comprehensive energy bill approved by the U.S. Senate Energy Committee Thursday includes several provisions authored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that could dramatically boost North Dakota's energy industries-from oil, coal and natural gas to renewable fuels, such as wind, ethanol and hydrogen-and lead to the creation of new jobs in the state.  
   Last week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee agreed to include the Senator's hydrogen title, and yesterday it added his "Renewable Fuels Standard," which calls for an 8 billion gallon a year ethanol mandate. The committee passed the full bill today, which means the legislation now moves to the full U.S. Senate, where Dorgan said prospects look good. 
   "I think we're on track for a big victory that will be very important for the whole gamut of energy industries in North Dakota," Dorgan said. "I am very happy with the makeup of this bill, and I think its chances of passing the full Senate are positive. That means more economic opportunities and jobs in the energy field for North Dakotans." 
   Among Dorgan's provisions in the bill most important to North Dakota: 
   * Hydrogen: Calls for an aggressive development project that would authorize a $3.75 billion investment over the next five years for research, development and demonstration programs with private industry to develop hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen powered automobiles, and a nation-wide fueling infrastructure. The legislation includes the goals of 100,000 hydrogen-fueled vehicles on the road in the United States by 2010, and 2.5 million of them by 2020.
   * Renewable Fuels Standard: Requires refiners to produce and use a minimum level of 8 billion gallons of ethanol in their gasoline blends annually by 2012. This will add substantial value to North Dakota's grains and spur economic development in the state's ethanol and biodiesel industries.
   * Loan Guarantee: Creates a loan guarantee for the construction of a clean, lignite-coal facility in North Dakota that would integrate coal, renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon sequestration.
   * Mercury Removal: Allows the Department of Energy to establish a program to develop and test technologies to remove elemental mercury from Fort Union lignite coal.
   * Advance Oil and Gas Recovery: Creates a demonstration program-involving 10, $3 million projects-in the Williston basin of North Dakota and Montana that would use carbon dioxide injection to recover oil and natural gas.
   * Indian Energy Development Opportunities: Encourages energy development on tribally owned lands, while ensuring that fundamental trust responsibilities remain intact.
   * Rural Electric Cooperatives: Minimizes new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) burdens for cooperatives, while exempting small electric coops from most FERC regulations. The bill also provides for voluntary-rather than mandatory-participant funding for all new transmission projects, and other FERC-related provisions.
