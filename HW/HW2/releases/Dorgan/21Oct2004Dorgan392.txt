SEN. DORGAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CORPS PLAN TO OFFSET DROUGHT IMPACTS IN MISSOURI RIVER BASIN
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) issued the following statement Wednesday regarding the announcement by the Army Corps of Engineers on new efforts to offset drought impacts throughout the Missouri River Basin.  
   Text of Statement by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan October 20, 2004 
   "I agree with and support the efforts of the Corps and am pleased that they now recognize the environmental and economic devastation that low water levels have caused on the Upper Missouri. But, the bottom line is that for five years the Corps has been draining our reservoirs during the drought to keep a non-existent barge industry afloat downriver." 
   "The need for these additional efforts is a direct result of the Corps' failure to develop an appropriate water use plan for the river. Additionally, even though the Corps is acknowledging the severity of the drought, they continue to operate under a plan basically implemented in the 1970s." 
   "North Dakota and other upstream states have suffered enough from the Corps' mismanagement of the Missouri River Basin. Marinas on Lake Sakakawea are sitting high and dry; the community of Fort Yates temporarily lost its water supply last November; and other towns have had their water supplies threatened." 
   "If the Corps is really interested in minimizing drought impacts along the river, they will support the efforts by Senator Burns and myself to lower the trigger for stopping navigation. As long as the Corps continues to mismanage our reservoirs we will continue facing these same problems."
