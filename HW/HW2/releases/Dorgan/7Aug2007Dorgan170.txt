SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD SAY NEW KILLDEER MOUNTAIN MANUFACTURING PLANT WILL BOOST ECONOMY
  U.S. Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad helped kick off Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing's new plant here Tuesday, saying the expansion is a good sign for the economy of Dickinson and all of North Dakota. 
   Senator Dorgan, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Senator Conrad, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, have worked to help Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing secure contracts to produce high-tech equipment for the U.S. military and companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The senators have secured more than $8 million to help KMM develop new technologies for the military.
   "This new facility will help expand Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing's role as an important producer of high-tech equipment and a key piece of the Red River Valley Research Corridor," Dorgan said. "This facility will give a boost to the economy of the region and help solidify the state's reputation as a center of high-tech research and development. KMM's expansion is also evidence that home grown North Dakota companies have a major role to play in the Red River Corridor, not only in research but in manufacturing as well."
   "Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing is precisely the model for how private companies can invigorate the economy of North Dakota. Don and Patricia Hedger have an entrepreneurial and common-sense spirit that helps all of North Dakota, by seizing business opportunities and creating jobs," Senator Conrad said. "Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing is growing, and proving that no barrier is too high to succeed in business in North Dakota."
