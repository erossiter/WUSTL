SEN. DORGAN CO-SPONSORS BILL TO BRING DISASTER RELIEF TO FAMILY FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), along with Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) and a bipartisan group of 18 other co-sponsors, introduced a bill Thursday to provide much-needed relief to family farmers and ranchers struggling with the effects of weather-related disasters and skyrocketing energy prices. 
   Dorgan said the bill would assist producers who have lost or suffered damage to crops, livestock and livestock feed supplies. The legislation would be a significant boost for producers in North Dakota, where heavy rains in the summer of 2005 prevented planting of more than 1 million acres, and high energy prices eliminated 75 percent of farm income on average, Dorgan said.
   "We need to support our farmers and ranchers all over the country who have faced drought, wildfires, flooding, and record high energy costs," Dorgan said. "Nearly every day I hear from farmers in North Dakota who are wondering whether they can afford to stay on the farm for another year. Congress needs to recognize the situation our producers are facing, and bring them some relief."
   Dorgan said he will try to attach the legislation to an emergency supplemental spending bill for Iraq and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Senator, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he expects to be on the conference committee that would negotiate the final version of the bill. He said he will use his role in that capacity to "do everything he can to keep the agriculture disaster language in the bill and intact."
   Senators Dorgan and Conrad were the first Members of Congress to write a disaster relief package for farmers and ranchers last year, and Dorgan succeeded in attaching a disaster relief package to a major spending bill last December, but the majority party in the House struck the language from the final bill.
