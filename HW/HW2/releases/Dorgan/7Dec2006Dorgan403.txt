SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES SENATE APPROVAL OF LEGISLATION TO PRESERVE NATIVE LANGUAGES
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday the Senate has approved legislation that will help preserve American Indian languages by establishing education programs and materials. Dorgan sponsored the Senate version of the bill, H.R. 4766. The bill now goes to the President.  
   Dorgan, Vice Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, said the legislation is a key step in the effort to preserve Native languages and culture. Of the hundreds of Native languages spoken centuries ago, only 20 or so are spoken daily - and in many cases they are spoken only by a few tribal elders. 
   The bill, which passed the Senate late Wednesday night, provides multi-year grants to establish "language nests" for young children, language survival schools for student-age children, and restoration programs that provide Native language training and materials to those seeking fluency. The programs will pair Native speakers, most of whom are tribal elders, with a range of child-age and adult students. The program will also help teaching institutions and language programs create materials to further preserve these at-risk tribal resources. 
   "This legislation will not only help preserve an important piece of American Indian culture, but also help young Native children succeed in school," Dorgan said. "We know that students attending language nests and survival schools become closer to their communities and perform better in school. Students, their families and tribes are strengthened when students become fluent in their native languages, while still receiving a majority of their instruction in English."
