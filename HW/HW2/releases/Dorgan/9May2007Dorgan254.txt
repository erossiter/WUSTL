SEN. DORGAN PRESSES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO MAINTAIN FLEET OF B-52 BOMBERS
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) quizzed U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates Wednesday on the Pentagon's budget for B-52s, saying he was disappointed that it ignored Congress' clear mandate that the Air Force maintain a fleet of 76 B-52s. 
   In a hearing of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Dorgan said the Administration's proposal to fund only 56 B-52s ignores a clear Congressional mandate that the fleet cannot fall below 76. Dorgan pointed out to Gates that the loss of an additional 20 aircraft could harm the nation's long-range strike capabilities.
   "Our B-52s are the cheapest bombers in our arsenal to fly, they have decades of life left, and we have relied on them as recently as Operation Iraqi Freedom," Dorgan said. "The Air Force has no business retiring more of these aircraft, and I don't expect Congress to change its mind on the need for at least 76 B-52s."
   "If the Air Force is allowed to move these B-52s to storage, they will very soon declare a bomber gap," he said. "The best use of taxpayer money is to maintain our bomber fleet. It makes no sense to try to save money by eliminating the most cost-efficient aircraft in our arsenal."
   Last year, Dorgan offered an amendment, which was adopted and passed into law, barring the Air Force from retiring any B-52s until the completion of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study. Dorgan said he is confident the detailed study, which would address America's long-range strike capabilities, would show the retirement would create a bomber gap.
