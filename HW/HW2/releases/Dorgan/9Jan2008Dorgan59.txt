SEN. DORGAN HOLDS TOWN HALL MEETING WITH BOTTINEAU-AREA RESIDENTS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) held a town hall meting here Wednesday to discuss the economy of the Bottineau region and the concerns of local residents. He also provided an update on his work in Congress, including his successful effort to secure $295,470 for much-needed improvements at the International Peace Garden. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured the funding to help make improvements to a number of buildings and other facilities at the International Peace Garden that have fallen into disrepair. He pledged to work to assist in the effort after touring the Peace Garden and seeing the state of its structures.
   "The International Peace Garden is a unique symbol of cooperation between our country and Canada, and one that we should take pride in," Dorgan said. "That means we have a responsibility to ensure its facilities are in good shape for the kids who attend music camp and the thousands of other visitors it hosts each year. This funding will help us fulfill that responsibility."
   Dorgan also gave attendees the latest update on the status of the farm bill. He said the Senate produced a solid farm bill that will strengthen the safety net for family farmers and, for the first time in more than a decade, establish a permanent disaster relief program.
