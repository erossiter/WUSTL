SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO CORPS OF ENGINEERS DECISION NOT TO CONDUCT 'SPRING PULSE' IN MARCH
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Wednesday applauded the decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to refrain from conducting a "spring pulse" that would drain more water from the drought-stricken reservoirs on the upper Missouri River.  
   Dorgan is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Corps of Engineers. 
   TEXT OF STATEMENT
  BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   March 7, 2007
   "I'm pleased that the Corps has decided not to put residents of the upper Missouri River basin through a spring pulse during this time of severe drought. 
   "Last month, the Corps provided a report to me that shows a number of communities in North Dakota and other upstream states would face serious consequences if the upper Missouri River reservoirs drop further. This is no time for a spring pulse. 
   "The Corps made the right decision in this case but my real concern is to improve their overall management plan so upstream communities are given a fair shake. I'm going to keep pushing them to do that and working in the meantime with the Corps, the Bureau of Reclamation, and state and local officials to prevent any North Dakota community or its residents from being cut off from their Missouri River water supply as this drought continues."
