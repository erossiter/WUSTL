COMMITTEE APPROVES BILL CO-SPONSORED BY SEN. DORGAN TO BETTER MEASURE BROADBAND COVERAGE
  The Senate Commerce Committee approved legislation co-sponsored by U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) to more accurately determine the gaps in broadband coverage in the United States to help policy makers make better decisions to provide all Americans with broadband access. 
   "The FCC has been claiming that more people have access to broadband service than actually do," said Dorgan. "We must improve the accuracy and quality of broadband data collection in order to address the shortfalls in access and make better-informed decisions about broadband policy. We need to know what areas are being underserved, whether consumers are being overcharged, and if connection speeds are too slow for consumers to benefit." 
   "The U.S. is falling behind in its broadband penetration, and we need to find solutions to better serve consumers. We must ensure that all Americans have access to broadband service at high-speed connections and reasonable prices."
  The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently ranked the U.S. 15th in broadband penetration per capita out of the 30 nations belonging to the OECD. This is a significant drop compared to its rank of fourth in 2001. 
   The Broadband Data Improvement Act, S. 1492, will require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to update its data collection methods to measure broadband deployment levels more accurately and account for price and connection quality.
