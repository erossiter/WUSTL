SENATE APPROVES SEN. DORGAN BILL TO FIGHT METH USE ON AMERICAN INDIAN RESERVATIONS
  The U.S. Senate Friday approved a bill sponsored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and others to help fight methamphetamine production and use on rural American Indian reservations. 
   Dorgan, who sponsored the legislation with Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), said the bill would bring grant programs and federal funding to reservations to fight a "scourge" that has spread across rural America. The funding would be used to train law enforcement officials to investigate and lock up offenders, add tribes and U.S. territories to grant provisions for drug-endangered children, and address meth use by pregnant women and mothers. 
   "Meth is a dangerous drug that has been devastating to many rural communities. Unfortunately, American Indian reservations have not been spared from this scourge," Dorgan said. "On our reservations, we have too few law enforcement resources to track down dealers, and a lack of bed space and sufficient treatment for meth-related patients. This bill will bring critical resources to tribal communities to help stop people from falling into the meth trap, and help break the addiction for those who have." 
   Dorgan, Vice Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, called a hearing on meth on reservations last spring, and invited Karrie Azure, who coordinates the United Tribes Multi-Tribal Indian Drug and Alcohol Initiative at United Tribes Technical College. Azure testified that approximately 90 percent of individuals entering treatment programs at Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota are there because of methamphetamines, and said more resources are needed to fight the effects of a drug that is ravaging tribal communities.
