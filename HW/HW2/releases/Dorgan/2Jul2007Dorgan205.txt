   "The Happy Hooligans deserve congratulations for the completion of their first UAV mission from their base in Fargo. This is an historic moment in the transition of the Happy Hooligans to their new mission and the rise of North Dakota as a hub of unmanned aircraft systems nationwide.
   "I've often said the Happy Hooligans are the best pilots in America, so it's no surprise to me that they were able to complete their first mission so quickly.
   "This is a big day for our Air National Guard and for the state of North Dakota. I'm going to keep working to ensure the Happy Hooligans have all the resources they need to carry out this exciting new mission."
