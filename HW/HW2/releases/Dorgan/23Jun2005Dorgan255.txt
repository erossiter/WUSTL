SEN. DORGAN REACTS TO CAFTA'S ARRIVAL ON CAPITOL HILL
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) reissued a call Thursday to sideline the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) as the Bush Administration prepared to send the agreement to the Senate for consideration today.  
   As written, CAFTA simply repeats many of the mistakes made in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has cost the U.S. nearly 900,000 jobs, Dorgan said. 
   "These fast-track trade agreements are really just a sham," Dorgan said. "Since NAFTA, our trade deficit with Mexico and Canada has increase twelvefold, and our agricultural trade surplus has disappeared. CAFTA will be more of the same. It will devastate North Dakota's sugar industry, increase our trade deficit, and send more U.S. jobs overseas." 
   CAFTA is also a threat to sugarbeet growers, who generate $2.6 billion in economic activity and support 32,000 jobs in the Red River Valley. 
   "We've been waiting to debate CAFTA for a year because Congress and the American people are sick of failed trade agreements," Dorgan said. "I'm glad we'll finally get a vote, and I hope we can stop it. We need trade agreements that benefit our country, not eliminate jobs and spike up the debt."
