SEN. DORGAN SURPRISES CANDO COUPLE AT 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY BY PRESENTING LONG OVERDUE WORLD WAR II MEDALS
  Donald and Carol Haugen of Cando received a surprise visit Friday from Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan, who congratulated them on their 50th wedding anniversary and presented Donald with a number of long-overdue medals he earned for service in World War II. 
   "You are an inspiration and example not only to your family, but to your many friends and neighbors. When you reach the 50 year mark, you've got more than a marriage, you've built a monument to love," Dorgan told the couple during his visit with them at the Durum House restaurant in Cando. 
   The medals awarded to Donald included the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star with Bronze Service Arrowhead, the Philippine Liberation Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, the Asiatic Pacific Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Victory Medal and the Presidential Unit Citation Medal, the Philippines Presidential Unit Citation, and the National Defense Service Medal. 
   "These medals tell a story of remarkable and heroic service to the United States of America," Dorgan said. "I'm sure that all these years Carol has felt mighty fortunate to have you, but you need to know your country feels the same way. Your difficult and dangerous service in World War II helped keep millions of people around the world free."
