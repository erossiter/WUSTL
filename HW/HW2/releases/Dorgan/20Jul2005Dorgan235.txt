SEN. DORGAN LOOKS FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT NOMINEE FOR SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said Wednesday that President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge John Roberts, has impressive credentials and that he will carefully examine his record as the Senate confirmation process moves forward.  
   "I don't know much about Judge John Roberts beyond initial news reports and briefings I've received, but I expect that I, as well as the rest of country, will learn much more about him in the coming months. We in the Senate will look into his record, and then I will make an informed decision from there," Dorgan said. 
   "A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is not something this country should take lightly. Few decisions reach the level of importance in a President's term than a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land," Dorgan said. "It is the job of the Senate Judiciary Committee to carefully examine Judge Roberts' judicial record and to ask relevant questions about his judicial philosophy." "I intend to give his nomination the serious consideration a Supreme Court nomination deserves."
