SEN. DORGAN TO CONVENE ACTION SUMMIT ON UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES
  Experts and policymakers will discuss the future of Unmanned Aviation Systems at a Red River Valley Research Corridor Action Summit Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and the University of North Dakota (UND) School of Aerospace Sciences are convening March 26 and 27 at the Alerus Center in Grand Forks.  
   Dorgan is organizing the Action Summit to bring federal officials and area residents together to discuss ways to speed the deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Grand Forks Air Force Base and to use the new mission to develop North Dakota as a center of UAV-related research, development and other activity. 
   "North Dakota is increasingly becoming a hub of UAV activity with the mission at the Grand Forks Air Force Base and the Happy Hooligans, the Center for Defense UAV Education at UND, and now the UAV pilot project coming to the Northern Border Air Wing," Dorgan said. "This Action Summit will be a good opportunity to come together to talk about where this technology is going and what else we can do to boost its impact on our region." 
   The public is invited to attend the Action Summit. For more information, call the Red River Valley Research Corridor Coordinating Center at 1-888-775-0192 or RSVP by e-mail to delore@theresearchcorridor.com.
