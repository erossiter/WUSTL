SEN. DORGAN ANNOUNCES TWO NORTH DAKOTANS TO TESTIFY AT HEARING ON DIABETES IN INDIAN COUNTRY
  Two North Dakotans will testify at a hearing Senate Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Byron Dorgan (D-ND) will convene Thursday to investigate the prevalence of diabetes in American Indian communities.  
   Dr. James Brosseau, director of the Altru Diabetes Center in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and Dr. Biron Baker, a primary care physician at Med Center One in Bismarck, North Dakota, will travel to Capitol Hill to speak about their experience with diabetes among American Indians, who are affected with a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than any other racial or ethnic group. 
   "Diabetes is a serious disease that affects American Indian communities at a much higher rate than the rest of the population, and it's a problem that seems to be getting worse," Dorgan said. "We need to find some innovative ways to deal with this issue, and I'm pleased we'll have Dr. Brosseau and Dr. Baker at tomorrow's hearing. Both have significant experience dealing with diabetes among American Indians and I think their testimony will be helpful as we attempt to address this important health issue." 
   Diabetes is a widespread problem in Indian Country, affecting as much as 60 percent of the adult population in some tribal communities. Between 1990 and 2004, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased 133 percent among Native Americans under age 35, and amputation rates among American Indians are three to four times higher than for the general population.
