   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY U.S. SENATOR BYRON DORGAN (D-ND) 
   "We've had our differences over issues like media ownership, but I respect Chairman Powell's service, and I like him. I wish him the best in the future and look forward to working with his successor, who I hope will see things a little differently on the need for localism and diversified ownership of broadcasting stations."
