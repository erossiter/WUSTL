SENS. DORGAN, CONRAD SECURE $12 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHERN BORDER AIR WING
  Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) announced Thursday he has secured $12 million in a Homeland Security Appropriations bill to help bring the Northern Border Air Wing based in Grand Forks to an operational stage. The bill was approved Thursday by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   Dorgan, a member of the Committee, said the funding will move the air wing from the planning to the operational stage. When fully operational, the Grand Forks wing - one of five planned across the United States' northern border - will include helicopters for surveillance and interdiction, a fixed airwing plane fitted with specialized sensors and equipment, and up to 30 staff members.
   When the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to strengthen protection of the northern border, Dorgan worked with the Department to locate a new Air Wing branch in Grand Forks. Last year, Dorgan supported a measure offered by Senator Kent Conrad that provided $2 million for preliminary preparations. Customs and Border Protection officials have visited Grand Forks to make initial site assessments.
   "The Northern Border Air Wing at Grand Forks will be an important component of our effort to strengthen security at our border with Canada," Dorgan said. "Even before September 11, I argued that we need agents and high-tech equipment guarding the border, not orange construction cones. This funding will help us keep control of our border and bring an important new mission to Grand Forks."
   The other four Northern Border Air Wing branches are in Washington, Montana, Michigan and New York.
   Dorgan is a long-time advocate of increasing resources at the northern border. In 2001, he developed a $28 million Northern Border Initiative that added about 300 Customs agents and border inspectors to the U.S.-Canada border, including 36 in North Dakota.
