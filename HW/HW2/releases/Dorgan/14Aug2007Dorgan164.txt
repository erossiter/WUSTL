SEN. DORGAN BRINGS NATIONAL LAB DIRECTORS TO RESEARCH CORRIDOR
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) brought the directors of four of the United States' premiere high-tech research labs here Tuesday for a tour and meetings aimed at identifying areas in which the labs can partner with North Dakota State University (NDSU) and the University of North Dakota (UND) to expand the Red River Valley Research Corridor. 
   Dorgan said the visit from the lab directors is further evidence of the reputation the growing Research Corridor is gaining as a center of cutting-edge research. The high-tech research ongoing in North Dakota offers opportunities to partner with the national labs in a way that will help the labs and grow the state's high-tech sector, Dorgan said.
   The directors who toured NDSU and UND with Dorgan included Robert Rosner, Argonne National Laboratory; Carl Bauer, National Energy Technology Laboratory; Thom Mason, Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and Michael Kluse, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
   The Research Corridor is a concept that Senator Dorgan created in 2001 to bring world-class research, and good-paying jobs, to North Dakota. An NDSU report released last year found the Research Corridor has had a $759 million economic impact and created thousands of jobs in the state.
   "North Dakota has some world-class research facilities that are doing cutting-edge work, and I think we have a real opportunity here to partner with our national laboratories not only to help them fulfill their mission, but to help expand our Research Corridor," Dorgan said. 
   "Our meetings have been very productive, but this is only the start of our conversation. I'm going to keep working to find ways our researchers in North Dakota can develop partnerships with our national labs."
