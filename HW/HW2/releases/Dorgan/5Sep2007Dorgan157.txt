SEN. DORGAN REQUESTS BRIEFING ON AIR FORCE PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING NUCLEAR WEAPONS
  U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) asked the U.S. Air Force Wednesday for a full classified briefing on a published report that a B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded with nuclear weapons and then flew from Minot Air Force Base to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana on August 30.  
   Dorgan said he received some preliminary information from the Department of Defense Tuesday, but he is asking now for a full briefing on the matter as soon as possible. 
   Dorgan, who serves on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said that the "command and control" of weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal "is one of the most important duties of the military chain of command. I'm very concerned about published reports that some nuclear weapons may have been improperly handled or perhaps removed from the nuclear chain of control. I want a full, classified briefing to understand exactly what happened and what is being done to make sure it cannot happen again." 
   "Nothing is more important than safeguarding the security, command and control of our nuclear stockpile," Dorgan said.
