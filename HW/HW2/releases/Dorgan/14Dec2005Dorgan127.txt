   TEXT OF STATEMENT BY SENATOR BYRON DORGAN 
   December 14, 2005 
   "My meeting with Judge Samuel Alito today was a good first opportunity to sit down and get to know him on a one-one-one basis. 
   "A seat on the Supreme Court is a lifetime appointment, and one of the most important decisions the U.S. Senate and a President can make. This seat is particularly important. Judge Alito has been nominated to replace Sandra Day O'Connor, a distinguished and moderate justice who made a name for herself through her flinty independence and willingness to see all sides of an issue. 
   "I look forward to following the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, which are scheduled to begin in January, prior to making a decision on this nomination."
