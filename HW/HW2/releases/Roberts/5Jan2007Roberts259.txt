SEN. ROBERTS SUPPORTS BILL TO AID STORM AFFECTED FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts joined Sens. Wayne Allard (R-CO), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Pete Domenici (R-NM) and James Inhofe (R-OK) in introducing legislation to aid farmers and ranchers affected by winter storms in late December. This legislation is the first bill Senator Roberts is sponsoring in the new 110th Congress. 
   "With more storms hitting the area, it is important to recognize we are not out of the woods yet," Senator Roberts said. "The long term consequences of these storms may have a lasting effect on this industry, one that is vital to rural America and our national economy. This legislation is a good way to answer the needs of farmers and ranchers in disaster areas." 
   The legislation, S. 165, reauthorizes the Livestock Compensation Program and would allow aid for producers who suffered livestock losses as a result of the recent blizzards in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico and Oklahoma.
   In Kansas, the storm hit one of the largest concentrations of livestock in the state, and there are numerous reports of animals succumbing due to a lack of food and water. 
   Yesterday, Senator Roberts, Senator Brownback (R-KS) and Congressman Jerry Moran (R-KS) sent a letter to the President to support a request from the State of Kansas to give the area a federal disaster declaration making federal aid available to producers in need.
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
