SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BILL; CONTAINS IMPORTANT KANSAS PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, today announced the Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2006 Military Construction Appropriations and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Conference Report containing construction projects important to Kansas.  
   "I am pleased the Senate has acted quickly to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families especially during this time of war when so many are making the ultimate sacrifice for our nation," Senator Roberts said. "These projects in Kansas reflect our commitment to provide our military with the best facilities to carry out their mission and to raise their families." 
   This conference report just passed provides the VA with a total of $70.25 billion, which is $4.87 billion over 2005 levels. For VA Medical Services, $22.55 billion is allotted, representing an 8 percent increase over current funding levels. In addition, the measure designates $1.23 billion as emergency spending in response to the discovery of a projected budget shortfall for 2006. 
   Earlier this year, Senator Roberts supported a critical amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill passed by the Senate to correct a $1.5 billion shortfall in veterans' health care services. Sen. Roberts said, "As the veterans of Operation Enduring and Iraqi Freedom return, we are reminded of our nation's duty to ensure their health needs are taken care of and they return to their civilian lives with as much ease as possible."
