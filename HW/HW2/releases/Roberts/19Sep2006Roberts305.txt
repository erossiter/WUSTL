SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $347,900 TO SAFEHOME IN OVERLAND PARK
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $347,945 grant to Safehome, Inc. in Overland Park for housing needs for women affected by domestic violence. 
   The funds will provide assistance to minors, adults, and their dependents who are homeless, or in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance as a result of fleeing a domestic violence situation. The grant may be used to provide short-term housing assistance, including rental or utilities payments and to support individuals who are fleeing a situation of domestic violence to locate and secure permanent housing.
   "I am pleased that Safehome in Overland Park received this grant," Senator Roberts said. "It is important that victims of domestic violence be provided with a strong system of support."
   The grant was awarded by the United States Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women. The funds were made available by the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act (The PROTECT Act) of 2003.
