SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE APPROVES WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT CONFERENCE REPORT
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts today announced that projects critical to Kansas communities including the combined sewage overflow (CSO) project in Atchison were included in the Conference Report on the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) approved by the Senate late last night. The legislation was approved by the House August 1 and the bill now goes to the President to be signed into law, which Senator Roberts urged him to do. 
   "Atchison is facing one of the most comprehensive and formidable challenges I have ever seen with the combined sewage overflow project.," Roberts explained. "I am pleased the Environment and Public Works Committee included my request for a solution for Atchison in the bill by providing an authorization for funding.
   "In discussions with community leaders in Atchison and Kansas City District Army Corps of Engineers, it is clear we must address the sewer issue because it not only affects the quality of the water in the area, but it could also have a serious impact on future economic growth for the City of Atchison." I look forward to working with my colleagues, the community, and the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure this project remains a priority.
   The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is the main vehicle to authorize Army Corps of Engineers Civil works projects.
   Senator Roberts also worked to secure funds for the Seven Levees project in Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri. "The levees protect the Kansas City Metropolitan area, including several square miles of urban, industrial, commercial and residential areas," Senator Roberts said. "This area is vital to the economy because it serves as a manufacturing, distribution, transportation, and warehouse center for the nation."
   The projects for Kansas include:
   * $20 million for Atchison: a project to eliminate or control combined sewer overflows in the city of Atchison, and to prevent wet weather discharge into the Missouri river, which is the drinking water source for downstream communities including Leavenworth and Kansas City.
   * Strawn Cemetery, Pleasant Township, Coffey County: transfers three acres of land from the John Redmond Reservoir to Pleasant Township in Coffee County to expand the Strawn Cemetery.
   * Geary County Fire Department: a conveyance of 7.4 acres of land located in Geary County, to the Geary County Fire Department for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a fire station.
   * $42.5 million for the Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri Levee Project: feasability study on the protection and capabilities of seven levees along the banks of the Missouri and Kansas River. The levees protect the Kansas City Metropolitan area, including several square miles of urban industrial and commercial and residential areas. 
   WRDA also authorizes funds to improve the Missouri River locks and dams systems to improve grain transportation up and down the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.
