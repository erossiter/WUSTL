SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $122,000 GRANT FOR GANG RESISTANCE IN TOPEKA
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $122,000 grant to the City of Topeka for gang resistance education and training. 
   The Topeka Police Department will use the funds to teach the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program to nearly 1,000 sixth-grade students in Unified School District 501. Six police officers and one sergeant will teach the GREAT program which is designed to provide students with the skills they need to avoid gang pressure and youth violence. The curriculum helps students develop values and practice behaviors that will assist them to avoid destructive activities. The program also trains law enforcement officers in the school-based curriculum.
   Senator Roberts said, "I am pleased to announce these funds to the City of Topeka. It is important to use our highly skilled police officers in the classroom to assist in the education and protection of our children."
   The grant was awarded by the United States Department of Justice's Gang Resistance Education and Training Program.
