SEN. ROBERTS TO NFL COMMISSIONER: ALLOW KANSANS TO WATCH K-STATE'S BOWL GAME
  Sen. Pat Roberts, a graduate of Kansas State University, late yesterday spoke with the National Football League (NFL) Commissioner, Mr. Roger Goodell, urging him to allow Kansans to view televised coverage of the ever-optimistic and fighting Kansas State Wildcats at the Texas Bowl. 
   "Every Kansan should be able to cheer on their team, be it the Wildcats, the Jayhawks or the Shockers," Roberts said. "This issue is symptomatic of a long-running dispute between the NFL Network and certain cable providers. While I hope the parties can come to a long-term and mutually acceptable resolution, I do not believe K-State fans should be kept from seeing the Texas Bowl simply because they subscribe to a particular cable company." 
   At issue is televised access to the inaugural game of the Texas Bowl featuring Kansas State University's Wildcats against Rutgers' Scarlett Knights on December 28, 2006 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. The game will air exclusively on the NFL Network which is only provided on certain carriers.
