SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $63,780 FOR DRUG FREE PREVENTION IN JACKSON COUNTY
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $63,780 grant to the Jackson County Communities That Care Coalition for drug abuse prevention. 
   The Coalition in Jackson County will strengthen collaboration with other community-based youth serving organizations to prevent and reduce substance abuse among youth and over time, adults, by addressing the factors in the community that increase the risk of substance abuse.
   "Efforts to keep our youth drug-free are critical to healthy communities in our state," Senator Roberts said. "Thanks to this grant, the Coalition has great potential to help save kids' lives."
   The funds were awarded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The Jackson County Communities That Care Coalition serves Jackson County with a population of 12,657.
