SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON IRAQ
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement on the recent National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq:  
   "The ongoing situation in Iraq is something the Intelligence Committee follows on a weekly basis," Senator Roberts said. "I have reviewed the NIE and I think that it is a fair, well-written piece. Any honest assessment would recognize that the next couple of years will be very challenging for the Iraqi government and for the US. While the road ahead will be difficult, there are reasons to be optimistic. The vast majority of Iraqis still want true and full independence, fair elections, a growing economy and an opportunity to participate in their new government. 
   "We need to continue our full support of the nascent Iraqi government by helping to rebuild their economic infrastructure and maintain security while training the Iraqi security forces. This is exactly what the President is doing. 
   "This NIE discusses a broad range of possibilities and acknowledges its own uncertainties because of the complex and shifting factors at play in Iraq. It represents one facet of information that informs our policy decisions and should be treated as such."
