SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GOV. JOHANNS FOR SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE
  Sen. Pat Roberts issued the following statement regarding the nomination of Governor Mike Johanns (R-NE) for Department of Agriculture Secretary:  
   "I have personally congratulated Gov. Johanns on his nomination for Secretary of Agriculture," Senator Roberts said. The president has made a good choice and I am sure his confirmation in the Senate will be steadfast. 
   "Gov. Johanns understands agriculture on the high plains and the challenges our producers and farmers face today. He has led efforts at both the state and national level to combat drought, promote U.S. agriculture overseas, and to improve the economic conditions of rural communities. Gov. Johanns is a well-qualified individual who will continue to protect farmers and will serve as an outstanding advocate for agriculture." 
   Mike Johanns was sworn into office as Nebraska's 38th Governor in 1999 and was re-elected in 2002. Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary Ann Veneman resigned her post after serving on President Bush's cabinet for four years. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
