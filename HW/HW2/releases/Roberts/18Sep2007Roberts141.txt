SEN. ROBERTS: CONTINUE FIGHT ON METH
  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today encouraged industry and federal officials to continue the progress that has been made in Kansas and nationwide on fighting the production and distribution of methamphetamine. 
   Senator Roberts made the following statement at today's Senate Finance Committee hearing on "Breaking the Methamphetamine Supply Chain: Meeting Challenges at the Border:"
   "Thank you for holding this hearing today on an issue that greatly affects my state and the rest of the nation. Methamphetamine production and use is a growing problem for Kansas law enforcement.
   "While the number of meth lab incidents has significantly decreased over the past few years, we still face an uphill battle in the fight against meth and other drugs. Even with the decline in the number of meth labs, the price for meth has not increased. This indicates that people have found other ways to get meth.
   "Around 10 percent of the meth supply in Kansas is produced in labs. This means that 90 percent of the meth in Kansas is imported. Meth is coming into the state from Mexico by way of Texas and Oklahoma on highways 54 and 56.
   "This poses significant challenges for law enforcement officials. In addition, methamphetamine contributes to criminal behavior, such as burglary, theft, and identity theft.
   "The fight against meth takes a comprehensive approach including prevention, enforcement, and treatment. I thank all of you for your efforts in combating meth."
   Senator Roberts is a new member of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Roberts is a co-sponsor of the Agricultural Business Security Tax Credit Act of 2007 which would provide tax credits to improve security measures for businesses that sell and store agricultural products and chemicals.
