SEN. ROBERTS: INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE APPROVES HAYDEN NOMINATION TO BE CIA DIRECTOR
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today announced the Committee voted 12-3 to favorably report the nomination of General Michael Hayden to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 
   "General Hayden is an outstanding choice to head the CIA. He is a proven leader and a supremely qualified intelligence professional. 
   "I now urge the Senate to consider this nomination before we break for the Memorial Day recess.
   "I believe that we can get this nomination on the floor and approved before the end of the week if my Democrat colleagues will join with us in a bipartisan way to fill this critical national security position."
