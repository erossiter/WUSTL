SENS. ROBERTS, BROWNBACK APPLAUD DESIGNATION OF FEMA DISASTER AID FOR KANSAS STORM VICTIMS
  U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Pat Roberts (R-KS) today applauded President Bush's declaration of a state of emergency for the state of Kansas following recent winter storms, releasing federal funds for recovery efforts. 
   "I am pleased that President Bush acted so quickly to help Kansans who have been affected by the recent storms," said Brownback. "I know the people of Kansas are resilient, and they will make good use of this federal assistance."
   Multiple winter storms spread thick ice throughout Kansas this week. The damage to date includes wide scale power outages and a great deal of damage to homes and businesses. Over 100,000 people are without power, many people cannot leave their homes, and at least four people have died due to icy conditions.
   "This quick presidential action on our request for FEMA aid is important for Kansas," said Roberts. "As a result of the horrible winter storms this week, it is critical that we remove debris and get aid to those without power or water. I know Kansans and our local emergency responders will remain diligent as crews are already working day and night to restore power and make roads safe."
   Led by Senator Roberts, the entire Kansas Congressional Delegation yesterday sent a letter to President Bush to support authorization of FEMA assistance to Kansas due to the multiple winter storms.
