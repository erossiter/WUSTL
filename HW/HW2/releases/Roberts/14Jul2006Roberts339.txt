SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $80,000 GRANT FOR CRAWFORD STATE PARK IN CRAWFORD COUNTY
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks will acquire 42 additional acres at the Crawford State Park in Farlington, KS. 
   The new acres, which will be used for outdoor recreation on the current 500-acre park, were provided by a $80,000 Land and Water Conservation Fund grant from the National Park Service.
   Additionally, the grant will also improve the Oak Point and Rocky Cove Campground areas.
   The new park space and renovated areas will feature additional parking and asphalt roads. Park users will have improved handicap, camper and recreational trail access for their outdoor recreation experience.
   "Kansas prides itself on its public parks and recreational facilities," Senator Roberts said. "This grant will improve Crawford State Park as it continues to be a point of interest for those in southeast Kansas."
   The Kansas Department of Transportation will provide the remaining $80,000 in the $160,000 improvement project.
