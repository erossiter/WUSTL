REP. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF REP. GOSS TO BE CIA'S NEW DIRECTOR
  Sen. Pat Roberts today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Rep.  
 Porter Goss (R-FL) to be the Director of Central Intelligence: 
   "I have told the White House that the President has made an excellent choice in nominating Congressman Porter Goss to be the Director of Central Intelligence. 
   "Serving with Porter during the past 16 years of his public service career, I have known him to be a most able, experienced and conscientious member of Congress with unique experience and expertise in national security and intelligence issues. 
   "I spoke with Porter this morning and gave him my full support and confidence as President Bush's nominee to lead the Intelligence Community at this most critical time. His chairmanship as well as his background as a former officer with both Army Intelligence and the CIA make him uniquely qualified in terms of experience and expertise to lead the Intelligence Community during this time of challenge and reform. I believe he has the capability to provide the agency and our intelligence community with new thinking combined with experience and a steady hand. 
   "I am hopeful that the Senate Intelligence Committee can quickly move this confirmation in a bipartisan manner." 
   Senator Roberts is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and will conduct Congressman Goss' confirmation hearings.
