SEN. ROBERTS APPLAUDS SENATE ACTION ON RESPECT FOR AMERICA'S FALLEN HEROES ACT
  Sen. Pat Roberts today applauded Senate approval of the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, a bill to prohibit demonstrations and picketing of military funeral services. 
   "As a former Marine," Sen. Roberts said, "I am pleased the Senate has acted to protect the dignity and honor of military funeral services. Loved-ones of our fallen men and women in uniform have already made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. We must allow them the right to mourn without being thrust into a political circus."
   The bill establishes a 500 foot buffer and prohibits picketing that disturbs or disrupt the peace within one hour before and after a funeral service, unless given consent by the cemetery director. The restrictions only apply to cemeteries that are part of the National Cemetery Administration and Arlington Cemetery. Offenders could face a fine and/or up to one year in prison.
   The bill, H.R. 5037, now goes to the President to be signed into law.
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
