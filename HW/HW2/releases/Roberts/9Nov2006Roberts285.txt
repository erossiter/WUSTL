SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT RECOGNIZING NATION'S VETERANS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, a former Marine and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today released the following statement in recognition of Veteran's Day: 
   "On this Veterans Day, our nation should be reminded of what it means to be a free people. Our inherent rights are protected by the men and women who have worn and are wearing the uniform. Many have given their full measure in the protection of our freedom. All have sacrificed. 
   "Let us take time to remember that if it weren't for these quiet heroes, America would not be America. We would not be free. 
   "It is also important to note that many veterans give their service to the nation above and beyond their call of duty. One need only look at the leadership of General Richard Meyers, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to find examples of contributions to the safety and security of the American people. He is now at Kansas State University, where he teaches and shapes young minds. 
   "We can also look to the members of the Patriot Guard, for shielding mourning military families from protesters, for protecting the memory of fallen service members and for preserving the dignity of their service. We should all be guided by their example. 
   "With gratitude from one veteran to all others, Semper fi. America, always faithful."
