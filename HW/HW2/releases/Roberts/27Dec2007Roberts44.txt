SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON FORMER PAKISTANI PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today issued the following statement regarding the death of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto: 
   "The tragic assassination of former Prime Minister Bhutto has raised serious national and international security concerns. Pakistan has been an American ally in the war against terrorism. Terrorists plan and use such attacks to encourage chaos, instability, and to put governments at risk. In this regard, Al Qaeda and the Taliban must be considered. Stability and the rule of law have been undermined, as well as, steps towards democracy. This instability is precisely what will empower and embolden terrorists who will use this tragedy to their own purpose. If the action to restore order is not handled quickly and properly, the government of President Musharraf may be at risk as well as cooperation with the United States.
   "Musharraf bough A.Q. Khan, the godfather and exporter of nuclear weaponry, under control and Musharraf has been sharing intelligence with the United States.
   "Today's tragic attack proves the threat of terrorism is not limited to Afghanistan and Iraq, but is world wide with ominous repercussions; especially with regard to difficult India-Pakistan relationship. In the eyes of a divided Pakistani people and the world, justice and the rule of law must prevail in order to maintain stability."
