SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE APPROVES MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts today announced the Senate approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act containing important funds for Kansas military installations and the nation's Veterans. 
   "I was pleased to see the Senate approved the bill and has recognized Kansas' critical role in our National Defense," Senator Roberts said. "The bill contains investments to our military installations that will improve quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families. I was also pleased to see a significant investment in Veteran's health care, especially in regard to the treatment of traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder."

  The bill now goes to a conference committee to resolve differences in the House and Senate bills. 
   The following projects were included for Kansas:
   FORT LEAVENWORTH 
   * Military Police Battalion Barracks: $55 million 
   * Unit Operations Facility: $23 million 
   * Barracks Expansion: $12.8 million

   * Air Support Operations Squadron Complex: $12.5 million 
   * Barracks: $50 million 
   * Unit Operations Facilities: $43 million 
   * Child Development Center: $8.5 million

   Combat Aviation Brigade Complex Phase II: $109 million 
   U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, was also able to secure an additional $9 million for the Air Support Operations Squadron at Smoky Hill.
   The bill provides over $87 billion for Veterans Affairs, an increase of nearly $10 billion over the 2007 bill. Over $37 billion is included for the Veteran's Health Administration, representing a $3 billion increase over current levels. Consistent with its focus on specialty areas, the measure provides $500 million dollars for medical and prosthetic research. 
   Senator Roberts was especially pleased the bill calls for expanded access for Veteran's Affairs health care through opening more community based out-patient clinics, a practical solution for veterans needing care in rural areas.
   Senator Roberts, a former Marine, is a strong advocate of Kansas military installations, members of the military and their families, and our nation's veterans.
