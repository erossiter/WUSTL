SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $223,000 FOR TEACHER EDUCATION AT WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $223,606 Department of Education grant to assist an alternative teacher certification program at Wichita State University. The Transition to Teaching Program is aimed at recruiting and training non-licensed individuals to teach secondary education in districts that have had difficulty finding qualified applicants. 
   School districts in Butler, Cowley, Harvey, Kingman, Reno, Sedgwick and Sumner Counties in south-central Kansas have already been aided by the program.
   Participants must have a four-year degree and prove an academic background in the subject they intend to teach. Alternative licenses are available in Art, Biology, Chemistry, English, History/Government, French, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Physics and Spanish.
   The program awards students a restricted license following the first summer of enrollment in the two-year program. The license is renewable after three years and can only be used in participating school districts. 
   "The practice of molding young minds is one of the most important professions our state can offer," Sen. Roberts said. "It is my hope that these funds will attract qualified applicants to join the ranks of some of our state's top educators."
   Senator Roberts serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
