SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES CROP INSURANCE RELIEF FOR WHEAT PRODUCERS AFFECTED BY SPROUT DAMAGE
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) today said the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced measures that will allow many Kansas wheat producers to receive crop insurance indemnities for losses attributed to sprout damage.  
   In June, untimely rains cause widespread and significant damage to winter wheat in western Kansas. Due to confusion surrounding the sampling procedures used to measure crop loss, many Kansas wheat producers were denied crop insurance payments for their losses. Senator Roberts urged U.S. Department of Agriculture officials to resolve the situation so that producers could receive their crop insurance payments. "I am pleased USDA acted to bring relief to these Kansas producers," Senator Roberts said. "By allowing producers, who through no fault of their own were denied claims, to receive crop insurance payments - USDA has restored confidence in our crop insurance program." 
   Senator Roberts added, "The sales closing date for producers to sign-up for crop insurance on the 2005 winter wheat crop is September 30. Earlier this week, I told USDA officials that changes had to occur and an announcement had to be made quickly in order to allow producers to make proper risk management decisions before this deadline. I am pleased they responded by issuing these important administrative changes." 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and is the author of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act - landmark legislation that enhanced and reformed the federal crop insurance program in 2000.
