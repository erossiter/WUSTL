SEN. ROBERTS INTRODUCES BILL TO SUPPORT DISABLED
  Sen. Pat Roberts signed onto a bill introduced late yesterday to support Americans with disabilities by providing greater access to assistive technologies in schools, in the work place and other public places.  
   "I have seen first hand the difference it makes to a disabled individual to be able to take advantage of technology to help them at school or to better perform at their job," Senator Roberts said. "It is critical that we bolster existing state programs to allow others access to devices, training or financing to help them meet the challenges of their disability." 
   According to Assistive Technology for Kansans, a statewide project coordinated by the Kansas University Center on Disabilities at Parsons, there is great demand in Kansas for assistive technologies financing and services. In 2003-4 there were 20,138 requests for services met for consumers, family members and providers, 4,222 consumers and professionals trained on use of assistive technology devices, and 1,176 Kansans received assistance in developing a funding solution for needed devices. 
   The Assistive Technology Act of 2004, S. 2595, is bi-partisan legislation introduced by Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Tom Harkin (D-IA). The bill does the following: 
   * Strengthens the existing successful state assistive technology programs. 
   * Authorizes additional resources so each state will receive $500,000 minimum for state programs and $50,000 minimum for protection and advocacy services. 
   * Ensures that technology will be available where people need it - in schools, on the job and in the community - by refocusing training and technical assistance and emphasizing the provision of assistive technology devices and services. 
   * Requires programs to provide device demonstration, equipment loan, device reutilization/recycling and financing systems such as low interest loan programs. 
   * Focuses training and technical assistance to improve service planning for individuals with disabilities and ensure that service providers have information on assistive technology. 
   Senator Roberts said, "Assistive Technology is a key to improving the quality of life for our disabled Kansans." 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
