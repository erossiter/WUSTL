  Sen. Pat Roberts is pleased to announce that Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry has accepted his invitation to attend the Kansas State Fair in Hutchinson on Saturday, September 9, 2006 to visit with Kansas producers about the new Farm Bill and general agriculture policy. 
   "I am pleased that Chairman Chambliss will visit Kansas to provide insight on current agriculture policy and his outlook for the next Farm Bill. Having served as House Agriculture Committee Chairman, I know that preparing for a Farm Bill is no easy task. Chairman Chambliss has been an outstanding champion for our agriculture producers, and I am pleased that he has agreed to come sit on the wagon-tongue with Kansas farmers and ranchers. It is an honor to be able to host him at this annual showcase of the best Kansas has to offer," Senator Roberts said.
   "Pat's experience through six farm bills, his commitment to agriculture, his integrity and loyalty to the American farmer and rancher always encourages a clear and positive conversation about agriculture's future," said Senator Chambliss. "In addition to being a great friend of the American farmer, Pat is my good friend so sharing a discussion with Kansas producers at the State Fair with Pat Roberts is an invitation I look forward to with great excitement."
   Senator Roberts is a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
