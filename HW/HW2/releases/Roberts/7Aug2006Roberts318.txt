SEN. ROBERTS LAUNCHES NEW 'HOME ON THE WEB'
  Sen. Pat Roberts today unveiled his new "home on the web," an updated website providing information on his activities on behalf of Kansans, links to federal government resources and timely updates on issues that affect Kansans' daily lives and pocketbooks. 
   "I am pleased to have this new gateway for Kansans," Senator Roberts said. "For many, the only office they will be able to visit is my online office, and I hope this new site serves them well."

   * Easy sign-up for the "Roberts Report," a monthly e-newsletter

   There is also direct access to legislation Senator Roberts champions, with detailed issue statements, bill status and voting records.
   For students, the web site provides information on applying for a nomination to the country's military academies as well as information on internships for college students in Senator Roberts' Washington office.
   "The site offers information on what to see and do when you visit our nation's capital and help with scheduling tours. I hope your visit will include a stop in my Washington office and a tour of the U.S. Capitol building," Roberts said. "My website is an easy way to request information, learn about my representation of Kansas in the U.S. Senate and is a reference for other government sources on the web."
