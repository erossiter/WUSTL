SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS; CONTAINS IMPORTANT PROJECTS FOR JOHNSON COUNTY, FT. LARNED
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced the Senate passed the Interior Appropriations bill containing important projects for Johnson County and Fort Larned.  
 The bill now goes to a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation. 
   Senator Roberts said, "I am pleased the Senate acted quickly to make this important investment in our infrastructure and historical preservation efforts. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure these projects remain a priority as the bill goes to conference." 
   The following projects Senator Roberts personally worked to include in the bill: 
   * $500,000 for WaterOne, a quasi-municipal agency that provides water to more than 383,000 Johnson County residents. 
   WaterOne's primary source of water is from a jetty on the Kansas River which was breached, due to age, and was temporarily repaired last year. The funds will be used to reconstruct or replace the jetty. The project will shore-up Johnson County's water source and will block river degradation from migrating further upstream and endangering other water intakes. 
   * $1.159 million for construction to maintain the officers quarters at Fort Larned National Historic Site.
