SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR EXPANDED ISLET CELL RESEARCH TO TREAT JUVENILE DIABETES
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions favorably voted out legislation he has strongly supported to advance and coordinate research on pancreatic islet cell transplantation, a medical procedure that shows significant promise in the treatment of juvenile diabetes and other diseases.  
   "I am encouraged by recent scientific advances in islet cell transplantation," Senator Roberts said. "The hope it gives young children with diabetes who are forced to receive daily painful insulin injections cannot be measured. There are still several unanswered questions regarding this therapy and its potential for use in other medical treatments. It is important that we pass this legislation to fully understand all potential applications of islet cells." 
   Pancreatic islet cell transplantation is the process of transplanting insulin-producing cells into an individual with juvenile diabetes. The procedure has been performed on nearly 300 individuals and the majority of them no longer need insulin injections to stay alive. 
   The Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act (S. 2158) will increase the supply of pancreata for islet cell transplantation and improves the coordination of federal efforts and information regarding the procedure. 
   The bill now goes to the Senate floor for debate and vote.
