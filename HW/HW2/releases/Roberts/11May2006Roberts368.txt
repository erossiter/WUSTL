SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today released the following statement on recent news reporting regarding the National Security Agency's (NSA) Terrorist Surveillance Program: 
   "As the President said today, I am increasingly frustrated with the release of sensitive data regarding our nation's best defenses in the War on Terror. I am concerned that such disclosures will continue to erode our ability to protect the American people.
   "The bipartisan members of the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Terrorist Surveillance Program have been fully informed of all aspects of the NSA's activities. We have received several briefings and conducted three hearings with more to follow. It is critical to allow the Subcommittee to continue its oversight. Calls for further oversight are unnecessary."
   "I remain convinced that the Program authorized by the President is lawful and absolutely necessary to protect this nation from future attacks.
   "Despite the concerns of those that have not been briefed on the operational details of the program, I can tell you that the privacy of American citizens is protected. The American people understand that the nation is at war and want the President to do everything in his power to confront the serious threats terrorists pose to our way of life. We should accept nothing less or risk vulnerability to future attacks."
