SEN. ROBERTS MEETS DOD OFFICIAL, DISCUSSES EFFECTS OF BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURES ON KANSAS COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Pat Roberts met with Patrick O'Brien, Director of the Office of Economic Adjustment under the Secretary of Defense, to discuss economic development in Kansas communities in light of the recent Base Realignment and Closures (BRAC) recommendations. 
   "I was pleased to welcome Director O'Brien to Kansas," Senator Roberts said. "Our state was the first stop on his tour of BRAC communities. This action builds on the teamwork of already strong state and local leadership, especially in Parsons. I am encouraged to see the Department of Defense focus a great deal of attention on the needs of Kansas communities who play a role in the nation's defense."
   In discussions with Director O'Brien, Senator Roberts learned that the Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) will sponsor a search for a qualified candidate to serve as the Executive Director of the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant Local Redevelopment Planning Authority. This person will coordinate state, local and federal initiatives to redevelop the Parsons Army Ammunition Plant.
   Senator Roberts said he will continue to work with OEA to assist Ft. Riley communities in preparing for the arrival of more than 3,400 soldiers and their families. Roberts asked Director O'Brien to help with the wide scale development predicted for the region as families start to settle in the surrounding towns as well as the development the Department of Defense is already doing on post.
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
