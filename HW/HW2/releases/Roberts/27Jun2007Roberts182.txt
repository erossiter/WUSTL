SEN. ROBERTS INTRODUCES KANSAS NATIVE JILL SOMMERS AT CONFIRMATION TO BE CFTC COMMISSIONER
  At a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, Sen. Pat Roberts today introduced Ft. Scott native Jill Sommers and conveyed his strong support on her nomination to be a Commissioner of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
   Senator Roberts said, "Jill is a native Kansan and is a graduate of the University of Kansas. I understand her parents John and Joyce Maycumber of Ft. Scott, Kansas are with her today. Ft. Scott has a rich history and is truly a gem in Kansas.
   "Jill is well qualified for this position. Having served on the staff of Senator Bob Dole, while also working in several positions in the futures industry, she has the background and understanding necessary to address the difficult issues she will face as CFTC Commissioner.
   "More important, being from Kansas she understands agriculture and the significant role the CFTC plays in regulating our agriculture markets.
   "I am convinced she is more than up to the task, and I am proud to support her nomination as a fellow Kansan."
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and is a member of the Senate Committee on Finance.
