SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS CONTAINS IMPORTANT KANSAS PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is pleased to announce that late last night the Senate approved the Conference Report to accompany the Defense Appropriations bill containing important Kansas projects. 
   "I am proud of the contributions that Kansas makes to our national defense," Senator Roberts said. "These projects reflect my focus on modernizing and transforming our forces, and giving our men and women in uniform the necessary training and equipment to confront future threats, be they conventional or unconventional. This bill continues our efforts to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families."  
   Among the projects that benefit Kansas, Senator Roberts helped secure the following funds: 
   Fort Leavenworth 
   * $2.9 million for the Red Team Joint Open Source Intelligence Program at Fort Leavenworth. This program develops and maintains Open Source Intelligence training, databases, training doctrine and publications, processes and methodology, and force structure recommendations. 
   * $2.1 million for the Battle Command Team Training Program at Fort Leavenworth. This program grants unit commanders the ability to properly train critical battle staff techniques in preparation for combat operations. 
   McConnell AFB 
   * $5.6 million for additional equipment for the 161st Intelligence Squadron at McConnell Air Force Base. The procurement of this equipment will expand the ability of the 161st Intelligence Squadron in the Kansas Air National Guard to staff, train, and equip for critical UAV operations. 
   * $90.7 million for the KC-135 Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) program. These funds will be used to accelerate completion of the program. 
   * $1 million for Air National Guard Network Operations and Security Center. These funds are to complete enterprise-wide Information Assurance Certification & Accreditation at the Air National Guard Network Operations and Security Center at McConnell AFB. 
   Kansas State 
   * $2.6 million for Biosecurity Research for Soldier Food Safety. This is a collaborative project between U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center and KSU's Biosecurity Research Institute that develops technologies that rapidly and reliably detect food contaminants, ultimately having a positive impact on soldier health, performance, and effectiveness. 
   * $4.5 million for Armed Forces Medical and Food Research. This project develops capabilities to conduct threat and vulnerability analysis of medical and food processing and handling systems in a biocontainment laboratory environment using biological and chemical threat agents. 
   * $1.1 million for Neutralizing Facility Threats with Novel Technology. This project funds operationally oriented research, education, and testing to develop novel technology, and technology applications, including reactive nanoparticle, acoustic and other means to neutralize facility threats. 
   * $3.8 million for the Marine Corps Urban Operations Environmental Laboratory. These funds will provide expanded assessment, analysis, neutralization, and development of capabilities to ensure minimum environmental and collateral damage with nontraditional and traditional capabilities used in urban and other missions and activities wherever environmental impact is a concern. 
   University of Kansas 
   * $17.5 million for SensorNet, a chemical and biological agent sensor network. SensorNet supports the real-time detection, identification, and assessment of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats to the United States. The University of Kansas is contributing to the development of a rail test bed in Kansas City. 
   Pittsburgh State 
   * $1 million for Multifunctional Materials for Naval Structures at Pittsburgh State University. These funds are used to study radar transparent, flame retardant, corrosion resistant, impact resistant and self-repairing advanced structural materials at Pittsburgh State University. 
   Wichita State University 
   * $4.8 million for Aging Military Aircraft Fleet Support. This funds technical personnel, facilities and equipment to support and enhance the Department of Defense mission in maintaining the aging fleet of military aircraft. The Aging Aircraft Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State University is involved in several US Air Force programs, assisting with investigations for maintaining the structural integrity and airworthiness of several aging aircraft fleets. 
   * $1.1 million for the Next Generation Ice Protection System for UAV's. These funds will address current UAV in-flight, ice protection shortfalls. Research contributing to this project is conducted at Wichita State University. 
   * $500 thousand for Advanced Very Lightweight Avionics System for Airborne Platforms. These funds are to study advanced cooling and densification technologies for avionics systems. 
   * $1 million for Materials Integrity Management Research for Air Force Systems to develop sensors to be optimally placed so as to monitor the vehicle's health state via signal processing algorithms. The Air Force is leading the effort in developing this technology since running cabling inside an aircraft is costly, maintenance and labor intensive, and greatly increases the weight of the aircraft. 
   * $1 million for Infrared Countermeasures Electronics Improvement Program. These funds are for the development and deployment of the ICEIP program. ICEIP addresses the vulnerability of large, slow-flying military and commercial aircraft to shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. The ICEIP program will design and develop a proof of concept to rapidly demonstrate and field a commercially viable IRCM system that is lighter, more reliable, less expensive, reconfigurable and FAA certifiable. 
   Wichita 
   * $333.3 million for the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) for the Air Force. Raytheon Aircraft, Wichita, manufactures the JPATS aircraft (T-6A), utilized in the initial phase of military pilot training. 
   * $17 million for JPATS for the Navy. 
   * $580.6 million for UH-60 'Black Hawk' helicopters for the Army. Plastic Fabricating Company and Excel Manufacturing Company, Wichita, manufacture components for the UH-60 helicopter. 
   * $490.9 million for the Airborne Laser (ABL) Missile Defense System. Boeing conducts significant work on the ABL at their Wichita facility. 
   * $964 million for the Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA). Boeing is an important partner in the MMA program. 
   * $6 million for the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). Raytheon is an important partner in the CAP program, which is essential to our homeland security efforts. 
   Coffeyville, Kansas 
   * $3.5 million for the All Terrain Lifter Army System (ATLAS) for the Army Reserve. These funds will address a critical shortfall for the Army Reserve. A major component of ATLAS is produced by Funk manufacturing in Coffeyville, Kansas. 
   * $3.5 million for Army Reserve Motor Graders. A major component of the Motor Graders is produced by Funk manufacturing in Coffeyville, Kansas. 
   Other 
   * $8.5 million for the procurement of GL-1800AP Truck Mounted Aircraft Deicers for the Air Force. The equipment is provided by Global Ground Support of Olathe. 
   * $1 million for the Parents as Teachers program. The program provides assistance to military families by providing instructional assistance to parents of pre-school children. The program is currently in place at both Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth. 
   * $5 million for Impact Aid for Children with Disabilities.
   * $300,000 for the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps. 
   * $4.8 million for the Army Extended Range Attack Missile (AERAM). AERAM provides the Army with a capability to engage targets at 100+ kilometers. AERAM addresses the critical issue of a cost-effective, extended range capability to counter subsonic, low altitude airborne threats near term.
