SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE RENEWS HEAD START; MORE KANSAS CHILDREN ELIGIBLE UNDER NEW PLAN
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced that late last night, the Senate approved a bill to renew funding for Head Start including measures to expand eligibility to more Kansas children for the successful early childhood education program. 
   "I am pleased the Head Start bill strengthens accountability of the program, expands eligibility to more children, enhances teacher quality, and strengthens school readiness," Senator Roberts said. "We made sure that Head Start continues to be a vital stepping stone for our children and their families."
   The legislation allows a Head Start agency to increase income eligibility to 130 percent of the poverty level to expand the program to more children.
   The bill now goes to a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate bills.
   Earlier this year, Senator Roberts received the Kansas Head Start Association's "Kansas Legislative Champion for 2007" award.
   Kansas Head Start serves 8200 young children in 86 counties in Kansas.
