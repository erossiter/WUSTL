SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $695,800 GRANT TO RADIO HUTCHINSON COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced a $695,803 grant to Hutchinson Community College's Radio Kansas for a new transmission tower. 
   The funds will construct a new 1,300 foot transmission tower for KHCC-FM in Hutchinson. KHCC will no longer be able to use the current tower when the lease runs out in June 2008 due to digital conversion of the tower owner's station. This project was made available by the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program which supports public telecommunications services by providing matching grants to public facilities that deliver educational and cultural programs across the nation. The total cost of this project is $1,095,803. 
   The grant was awarded by the United States Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
