SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES: 'BIG RED ONE' FIRST INFANTRY DIVISION HEADS TO FT. RILEY: SEN. ROBERTS PLACES ARMY FLAG OUTSIDE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OFFICE
  Sen. Pat Roberts said today that the Department of Defense announced it will move the Army's First Infantry Division, known as "The Big Red One" to Ft.  
 Riley, Kansas in 2006. The Big Red One is the oldest continuously serving division in the Army. It is currently stationed in Germany. 
   "In May," Senator Roberts said, "When the BRAC recommendations were announced and Kansas discovered we would get a division headquarters, we thought this was the most likely outcome. Today, it is a reality. In looking forward, I have placed the Army flag next to the Kansas and American flags outside my Washington office. It will be there ready, holding the place for the division flag when it returns home to Kansas." 
   In addition, the Secretary of Defense's plan to restructure its global presence also includes placing three of the First Infantry Division's Brigade Combat Teams within the force structure at Ft. Riley. The three Brigade Combat Teams will consist of two heavy and one light brigade. 
   This action is in addition to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) recommendations to move supporting units and a Multi Functional Aviation Brigade to Ft. Riley. 
   Senator Roberts is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services. Since coming to the Senate in 1996, Senator Roberts has worked tirelessly on behalf of Kansas' military installations and their communities to see that the nation's men and women in uniform have a better quality of life and the tools to fulfill their mission to protect and defend the United States.
