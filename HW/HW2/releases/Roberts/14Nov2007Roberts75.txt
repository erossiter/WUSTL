SEN. ROBERTS DISAPPOINTED WITH FARM BILL INACTION
  Today, Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) issued the following statement regarding the Senate Farm Bill: 
   "I am disappointed that Senate consideration of the new Farm Bill has been blocked for more than a week since the Majority leadership used a parliamentary tactic to prohibit any additional amendments to the Farm Bill. This is not the way to run the Senate and our producers deserve better. I am frustrated with Senators blaming each other and putting politics before our farmers and ranchers.
   "I am afraid that such tactics will prohibit the Senate from passing a Farm Bill in a timely fashion, which makes financial and planting decisions difficult for our nation's farmers and ranchers. Kansas farmers already planted wheat without knowing what a new Farm Bill will look like, and it now appears we may not have a new Farm Bill in place before financing and planting decisions are made in the spring of 2008.
   "The Senate needs to complete a Farm Bill and I hope this standoff comes to an end soon. We still have a lot of work to do, and I plan to work with my colleagues to continue the fight to protect the programs in the Farm Bill that work for Kansas farmers and ranchers, including direct payments and crop insurance."
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and former Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.
