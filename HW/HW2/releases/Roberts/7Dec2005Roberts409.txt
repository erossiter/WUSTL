SEN. ROBERTS: MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN AT FT. LEAVENWORTH
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that the Army approved the Community Development and Management Plan of Michaels Military Housing (MMH), LLC, to begin improvements to family housing at Ft.  
 Leavenworth on March 1, 2006. MMH will be the Army's partner for privatized housing for the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) at the Fort. 
   "After working last year to raise the cap to allow additional Army military installations to take part in the RCI program, I am pleased to announce that Fort Leavenworth is on track and on schedule to receive new and improved family housing," Senator Roberts said. "These housing developments and renovations will play an important role as Congress works to improve the quality of life for our nation's men and women in uniform, and their families." 
   The Community Development Management Plan represents $1.19 billion investment in base housing over the life of the 50-year contract. The plan includes construction of 708 new housing units to be built in two years among other improvements to the base. 
   RCI is the Army's program to alleviate housing shortages and eliminate sub-standard military housing by using private sector expertise to privatize family housing at Army installations located throughout the nation. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services.
