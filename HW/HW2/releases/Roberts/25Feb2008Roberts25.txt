SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $38,000 TO OSAGE COUNTY FOR DISASTER RECOVERY
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced Osage County will receive $38,000 for disaster flood recovery efforts. 
   "I am pleased USDA has designated these important funds for Osage County," Senator Roberts said. "Last year's flood left a drastic impact on our farmers and ranchers in this area and this program will now aid in the recovery."
   The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency (FSA) under the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP). This program gives producers additional resources to remove debris from farmland, restore fences and conservation structures, provide water for livestock in drought situation and grade and shape farmland damaged by a natural disaster. USDA Farm Service Agency state and county committees administer ECP.
   Producers should check with their local FSA offices regarding sign-up periods, which are set by FSA county committees. For more information visit: http://www.fsa.usda.gov .
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
