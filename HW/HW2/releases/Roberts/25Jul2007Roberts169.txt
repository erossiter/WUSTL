SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $200,000 GRANT FOR DRUG PREVENTION, ENFORCEMENT
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $200,000 grant to the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City for drug prevention and enforcement. 
   The grant will help law enforcement to focus on decreasing the number of street-level illegal drug sales and decrease the overall amount of violence in the area. Some of the community police goals include increasing the number of interactions between the police, residents and other stakeholders in the area with prevention, intervention, and treatment goals through workshops. Another effort will be to improve the appearance of the neighborhood through an aggressive reinvestment plan.
   The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Justice's Community Capacity Development Office for the Weed and Seed Program Guide and Application Kit Program.
