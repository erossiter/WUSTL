SEN. ROBERTS DISCUSSES SALINA REMEDIATION WITH COL. ROSSI OF ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today met with Kansas City District Commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, Colonel Mike Rossi, to discuss the ongoing cleanup at the former site of the Schilling Air Force Base. 
   Senator Roberts said, "Col. Rossi and I had a frank conversation about that status of investigation and clean up efforts at the former base. We both agree that our top concern is the health and well-being of the people living and working in the Salina area."
   During the meeting Senator Roberts and Col. Rossi discussed various projects throughout the state, but discussions focused on the situation in Salina. At issue is the investigation and remediation of potential contamination of the city's groundwater.
   "I was pleased to learn that the Corps has committed additional staff to manage the project and has accelerated the time frame for investigation. In addition, Col. Rossi assured me that the Corps has taken steps towards greater collaboration and transparency with local officials and community leaders.
   "I am encouraged by Col. Rossi's pledge to work in the best interests of the people of Salina. I understand the recent meeting with Salina community leaders and Col. Rossi was considered productive. I will closely monitor the situation in continuing discussions with the community."
