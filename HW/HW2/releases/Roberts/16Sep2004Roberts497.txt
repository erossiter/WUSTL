SEN. ROBERTS WANTS TO SIMPLIFY FILING TAXES FOR KANSAS SENIORS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today called for an easier, less complicated process for Kansas seniors when filing federal taxes.  
   Roberts has cosponsored the Simple Tax for Seniors Act (S. 2502), introduced by Sen. Larry Craig (R-ID). The bill would reduce paperwork by combining regular filing through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and retirement income filing. It will save seniors, time, effort and confusion, while saving the IRS money on administering the tax system. 
   "This is an example of how we can make government more efficient and less taxing on our citizens, and I fully support it," Senator Roberts said. "Restoring common sense to our tax policy is what Kansans expect." 
   This bill creates a new IRS form for seniors, 1040S, that is similar to the current IRS form with a line for seniors to report retirement income. Currently there are 35 million seniors that file the standard form, but cannot file the simpler IRS form because there is no line on that form for seniors to report their retirement income. This bill would allow for that, and would save time for seniors and the IRS. 
   This bill makes no changes to the current tax code, and all these simplifications are at no additional cost to the IRS, which makes the bill budget neutral. When implemented, the bill would reduce the IRS's processing costs buy cutting down on the number of forms submitted. Over 11 million seniors would be eligible to file this new, simpler form. 
   The legislation was referred to the Senate Finance Committee. A similar bill in the House of Representatives, H.R. 4109, passed the House in June by a vote of 418-0.
