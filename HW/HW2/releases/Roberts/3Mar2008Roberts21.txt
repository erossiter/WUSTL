SENS. ROBERTS, BROWNBACK REP. TIAHRT DEMANDED ANSWERS FROM AIR FORCE REGARDING TANKER CONTRACT
  Today, Senators Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback and Congressman Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) demanded answers from the Air Force regarding the recent Tanker contract announcement. Senators Roberts and Brownback and Rep. Tiahrt said: 
   "This afternoon, we conveyed to the Air Force our shock and disappointment of the recent Tanker bid being awarded to Airbus as opposed to a reliable and experienced U.S. company. We have just met with the Air Force and we remain unconvinced that the Airbus team will provide a better aircraft than the men and women of Boeing.
   "In the coming weeks, we want answers from the Air Force to our questions including: Why are we sending these jobs overseas when Boeing has a proven record of building Tankers? Why did the Air Force choose a less-efficient aircraft that is harder to maneuver? Why did the Air Force award this contract to a company that has never built a Tanker in its history? Why would the Air Force outsource a contract so critical to the security of our nation to a foreign company that is highly subsidized by European governments?
   "The right decision could have brought up to 1000 jobs to the Wichita area. We will continue to question the Air Force and support Boeing Wichita. As of today, the Air Force has delayed giving their explanation and important details to Boeing - this does not make sense and neither does the Air Force's decision.
   "As Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray (D-WA) said, 'This is a blow to the American aerospace industry, American workers and America's men and women in uniform. We will be asking tough questions about the decision to outsource this contract. We look forward to hearing the Air Force's justification.'"
