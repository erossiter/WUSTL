SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BILL; CONTAINS IMPORTANT KANSAS PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, today announced the Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report containing many construction projects important to Kansas. 
  "I am pleased the Senate has acted quickly to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families especially during this time of war when so many are making the ultimate sacrifice for our nation," Senator Roberts said. "These projects in Kansas reflect our commitment to provide our military with the best facilities to carry out their mission and to raise their families."
