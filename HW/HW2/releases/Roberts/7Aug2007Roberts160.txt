SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR EXPANDED FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE FOR INJURED SERVICEMEMBERS
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts announced that late last week, the Senate approved an amendment he supported to expand Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) for servicemembers injured in combat and their families. Senator Roberts was an original cosponsor of the amendment which passed the Senate as part of the State Child Health Insurance Plan reauthorization bill. 
   "For those that have already sacrificed so much for our country," Senator Roberts said. "It is only right to protect their jobs while they provide care or heal from wounds sustained in the defense of freedom."
   The bipartisan amendment, introduced by Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), expands FMLA coverage from the previos12 weeks to 26 weeks over a 12 month period. The leave is also expanded to include not only injured veterans and their spouse, child, or parent, but also their next of kin.
   Other provisions of the bill include:
   * Employees may elect, or an employer may require the employee, to substitute accrued annual, personal, or sick leave for coverage provided in this act; 
   * Both husband and wife are entitled to the 26 weeks/12 month period; 
   * Defines next of kin as the closest blood relative capable of acting as the "primary care giver" when the veteran is absent a capable spouse, parent, or child. 
   The bill now goes to a conference committee to resolve differences with the House passed version of the bill.
   Senator Roberts, a former Marine, is an outspoken advocate for the nation's men and women in uniform and their families.
