SEN. ROBERTS TO WELCOME FANS TO KANSAS SPEEDWAY
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts will officially welcome fans at the pre-race ceremonies this Sunday at the Kansas Speedway's "Chase for the NASCAR Nextel Cup" starting at Noon Central. 
   "I am pleased to welcome fans to Kansas for the Lifelock 400 this weekend," Senator Roberts said. "This race brings fans from all over the country to Kansas City. I commend the Kansas Speedway and all the local economic development leaders here in western Wyandotte County for all they have done for this area and its explosion of new business and tourism. This area serves as a model for our state's economy and tourism industry leaders. 
   "Kansans should be proud of the Kansas Speedway and all the support it has driven. I am particularly proud of Kansas native Clint Bowyer from Emporia, who is one of the drivers competing this weekend. Best of luck to all the drivers."
   On a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race weekend, the Kansas Speedway becomes the fourth-largest city in the state of Kansas. It is considered one of the top tourist destinations in the Midwest. Since its inaugural season in 2001, the Kansas Speedway has been a catalyst for economic development in Wyandotte County. 
   The 1.5 mile major motorsports facility hosts NASCAR Nextel Cup, Busch, Craftsman Truck, and Indy Racing Events. The tri-oval track has seating for nearly 100,000. The track also has driving schools, custom car shows, national barbecue contests, and hosts numerous other events throughout the year.
