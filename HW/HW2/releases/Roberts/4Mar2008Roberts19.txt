SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $2.3 MILLION FOR FT. RILEY VETERANS CEMETERY
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts today announced a $2.3 million grant to establish the Kansas Veterans' Cemetery at Fort Riley in Manhattan. 
   "I am pleased the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the completion of this important grant," Senator Roberts said. "We truly owe our military members a debt of gratitude and for those who pay the ultimate sacrifice, this is an honor that our country should provide."
   The grant covers costs of cemetery infrastructure, including administration and maintenance buildings, roads, utilities, landscaping and irrigation, a memorial walkway, an assembly area and a committal service shelter. The new cemetery will serve more than 30,000 veterans and their family members living in the area.
   This is the second part of the grant totaling $6.7 million. This grant covers 100 percent of the allowable costs to build the new 90-acre cemetery in the central part of Kansas. The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Senator Roberts is a former Marine and an outspoken advocate for our nation's veterans.
