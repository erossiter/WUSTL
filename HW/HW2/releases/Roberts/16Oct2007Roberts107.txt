SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES STATE, JUSTICE, COMMERCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced that the Senate passed the appropriations bill for the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce and Related Agencies for Fiscal Year 2008 containing an important investment in rural Kansas. 
   "I am pleased the Senate has acted to make investments in law enforcement and terrorism in rural Kansas," Senator Roberts said.
   The following project Senator Roberts personally worked to include in the legislation:
  * $350,000 for the Ford County Sheriff's Office in Dodge City for addressing and preventing terror risks in rural areas.
   "I am very proud of the work that Ford County Sheriff Dean Bush, Undersheriff James Lane, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) and Kansas State University have done on this issue in the past. More still needs to be done and these funds will address and prevent future risks in rural Kansas."
   Undersheriff James Lane testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee on this issue in July 2005. 
   The bill now goes to a conference committee with the House of Representatives.
