SEN. ROBERTS: DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION PASSES SENATE, CONTAINS IMPORTANT KANSAS PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today announced that late last night, the Senate passed the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2005 with projects important to Kansas totaling nearly $1 billion.  
   "I am proud of the contributions that Kansas makes to our national defense," Senator Roberts said. "These projects reflect my focus on modernizing and transforming our forces confronting future threats be they conventional or unconventional. This bill continues our efforts to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families." 
   The bill now goes before a Conference Committee to iron out differences between the House and Senate bills.
