SEN. ROBERTS: FEMA TO COVER 100 PERCENT OF MAY 4 STORM EMERGENCY COSTS, DEBRIS REMOVAL INCURRED IN FIRST 72 HOURS
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will reimburse funds used for debris removal and emergency protective measures at 100 percent of the total eligible costs incurred for a period of up to 72 hours in counties declared Federal Disaster Areas following the May 4 storms. FEMA usually reimburses expenses up to 75 percent. 
   This announcement follows a letter the entire Kansas congressional delegation sent to the President in May calling for 100 percent reimbursement of costs to residents of counties declared Federal Disaster Areas.
   "I am pleased FEMA has provided aid for the immediate and crucial clean up following the storms of May 4," Senator Roberts said. "Money and resources spent in the first 72 hours are critical to saving lives and protecting what little the storms left behind. This investment is a real boost to public facilties so that they can rebuild and restore their resources to protect against the next emergency."
