SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today released the names of the young Kansans who will receive his nomination for appointments to U.S. Service Academies. 
  "I am very pleased to announce this year's nominees," Sen. Roberts said. "These men and women are outstanding representatives of Kansas in every way." 
   In making the nominations, Senator Roberts followed the recommendations of his Academy Screening Board. The nonpartisan Board is comprised of eight volunteers from across Kansas and is overseen by Karin Wisdom, Senator Roberts' District Director in Wichita. As part of the decision-making process, board members conduct personal interviews with the applicants, as well as review their written applications, G.P.A, and standardized test scores.
   Once nominated by Senator Roberts, the applicants then must meet the individual admission requirements of each academy. The academies will make the final decision on who will receive an appointment of admission. Due to the limited number of openings at each academy, not every nominee will receive an appointment. The academies this spring will announce appointments for the class entering in June 2005. Senator Roberts' nominees are as follows: 
   * Air Force Academy (Colorado Springs, CO)
   Tyner Apt - Iola
