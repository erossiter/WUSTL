SEN. ROBERTS RECEIVES U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE'S SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE AWARD
  Sen. Pat Roberts today received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Spirit of Enterprise Award for his strong support of pro-business legislation in 2004.  
   The Chamber awards the "Spirit of Enterprise" based on rankings it gives members of Congress for key business votes explained in its annual publication, How They Voted. Senator Roberts earned a 100 percent score with the Chamber last year. Senator Roberts' service to Kansas since 1980 includes a well-establish record as an advocate for small business. He has compiled a 93 percent cumulative ranking during his time in Congress. Key votes for 2004 included medical liability reform, the U.S.-Australia free trade agreement, pension reform and tax relief. 
   "I am honored to receive this award from the Chamber. I always try to back legislation that will help create jobs, increase productivity and strengthen the economy in Kansas," Senator Roberts said. 
   Chamber-designated "key votes" are recorded floor votes on issues established as priorities by the Chamber's board of directors and on which the Chamber communicates its position prior to the vote. Members of Congress who support the Chamber's position on at least 70 percent of key votes receive the "Spirit of Enterprise" award. 
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business federation, representing more than three million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and region. Further information on the U.S. Chamber ratings is available online at: www.uschamber.com.
