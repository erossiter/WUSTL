SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMMIGRATION BILL PROPOSAL
  In voting against the motion to proceed to debate on the Immigration Reform Bill, S. 1348, Sen. Pat Roberts today released the following statement: 
   "In dealing with immigration reform, the Senate has repeated the mistake of the last session - a closed-door deal without committee hearings, informing Senators and staff of last minute details just before a vote, and a threat by the Senate Majority Leader that the closed-door deal by a handful of Senators was the only option or the Senate would reconsider last session's failed bill.
   "I oppose this bill. I oppose it because it includes amnesty and rewards immigrants for illegal conduct. I oppose it because there is no reliable cost estimate. I oppose it because the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration lacks resources and management to make the so-called reforms work and would be overwhelmed with a monumental workload increase.
   "I oppose it because I believe it to be unworkable, impractical and most of all because, once again, this was a back room deal and in shutting out many Senators of one of the most important issues of our time has been subjugated to politics and unworkable compromise."
