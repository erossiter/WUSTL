SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $775,400 IN GRANTS TO THREE KANSAS UNIVERSITIES
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced three grants totaling $775,400 to the University of Kansas, Kansas State University and Wichita State University for the McNair Scholar Program. These grants will help students prepare for graduate school. 
   * $271,300 to the University of Kansas
   * $252,000 to Kansas State University
   * $252,000 to Wichita State University
   The funds will be awarded to undergraduate students who have been academically successful and who are dedicated to attending graduate school. The McNair Scholars Program targets high-achieving undergraduate students that are first-generation college students or from socio-economic groups which are underrepresented in graduate programs in order to encourage and prepare them to enter graduate school. The program is the namesake of Dr. Ronald E. McNair, the African-American astronaut who was tragically killed in the 1986 Challenger space shuttle explosion.
   The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Education's Ronald E. McNair Scholar Program. Senator Roberts is a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
