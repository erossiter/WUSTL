SEN. ROBERTS: USDA EXTENDS EMERGENCY GRAZING OF CRP LANDS TO NOV. 10
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry, today announced USDA will extend emergency grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acreage to November 10, 2006, beyond the previous deadline of September 30.  
   CRP rental payments will also be reduced by only 10 percent instead of the standard 25 percent on CRP lands grazed in 2006. 
   Senator Roberts said, "I am pleased USDA continues to look for ways to help producers suffering from drought. However, I remain disappointed that additional Kansas counties have not been approved for this emergency designation. Many Kansas producers continue to struggle to meet their feed needs in counties that have not been granted this designation. I will continue my efforts to work with USDA on this front. In addition, I am committed to working to pass a disaster package this year. Several of my colleagues have introduced disaster proposals, and together, we will try and get a package that can be supported in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. When a disaster package is offered on the Senate floor, you have my assurances that I'll support it."
