SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES CRITICAL $1.5 BILLION INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR VETERANS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today supported a critical amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill passed by the Senate to correct a $1.5 billion shortfall in veterans' health care services.  
   "At a time when our nation's men and women in uniform are making huge sacrifices to fight and win the war on terror," Senator Roberts said, "it is our duty to ensure that when they return, there are services to take care of their medical needs. I am pleased the Senate has acted immediately in a bipartisan way to ensure that there is no gap in assistance." 
   At issue were internal accounting errors made by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs that would have created a $1.5 billion shortfall for resources to address the health care needs of more than 100,000 soldiers returning from deployments overseas. 
   The Interior Appropriations Bill now goes to a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation. 
   Senator Roberts is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a senior Member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services. Since coming to the Senate in 1997, Senator Roberts, a former Marine, has worked tirelessly on behalf of the nation's men and women in uniform to ensure they have a better quality of life and the tools to fulfill their mission to protect and defend the United States.
