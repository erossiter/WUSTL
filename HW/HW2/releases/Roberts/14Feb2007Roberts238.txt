SEN. ROBERTS: HELP COMMITTEE APPROVES HEAD START, MENTAL HEALTH PARITY BILLS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the important Head Start early education program and a bill granting mental health parity in insurance coverage. Both bills were approved by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, of which Roberts is a member. 
   "I am pleased the Head Start bill strengthens accountability of the program, expands eligibility to more children, enhances teacher quality, and strengthens school readiness," Senator Roberts said. "We made sure that Head Start continues to be a vital stepping stone for our children and their families."
   The Head Start bill, S. 556, is similar to legislation approved by the Committee and supported by Senator Roberts last year. The bill now goes to the full Senate for a debate and vote. 
   The Mental Health Parity Act, S. 558, requires equal health insurance coverage of financial requirements for both mental health benefits and medical or surgical benefits, unless comparable limitations are imposed on medical and surgical benefits. These financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, out-of-pocket expenses and annual and lifetime limits. The new requirements apply to group health plans with 50 or more employees.
   "It is time we address the disparity between mental health care and medical care," Senator Roberts said. "People requiring mental health care need the same protections, care and understanding as those individuals suffering from physical illnesses. I am confident that this proposal, which, has the support of employers, insurance companies and mental health providers, is a step in the right direction."
