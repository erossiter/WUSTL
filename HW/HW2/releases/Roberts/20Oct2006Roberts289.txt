SEN. ROBERTS TO HOST SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION VISIT TO WICHITA
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced he will host the new Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Mary Peters, in Wichita on Monday, October 30.  
   Senator Roberts made the following statement:
   "Just a month ago, I met with Secretary Peters as part of her confirmation process. We discussed a wide-range of transportation issues important to Kansas including my strong support for the General Aviation community.
   "In Wichita and the surrounding counties about 40,000 employees make their living building planes, manufacturing parts or servicing the aviation industry. Secretary Peters comes to the USDOT at an important time. Next year Congress will renew the Federal Aviation Administration's authority and will examine how the Air Traffic Control system is funded. In our meeting, I strongly encouraged Ms. Peters to consider the effects any policy change would have on the General Aviation community and to work with them to develop a fair and efficient proposal.
   "Secretary Peters, who was sworn in just two weeks ago, is certainly honoring her commitment to begin a dialogue with the General Aviation community by visiting Wichita very early in her tenure. I am confident the Secretary will leave Wichita understanding why it is the 'Air Capital of the World' and greatly appreciate her efforts to put a Kansas visit on her calendar so quickly.
   Details for the Secretary's visit are in the early planning stages. The United States Department of Transportation will release specific information about the Secretary's visit late next week.
