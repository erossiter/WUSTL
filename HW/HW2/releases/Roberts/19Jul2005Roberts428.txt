SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR MORE BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FUNDING
  Sen. Pat Roberts today called for more breast cancer research funding by co-sponsoring legislation to continue the Breast Cancer Research special postage stamp.  
   "I believe that research is a critical component to beating disease. Through past investments in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we have made great strides in better identifying and treating numerous forms of cancer," Senator Roberts said. "This bill is way for the public to do its part by purchasing these special stamps to promote research." 
   If passed again, the United States Postal Service will continue to establish a special rate of postage for the Breast Cancer Research stamp. It allows the public to make a convenient, voluntary contribution to the funding of breast cancer research. The bill, S. 37, was introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX). It has been referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees. 
   As a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Roberts is an outspoken advocate for investments in research and research infrastructure.
