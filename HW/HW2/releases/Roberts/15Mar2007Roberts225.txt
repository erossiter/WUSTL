SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR BREAST, CERVICAL CANCER EARLY DETECTION
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) today voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the important National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. 
   The bill, S. 624, was introduced by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and was approved today by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), of which Roberts is a member.
   "I believe that early detection is a critical component to beating cancer," Senator Roberts said. "Through past investments we have made great strides in better identifying and treating numerous forms of cancer and the passage of this bill will increase that effort." 
   The National Breast and Cervical Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) is a federal and state funded program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It provides free or low-cost mammograms and Pap tests for low-income, uninsured or underinsured women. All fifty states have a program in place. The bill also increases the authorized funding level each year until $275 million is reached in 2012. 
   According to the American Cancer Society, this year 212, 920 new cases of breast cancer and 9,710 cases of cervical cancer are expected to be diagnosed. When detected early, the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is 97 percent and for cervical cancer it is 92 percent. 
   "Early detection works," Senator Roberts said. "This program has already increased screening and I commend the HELP Committee for approving the reauthorization of this important program."
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
