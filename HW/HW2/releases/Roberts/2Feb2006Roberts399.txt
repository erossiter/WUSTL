SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING INTEL COMMITTEE'S OPEN WORLD-WIDE THREAT HEARING
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today made the following remarks after the Committee's open hearing on world-wide threats to the United States: 
   Senator Roberts said, "Today's hearing was an opportunity for members of the Intelligence Committee to discuss the threats we face by terrorists, narcotraffickers, and weapons proliferators. We had excellent testimony from the Intelligence Community with regard to this goal. 
   "However, I am concerned that some of my Democrat colleagues used this unique public forum to make clear that they believe the gravest threat we face is not Usama bin Ladin and al Qaida, but rather the President of the United States. 
   "There is no doubt in my mind there are marching orders to the minority members of this Committee to question and attack, at every opportunity, the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, Attorney General and now members of our intelligence agencies. 
   "We will now move to a closed session with the hope the committee can focus on world-wide threats, what the Intelligence Community is doing to prevent them, and what the Committee can do to ensure continued reform to obtain the best intelligence possible for the American people."
