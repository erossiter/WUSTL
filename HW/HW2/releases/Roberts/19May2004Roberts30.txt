SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE PASSES CHILD NUTRITION BILL
  Sen. Pat Roberts and the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee voted today to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Bill. 
   The Child Nutrition Bill renews the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs, the Women Infants and Children Special Supplementary program (WIC), and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). These programs provide children with increased access to food and nutrition assistance. The bill will help to simplify program operations and improve program management.
   In Kansas, 500,000 children are eligible for the school lunch program. On average 91,000 free lunches are given to Kansas students. The bill was passed by the Senate Agriculture Committee, and next will go to the Senate for a full vote.
   Senator Roberts said, "This legislation takes an important step in supporting hard-working families who are having trouble making ends meet. Many families face financial hardships in paying for school meals, and reauthorizing these programs will help provide needed assistance. Families should not worry whether or not they can afford school lunches or breakfasts for their children. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee as the child nutrition reauthorization moves forward."
   Senator Roberts is a key member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee and is a long supporter of the school lunch and breakfast programs.
