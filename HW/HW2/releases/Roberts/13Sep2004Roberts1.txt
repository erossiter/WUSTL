SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR INVESTMENT IN RURAL KANSAS WITH TAX RELIEF FOR PRODUCERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today called for greater economic investment in rural communities through tax relief opportunities for farmers and ranchers by sponsoring The Heartland Investment and Rural Employment Act.  
   "We need to give farmers and ranchers, our main economic engines of rural America, the tools to save and re-invest in their communities and operations," Sen. Roberts said. "These tax provisions can go a long way in covering the producers in the lean years by allowing them to bolster their own bottom line. This investment benefits the entire rural Kansas community." 
   The bi-partisan Heartland Investment and Rural Employment Act contains tax relief initiatives Senator Roberts has supported in the past. The legislation would: 
   * Create Farm, Fish, and Ranch Risk Management (FFARM) Accounts, in which farmers would be allowed to deposit up to 20 percent of their income in tax-deferred accounts for use during lean years; 
   * Coordinate farmer and fishermen income averaging and the alternative minimum tax (AMT) to reduce the number of producers and other small business owners adversely affected by AMT; 
   * Establish a tax deduction for farmers and ranchers who donate food inventories to food banks; 
   * Clarify that income from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) should not be subject to Social Security self-employment taxes; 
   * Clarify circumstances when rental income is excluded from Social Security self-employment taxes; 
   * Exempt agricultural bonds from private activity bond volume caps. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry. He is a strong supporter of rural development and the need to preserve the rural way of life.
