SEN. ROBERTS' AGRICULTURE MEDIATION BILL TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW; CONTINUES VITAL PROGRAMS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that legislation he authored to continue critical agriculture mediation programs passed the House on Tuesday and now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law.  
   "The mediation programs at the Department of Agriculture go a long way in helping our farmers and ranchers seek confidential advice and counsel to address loan problems and disputes before they grow to be too much for the producer too handle," Senator Roberts said. 
   The legislation will continue to authorize funding of the Certified State Agriculture Mediation Program for five years. 
   Mediation provides a neutral, confidential forum to discuss complex issues and build strong working relationships with producers, their lenders and government agencies. The programs address issues in a confidential and non-adversarial setting outside the traditional legal process of foreclosure, bankruptcy, appeals and litigation. 
   Since the program was reauthorized in 2000, seven more states have implemented a USDA Certified State Agricultural Mediation Program, bringing the total to 32 states, a growth of nearly 30 percent. The number of mediation clients nationwide has increased from approximately 3,300 in Fiscal Year 2001 to more than 4,600 in Fiscal Year 2004. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
