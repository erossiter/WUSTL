SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $6.7 MILLION IN GRANTS FOR HEAD START IN KANSAS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced over $6.7 million in grants for Head Start projects in Kansas City, Salina, and Wichita. 
   The funds allow the Head Start program to operate childcare centers, as well provide training for childcare providers and teachers to become Head Start educators. Head Start programs serve preschool-aged children and their families in low-income areas.
   * Kansas City, KS: $2.3 million for Economic Opportunity Foundation, Inc. 
   * Salina: $1.1 million for Salina Unified School District #305 
   * Wichita: $2 million for Child Care Association of Wichita/Sedgwick County and $1.2 million for Kansas Children's Service League 
   Senator Roberts said, "I have had the opportunity to see firsthand the great strides Head Start is making in Kansas communities. Head Start, as the name suggests, enables children in need to learn the basic life and social skills to enter school ready to learn. The program, which serves children all over Kansas, provides them with a stable, encouraging environment that allows them to learn, have fun, be nourished - and nurtured. This is particularly invaluable for a child that may not have the same environment at home."
   The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Children and Families. Senator Roberts is a key member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and has been a strong advocate of Head Start.
