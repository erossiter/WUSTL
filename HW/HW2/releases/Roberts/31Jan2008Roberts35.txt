SEN. ROBERTS: EXTEND GI BILL EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS TO MILITARY SPOUSES AND CHILDREN
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts, a former Marine, today helped introduce legislation to allow service members the ability to transfer earned Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits to their spouses and children. 
   "This is the least we can do for our brave men and women in uniform and their families to thank them for their sacrifice and service to our nation," Senator Roberts said. "The legislation will enable soldiers to make full use of this benefit by transferring it to their immediate family."
   Under current law, G.I. Bill funds can be transferred only if a service member has a critical skill, a designation that is made by each service that is subject to change. Additionally, current law limits this small percentage of service members to transfer only 18 months of education benefits even though the soldiers can earn up to 36 months of benefits equivalent to four years of college tuition.
   The legislation, introduced by a group of bipartisan Senators including Roberts and led by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), removes these limitations and immediately allows service members who are eligible for the G.I. Bill to transfer their earned educational funds to spouses or children.
   Those entering the military usually buy their way into the Montgomery GI Bill. It generally covers 36 months of education at a value of about $40,000. Today, 97 percent enroll, but only 70 percent actually use the benefit, with very few using all of it. The legislation will enable soldiers to make full use of this earned benefit by transferring it to an immediate family member.
   The bill, S. 2575, entitled the Montgomery GI Bill Educational Assistance Transferability Act of 2008, was referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services.
   Senator Roberts is an outspoken advocate men and women in uniform and their families.
