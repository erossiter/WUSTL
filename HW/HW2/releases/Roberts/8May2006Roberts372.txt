SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GEN. HAYDEN TO BE DIRECTOR OF CIA
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today made the following statement on the nomination of General Hayden to be the Director of CIA:  
   "General Hayden has extensive experience in the Intelligence Community. Throughout his career he has had success in the Air Force, at the National Security Agency and as Deputy Director of National Intelligence. While I am not opposed to his nomination, Senators, including myself, will have important questions which they will want addressed prior to any confirmation vote. 
   "The Committee will follow its normal confirmation process. At the same time the Committee will continue its work on other high priority oversight issues, including consideration of the Fiscal Year 2007 Intelligence Authorization Bill. The Authorization Bill is of particular importance in that the Senate was unable to pass a bill last year. Given this and other priorities, the Committee will do everything in its power to consider the Hayden nomination as expeditiously as possible. In speaking with General Hayden today, I told him it would be my hope to schedule a hearing as soon as possible.
   "I look forward to working with General Hayden, the Administration and my Senate colleagues to move this important nomination. We need to make sure that the next CIA Director provides the long term direction and leadership which the Agency so critically needs."
