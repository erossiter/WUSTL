SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts, a former Marine, today released the following statement in recognition of Veteran's Day: 
   "As we observe Veterans Day, our nation should be reminded of what it means to be a free people. Our inherent rights are protected by the men and women who have worn and are wearing our uniform. Many have given their full measure in the protection of our freedom. All have sacrificed.
   "'Hero' is a term that is often tossed about without too much thought. It's often overused and generously applied.
   "But, the word 'hero' is the most accurate reflection of the men and women, past and present, who have served in defense of this nation. These brave men and women have earned our highest respect and gratitude for their willingness to face threats to our liberty and preserve our freedom and way of life.
   "Heros are not merely characters in movies or books. They are real live people who have sacrificed by answering the call to duty - separated from their families, their lives disrupted for months and even years at a time. Many have suffered wounds - some obvious to the eye, some hidden beneath the surface. That is honor. They are heros. We are humbled by their sacrifice on this Veterans Day.
   "So, on November 11 and everyday, let us give heartfelt thanks to our brave veterans for their service and sacrifice. From this former veteran Marine, Semper fidelis - always faithful."
