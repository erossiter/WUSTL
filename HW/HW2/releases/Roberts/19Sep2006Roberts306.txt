They will provide in-service activities for teachers, administrators, and other school personnel. The goal of this program is to prevent youth crime, violence and gang involvement among school-aged youth, and to create safer schools and communities.
   Senator Roberts said, "I am pleased to announce these funds for the Wichita Police Department. It is important to use our highly skilled police officers to assist in the education and protection of our children."
