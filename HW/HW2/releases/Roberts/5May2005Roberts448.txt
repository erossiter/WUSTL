SEN. ROBERTS: MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING IMPROVEMENTS TO BEGIN AT FT. RILEY
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that the Army selected Picerne Military Housing, LLC, of Rhode Island, to begin improvements to family housing at Ft. Riley.  
 Picerne will be the Army's new partner for privatized housing for the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) at the Fort. 
   "After working last year to raise the cap to allow additional Army military installations to take part in the RCI program, I am pleased with the Army's announcement today that Fort Riley is on track and on schedule to receive new and improved family housing," Senator Roberts said. "These housing developments and renovations will play an important role as Congress works to improve the quality of life for our nation's men and women in uniform, and their families." 
   RCI is the Army's program to alleviate housing shortages and eliminate sub-standard military housing by using private sector expertise to privatize family housing at Army installations located throughout the nation. The next step will be for Picerne to partner with the Army for the next six months to develop a Community Development Management Plan, which will serve as the blueprint for the Army's residential communities plan at Fort Riley. All 3,052 Army military family housing units at Fort Riley will be transferred to Picerne. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services.
