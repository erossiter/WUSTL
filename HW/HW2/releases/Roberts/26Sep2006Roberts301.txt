SEN. ROBERTS: RELEASE OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON GLOBAL TERRORISM GOOD FOR PUBLIC
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today released the following statement: 
   "I am pleased the Administration agreed, as I have urged, to declassify the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) concerning Trends in Global Terrorism. It is important for the American people to put the findings in the proper perspective so that they can understand the full context of the NIE without the interference of partisan politics. In looking at this particular NIE, I believe it can be released without jeopardizing intelligence sources and methods.
   "I look forward to the American people seeing the NIE's judgments for themselves later today and deciding for themselves what they mean."
