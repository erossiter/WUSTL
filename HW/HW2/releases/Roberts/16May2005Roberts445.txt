SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today issued the following statement on federal judicial appointments:  
   "I have long supported Majority Leader Frist's efforts to ensure every Senator is given the opportunity to vote in support of or in opposition to a given nominee," Roberts said, "This would simply be a return to more than 200 years of precedent in which a simple majority would be required for approval of judicial nominations. 
   "President Bush has nominated many qualified jurists to fill vacancies throughout the nation's judicial districts. Each nominee has received approval from the American Bar Association as well as support from some of the most prominent legal scholars in the country." 
   "Unfortunately, the partisan environment that has existed since 2003 in regard to judicial nominations has prevented the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to advise and consent on all qualified nominees. Filibusters by some in the minority have prevented up-or-down votes on nearly a dozen nominees. Unable to muster 60 votes necessary to stop the filibuster, the Senate has been unable to consider these key nominations. 
   "My hope is that Senate leaders can work something out and end the stalemate that has denied President Bush's judicial nominees an up-or-down vote. But if that's not the case, as I have stated, I would vote with Majority Leader Frist to end the judicial filibuster."
