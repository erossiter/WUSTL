CHAIRMAN ROBERTS, VICE CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER ISSUE JOINT STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF CIA DIRECTOR TENET
  Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Vice Chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today issued the following statement: 
   "Director Tenet has devoted his entire career to the cause of making America safe. In both Congress and the Executive Branch, for both Democratic and Republican administrations, he has tirelessly worked to modernize our intelligence community to meet the national security challenges of the 21st century. There are few jobs as demanding as that of Director of Central Intelligence. For many years George Tenet has displayed the will and tenacity needed to focus the capabilities of the intelligence community in our global war against terrorism.
   "His tenure at the Central Intelligence Agency provided much-needed stability and leadership to an agency largely adrift. George Tenet was a staunch supporter of the intelligence mission and the people who carry it out. He is well respected within the halls of our intelligence agencies and he will be sorely missed by those he led for over seven years. While he steps down during a period of controversy over events leading up the attacks of 9/11 and the quality of intelligence prior to the Iraq War, we should not lose sight of a simple truth: George Tenet has served his country with distinction and honor during difficult and demanding times.
   "We wish him well. We will continue to work closely with the Intelligence Community during this period of transition."
