SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR INCREASE IN FUNDS FOR SMALL COMMUNITY AIR SERVICE PROGRAMS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today called for an increase in federal funding for the Essential Air Service program to provide greater access to critical air service in rural areas.  
 The Essential Air Service (EAS) program serves the following communities in Kansas: Dodge City, Garden City, Great Bend, Hays, Liberal, Salina and Manhattan.
   "I am a long time supporter of the EAS program which provides critical air service to Kansas' small community airports," Senator Roberts said. "Air Service in rural areas is not simply a luxury, it is imperative. I am hopeful we will increase this funding level, especially in light of our nation's air service needs."
   Senator Roberts joined Senators Snow (R-ME), Lott (R-MS), Inhofe (R-OK), and Collins (R-ME) in signing a letter to Senators Richard Shelby (R-AL) and Patty Murray (D-WA), chairs of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation, requesting that the Appropriations Committee provide $127 million for the EAS program and $35 million for the Small Community Air Service Development program.
   The Senators' letter stated, "Small and rural communities are the first to bear the brunt of bad economic times and the last to see the benefits of good times. The general economic downturn and the dire straits of the aviation industry have placed exceptional burdens on air service to our most isolated communities.
   "The Small Community Air Service Development program is a flexible program that allows communities to take a proactive approach to developing new air service. To date over 40 communities have leveraged federal funding to build their access to the national aviation network. Unfortunately, over 100 communities applied for funding but were turned down. The demand for funding through this program greatly outstrips available resources."
