SEN. ROBERTS URGES GREATER MARKET ACCESS FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE
  Sen. Pat Roberts today reinforced the U.S. position that any trade agreement concerning agriculture must involve greater market access for U.S. agriculture exports in a meeting with European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson. 
   "I will not support any trade agreement that asks farmers and ranchers to shoulder a larger burden without opening the necessary markets for their products," Senator Roberts said.
   The Doha Round talks collapsed in July due to unwillingness of other trading partners, including the European Union, to put proposals on the table that matched the scope and breadth of the United States' proposal regarding domestic supports and market access.
   "As discussions occur between our various trading partners," Senator Roberts said. "I am confident Ambassador Susan Schwab will continue to represent the best interests of America's agriculture producers."
   The meeting was held by members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry.
