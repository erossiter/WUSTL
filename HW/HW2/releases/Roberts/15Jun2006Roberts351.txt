SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES WAR SUPPLEMENTAL BILL WITH $25 MILLION FOR FT. RILEY'S COMBAT AVIATION BRIGADE
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced the U.S. Senate passed the 2006 War and Hurricane Supplemental Appropriations Bill containing $25 million for the Combat Aviation Brigade arriving at Ft. Riley and other critical funds for our men and women in uniform. 
   "I am pleased to see the Congress make this much needed investment in the new Combat Aviation Brigade at Ft. Riley," Senator Roberts said. "With the first UH-60 Black Hawks arriving on post earlier this month, I am working hard to provide Fort Riley with the necessary funding and resources to provide for a smooth transition as the post begins receiving its new missions. These funds will add a critical element to the maneuver training that troops already receive at Ft. Riley." 
   The $25 million will help facilitate the fielding, training, and employment of the Brigade already arriving at the post. The Brigade is made up of Black Hawk, Apache and Chinook helicopters.
   The bill also includes:
   * $1.9 billion for the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security for border security;
   * $538.5 million for body armor and personal protection equipment for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in harm's way; 
   * $94.1 million for service member and family support programs such as counseling, child care, support to the severely injured, and transition assistance for separating service members;
   * Approximately $2.0 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund; 
   * $4.9 billion for the Afghanistan and Iraq Security Forces Funds to train and equip Afghan and Iraqi Security Forces and assist their governments in assuming greater responsibility for their nation's security; and, 
   * $1.2 billion for the Defense Health Program to provide health care for activated reservists and their families, and funds for civilian medical staff to backfill deployed active duty medical staff at military treatment facilities and clinics. 
   Senator Roberts, a former Marine, is a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
