SEN. ROBERTS RELEASES STATEMENT REGARDING TERMINATION OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY EMPLOYEE
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today released the following statement regarding the termination of a Central Intelligence Agency employee for unauthorized disclosure of classified information: 
   Senator Roberts said, "Unauthorized disclosures of classified information can significantly harm our ability to protect the American people. Frankly, at a time in which intelligence is more important than ever, leaks have hindered our efforts in the war against al-Qaida.
   "Those who leak classified information not only risk the disclosure of intelligence sources and methods, but also expose the brave men and women of the intelligence community to greater danger. Clearly, those guilty of improperly disclosing classified information should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
   "I am pleased that the Central Intelligence Agency has identified the source of certain unauthorized disclosures, and I hope that the Agency, and the Community as a whole, will continue to vigorously investigate other outstanding leak cases."
