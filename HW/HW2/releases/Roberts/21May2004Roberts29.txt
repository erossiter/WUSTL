SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE HONORS WORLD WAR II VETERANS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that the Senate passed a resolution honoring World War II veterans.  
 The resolution first was introduced in the House by Kansas First District Rep. Jerry Moran (R-KS).
   The World War II Commemorative Resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 409, expresses the country's gratitude for the tremendous sacrifices of the more than 16 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Coast Guard, and Merchant Mariners. The resolution also celebrates the completion of the National World War II Memorial on the National Mall, which will be dedicated on Memorial Day weekend with 800,000 veterans expected to attend the ceremony.
   Senator Roberts said, "The upcoming dedication of the World War II National Memorial this Memorial Day weekend is a long overdue tribute to those who served in our Armed Forces, honoring the many contributions made by those on the home front. As a former Marine, and on behalf of all the remaining pillars of our Greatest Generation, I am pleased to honor our veterans, and I commend Congressman Jerry Moran for his tireless work on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs."
   Senator Roberts is a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
