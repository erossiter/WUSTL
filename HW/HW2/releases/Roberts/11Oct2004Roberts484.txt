SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES DISASTER ASSISTANCE; $2.9 BILLION IN CRITICAL AID ON THE WAY TO PRODUCERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced the Senate passed legislation providing $2.9 billion in disaster assistance for drought stricken farmers and ranchers.  
   "I am pleased the Senate has acted quickly to deliver much needed aid to our farmers and ranchers suffering from drought," Senator Roberts said. 
   The legislation was attached to the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report and includes $2.9 billion for disaster assistance in areas experiencing severe drought and crop losses in 2003 or 2004. The funds will be offset from the Conservation Security Program (CSP). 
   "I continue to believe that agriculture should not be treated differently from other disasters and would have preferred a spending bill that was free from offsets," Senator Roberts said. "I am glad my colleagues came to understand the dire consequences of prolonged drought in Kansas and other states. This aid is will go a long way for our farmers and ranchers." 
   Senator Roberts first led the charge for disaster assistance when he and other farm state Senators fought for and passed a bipartisan disaster assistance package in the Senate. 
   "In 2000, we made reforms to the crop insurance program that have improved that portion of the safety net for our producers in need," Senator Roberts said. "However, as I said when I voted against the current farm bill, it does not assist producers when they need it most, when there is no crop to harvest due to disaster. That is exactly what has happened for many producers in Kansas, and here we are again talking about another disaster bill." 
   The bill now goes to the President to be signed into law. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
