SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $55 MILLION IN NEW AIR BORN LASER WORK TO COME TO BOEING WICHITA
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that Boeing will bring $55 million of new work on the Air Born Laser (ABL) to Boeing Wichita. Sen.  
 Roberts said, "I am pleased that Boeing has recognized the skilled labor force in Wichita and has decided to bring this important work to their facility there. It is my hope that as the ABL moves from prototype to full production, this work will remain in Wichita." 
   This summer, Boeing will bring approximately 10 months of work previously scheduled to be completed at Edwards Air Force Base in California, to the Boeing Wichita Plant. The project will bring $55 million and will employ 30 to 40 engineers to install laser system provisions. 
   "Completion of this project is a key milestone," Roberts said, "because it is one of the last points of production before the laser is installed on the tip of the plane." 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services.
