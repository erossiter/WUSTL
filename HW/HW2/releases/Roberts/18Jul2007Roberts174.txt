SEN. ROBERTS: KANSAS AWARDED $10 MILLION IN GRANTS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts today announced Kansas was awarded more than $10 million in grants to help state and local first responders improve public safety communications and coordination during a natural or man-made disaster.  
   "These funds will go a long way in obtaining advanced communications systems that will allow first responders from different jurisdictions to better coordinate during an emergency," Senator Roberts said.
   The funds will assist public safety agencies in the acquisition, deployment, and training of interoperable communications systems to enhance interoperable communications of voice, data, and/or video signals. 
   First responders from different jurisdictions and agencies use disparate communication technologies that impede critical communication among fire fighters, police, and other emergency personnel during a disaster. Such differences can pose problems and impede the critical work of the nation's first responders.
