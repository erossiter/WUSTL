SENS. ROBERTS, BROWNBACK TO VISIT EASTERN KANSAS
  U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Pat Roberts (R-KS), and Dick Hainje, Regional Administrator for FEMA on Thursday will tour several Eastern Kansas communities that were affected by the recent flooding. Roberts, Brownback and Hainje will hold a press conference in Topeka after visiting Osawatomie, Coffeyville and Fredonia. 
   "Visiting the devastated communities and talking with local residents will help my colleagues and me in Washington know what more we must do to assist this disaster clean-up and recovery," said Brownback. "I have so far been very impressed with the emergency response efforts, and am proud of the way my fellow Kansans have responded to this disaster."
   "The recent flooding in Kansas has resulted in significant damage to many of our counties," Senator Roberts said. "I believe it is necessary to see the damage firsthand to help our local officials and residents work with their federal counterparts to coordinate disaster relief for the area."
