SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES HIGHWAY BILL; KANSAS GAINS FUNDING, JOBS, SAFER ROADWAYS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today voted for the Highway Bill, legislation that will ultimately bring new jobs and $420 million to Kansas for safer roadways.  
 The Senate passed the legislation with a vote of 89 to 11. 
   "The Highway Bill is a critical investment in the way of live for every Kansan," Roberts said. "Not only does it improve roads and bridges, it adds to transportation safety and the general economy of our state." 
   According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, every $1 billion invested in federal transportation infrastructure improvements creates 47,500 jobs. These dollars alone will create over 95,000 jobs in Kansas. 
   The federal highway program has been particularly successful because of the return on the investment it provides Kansas. Under current law, Kansas received an average of $321 million. With the new legislation, Kansas stands to receive $420 million a year, a 30 percent increase. 
   Since its enactment in 1998, the Highway Bill has made major investments including I-70 between Salina and Topeka, Highway US 50 between Syracuse and Lakin, a majority of Interstate 35 and major portions of Interstate 135 through Harvey and Sedgwick counties. 
   Senator Roberts said, "The Highway Bill is a unique program, encouraging strong federal, state and local partnerships where the benefits are realized by Kansans every day on the road." 
   The legislation now goes to a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.
