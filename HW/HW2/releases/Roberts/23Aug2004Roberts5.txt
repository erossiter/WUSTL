SEN. ROBERTS RESPONDS TO CRITICS OF INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY REFORM
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, responds to critics of intelligence community reform:  
   "Already some critics have charged that we cannot reform the intelligence community during time of war. Some have also charged that the legislation would 'abolish' the CIA and would harm national security. I offer the following historical example to disprove these points: 
   * "The National Security Act of 1947 'abolished' the Army Air Corps in effect creating the U.S. Air Force. With the stroke of the legislative pen, hundreds of thousands of personnel left the Army and 'became' the Air Force virtually overnight. 
   * "Did the change of uniform, leadership and name 'gut' our air power capabilities? Absolutely not. In less than three years from its creation, the Air Force transitioned from the propeller age to the jet age and successfully engaged the North Koreans in both air interdiction and air superiority campaigns during the Korean War. 
   * "Had these critics been president instead of Harry Truman in 1947, the U.S. would still have the War and Navy Departments. There would be no Department of Defense and no CIA." 
   Senator Roberts is the author of an Intelligence reform bill, entitled, the "9/11 National Security Protection Act." He is also a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
