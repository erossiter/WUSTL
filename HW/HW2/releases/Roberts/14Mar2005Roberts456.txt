SEN. ROBERTS SHOWCASES FORT LEAVENWORTH TO DEFENSE DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY ABELL
  Sen. Pat Roberts today hosted Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness Charlie Abell during a visit to Fort Leavenworth.  
 Roberts invited Abell to the post to showcase its role in current operations in the Global War on Terrorism and the Army's transformation efforts. 
   "Fort Leavenworth is the intellectual center of the Army," Senator Roberts said. "The Post is unmatched in providing educational and training support to today's war fighter. The Army gains a tremendous amount of synergy by co-locating its educational efforts here. I believe the Army would benefit by locating other training and doctrine activities at the post. I am pleased Secretary Abell accepted my invitation to visit Fort Leavenworth so he will learn of the post's contributions firsthand." 
   As an example of the synergy, the Senator highlighted the benefit of having both the Command and General Staff College and the Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) based at Fort Leavenworth. The Command and General Staff College is the crown jewel of professional military education. CALL plays an invaluable role in today's threat environment by analyzing adversaries' strengths and capabilities and translating that analysis into tangible information for the war fighter. 
   "CALL immediately translates lessons learned on the front lines into cutting edge training that saves lives on the battle field," Roberts said. 
   Senator Roberts is a strong advocate for ensuring the nation's men and women in uniform have the tools and training they need to fulfill their mission. Senator Roberts, a former Marine, is Chairmen of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services.
