SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE APPROVES MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN KANSAS MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that the Senate approved the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Bill containing major projects for Ft. Riley, Ft. Leavenworth, Topeka and Hays.  
   "I am pleased the Senate has acted quickly to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families especially during this time of war when so many are making the ultimate sacrifice for our nation," Senator Roberts said. "These projects in Kansas reflect our commitment to provide our military with the best facilities to carry out their mission and to raise their families." 
   Senator Roberts personally worked to include the following projects: 
   Fort Riley
   * $41 million barracks complex renewal.
   * $3 million for a communications center.
   * $15.5 million for a maintenance facility revitalization.
   * $33 million for construction of 126 units for family housing.
   * $30 million for family housing improvements.
   Fort Leavenworth 
   * $44 million for phase II of the Command and General Staff College's new Lewis and Clark Instructional Facility. Senator Roberts secured the original design funds in Fiscal Year 2003, and secured $28 million in FY 2004 for Phase I. The Army held a groundbreaking for this critical new facility in June.
   * $15 million for the Family Housing Privatization Project. 
   Topeka
   * $3 million for Readiness Center improvements 
   Hays
   * $7.4 million for an Army Reserve Center/Organizational Maintenance Shop 
   The bill now goes to a conference committee to iron out differences in the House and Senate versions of the legislation. 
   Senator Roberts is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chairing the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. He continues to see that the armed forces receive the best training and technology to complete their missions.
