  Sen. Pat Roberts, a key member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, today announced that Ft.  
 Riley will transform one of its brigades to the Army's new force structure, signaling Ft. Riley's importance to the Army's future force. 
   "I have been meeting with Army leadership to ensure that Ft. Riley was considered for early inclusion in the Army's modernization plan. I am pleased the Army has decided to expediate the transformation of one of our brigades at Ft. Riley," Senator Roberts said. "The men and women of Ft. Riley continue to make significant contributions and sacrifices to our military operations in Iraq. The Army's decision today reflects their confidence in Ft.
