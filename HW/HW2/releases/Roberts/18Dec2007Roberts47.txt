   This bill also includes a provision important to the revitalization of Greensburg. At issue were the parameters of a Department of Labor grant which would not allow the funds to be used to hire public sector employees such as administrators, zoning and planning officials and inspectors. Given the small size of local government in the affected areas, it became apparent to state and Greensburg officials that it would be necessary to hire public employees to assist in the reconstruction. Senator Roberts has worked with the rest of the Kansas delegation and Governor Sebelius to get this
  important waiver for Greensburg.
   The bill now goes to the House of Representatives for final approval before being sent to the president for his signature.
