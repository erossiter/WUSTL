SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES OVER $700,000 TO CITY OF MANHATTAN TO HELP WITH GROWTH FROM FT. RILEY
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $763,700 grant to the City of Manhattan for community assistance. 
   "Our state is excited and proud of the expansion at Ft. Riley," Senator Roberts said. "With the increasing number of troops and their families moving to communities near the post, the Defense Department has recognized the unique demands this places on cities like Manhattan. This grant will help the City of Manhattan anticipate these demands to continue to make Kansas a great place to live and work, while contributing to our nation's defense."
   The funds were awarded by the Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment as a result of the realignment at Ft. Riley. The City of Manhattan will use this grant to assess the expansion of Ft. Riley and identify priorities for community development, prepare strategies for the city, and develop action plans.
   Senator Roberts, a former Marine, is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Since coming to the Senate in 1996, Senator Roberts has worked tirelessly on behalf of Kansas' military installations and their communities to see that the nation's men and women in uniform have a better quality of life and the tools to fulfill their mission to protect and defend the United States.
