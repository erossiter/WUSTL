SEN. ROBERTS RECOGNIZES NATIONAL 'READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY' IN WYANDOTTE COUNTY
  Sen. Pat Roberts today read to children at the Frank Rushton Elementary School in Kansas City, Kansas as part of the 10th anniversary celebrations of national "Read Across America" day. Roberts is dedicating efforts this year to promoting literacy at Kansas schools. 
   Senator Roberts cosponsored a resolution, passed by the Senate in late February, to designate March 2nd as "Read Across America Day," encouraging parents to read to children at least 30 minutes a day. March 2nd was chosen to recognize the birthday of Theodor Geisel, better known to kids as Dr. Seuss, for his success in encouraging children to discover the joy in reading. Roberts read a Seuss favorite to kindergarten through second graders.
   "Early childhood literacy initiatives are imperative to the success of our children." Senator Roberts said. "Reading out loud is a key way to engage children in learning and demonstrates the importance of reading at a young age. If they become enthusiastic about books and reading now, it will carry them through their entire lives." So far this year, Senator Roberts has read to four schools to help lend enthusiasm for reading to students, teachers and parents. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
