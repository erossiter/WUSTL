SEN. ROBERTS: CRITICAL TAX RELIEF PASSES CONGRESS; BENEFITS KANSAS FAMILIES
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that late last night, the Congress passed legislation to extend critical tax relief for working families.  
   "Kansans deserve to keep more of the dollars they earn," Senator Roberts said. "This tax relief will help ensure that our economy continues to grow by reducing the burden on the American taxpayer." 
   The Senate passed The Conference Report accompanying the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004. The following are details of the legislation: 
   * Extends the $1,000 child tax credit through 2010;
   * Allows men and women in the military to include combat pay when calculating the child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit. Resulting in $199 million in relief to military families with members serving in combat zones;
   * Extends the expansion of the 10 percent tax bracket. For 2005-2010, the upper limit of the 10 percent tax bracket will remain $14,000 for joint filers and $7,000 for single taxpayers (indexed for inflation);
   * Ensures continuation of tax relief for married couples through further elimination of the marriage penalty;
   * Extends the current relief of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) through 2005. The AMT increasingly burdens more middle class families; 
   * Extends the Research and Development Tax Credit until 2005, mirroring legislation Senator Roberts supported in March, enhancing the development of science and technology by continuing to provide incentives for investment in research and development.
   The Working Families Tax Relief Act now awaits the president's signature to become law.
