SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES ENERGY AND WATER CONFERENCE REPORT; CONTAINS IMPORTANT KANSAS PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced the Senate passed the Energy and Water Appropriations Conference report for Fiscal Year 2006 containing critical investment in Kansas' infrastructure.  
   "The Energy and Water bill contains millions of dollars for improvements to our daily way of life. This bill contains projects that will make critical investments in our lakes, streams and rivers for recreation, drinking water and flood control," Senator Roberts said. 
   Also included in the bill was a request by Senator Roberts and others for $1 million for the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC). Kansas is a charter member of the IOGCC, which represents 37 states that produce domestic oil and natural gas. IOGCC coordinates state research and assessments on oil and gas regulation, encourages the sharing of best practices, and promotes the latest technology. In June, Senator Roberts joined nine other Senators in sending a letter to appropriators requesting this funding.
