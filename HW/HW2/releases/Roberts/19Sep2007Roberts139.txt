SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE APPROVES MENTAL HEALTH PARITY BILL
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced the Senate approved a bill last night granting mental health parity in insurance coverage. 
   "It is time we address the disparity between mental health care and medical care," Senator Roberts said. "People requiring mental health care need the same protections, care and understanding as those individuals suffering from physical illnesses. I am confident that this proposal, which, has the support of employers, insurance companies and mental health providers, is a step in the right direction."
   The Mental Health Parity Act, S. 558, requires equal health insurance coverage of financial requirements for both mental health benefits and medical or surgical benefits, unless comparable limitations are imposed on medical and surgical benefits. These financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, out-of-pocket expenses and annual and lifetime limits. The new requirements apply to group health plans with 50 or more employees.
   The bill now awaits House action.
   Senator Roberts is an original cosponsor of the bipartisan legislation and is a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
