SEN. ROBERTS CALLS MARINE CORPS COMMANDANT REGARDING PURPLE HEART
  Sen. Pat Roberts, a former Marine, today called the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Michael W. Hagee, on behalf of Marines mistakenly awarded the Purple Heart.  
   "Cpl. Travis Eichlberger should be proud of his service to our nation," Senator Roberts said. "I regret that our Marine Corps has handled this case badly. This afternoon, I spoke with both Travis and the Commandant. As a result of these conversations, I think it is fair to say that Travis understands the Marine Corps' decision. The Commandant also agrees with me that our Corps has put these Marines in embarrassing circumstances and should have handled this situation more appropriately. 
   "At my request, the Commandant called Travis and apologized on behalf of the Marine Corps. Both the Commandant and I assured Travis that we would provide him with any possible assistance. 
   "Along with the good people of Atchison, I honor Travis' service. My message to Travis was: Semper Fi." 
   Senator Pat Roberts served in the Marine Corps from 1958-62. He is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services.
