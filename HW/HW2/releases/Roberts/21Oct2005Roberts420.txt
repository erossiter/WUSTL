SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES HUD APPROPRIATIONS BILL; CONTAINS FUNDS FOR FAIRWAY AND MISSION
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced that late last night, the Senate passed the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006 containing critical funds for the cities of Mission and Fairway.  
  "I am pleased to announce additional funds for re-development associated with the Rock Creek project," Roberts said. "The partnership with city, county, state and federal government is dedicated to improving the Johnson Drive commercial area."
   Senator Roberts personally worked to include $500,000 for Mission and $500,000 for Fairway in the form of HUD Economic Development Initiative grants. 
   Last Thursday, Senator Roberts attended a press conference with the cities of Mission and Fairway at Sylvester Powell Community Center to announce $2.4 million in federal funds Senator Roberts had secured for the Rock Creek project through the Highway Bill signed into law by the President in August. 
   In addition to the funds for Mission and Fairway, Senator Roberts also secured $2 million for the Kansas Department of Transportation for statewide buses and bus facilities.
