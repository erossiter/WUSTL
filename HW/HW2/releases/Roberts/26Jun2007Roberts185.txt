SEN. ROBERTS: KOREA ACCEPTS BEEF FROM SIX U.S. PLANTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that the People's Republic of Korea agreed to resume trade from six U.S. plants that had been previously suspended. Shipments from the six plants were suspended because a third-party vendor mistakenly exported product that was labeled for domestic use only. 
   The reinstated companies may resume shipping boneless beef products from animals under 30 months of age.
   "This decision inches us closer to normal beef trade with Korea," Senator Roberts said. "There is still much progress to be made as we consider our free trade agreements. I will continue to work towards expanding access for all products, including bone-in beef, from animals of all ages and consistent with the World Animal Health Organization's (OIE) international standards as we go forward with talks."
   Senator Roberts has been an outspoken advocate for adherence to internationally recognized scientific standards and the need for agreement on commercially viable import protocol. He had said continued delays on the part of Korea were a barrier to trade.
   Senator Roberts is a member of the Finance Committee and a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry. From his position on both Committees, Roberts offers unique leadership for Kansas, where the beef industry is one of the largest industries in the state- representing over $5 billion in annual revenue. The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over all trade agreements.
