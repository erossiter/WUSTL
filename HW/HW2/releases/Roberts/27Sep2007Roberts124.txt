SEN. ROBERTS: BETTER BORDER SECURITY NEEDED ON NORTHERN BORDER
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS), former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today urged federal officials to improve border security and safety along the United States/Canada border. 
   Roberts reacted to the release of a General Accountability Office (GAO) investigation that highlighted major security holes in the northern border.
   "Both our northern and southern borders are a matter of national security," Roberts cautioned. "Not only do we have to worry about individuals illegally crossing the borders. We also have to worry about the things that people carry across the borders, whether it be drugs, weapons, explosives, or nuclear material. 
   "The findings of this GAO investigation were disturbing. Along the northern border, investigators carried a duffel bag across in three of the four locations without any challenges by border agents. Clearly, there are large porous areas along the northern border that leave us open to security threats that current staffing levels cannot address. In fact, in May of 2007, there were only 972 border patrol agents along the northern border. This is in comparison to the 11,986 border patrol agents along the southern border.
   Roberts also cited reports that have indicated that there are international terrorist organizations operating in Canada.
   "We must ensure that these organizations cannot enter or bring hazardous material into the United States," Roberts said. "It's clear we have a lot of work to do to better protect both of our borders so that we can detect suspicious activity and better prevent the unauthorized entry of individuals."
