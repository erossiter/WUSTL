SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $108,000 GRANT FOR COMMUNITY HOUSING IN GEARY COUNTY
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $108,000 grant for housing assistance in Junction City. 
   The city of Junction City will coordinate and supervise the construction of homes in the city. The funds will be used to provide grants to public or private non-public organizations and Indian Tribes to provide assistance in recruitment, screening, loan packaging, credit counseling and related activities for prospective housing applicants. This program brings new, modest homes to the community and allows families who otherwise might not be able to afford a home to do so through the contribution of sweat equity.
   The Self-Help Housing Grant was awarded by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Office. Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
