SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT RECOGNIZING NATION'S VETERANS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, a former Marine and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today released the following statement in recognition of Veteran's Day.  
   Senator Roberts said, "The dictionary defines the word 'veteran' as an old soldier of long service, and a former member of the armed services. Well, As a veteran, I don't want to quarrel with the dictionary but Veterans' Day provides a perfect opportunity to reflect on a more personal meaning of the word veteran. To Americans, a veteran is certainly more than a definition in a dictionary. A veteran is one who has shown courage to further the cause of liberty and freedom. 
   "We see this same courage and resolve demonstrated daily by our men and women currently serving in our armed forces throughout the world. The battle reports from Iraq serve as a poignant reminder that freedom is not without cost and securing our nation from terrorism is a most difficult task. These veterans and defenders of our nation's security deserve our utmost respect and prayers. 
   "Kansans have a strong history of honoring our nation's veterans. Through the efforts of native Kansans Alvin J. King and Representative Ed Rees in 1953, Kansas made a historic contribution by proposing the change from Armistice Day to Veterans' Day, thereby recognizing all veterans of all wars. In fact, Emporia, Kansas, has been recognized as the Founding City of Veterans' Day. 
   "To me, a veteran is one who was prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for the preservation of freedom and the security of our nation. These heros among us are our neighbors, friends, and family members. 
   "So today, and everyday, let us give heartfelt thanks to the brave men and women for their service and sacrifice. From this former Marine, Semper fi."
