   "On this Memorial Day holiday, we remember and salute the generations of Americans who gave their lives to defend and serve this country during times of war. 
   "The freedom and liberty that we enjoy today was secured by these brave men and women who stood in the face of tyranny. Many were natives of our great state of Kansas. 
   "We honor their memory. We remember their sacrifices. Their spirit, dedication, and courage are an inspiration to us all. 
   "Let us also recognize and express gratitude for Kansas military personnel currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan in the war against terrorism. 
   "Deployed from McConnell Air Force Base, Ft. Riley, Forbes Field and various National Guard and reserve units, these men and women are working to protect our national security and to promote peace. 
   "We are saddened by the recent deaths of two young men, Sgt. Benjamin Morton of Wright, and Sgt. Christopher Perez of Hutchinson. I offer my sincerest condolences to their families and loved ones. Their courage and sacrifice is what defines America. Our appreciation cannot be understated. 
   "God Bless you and God bless our great Nation. You go with our hearts, our prayers and our support. Pardon this veteran Marine when I say Semper Fi."
