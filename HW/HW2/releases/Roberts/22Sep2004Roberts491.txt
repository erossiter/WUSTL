SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR MORE FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE FOR UNINSURED
  Sen. Pat Roberts said the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions favorably voted out a bill to extend and increase funding to states to help provide health care for the uninsured.  
   "This bill provides funds to the state to provide health care for Kansans who are unable to obtain health insurance by other means," Senator Roberts said. "Most of these Kansans are our neighbors and friends, they are self-employed or work for a small business and without this opportunity, they would be uninsured or forced to seek public assistance." 
   State high risk pools are state-created and state-funded initiatives designed to stabilize the state health insurance market and help those individuals who would otherwise be uninsured or are on public assistance programs. High-risk pools are the insurer of last resort for more than 170,000 Americans in more than 30 states. Last year, Kansas received $1.3 million for the program. 
   The State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act of 2004 authorizes $75 million to extend funding through Fiscal Year 2009. The funds go to offset losses incurred in the state's high risk pool. In addition, the legislation includes a supplemental grant for state high risk pools that would like to improve consumer benefits, such as lowering premiums, providing low-income premium subsidies, or providing flexibility in enrollment rules. 
   The legislation now goes to the Senate floor for debate and vote. 
   Senator Roberts is a key member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
