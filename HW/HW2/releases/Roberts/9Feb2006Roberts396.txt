SEN. ROBERTS, REP. TIAHRT: NEW MISSION FOR AIR NATIONAL GUARD AT MCCONNELL
  Sen. Pat Roberts and Fourth District Rep. Todd Tiahrt today announced the intention of the U.S. Air Force to transfer a fighter training mission to the Air National Guard at McConnell Air Force Base. 
   The Air Force is expected to announce the transfer of at least one squadron of T-38's from Moody Air Force Base in Georgia to the Kansas Air Guard. T-38's are a critical component of the Air Force's fighter training program. 
   Senator Roberts said, "The Kansas Air National Guard has a rich tradition in flying missions critical to our national security. The BRAC 2005 decisions transferred the fleet of Air Guard tankers at McConnell up the road to Forbes Air Field in Topeka. Since then, Congressman Tiahrt and I have worked tirelessly to bring a new flying mission home to the Kansas Air Guard. This decision by the Air Force illustrates what Todd and I already know - that the men and women of the Kansas Air National Guard are some of the best airmen in the force." 
   "We are pleased our efforts have resulted in a continued air presence for the 'Flying Jayhawks' of the 184th," said Tiahrt. "Senator Roberts and I strongly urge Governor Sebelius to accept this new mission on behalf of the Kansas Air National Guard." 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
