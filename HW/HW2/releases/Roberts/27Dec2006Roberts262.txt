SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT FORD
  Sen. Roberts Issues Statement on the Death of President Gerald Ford: 
   I am saddened to learn of President Gerald Ford's passing. As tributes to our 38th president pour in from around the country, the themes of honor, integrity and honesty rightly resound. President Ford provided the country a great service by allowing the country to heal after Watergate. Kansans will remember him as a supporter of President Eisenhower. I remember as a young congressional staffer that he had strong friendships with his Kansas colleagues in the House and Senate, including with my predecessor and then-boss First District Congressman Keith Sebelius. And, of course, he chose Kansas Senator Bob Dole as his running mate in 1976. Jerry Ford's down-to-earth style, his sincerity and his ability to do what was right rather than what was politically expedient will be his legacy. We need more Jerry Ford's in public service.
