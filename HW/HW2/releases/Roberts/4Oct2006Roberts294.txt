SEN. ROBERTS APPLAUDS SENATE APPROVAL OF OLDER AMERICANS ACT
  Sen. Pat Roberts said that late last week, during a final wrap-up session before the recess, the Senate approved important legislation to provide critical support for the nation's senior citizens. 
   "As we know, many communities in Kansas have aging populations," Senator Roberts said. "This bill will provide the funds and the tools to ensure that seniors, and those that care for them, will have the support necessary to ensure their well being."
   The bill re-authorizes the Older Americans Act (OAA) which provides funding for state and community programs on aging, for mental health services, for community service employment programs, and for prevention of elder abuse. In particular, the Title III programs, including supportive services and centers, family caregiver support, congregate and home delivered nutrition, and disease prevention will receive 70 percent of the total funds authorized.
   "I understood the concerns regarding the funding of the Title III programs," Senator Roberts said. "Kansas is a rural state with a number of low income seniors who depend on these nutritional programs. As a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions we had to ensure seniors in Kansas benefitted from the final formula."
   Under the new law, funding formulas were adjusted for states with growing aging populations. Kansas' share of the funds is expected to increase over funding levels of years past.
