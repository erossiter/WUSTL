SEN. ROBERTS: USDA SECRETARY WAS A TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR PRODUCERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts issued the following statement regarding U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman's resignation:  
   "I want to personally thank Secretary Ann Veneman for all she has done for Agriculture," Senator Roberts said. "She has been a strong advocate for producers, free and fair trade, food safety and conservation programs. Her legacy will be the food security of the United States due to her untiring efforts to place agroterrorism as a priority within our national security system and her ability to maintain confidence in our food supply through sound science and knowledge during times of difficult challenge" 
   "I consider her not only a good friend, but a tireless advocate for agriculture, she will be missed. I wish her well in her future endeavors," Senator Roberts said. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
