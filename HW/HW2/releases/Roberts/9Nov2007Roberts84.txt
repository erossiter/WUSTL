SENS. ROBERTS, BROWNBACK ANNOUNCE $4.3 MILLION FOR FT. RILEY VETERANS CEMETERY
  U.S. Senators Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback today announced a $4.3 million grant to establish the Kansas Veterans' Cemetery at Fort Riley in Manhattan. 
   "I am pleased the Department of Veterans Affairs announced this important funding on this Veterans Day weekend," Senator Roberts said. "We truly owe our military members a debt of gratitude and for those who pay the ultimate sacrifice, this is an honor that our country should provide."
   "Our veterans deserve our thanks and our respect. It is worthy that we honor them this Veterans Day by passing this bill and affording Fort Riley Cemetery the ability to serve our veterans for years to come," Senator Brownback said.
   The grant covers costs of cemetery infrastructure, including administration and maintenance buildings, roads, utilities, landscaping and irrigation, a memorial walkway, an assembly area and a committal service shelter. This development will provide 4,000 full casket grave sites, 700 in-ground cremation burial sites and 786 columbarium niches. The new cemetery will serve more than 30,000 veterans and their family members living in the area.
   This total grant amount is over $6.7 million and the Department of Veterans Affairs will award the second part of the grant when the remaining balance is available. This grant covers 100 percent of the allowable costs to build the new 90-acre cemetery in the central part of Kansas.
   The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Senator Roberts is a former Marine and an outspoken advocate for our nation's veterans.
