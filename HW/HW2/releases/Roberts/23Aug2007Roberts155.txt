SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $100,000 TO WYANDOTTE COUNTY FOR DRUG PREVENTION
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $100,000 grant to Wyandotte County for drug abuse prevention. 
   The grant was awarded to the Connect the Dottes Coalition in Wyandotte County. The goals of this program are to strengthen collaboration with other community-based youth serving organizations to prevent and reduce substance abuse among youth and over time, adults, by addressing the factors in the community that increase the risk of substance abuse.
   "Efforts to keep our youth drug-free are critical to healthy communities in our state," Senator Roberts said. "Thanks to this grant, the Coalition has great potential to help save kids' lives."
   The funds were awarded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The Connect the Dottes Coalition serves Wyandotte County with a population of 155,750.
