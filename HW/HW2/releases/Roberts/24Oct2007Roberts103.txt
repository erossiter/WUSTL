SENATE APPROVES LABOR/HHS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) said late last night the Senate approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor and Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill including $1.5 million for Kansas. 
   Senator Roberts worked to secure funding for the following Kansas projects:
   * $100,000 for the Kansas Learning Center for Health in Halstead to expand their "On the Road" health program to additional schools for grades K-12. Through this program, instructors come out to schools and teach 30 minute interactive hands-on lessons to classes throughout the school day. Lesson curriculum covers age appropriate topics such as: The dangers of dealing with strangers, bone purpose and placement, lung functions, and cell structures. Students are taught to make informed and wise decisions concerning alcohol and tobacco use.
   "As childhood health is a growing problem in our nation, these funds are important to ensure proper health education and nutrition is taught to our children," Senator Roberts said. "Children need to be healthy in order to learn, and I know these funds will help make that possible."
   * $1.4 million for the University of Kansas (KU) biodiversity research center. This center is currently creating and researching the predictive modeling on avian influenza.
   "Increased federal and state funding along with the cooperation of area research facilities - including this center at KU, will allow Kansas to contribute to our nation's health preparedness."
   The bill now goes to a conference committee to iron out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill and then will go to the President for his consideration.
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
