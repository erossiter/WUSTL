SEN. ROBERTS WELCOMES BIG RED ONE HOME TO KANSAS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today welcomed the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, known as the "Big Red One" home to Ft. Riley, Kansas.
   "Kansas is proud to have the Big Red One, the longest continually serving, and most prestigious Infantry Division in the history of the U.S. Army, back where it belongs at Ft. Riley," Senator Roberts said. "I knew when the Big Red One left Ft. Riley for Germany in 1996 that, when it came time to move the division back to the States, Ft. Riley would be a natural fit. As one of the premier Army installations in the country, Ft. Riley matches superior training capability and wide open spaces with a strong quality of life and supportive communities second to none. As the Army begins bringing troops home from overseas, and transforming into a more agile and lethal fighting force, Ft. Riley is truly leading this effort." 
   The Big Red One has a colorful and storied history, from its role in D-Day, on the beaches of Normandy, to its numerous deployments over the previous 10 years, including two in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Big Red One has taken part in missions in WW I, WW II, Vietnam, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, and operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
   The relocation will have a significant impact on the state: 
   * The population of soldiers at Ft. Riley will ultimately grow from the previous number of 11,000 to over 18,000. 
   * When considering military, dependents, and civilian personnel, Ft. Riley and the surrounding communities could gain over 20,000 people during the next several years. 
   * Currently, it is estimated that Ft. Riley provides an $866 million economic impact to Manhattan, Junction City, and the surrounding communities. This will grow substantially over the next several years. 
   The critical role the Big Red One plays in the defense of our nation, and our interests overseas, is clearly illustrated in the new mission the Division's First Brigade recently assumed. The First Brigade of the First Infantry Division is the first brigade-sized unit solely dedicated to the development of training and transition teams for Iraqi Security Forces. Ft. Riley now plays an even more pivotal role in the full spectrum of military operations, including post-conflict resolution. In today's threat environment, this is a crucial mission.
   Senator Roberts has been a proud champion of Ft. Riley and the Big Red One in Washington. To ensure Ft. Riley was in a position to receive, house, train, and mobilize additional troops, including a division headquarters, Senator Roberts' efforts continue to include:
   * Inviting and accompanying Department of Defense personnel and Army civilian and uniform leadership to the post, in order to expand awareness of Ft. Riley's unique and relevant warfighting, training, and 
  deployment capabilities;
   * Securing funding for construction projects. As a result of last year's BRAC decisions, Ft. Riley is set to receive approximately $300 million in additional military construction funds that were not previously planned - a number that could grow as additional units transition to the post over the next few years;
   * Improving military housing. Ft. Riley is currently undergoing a housing privatization project that will see 751 new homes built, and the renovation of several others. The project also calls for several new community centers. In 2004, Roberts worked with Army officials to pull forward Ft. Riley on the housing privatization schedule;
   * Working with state and local leaders, including the Governor's Military Council, to provide the necessary resources to ensure that Ft. Riley, and the surrounding communities, are prepared for additional troops. 
   "I am proud to have spent the last 10 years working to bring the Big Red One back home to Kansas," Senator Roberts said. "To the soldiers of the Big Red One, Welcome home and thank you."
   "As the Big Red One comes home to Ft. Riley, another Army division that has called the post home for over 7 years will be inactivated. The 24th Infantry Division is one of the most capable divisions in the U.S. Army, and has greatly contributed to the security of our nation and our friends and allies overseas, and the advancement of freedom and liberty to those less fortunate. When needed, the 24th Infantry Division answered the call to duty with competence, valor, courage, and self-sacrifice, standing steadfast and resolute in support of our national security."
   "It has been a pleasure and an honor to work with Major General Hardy, a warrior and a patriot. General Hardy deserves much credit for the work he has done to ensure a smooth transition at the post, and I have no doubt he will continue to accomplish great things in his career."
   Senator Roberts, a former Marine, is a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
