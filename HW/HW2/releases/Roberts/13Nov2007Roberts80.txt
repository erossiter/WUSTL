SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEETING WITH SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE NOMINEE GOV. SCHAFER
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today met with former North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer as part of his confirmation process for Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Senator Roberts issued the following statement: 
   "As we debate the Farm Bill in the Senate, I asked Gov. Schafer to keep in mind the programs that work in the high plains. He thanked me for my work on crop insurance - and I plan to continue that fight.
   "As a former Governor from the Midwest, Schafer knows the importance of direct payments and crop insurance programs. Today I reminded the nominee that production agriculture, which has been criticized by some, is still the key component to our nation's safe and affordable food supply."
   President Bush nominated Governor Schafer last month for Secretary of USDA. His confirmation hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee has not yet been scheduled. Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.
