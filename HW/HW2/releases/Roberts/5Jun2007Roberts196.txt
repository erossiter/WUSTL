SEN. ROBERTS: SEN. THOMAS WAS A STEADY HAND AND WORKHORSE FOR WYOMING
  Sen. Pat Roberts today issued a statement regarding the death of U.S. Senator Craig Thomas (R-WY), a dear friend and colleague: 
   "The Senate has lost a steady hand and a man who has done much for his special State of Wyoming. Craig was dependable in the finest sense of the word. He was the epitome of a workhorse, not a show horse.
   "To many of us, he was a fellow Marine. In this case Semper Fidelis - always faithful, is most appropriate. If anyone faced trouble in their life, the one person you would want by your side would be Craig Thomas.
   "I shall miss him greatly as a personal friend, confidant and strong supporter. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Susan, his sons Patrick and Greg, and his daughter Lexie."
