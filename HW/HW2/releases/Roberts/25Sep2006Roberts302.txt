SEN. ROBERTS: DECLASSIFY NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON GLOBAL TERRORISM
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today made the following statement: 
   "I have seen the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) concerning Trends in Global Terrorism. The Committee has had it since April. I think the Administration should declassify this document so the American people can see the material for themselves and come to their own conclusions."
   "There is a false impression that the NIE focuses solely on Iraq and terrorism. That is not true. This NIE examines global terrorism in its totality. In this regard, I also agree with Director Negroponte that we have had notable successes against the terrorists but that there is much that remains to be done."
