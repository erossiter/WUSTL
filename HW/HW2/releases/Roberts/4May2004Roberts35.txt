SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TO HOLD HEARINGS ON ABUSE OF IRAQ PRISONERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, announced today that the Committee will hold a closed hearing tomorrow on the recent events surrounding the Abu Ghurayb detention facility in Iraq. 
   The Committee will hear from senior representatives of the Intelligence Community and the United States Army. Senator Roberts said, "there have been a number of allegations that intelligence personnel instructed or encouraged the activities that have come to light over the last few days. The Committee will question the witnesses to determine whether intelligence professionals had anything to do with what I think everyone believes is absolutely unacceptable conduct by Americans."
