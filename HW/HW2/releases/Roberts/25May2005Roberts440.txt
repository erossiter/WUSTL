SENATE HELP COMMITTEE APPROVES BI-PARTISAN HEAD START BILL
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) unanimously approved the Head Start Reauthorization Bill containing solid improvements to the successful federal early childhood program. The bill now goes to the full Senate for debate and a vote.  
   "I am pleased both sides of the aisle could come together and create legislation that strengthens and protects the integrity of Head Start. This legislation does not dismantle or punish Head Start programs. Instead, this bipartisan bill gives Head Start centers across the country the tools necessary to continue and strengthen their successful work," Senator Roberts said. 
   Senator Roberts also successfully fought hard to block a proposal to create a Head Start demonstration project to allow states to administer the Head Start program. "I fought against this proposal," Senator Roberts said, "because it sets the stage for all states to take over this successful federal-to-local program and threatens to unravel the good work our Head Start programs have done since 1965." 
   The bill contains the following provisions: 
   * Requires increased collaboration between Head Start, other federal early childhood programs, and state and local early childhood programs.
   * Strengthens oversight of the program and gives the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and local programs the tools to protect against fraud and abuse. Local programs may also use technical assistance dollars for professional development, improving child outcomes, or other areas the local grantees feel important. 
   * The bill encourages Head Start programs and local elementary schools to work together to ensure a smooth transition for children from preschool to kindergarten to elementary school. 
   * The bill awards high-performing programs by creating "Centers of Excellence" and potentially awarding these centers with bonus grants to serve more kids or for other purposes.
   * The bill increases the set-aside for Early Head Start - the program targeted at children 0-3.
   A large piece of the reauthorization debate was the discovery of Head Start administrative salary abuses in Kansas City, MO and other states. Senator Roberts supported a proposal to place a cap on salaries and successfully called for an annual administrative review of each Head Start center. "I believe Head Start programs in Kansas and across the country are doing a great job of preparing children to enter school, but it is also important to identify any problems within the program so we can move ahead with solutions to make Head Start even stronger." 
   In April, the HELP Committee conducted a hearing on Head Start financial management. Senator Roberts was closely involved with this hearing and invited a Kansas City expert, Dr. Jim Caccamo, to testify before the committee. Dr. Caccamo is Director of the Metropolitan Council on Early Learning and he shared his views on what steps need to be taken to ensure Head Start programs have sound financial management practices and procedures. 
   Senator Roberts has visited Head Start centers in Kansas City, KS and in Hays, KS. He has met with Head Start administrators, parents, students, teachers and local government and education officials and listened to their personal experiences with Head Start. "The stories of these individuals are living proof that Head Start is a highly successful program. I believe that the bi-partisan legislation approved by the HELP committee today will allow more success stories to be realized by children and families in need." 
   Senator Roberts is a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and a strong supporter of increasing the quality of early childhood education and childcare programs nationwide. He is the author of childcare legislation included in the Childcare and Development Block Grant Reauthorization bill awarding grants to small businesses providing childcare to employees. The bill awaits further action in the Senate.
