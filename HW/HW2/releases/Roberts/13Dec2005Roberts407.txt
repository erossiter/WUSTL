CHAIRMAN ROBERTS RELEASES STATEMENT ON PROGRESS OF INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S PHASE II
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today released the following statement regarding the Committee's Review of Pre-War Intelligence on Iraq: 
   "I have just been made aware of a letter sent to the Republican Leader and Assistant Leader signed by the Democrat Leader and Assistant Leader. 
   "The letter is basically a partisan allegation about Phase II of the Intelligence Committee's Review of Pre War Intelligence on Iraq. It alleges incorrectly that 'critical questions remain about the committee's progress on its investigation, its timeline for completing that investigation, and what remaining steps need to be taken to ensure a prompt, thorough, and complete review.' 
   "As an ex officio member of the Committee, Senator Reid is welcome to participate in any Committee activity including 'Phase II.' He has yet to do so. 
   "If the Democrat Leader has 'critical questions' he should pick up the phone and call me, or better yet, attend the business meeting scheduled for this Thursday when we will discuss all facets of our progress on 'Phase II.' I think he would be pleasantly surprised."
