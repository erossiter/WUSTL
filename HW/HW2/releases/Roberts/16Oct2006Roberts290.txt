SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES OVER $238,000 IN GRANTS FOR BULLET PROOF VESTS IN KANSAS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that communities across Kansas will receive $238,000 in grants for bullet-resistant vests for Kansas law enforcement officers.  
   The funding was awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs. The payments to purchase these vests are a result of the Fiscal Year 2006 Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program.
   Senator Roberts said, "This money is crucial especially for smaller communities in Kansas that do not have the means to purchase vests on their own."
