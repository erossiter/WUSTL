SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SELECTED FOR BSE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has selected Kansas State University as one of five new state laboratories that will assist in the surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as "mad cow disease." 
   These laboratories are part of an existing network of state and federal labs that assist APHIS with animal disease testing as needed. These labs will use approved rapid tests for BSE.
   This new lab expands on the Department of Agriculture's March 15 announcement of an enhanced BSE surveillance program which incorporates recommendations from an international scientific review panel and the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis.
   In addition to today's announcement, Kansas State University was selected as a regional lab for USDA's National Plant Diagnostics Network in 2002.
   Senator Roberts said, "I am pleased that Kansas State has received this prestigious designation. I know that K-State will have a nation-wide impact on the analysis and testing of BSE. This further solidifies Kansas State as a national and world leader in animal and plant disease and food security research."
   Senator Roberts, a key member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, has long been an outstanding advocate of agriculture at Kansas State University.
