SEN. ROBERTS URGES SENATE TO PASS BILL TO INCREASE DOMESTIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION
  Sen. Pat Roberts today urged the Senate to pass legislation to increase domestic oil and natural gas production to ease the nation's growing energy demand. 
   "It is important for our national security and our economy that we increase domestic energy production," Senator Roberts said. "Rising energy prices are part of the growing cost of staying in the business of farming. It is simply too much for some producers to keep up with the cost of fuel and fertilizer."
   The Senate is debating the legislation, S. 3711 on the floor this week. This bill would enhance energy dependence and security by exploring, developing and producing in the Gulf of Mexico. According to estimates by the Minerals Management Service, this exploration will bring nearly1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to market. That is enough gas to heat nearly six million homes for 15 years. 
   "It is obvious," Roberts said, "we must take steps to encourage new exploration in the United States and off our shores. Supplies from this area can help alleviate the pain of paying high prices." 
   Roberts went on to say, "We took the right step forward by passing a comprehensive energy bill last year to decrease our dependence on foreign sources of energy and increase our supply of domestic energy resources. I am pleased that bill promotes the development and use of renewable energy resources produced and harvested in our own backyard like ethanol and wind power. It also provides incentives for Kansas oil and gas producers to explore resources within our own country."
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
