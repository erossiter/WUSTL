SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES OVER $2.3 MILLION IN GRANTS FOR HEAD START IN SALINA, WICHITA
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts today announced two grants totaling over $2.3 million for two Head Start programs in Salina and Wichita. 
   The funds allow the Head Start program to operate early learning programs, as well provide training for childcare providers and teachers to become Head Start educators. Head Start programs serve preschool-aged children and their families in low-income areas.
   * $1,153,247 for Salina Unified School District #305 for Head Start in Salina
   * $1,200,574 for the Kansas Children's Service League for Head Start in Wichita
   Senator Roberts said, "I have had the opportunity to see firsthand the great strides Head Start is making in Kansas communities. Head Start, as the name suggests, enables children in need to learn the basic life and social skills to enter school ready to learn. The program, which serves children all over Kansas, provides them with a stable, encouraging environment that allows them to learn, have fun, be nourished - and nurtured. This is particularly invaluable for a child that may not have the same environment at home."
   The funds were awarded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Children and Families. Senator Roberts is a key member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and has been a strong advocate of Head Start.
