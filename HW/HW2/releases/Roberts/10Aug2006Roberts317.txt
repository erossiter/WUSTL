SEN. ROBERTS COMMENTS ON UNITED KINGDOM TERRORIST PLOT
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today made the following statement: 
   "I was briefed earlier in the week about a joint effort by intelligence and law enforcement personnel in the United Kingdom and United States to interdict a terrorist plot which could have resulted in another 9/11-type attack. 
   "I was gratified to hear the news this morning that those efforts were successful.
   "This is the kind of success that our intelligence and law enforcement personnel work hard to achieve -- a success achieved despite damaging leaks and unjustified criticisms of the methods they use to detect and prevent terrorist attacks. I congratulate them and our allies on a job well done. They deserve a great deal of credit.
   "Nearly five years after September 11, 2001, we must remember that our terrorist enemies are more determined than ever and will continue to seek new and insidious ways to kill Americans. We must remain vigilant."
