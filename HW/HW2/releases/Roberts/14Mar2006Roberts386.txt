SEN. ROBERTS: $930,000 IN FEDERAL AID FOR FLOOD DAMAGED ATCHISON, JACKSON, JEFFERSON, LEAVENWORTH, SHAWNEE COUNTIES
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced that nearly $1 million in federal aid will be heading to Northeast Kansas to help producers recover from major flooding last October. USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) has allocated $930,000 in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funding to Atchison, Jackson, Jefferson, Leavenworth and Shawnee Counties. 
   "I am pleased to see these critical funds are on their way to producers in need," Senator Roberts said. "I have been working with local officials, USDA and FSA to see that those suffering from losses due to the flash flooding can get the help they need to restore their operations."
   According to the Kansas FSA office, damage from the flood on October 2, 2005 included: erosion, loss of livestock, fence damage, pond and watershed dam erosion and damage, terrace and diversion damage, debris, building, equipment, and machinery damage, and crop loss. "My sympathies are with area producers facing losses from this storm," Senator Roberts said.
   ECP provides producers more resources to remove debris from farmland, restore fences and conservation structures, provide water for livestock in drought situations and grade and shape farmland damaged by a natural disaster. Locally-elected FSA county committees implement ECP for all disasters other than drought, which is done by FSA's national office. Eligible producers receive cost-share assistance of up to 75 percent of the cost of approved practices, as determined by FSA county committees.
   Producers can contact their local FSA offices regarding ECP sign-up periods, which are set by the county FSA committees.
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
