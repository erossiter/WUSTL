SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES BILL TO NAME OVERLAND PARK POST OFFICE FOR MAYOR EILERT
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced that late last night, the Senate passed legislation to name the U.S. Postal Office at 12433 Antioch Road in Overland Park after former Mayor Ed Eilert.  
   "I am pleased the Senate acted quickly to pass this legislation," Senator Roberts said. "It was an honor for me to introduce this bill because I was privileged to work with Mayor Eilert for years. He is a trusted advisor and friend. Mayor Eilert served Overland Park and Kansas well by creating amazing growth for the city and made Overland Park a wonderful place to call home." 
   Under Mayor Eilert's tenure and leadership, Overland Park doubled in size to almost 170,000 people, making it the second-largest city in Kansas. After serving as mayor for 24 years, Eilert stepped down on April 11, deciding not to run for a seventh term. Also under his term, the city has seen the arrival of the Sprint campus, three new hospitals, the University of Kansas Edwards campus, the Carlsen Center at Johnson County Community College, and a city convention center. 
   Eliert was first elected to the Overland Park City Council in 1977 and became Council president in 1980. He was elected mayor in 1981 and re-elected five times. Eilert was a former Shawnee Mission East High School teacher, and taught at Lebo High School in Lebo, KS. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1961 and a master's degree in business education in 1962 from Emporia State University. 
   Rep. Dennis Moore (D-KS) introduced similar legislation, H.R. 1524, in the House where it passed in April. The bill now goes to the president's desk to be signed into law.
