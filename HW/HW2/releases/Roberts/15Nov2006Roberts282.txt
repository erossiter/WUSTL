SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE APPROVES MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN KANSAS MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, VA
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced that late last night, the Senate approved the Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act containing major projects for Ft. Riley and Ft. Leavenworth.  
   "I am pleased the Senate has acted to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform, their families and veterans, especially during this time of war when so many are sacrificing their safety for our nation," Senator Roberts said. "These projects in Kansas reflect our commitment to provide our military with the best facilities to carry out their mission and to raise their families." 
   "Given the many new building projects, I am especially pleased Ft. Riley will have a new vehicle inspection facility," Roberts said. "This will help speed up critical construction on Post while ensuring the safety of those who live and work there."
   Senator Roberts personally worked to include the following projects for Kansas:
   FORT LEAVENWORTH
   * $15.2 million for a Battle Seminar Facility   
   FORT RILEY 
   * $32 million for a Barracks Complex 
   * $5.2 million for a Child Development Center 
   * $10.2 million for a Vehicle Inspection/Cargo Processing Facility 
   The bill now goes to a conference committee to iron out differences in the House and Senate versions of the legislation.
   Senator Roberts is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and is a senior member of the Senate
   Armed Services Committee. As a former Marine, he continues to ensure that the armed forces and veterans receive the best training, technology and funding.
