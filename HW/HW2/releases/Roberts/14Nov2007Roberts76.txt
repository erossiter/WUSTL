SEN. ROBERTS HONORS MILITARY FAMILIES
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today supported and co-sponsored a Senate Resolution thanking our nation's Military families this holiday season. 
   The resolution was introduced by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Daniel Akaka (D-HI) today to honor and thank our nation's Military families for their tremendous sacrifices and contributions they have made to the nation.
   "With the holidays around the corner," Senator Roberts said "We need to recognize and thank our military families who sacrifice every day, especially those whose loved ones will be deployed during this upcoming holiday season. I am humbled by these families who share the burden of protecting our nation.
   "This resolution expresses appreciation for the contributions these families make in providing essential personal support to our men and women in uniform. Thank you for what you do."
   The National Military Family Association and the Armed Services YMCA observe November as Military Family Month.
   Senator Roberts is a former Marine and an outspoken advocate of our men and women in uniform and their families.
