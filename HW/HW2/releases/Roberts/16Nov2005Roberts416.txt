SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES BILL TO STRENGTHEN, SAFEGUARD PENSIONS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced the Senate approved critical legislation, the Pension Security and Transparency Act, to strengthen and safeguard the pension plans of more than 44 million Americans. The bill includes language supported by Sen. Roberts to protect multiple employer plans of rural cooperatives. 
   "This legislation will ensure companies better calculate their pension obligations and ensure that retirement promises made to workers are kept," Senator Roberts said.
   Key provisions of the bill include:
   * Strengthening single-employer defined benefit plans by requiring them to fully fund their plans and more accurately calculate their pension plan obligations. New funding rules and are phased in over several years. 
   * Providing stronger new rules for plans that are underfunded. An important provision of the bill prohibits severely underfunded plans from enhancing compensation for top executives. 
   * Providing new funding rules for multi-employer plans and enhancing disclosure requirements to make certain employers and workers have information about the funding status and health of their plans. 
   * Adjusting premiums to ensure the solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). 
   * Providing relief for airlines to help them meet their pension obligations. 
   * Providing prospective clarification for hybrid plans.
   The bill also includes provisions relating to defined contribution plans that require employees to receive information about their right to diversify their pension plans, and receive periodic account statements and notice of blackout periods. In addition, the bill requires that employees receive investment advice. 
   The legislation approved by the Senate also include language based on an amendment introduced by Senator Roberts that recognizes the unique nature of multiple employer pension plans sponsored by rural electric, rural telephone and agriculture cooperatives. 
   "In Kansas, we have more than 160 rural cooperatives with thousands of employees that rely on multiple employer plans. This bill will help these co-ops to better plan their pension funding obligations," said Senator Roberts. 
   The Roberts amendment recognizes multiple employer plans' lack of risk to the PBGC, since these plans would continue to operate even if some cooperatives were to go out of business. The bill permits these plans to continue to operate under their existing pension funding rules for 10 years. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
