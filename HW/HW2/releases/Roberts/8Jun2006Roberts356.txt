SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today issued the following statement: 
   "The American people can be proud today. We have dealt a damaging blow to Al Qaida in Iraq.
   "As Central Intelligence Agency Director General Hayden told me this morning, better cooperation, hard work and patience paid off. 
   "General Hayden also stressed this obviously was a joint success with regard to both human intelligence and signals intelligence - and a result of greater cooperation among our military forces, intelligence assets and Iraqi forces.
   "We can expect more aggressive action and follow-up. But we should also understand, this success may be followed by retaliation with an increase in violence - but we should not be discouraged.
   "In addition there may well be a succession struggle within with the insurgency of which we can take advantage. Zarqawi's death and the information we have obtained will make the leadership of the insurgency more vulnerable.
   "Let me also express my appreciation for the sacrifice of the men and women in uniform and intelligence officers who have persevered in this effort. Their success is America's success."
