SEN. ROBERTS CALLS FOR EMERGENCY DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts today joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing legislation to provide emergency disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers suffering from severe drought losses in 2003 and 2004.  
   "Kansas producers, especially in the West, need this assistance," Senator Roberts said. "The state has been hit hard by drought for several consecutive years. For some, this assistance is what will keep them in business." 
   The disaster assistance will be offered as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill slated to come to the Senate floor for debate and a vote this week. 
   The following are the details of the amendment: 
   * Provides emergency assistance (with no offsets) through the Crop Disaster Program (CDP), Quality Loss Program (QLP) and Livestock Assistance Program (LAP) for losses sustained by producers in counties in primary or contiguous disaster areas during the 2003 or 2004 production years.
   * Producers may receive assistance for one, but not both years.
   * Contains the same payment limitations per person and maximum personal gross income eligibility provisions as in previous disaster bills.
   * Producers must agree to purchase two years of crop insurance if they receive assistance for losses on insurable crops and they did not previously purchase crop insurance.
   "In 2000, we made reforms to the crop insurance program that have improved that portion of the safety net for our producers in need," Senator Roberts said. "However, as I said when I voted against the current farm bill, it does not assist producers when they need it most, when there is no crop to harvest due to disaster. That is exactly what has happened for many producers in Kansas, and here we are again talking about another disaster bill." 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
