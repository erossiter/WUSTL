SEN. ROBERTS: EMERGENCY DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS, RANCHERS PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced that late last night, the Senate passed an amendment to provide emergency disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers suffering from severe drought losses in 2003 and 2004.  
   "I am pleased the Senate reacted quickly to pass emergency assistance," Senator Roberts said. "In Kansas, this assistance is critical to provide aid to our farmers and ranchers who have been hit hard by a multi-year drought. While many have viewed the terrible destruction wrought across Florida and the southeastern U.S. by successive hurricanes in recent weeks, we cannot forget the terrible drought that has continued to grip much of the western portion of Kansas." 
   "We also cannot forget the eerie photographs, taken earlier this summer, of a giant dust cloud that swept across western Kansas," Senator Roberts said. "This dire result of continuous drought caused Interstate 70 to shut down, its dust inundated homes and hospitals and even caused a tragic traffic accident that claimed the life of a distinguished Kansan, the late State Senator Stan Clark." 
   The following are the details of the bipartisan amendment Senator Roberts cosponsored: 
   * Provides emergency assistance (with no offsets) through the Crop Disaster Program (CDP), Quality Loss Program (QLP) and Livestock Assistance Program (LAP) for losses sustained by producers in counties in primary or contiguous disaster areas during the 2003 or 2004 production years.
   * Producers may receive assistance for one, but not both years.
   * Contains the same payment limitations per person and maximum personal gross income eligibility provisions as in previous disaster bills.
   * Producers must agree to purchase two years of crop insurance if they receive assistance for losses on insurable crops and they did not previously purchase crop insurance.
   "In 2000, we made reforms to the crop insurance program that have improved that portion of the safety net for our producers in need," Senator Roberts said. "However, as I said when I voted against the current farm bill, it does not assist producers when they need it most, when there is no crop to harvest due to disaster. That is exactly what has happened for many producers in Kansas, and here we are again talking about another disaster bill." 
   The legislation now awaits conference with the House version of the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
