SEN. ROBERTS TELLS NEGROPONTE 'WE WILL WORK TOGETHER ON NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE REFORM'
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee today said, "I am extremely pleased by the naming of Ambassador John Negroponte to be the Director of National Intelligence.  
 I am also pleased with the selection of Lieutenant General Michael Hayden to be Deputy Director. Both of these men are outstanding choices. Both have significant national security and intelligence backgrounds. When the Ambassador called me this morning, he told me he looks forward to appearing before the committee for his confirmation hearing and seeking our advice as we move forward with the new intelligence reform legislation. We will hold the Ambassador's confirmation hearing as soon as his duties in Iraq are completed."
