SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION, CONTAINS IMPORTANT KANSAS PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is pleased to announce important Kansas projects totaling over $3 billion in this year's Defense Authorization bill were approved by the Senate late last night.
   "I am proud of the contributions that Kansas makes to our national defense," Senator Roberts said. "These projects reflect my focus on modernizing and transforming our forces, and giving our men and women in uniform the necessary training and equipment to confront future threats, be they conventional or unconventional. This bill continues our efforts to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families." 
   The Senate also defeated amendments Roberts opposed to prematurely withdraw troops from Iraq. 
   Senator Roberts said, "The requirement of a timetable for withdrawal is reckless, and will setback the progress we have realized in Iraq over the last few years. Such a departure from basic common sense will have long lasting consequences. While we may wish otherwise, the blunt truth of it is there is no exit from either Iraq or the Global War on Terrorism but through success." 
   The bill was passed by the full Senate 96-0 and now goes to a conference committee to iron out differences with the House of Representatives bill. Among the projects that benefit Kansas, Senator Roberts helped secure the following funds:
