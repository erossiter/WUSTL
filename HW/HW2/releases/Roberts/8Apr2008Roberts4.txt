SENS. ROBERTS, BROWNBACK HONOR KANSAS JAYHAWKS' NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP
  U.S. Senators Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback (R-KS) today introduced a Senate Resolution, S.RES. 505, to commend the University of Kansas Jayhawks' 2008 NCAA Championship team. 
   "The families of the players, students, alumni, and faculty of the University of Kansas, and all the supporters of the University of Kansas, are to be congratulated for their commitment to, and pride in, the basketball program at the University," Senator Roberts said today on the Senate floor. "This is a great day for KU and the state of Kansas, Rock Chalk Jayhawk."
   Senator Brownback said, "I congratulate the University of Kansas, Head Coach Bill Self, and of course the unstoppable Men's Basketball team. The University has a long and esteemed basketball history and last night, the Jayhawks solidified once again Kansas' domination in the world of college basketball. Perhaps even more thrilling than this win is that it comes on the 20th anniversary of the 1988 victory. Rock Chalk Jayhawk KU!"
   The University of Kansas men's basketball team last night won its third NCAA Division I Basketball Championship and fifth national championship with its 75-68 win over the University of Memphis.
