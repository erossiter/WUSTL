SEN. ROBERTS VOTES AGAINST SENATE IMMIGRATION BILL; SAYS 'BORDER PROTECTION MUST COME FIRST'
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) today voted against the Senate immigration bill saying: 
   "While our illegal immigration problems are critical, I was disappointed that the Senate bill doesn't address the most vexing problem of border security first. Without secure borders to protect our national security, reform won't mean much in the end. The Senate measures to deal with guest workers and to legalize millions of immigrants are convoluted, lack needed funding and lack time to train new personnel. I hope that the House and Senate negotiators will listen to the majority of Americans who want to take back control of our borders and will make that a priority in the final agreement. An immigration policy that addresses social and economic needs is important, but won't be possible without strong border protection."
