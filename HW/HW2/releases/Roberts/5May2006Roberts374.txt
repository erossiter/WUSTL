SEN. ROBERTS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING CIA DIRECTOR GOSS' RESIGNATION
  Sen. Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today released the following statement: 
   "Director Goss is a good friend who has made service to our nation his life's work. He began his career as an operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, and he ended it as its Director.
   "Director Goss took the helm of the Intelligence Community at a very difficult time in the wake of the intelligence failures associated with 9/11 and Iraq WMD. Porter made some significant improvements at the CIA, but I think even he would say they still have some way to go.
   "I wish Porter and Mary all the very best as they move on to the next phase of their lives with the sincere thanks of a grateful nation.
   "I look forward to working closely with the President as he considers candidates for the next Director."
