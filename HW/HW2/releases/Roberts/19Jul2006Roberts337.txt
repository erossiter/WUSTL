SENS. ROBERTS, CONRAD INTRODUCE RESOLUTION HONORING PATRIOT GUARD RIDERS
  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), a former Marine, and Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) today introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution, S.RES. 535, to commend the Patriot Guard Riders for shielding mourning military families from protesters, for preserving the memory of fallen service members and for preserving the dignity of their funerals. 
   Senator Roberts said, "On behalf of Kansas and a grateful nation, I thank the volunteers of the Patriot Guard for lifting the spirits of the families, veterans and service members they so revere. Their selfless and patriotic actions for the men and women in uniform who have fallen in combat, and to the families who are left behind are deserving of this resolution."
   The Patriot Guard originated in Kansas to shield military families from protesters at military funerals. Members would line up their motorcycles along funeral procession routes using their engines to drown out the noise and prevent interruptions of protestors. The group has since become a nationwide network of motorcycle organizations volunteering to attend funerals around the country.
   In May, the Senate passed the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, a bill to prohibit demonstrations and picketing of military funeral services. Senator Roberts was an original co-sponsor.
   "As a former Marine," Senator Roberts said, "I am pleased the Senate acted to protect the dignity and honor of military funeral services. Loved-ones of our fallen men and women in uniform have already made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. We must allow them the opportunity to mourn without being thrust into a political circus."
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
