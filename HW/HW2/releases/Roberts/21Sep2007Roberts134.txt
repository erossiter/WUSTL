SEN. ROBERTS: PERU TRADE AGREEMENT APPROVED BY SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced that the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is a member, passed the Peru Free Trade Agreement by a 18-3 vote. 
   "I am pleased the Finance Committee approved this bill important to our Kansas farmers and ranchers," Senator Roberts said. "I am hopeful that this is the beginning of more action on future trade agreements and eventually, trade promotion authority.
   "In Kansas, as it is with the United States as a whole, international trade is important to our state economy. As the top wheat producer with almost half of all wheat produced exported, the importance of opening and expanding foreign markets is crucial to ensuring rural America's survival."
   The Peru Free Trade Agreement (FTA) provides duty free access to 90 percent of current Agriculture exports to Peru. In 2006, almost 32 percent of Kansas's farm economy relied on agricultural exports. Kansas's farm cash receipts total $10 billion and agricultural exports amounted to $3.2 billion.
   Senator Roberts is a member of the Senate Finance Committee and a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
