SEN. ROBERTS SPONSORS NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE RETIREMENT MODERNIZATION ACT
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts has sponsored legislation, The National Guard and Reserve Retirement Modernization Act, to improve retirement benefits for members of the National Guard and Reserves. 
   Senator Roberts said, "This bill updates an effort we began last year to ensure our citizen soldiers, a very important part of our military, receive retention and recruitment benefits closer to those provided to our active duty forces."
   Last year, Senator Roberts co-sponsored and the Senate passed an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill to even out the retirement differences between active duty and members of the National Guard and Reserve. The bill reduced the retirement age for members of the National Guard and Reserve by 3 months for every 90 days of active duty service.
   However, the wording was changed in conference to cover only service performed after the date of the bill's signing. This year, Senator Roberts has cosponsored an updated version of the bill which will make these changes retroactive to September 11, 2001.
   The Naval Reserve Association, the Reserve Enlisted Association, the National Guard Association of the United States, and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard have all stated their support for this effort.
   Senator Roberts, a former Marine, is an outspoken advocate for the quality of life for men and women in uniform and their families. Roberts is a member of the National Guard Caucus.
