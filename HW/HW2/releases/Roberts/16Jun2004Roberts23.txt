SEN. ROBERTS SUPPORTS BILL TO DOUBLE FUNDING FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced his support for The Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004, a bill to double federal funding for research on Alzheimer's Disease, a heartbreaking illness affecting 4.5 million Americans and their families. 
   "Alzheimer's Disease takes a high emotional toll on patients, caregivers and families," Senator Roberts said. "Unfortunately, one in three Americans knows someone in the throws of this tragic disease. We are at a critical point in Alzheimer's research. We need this federal investment to quickly develop memory enhancing treatments, offer support to those that care for patients and set the stage for a dramatic scientific breakthrough to prevent this disease."
   The bipartisan bill, containing 30 cosponsors, was introduced by Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Kit Bond (R-MO) as a tribute to President Ronald Reagan and the Reagan family.
   Key provisions of The Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004 would:
   * Strengthen the federal government's commitment to Alzheimer's Disease research by doubling the funding for Alzheimer's Disease research at the National Institutes of Health (from $700 million to $1.4 billion).
   * Call for a National Summit on Alzheimer's Disease that would bring in the best minds from across the country to examine the NIH's current research agenda for Alzheimer's, future research priorities, and challenges and opportunities for the research community and the public.
   * Provide critical support to caregivers by helping pay for the costs of caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's by providing a tax credit of up to $3,000 for costs like prescription drugs, home health care, and specialized day care. The legislation also makes long term care insurance premiums deductible for all taxpayers.
   * Increase the availability of services such as respite care, home health care, counseling and training. The bill proposes doubling funds for two existing initiatives - the National Caregiver Support Program (from $125 million to $250 million) and the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant Program (from $12 million to $25 million).
   * Increase access to respite care services for caregivers by providing grants to states, nonprofit organizations and others to inform the public about respite care, increase respite care services, and train respite care workers/volunteers.
   * Launch a "News You Can Use" education campaign to get the word out about advances in research. While scientists are working for a cure, this public education campaign will help families and doctors find out the latest information on how to help prevent Alzheimer's disease and how to slow the onset of symptoms. 
   "I have talked with many Kansans who are caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease just as Nancy Reagan cared for our President," Senator Roberts said. "They are real heroes, but they need support, and they want to prevent others from experiencing the long goodbye."
