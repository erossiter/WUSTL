SEN. ROBERTS APPLAUDS JAPAN'S DECISION TO OPEN MARKETS TO U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Pat Roberts today applauded the long overdue decision by the Japanese government to reopen their markets to U.S. beef to cattle 20 months of age and younger. 
   "This is great news for Kansas producers. Based on their own certifications of our facilities and a thorough look at our inspection systems, the Japanese have finally come to accept what we have known all along, that U.S. beef is safe. We must now remain diligent to ensure that the Japanese resume imports in a manner that is quick and consistent with the agreement between our two countries. We must also continue efforts to reopen all international markets to U.S. beef."
   At issue is the delay by the Japanese Food Safety Commission in resuming normal beef trade, based on internationally recognized science, after the discovery in January of spinal cord material in a single shipment of U.S. beef.
   In June, Senator Roberts and Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) introduced legislation to impose tariffs on Japanese products if a date was not set to reopen the Japanese market to U.S. beef.
   "I hope that we won't need to resort to this kind of legislation in the future and that nations adhere to internationally accepted safety standards," Roberts said.
   The Roberts/Conrad legislation set deadlines by which the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) must certify that Japan has reopened its borders to American beef. According to the bill, USTR must provide this certification or lack thereof to Congress by August 31, 2006.
   The beef industry is one of the largest industries in Kansas - representing over $5 billion in annual revenue. Kansas has 6.65 million head of cattle. Cattle represented 59%, over $6 billion, of the 2004 Kansas agricultural cash receipts.
