MEMBERS OF KANSAS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION PLEASED WITH SOUTH LAWRENCE TRAFFICWAY PROGRESS
  U.S. Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Rep. Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) today released the following statement after the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a report supporting the 32nd street route for the South Lawrence Trafficway (SLT): 
   "We are pleased the Federal Highway Administration agreed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decision that the 32nd street route is the only feasible and prudent option for the South Lawrence Trafficway (SLT).
   "Progress on the Corps' and now FHWA approved 32nd Street route for the South Lawrence Trafficway, connecting the southern Kansas City area to I-70, is critical for safety and the economic development of the Kansas Technology Corridor. We must look to the future and make this investment to help create the bio-science and high-tech corridor from Manhattan to Topeka to Lawrence to Kansas City. A South Lawrence Trafficway is needed for efficient and safe transportation.
   "We will continue to support this project at the federal level."
