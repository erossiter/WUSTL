SEN. ROBERTS: $13.2 MILLION IN GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR VALUE-ADDED AGRICULTURAL VENTURES
  Sen. Pat Roberts today announced the availability of $13.2 million in grants to support value-added business ventures that develop alternative sources of renewable energy. 
   Grants are available to independent producers, agricultural producer groups, farmer or rancher cooperatives, and majority-controlled producer-based business ventures. Priority consideration will be given to grant applications that dedicate at least 51 percent of the project costs to planning activities for a bio-energy project.
   Senator Roberts is a strong supporter of value-added agriculture. "It is critical that we enhance the financial well-being of producers and the economic performance of our rural communities," Senator Roberts said. "Value-added agriculture is a win-win-win situation for the environment, the producer and the energy consumer."
   Applications must be received no later than July 26, 2004, and awards will be made on a competitive basis. For more information on rural programs, visit USDA's web site at http://www.rurdev.usda.gov. 
   Senator Robert is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
