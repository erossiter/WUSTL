SENS. ROBERTS, BROWNBACK COMMENT ON HIGHWAY FUNDING FOR KANSAS
  U.S. Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Sam Brownback (R-KS) today remarked on transportation funding for the State of Kansas: 
   "I am aware and concerned about the potential shortfall in future transportation funds affecting Kansas communities," Senator Roberts said. "As a member of the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over the Highway Trust Fund, I am engaged with other Members of Congress working toward a responsible solution. In fact, last week the Committee passed the American Infrastructure Investment and Improvement Act which fills the estimated federal funding gap without raising the gasoline tax. As the process moves forward, I will continue to work closely with KDOT and many local Kansas communities.
   "My position on the Finance Committee ensures rural states like Kansas have a voice in how revenues are raised to meet the needs of our highway system. Kansas has over 135,000 public road miles; a healthy Highway Trust Fund is vital to maintaining the state's high transportation standard. I will continue to support funding options that protect the best interests of Kansas taxpayers."
   Senator Brownback said, "America's transportation infrastructure is one of the main reasons why we have the strongest and most vibrant economy in the world. As a member of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked hard to draft a highway spending bill for FY2008 that fully funds road construction and maintenance programs. Earlier this month, the bill passed the Senate by the wide margin of 88-7. However, the projected shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund beyond FY2008 are worrisome, and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to address this issue in a timely manner."
