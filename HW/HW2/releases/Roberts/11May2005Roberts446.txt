SEN. ROBERTS: SENATE PASSES IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT WITH $90 MILLION IN KANSAS PROJECTS
  Sen. Pat Roberts announced that late last night, the Senate passed the Conference Report for the Fiscal Year 2005 Iraq-Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Bill containing over $90 million for improvements to facilities at Ft.  
 Riley including a new Operational Readiness Training Center. 
   "I am pleased the Senate is recognizing the financial needs associated with standing up a new unit of action brigade at Ft. Riley as well as at other Army installations around the country," Senator Roberts said. "As we begin to look at bringing troops back from overseas military installations, it is important that we continue to provide all of the necessary housing, administration and training facilities for them to carry out their mission." 
   These funds include $75 million for initial construction associated with the 6th Brigade 25th Infantry Division. $50 million of these funds will go towards the purchase of relocatable buildings to help transition the new unit to be activated early next year. In July, 2004, Senator Roberts announced the arrival of the new brigade which will bring approximately 3400 Soldiers to Ft. Riley. 
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services.
