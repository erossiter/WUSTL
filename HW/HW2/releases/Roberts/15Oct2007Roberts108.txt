SEN. ROBERTS ANNOUNCES $550,000 TO UNITED WAY OF WYANDOTTE COUNTY FOR YOUTHBUILD KANSAS CITY
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today announced a $550,000 grant to United Way of Wyandotte County for YouthBuild in Kansas City. 
   YouthBuild serves 16-to-24 year-old disadvantaged youth without a high school diploma by providing job training and education opportunities for at-risk youth while they construct or repair housing for low-income families in their own neighborhoods. Participants will split their time between the construction site and the classroom, where they will earn their GED or high school diploma, learn to be community leaders and prepare for college and other postsecondary training opportunities. YouthBuild includes additional support systems, such as mentoring, employment and personal counseling services. This grant will enroll 64 youth in this program.
   The grant was awarded by the United States Department of Labor. Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
