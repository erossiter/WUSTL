SEN. ROBERTS COMMENTS ON CHIEF USDA ECONOMIST COLLINS' RETIREMENT
  U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) today made the following statement regarding Dr. Keith Collins' retirement from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as Chief Economist: 
   "I offer my appreciation to Dr. Collins for a distinguished career at USDA and his invaluable service to U.S. agriculture. I have known Dr. Collins for years and we have worked closely through many debates over Farm Bills, reforming the Crop Insurance program, and disaster aid packages. Throughout, Dr. Collins has continued to provide professional, unbiased analysis of proposals. His expertise has been and is unmatched. Keith has given the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, as well as those involved in agriculture program policy, sound and solid advice. Both he and his abilities will be sorely missed at USDA. I wish Keith and his family the best."
   Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and former Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.
