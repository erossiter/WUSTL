   Senator Lott said, "These are important initiatives that are a big part of restoring the quality of life and vitality of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

   Details on today's awards are as follows:
   * $4,691,904.56 - City of Biloxi - Parks Recreational Facilities and Other Items. On August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which damaged the 4,824 ft long by 24.5 ft wide old highway 90 fishing pier. The waves from the storm surge destroyed all but one of the 155 / 31 ft sections of the pier deck. This $5,213,227.29 represents the estimated cost to repair the fishing pier to current code consisting of 156 deck sections 31 ft long and 24.5 ft wide with 49 inch guard rail on each side. Each deck section will rest upon concrete pile caps that are in turn each supported by four 14 in square by 75 ft long concrete piles. The pier will support light vehicles of the type used for handicapped and emergency accommodations/
