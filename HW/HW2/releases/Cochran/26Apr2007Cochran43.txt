SENS. COCHRAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE FEMA HOUSING EXTENSION
  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will extend temporary housing assistance for victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by 18 months through March 2009, Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The current extension will expire August 31, 2007.  
   "I am pleased the Federal Emergency Management Agency's has recognized the remaining need for housing assistance along Mississippi's Gulf Coast," Senator Cochran said. "As our citizens work to regain stability, the federal government must continue to provide the resources necessary for them to transition into more permanent housing." 
   Senator Lott said, "This is good news for many hurricane victims who still need this program. The availability of housing along the coast remains an issue, and this initiative certainly has a continued role to play as we seek solutions that will bring more substantial, long-term housing into this market." 
   In addition, FEMA will immediately begin allowing occupants to purchase housing at fair price. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will assume management of rental housing assistance from FEMA on September 1, 2007.
