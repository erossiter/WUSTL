CONGRESS APPROVES FY 2008 APPROPRIATIONS LEGISLATION
  The Senate approved a $512 billion spending bill tonight to fund the federal government for the Fiscal Year ending September 30, 2008, announced Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS). The legislation contains several items of interest to Mississippi.
   "I am pleased Congress has fulfilled its constitutional responsibility to make annual spending decisions for the federal government," Senator Cochran said. "This legislation carries forward the priorities Congress has developed for our nation in consultation with the executive branch, and it will allow individuals, municipalities, and businesses in Mississippi to play a significant role in helping to meet those priorities."
   The final version of the bill contained a provision providing $70 billion in funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Cochran said: "This bill contains important funding to support our soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Because of this legislation our military men and women will be given the resources needed to complete the missions assigned to them by our government. As we begin next year's appropriations process, it is my hope that we can do so with a sincere goal of completing each of the 12 appropriations bills individually, on time, and in a fiscally responsible manner.
