SENS. COCHRAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR GULF COAST SCHOOLS
  Hurricane Katrina assistance totaling nearly $4 million has been released to schools on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, U.S. Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The grants, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), are awarded to Greene County and Gulfport school districts. 
   "Nearly two years after Hurricane Katrina destroyed buildings and livelihoods in South Mississippi, we are still hard at work repairing the damage," Senator Thad Cochran said. "Great progress has been made, but we must always look to the future. This assistance will help restore facilities and amenities used by young people in Gulfport and Greene County and therefore allow students to once again use these venues for learning and enrichment."
   "The return of August reminds us that there is nothing more important than the continued improvement and repair of schools damaged by Hurricane Katrina," said Senator Trent Lott. "Our rebuilding efforts are far from complete, and this welcomed funding will help ensure that our children will have the resources needed for success." 
   Details on the grants are as follows: 
   * $1,135,773.64 Greene County School, Public Buildings - On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina generated hurricane force winds and driving rain which severely damaged the Sandhill Middle School Gymnasium owned by the Greene County School District. The damaged gymnasium was an 11,085 square foot timber frame structure originally built in the 1920's and relocated to the site in the late 1940's. The cost to repair the facility was greater than 50% of the replacement cost qualifying the gymnasium for complete replacement. This $1,135,773.64 is in addition to the $93,457.39 previously funded bringing the total funding for this project to $1,229,231.03. 
   * $2,708,851.29 Gulfport School District, Public Buildings - On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina generated heavy winds, driving rain, and a storm surge which severely damaged the East Ward Community Education and Technology Service Center Building owned by the Gulfport School District. The building was originally built as a 9760 square foot 2 story building in 1921. In 1960 a one story 17,535 square foot addition was added bringing the total area to 27,295 square feet. The building sustained major damage of over 72% qualifying it for complete replacement. This $2,708,851.29 funds the replacement costs less anticipated insurance proceeds of the East Ward Community Education and Technology Service Center Building complying with current codes and standards.
