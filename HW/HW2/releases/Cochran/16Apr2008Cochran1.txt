SEN. COCHRAN COMMEMORATES WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD
  Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) introduced a Senate Resolution today to recognize this week as the Week of the Young Child. The Week of the Young Child is celebrated across the country by hundreds of local organizations working to improve education for all young children. The resolution seeks to emphasize the importance of a child's early years and the need to ensure that all children have positive early development and learning experiences at home, at child care, and at school. 
   In Mississippi, 29.8 percent of children live below the poverty line. Senator Cochran continues to support early childhood education programs such as Head Start and Early Reading First to provide assistance to young children in Mississippi where state-sponsored pre-kindergarten programs are not available.
   "Early childhood development programs are vital to the enhancement of education and quality of life for children in our state," Senator Cochran said. "I am pleased that this week has been designated 'The Week of the Young Child' in order to highlight the importance of early childhood development."
   Senator Ken Salazar (D-CO) joined Senator Cochran in introducing this legislation. The Resolution is expected to be approved by the U.S. Senate by Unanimous Consent.
