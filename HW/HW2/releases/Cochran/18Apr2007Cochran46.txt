SENS. COCHRAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE BILOXI DREDGING PLANS
  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will dredge and clear silt from Biloxi Bay, Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today.  
   "I am pleased the Federal Emergency Management Agency has chosen to classify silt deposited by Hurricane Katrina as debris," Senator Cochran said. "Dredging Biloxi Bay will allow commerce along the coast to return to normal much sooner than expected."
   "While I've been quick to criticize FEMA in the past, I also want to be quick to commend them for making this common sense decision," Senator Lott said. "This is a big step forward for our ongoing hurricane recovery effort, and I'm pleased that FEMA acted promptly on this local request. Having our harbors free and clear of obstructions is very important to our future development."
   FEMA officials are currently working to determine when the necessary funds will be obligated and when work will begin.
