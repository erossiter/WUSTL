SENATE CONFIRMS NOMINATION OF JUDGE AYCOCK
  The nomination of Judge Sharion Aycock to the Northern District of Mississippi was confirmed by the United States Senate today, United States Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced.  
   "The Mississippi legal community has long recognized Judge Aycock's competence as a practitioner and as a judge," Senator Cochran said. "Judge Aycock has earned the respect and admiration of her fellow lawyers and judges who have worked with her and who know her well. She will serve on the federal bench with great distinction."
   Senator Lott said: "Mississippi's federal legal community consists of the best and the brightest our state has to offer, and today we added to the depth of that bench with the Senate's confirmation of Sharion Aycock to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge for North Mississippi. Judge Aycock was the first female president of the Mississippi Bar Foundation and is also the first female jurist from Mississippi to be nominated to the federal bench. It was an honor to speak on her behalf before the Senate Judiciary Committee at her confirmation hearing, and I know that Judge Aycock will serve as a credit both to the federal bench and the State of Mississippi. The Senate has confirmed a qualified judge today, and I look to forward to confirming many more to important seats in Mississippi."
   Aycock is a native of Tremont, Mississippi and has served as Circuit Court Judge for the First Circuit Court District of Mississippi since 2002. She holds degrees from Mississippi State University and the Mississippi College School of Law, and her confirmation makes her the first woman to sit on the federal bench in Mississippi. 
   Cochran and Lott recommended Aycock to President Bush for the Northern District seat in December 2006.
