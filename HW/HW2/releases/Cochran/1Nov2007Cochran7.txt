SEN. COCHRAN MOVES TO ESTABLISH MISSISSIPPI HILLS NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA
  Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) has introduced legislation to establish the Mississippi Hills National Heritage Area. The legislation designates a 30 county area in Mississippi as the Mississippi Hills Heritage Area. The project has been in the developmental stages since 2004. 
   "The hills of Mississippi are rich in unique historical, natural, and cultural characteristics," said Senator Cochran. "This legislation will highlight the wonderful traits of the region and ensure that the story of the Mississippi Hills is preserved and promulgated."
   The National Park Service defines a national heritage area as "a region designated by the United States Congress where natural, cultural, historic and recreational resources combine to form a cohesive, nationally-distinctive landscape arising from patterns of human activity shaped by geography." 
   "This is important news. The Mississippi Hills Heritage Area has gone from concept to formal introduction on the Senate floor. We thank Senators Cochran and Lott and Congressman Wicker for recognizing the potential our region has to become a national heritage area, and for providing leadership in this vital endeavor," said Dr. Gloria Kellum, Vice Chancellor for University Relations at the University of Mississippi and a key project organizer. 
   There are 37 existing national heritage areas.
