SENS. COCHRAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR YAZOO CITY PRISON
  Federal funding totaling $12.5 million will be used towards the expansion of the Yazoo City Federal Correctional Complex, Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The funding, administered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, will aid in the construction of an additional medium to high security facility with a projected capacity of 1,088 inmates.  
   "With this funding, the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons have demonstrated a commitment to reducing inmate overcrowding and improving safety in our federal facilities," Senator Cochran said. "This expansion will help ensure justice is carried out across our nation while also creating job opportunities for citizens in this part of Mississippi." 
   "We need to ensure that our justice system has the capability to deal with those who break the law, and certainly this expansion will help make sure we keep criminals off our streets," Senator Lott said. "Also, there is an economic impact with any project like this, and this area will indeed benefit from the jobs brought to Mississippi by this expansion."
   The total projected cost of the addition to the Yazoo City complex will be between $165 and $195 million.
