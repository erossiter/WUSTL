SENATE PANEL APPROVES MORE THAN $70 MILLION IN AGRICULTURE FUNDING FOR MISSISSIPPI
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved approximately $70 million in agricultural funding to be directed to Mississippi, Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced today. The funding, which includes approximately $52 million in research funding directed to Mississippi universities, is part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Agriculture Appropriations Bill. Cochran serves as the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee.  
   "Almost every community in Mississippi relies on agriculture to maintain its economy and way of life," Senator Cochran said. "We must remain focused on providing those who rely on agriculture, forestry, and wildlife in Mississippi with the research and resources necessary to ensure their work is sustainable and our resources are conserved. I am pleased the committee has recognized these priorities and responded accordingly."
   Noteworthy Mississippi funding in the bill includes $8 million for Agricultural Research Service facility construction, $4 million for resource conservation initiatives, $1.9 million for rural health and safety education, $1.3 million for rural development centers, and $1.2 million for biomass-based energy research. Additionally, $38 million would be provided for nationwide boll weevil eradication efforts. 
   The bill will now be submitted for consideration on the Senate Floor.
