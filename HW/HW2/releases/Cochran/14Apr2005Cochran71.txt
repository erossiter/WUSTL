SEN. COCHRAN ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR ENDING JUDICIAL FILIBUSTERS
  Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced his support today for Majority Leader Frist's plan to end filibusters in blocking judicial nominees.  
   Senator Cochran offered the following statement Thursday morning to the Senate regarding the use of filibusters to block judicial nominees:
   "The continued controversy over Senate confirmation of federal judges needs to be resolved. It promises to hang as a cloud over the Senate unless we reach an understanding of the appropriate role of the Senate.
   "I had been hopeful that the Senate leadership would be able to resolve this issue by reaching an agreement that would be acceptable to both sides. However, that does not now appear likely.
   "Therefore, I have advised the distinguished Majority Leader, Mr. Frist, that I will support him in his effort to bring this confrontation over judicial filibusters to an end.
   "There should be no question in anyone's mind about my intentions. I will work in concert with our leader, and with the distinguished Majority Whip, Mr. McConnell, to end filibusters of judicial nominations in the Senate."
