SENS. COCRHAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE $1.14 MILLION FOR WAVELAND UTILITIES
  The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide Waveland, Miss. with $1.14 million to assist in replacing gas lines and distribution equipment damaged by Hurricane Katrina, Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. 
   "It has been well over two years since Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and caused catastrophic and unprecedented damage," Senator Cochran said. "Our citizens and their cities and counties have worked so hard to rebuild, but federal assistance is still needed. Without essential utilities and infrastructure, cities like Waveland cannot completely regain the quality of life and business it once had. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has recognized this need, and I am excited to hear that Waveland can take one more important step forward in the long recovery process."
   "Hancock County and Waveland, in particular, suffered the brunt of Hurricane Katrina's brutal blow, and certainly this funding is helping to rebuild Waveland and again make it a great community to live, work and raise a family," Senator Lott said. "Reconstructing Waveland's public infrastructure is a critical component of Waveland's revitalization, and I'm pleased we were able to secure this federal funding." 
   Waveland gas lines suffered extensive damage due to saltwater corrosion and uprooted trees. The funding will provide for pressure testing of the high-pressure main line, repair and capping of existing branches off the main line, re-establishment of easements, and installation of a high-density polyethylene main line, service lines, and termination caps.
