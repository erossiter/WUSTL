PRESIDENT NOMINATES SEN. COCHRAN'S LONG-TIME CHIEF OF STAFF KEENUM FOR USDA UNDER SECRETARY POSITION
  Today President George W. Bush announced his intention to nominate Sen. Thad Cochran's long-time Chief of Staff Mark E. Keenum, Ph.D., of Corinth to be Under Secretary of Agricultural for Farm and Foreign Agriculture Services.  
   "Mark has been an able member of my staff for the past 17 years, including serving the past 10 years as my Chief of Staff," said Cochran. "As an advisor to me on agricultural issues, he worked closely on the 1990, 1996, and the 2002 Farm Bills, and this experience will benefit the Administration greatly in preparation for reauthorization of the next Farm Bill. His experience on Capitol Hill and his background in Agricultural Economics make him an outstanding nominee to be an Under Secretary of Agriculture. I have confidence in his professional ability and in him personally. Mark is an excellent choice for this position, and I look forward to voting on his nomination soon."
   Prior to serving as Chief of Staff for Cochran, Dr. Keenum served as Assistant Professor and Economist of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Mississippi State University. He has also worked as a Research Associate with the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station. Dr. Keenum received his bachelor's degree, master's degree, and Ph.D. from Mississippi State University. He is married to the former Rhonda Newman, of Booneville, who serves as Deputy Assistant to the President of the United States and Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison. They currently reside in Alexandria, VA, and have four children.
