SENS. COCHRAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE HURRICANE RECOVERY GRANTS
  Federal funding totaling more than $5 million has been awarded for Hurricane Katrina recovery costs, Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The grants, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), are awarded to Hancock County to cover costs associated with debris removal and to Harrison County to assist with reconstruction of the Gulfport Library.
   "I am pleased the Federal Emergency Management Agency has recognized the level of damage Hurricane Katrina caused to the Gulfport Library," Senator Cochran said. "Federal assistance both with the library's reconstruction as well debris removal remains essential to ensuring life and learning along Mississippi's Gulf Coast remain strong despite the difficulties caused by the storm."  
   "Hancock and Harrison counties in particular were faced with an unprecedented task of removing debris in the initial months following Katrina, and this funding will certainly help both counties offset the tremendous expenses incurred during time," Senator Lott said. "This funding will also enable the reconstruction of the Gulfport Library, a very important public facility, and its rebuilding represents a significant step forward in this community's recovery." 
   Details on today's award are as follows:
   * $2,317,127.18 - Harrison County - Public Buildings. On August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a high tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, severely damaging the Gulfport Library in Harrison County. The two-story, 43,664SF, reinforced concrete frame facility was constructed in 1965 and was fully functional and the time of the disaster. The repair estimate is roughly 61% of the estimate to replace the facility, qualifying the Library for complete replacement. In order to replace the facility in kind, the scope of work includes concrete footings and foundations, a six inch concrete slab, reinforced concrete structure, tinted glass storefront, built up bituminous roof with ballast, painted concrete block and ceramic wall finishes, carpet floor finishes, one elevator with lift, standard plumbing and fixtures, water distribution, standard sprinklers, electrical services, standard HVAC, and one security system. This $2,574,585.76 is additional funding for costs associated with applying the CEF and for elevating the structure above the ABFE. This brings the total funding for this project to $4,367,570.00 which is less anticipated insurance proceeds. 
   * $1,619,114.67 - Hancock County - Debris Removal. On August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 - 25 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The storm caused severe widespread damage and debris throughout Hancock County posing an immediate threat to public health and safety. This $1,799,016.30 is the estimated cost to remove, haul and dispose of debris that remains a threat in the City of Bay St. Louis and Hancock County Right-of-ways and Public Property. The estimated cost is based on the contractor loading, hauling and disposing of approximately 137,307 CY of construction and demolition debris, approximately 2744 CY of concrete debris, and approximately 612 CY of white goods and appliance debris remaining or being brought to the right-of-way. This project is being funded at a 90% FEMA cost share of $1,619,114.67 for work performed as of July 1, 2006 and is expected to be completed by the June 30, 2007, debris removal FEMA funding deadline. 
   * $1,138,993.29 - Hancock County - Debris Removal. On August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina generated wind in excess of 120 MPH and a 20 - 25 foot tidal surge along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The storm caused severe widespread damage throughout, including private residential structures in Hancock County posing an immediate threat to public health and safety. This $1,265,548.10 is the estimated cost to demolish and dispose of debris from approximately 350 structures that remain a threat in the City of Bay St. Louis and Hancock County. The estimated cost is based on the contractor demolishing, loading, hauling and disposing of approximately 64,079 CY of construction and demolition debris, approximately 21,388 CY of potential Asbestos containing debris, and approximately 300 CY of white goods and appliance debris.
