SENATE APPROVES SEN. COCHRAN TROOP FUNDING AMENDMENT
  The Senate approved an amendment today introduced by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) expressing that Congress should provide President Bush with troop funding legislation he can sign by the end of the month. The amendment, which the Senate approved by voice vote, was added to the Water Resources and Development Act, which could be voted on by the Senate later today.  
   The Cochran Amendment expressed the sense of the Senate that Congress should send legislation to the President providing appropriations for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in a manner that the President can sign into law by not later than May 28, 2007.
   It furthermore expressed that the Senate makes the following findings:
   * The President is commander in chief of U.S. Armed Forces. 
   * The U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq are in the interest of U.S. national security. 
   * The funds previously appropriated to continue military operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
  Freedom are depleted. 
   * The President requested supplemental appropriations more than 100 days ago. 
   * Congress has not passed a supplemental appropriations bill in a form that the commander in chief believes gives the United States and the Iraqi people the best chance for success. 
   * A supplemental funding bill should remain focused on the war effort by providing the resources necessary for U.S. troops
   Prior to Senate approval, Senator Cochran gave the following remarks on the floor of the Senate in support of his amendment:
   "Mr. President, I hope the Senate will be able to support my amendment...It all comes down to saying that the Senate should give the President what he's asked for in terms of supplemental appropriations.
   "This includes appropriations to fund the activities in Iraq that would protect our soldiers, that would put into the field new equipment and armaments, that would help us reduce the level of casualties, and that would make it less likely that American soldiers are going to die on the battlefield. 
   "We don't need to continue to drag this out. This request has been submitted to the Senate and to the House, and it still has not been approved?It's supplemental funding to replace funds that have been exhausted in the regular fiscal year appropriations to add what the military needs. I have a letter from Secretary Gates which specifically says, 
   "The situation increases the readiness risk of our military. With each passing day, should the nation require the use of these forces prior to the funding becoming available, delay negatively impacts our forces in the field by needlessly delaying the accelerated fielding of capabilities such as the mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle and counter-IED technologies."
   "So my hope is the Senate will approve my amendment, and let's get on with supporting the President's initiative to bring this war to a successful conclusion."
