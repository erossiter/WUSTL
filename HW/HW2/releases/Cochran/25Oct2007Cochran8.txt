   "Agriculture is the largest industry in Mississippi. The farm bill is critical to the continued success of the agricultural industries and the viability of rural communities in the state," said Cochran. "I am pleased that this bill continues farm income safety net programs, maintains conservation initiatives, and expands nutrition programs for our nation's most needy citizens."
