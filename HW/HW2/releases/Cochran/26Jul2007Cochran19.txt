SENATE APPROVES HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Senate tonight approved the FY 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. Included in the legislation was significant funding for border security and immigration enforcement as well as an amendment sponsored by Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) that would expedite the release of approximately $2 billion in previously appropriated funds to make homes, schools, businesses, and other public infrastructure along the Gulf Coast more storm-proof. 
   "I am encouraged by the steps taken by the Senate tonight to provide funding to secure our nation's borders and protect against illegal immigration. This legislation will allow the United States to hire new Border Patrol agents and purchase the detention beds necessary to hold illegal immigrants in custody," Senator Cochran said. "I am also pleased the Senate recognized the importance of ensuring that federal dollars appropriated for hurricane recovery along the Gulf Coast are made available to the people and communities who need them. A disaster of such unprecedented magnitude requires us to remain flexible as we continue to assist in recovery." 
   The amendment introduced by Cochran would make a technical change to the way the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approves its release of Hazard Mitigation Program Grants (HMPG). The grants are used to strengthen infrastructure in preparation for future disasters. 
   In the case of Hurricane Katrina, the HMPG precertification process would have caused such a delay that most homeowners and communities forfeited the assistance in order to rebuild in a timely manner. Therefore a large portion of funding previously approved by the Senate in Hurricane Katrina emergency appropriations bills was essentially inaccessible to those for whom it was intended. 
   The Cochran Amendment allows those who would have been eligible under precertification to become eligible for the assistance retroactively. Of the $2 billion that would be made available by the Cochran Amendment, $450 million would be for Mississippi. The Cochran Amendment was co-sponsored by Senator Trent Lott (R-MS).
   In addition to expediting the release of HMPG funds to the Gulf Coast, the bill included several other provisions important to Mississippi. The Department of Homeland Security recently selected Flora, Mississippi as one of five finalists for the location of the National Bio and Agrodefense Facility (NBAF). The bill includes $11 million for the Department of Homeland Security to continue site evaluation and selection for NBAF.
   The Senate also added an amendment providing $3 billion in emergency funding to further improve border and immigration security.
