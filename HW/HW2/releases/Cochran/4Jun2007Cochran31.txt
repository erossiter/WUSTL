SENS. COCHRAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE COASTAL PROTECTION GRANT
  Federal funding totaling more than $1.1 million has been awarded to the State of Mississippi for coastal management, Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The grant, administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is awarded for coastal resources assistance and outreach as well as restoration of the state's Coastal Preserves following Hurricane Katrina.  
   "The wildlife and waters along our coast are some of our state's most precious resources," Senator Cochran said. "This award will help the State of Mississippi ensure that these important resources are properly managed, maintained and publicized. Additionally, I am pleased the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has recognized the importance of assisting our state in rehabilitating our coastal environment following the impact of Hurricane Katrina." 
   "This is an important annual award that helps our state continue a number of programs that support a healthy coastline and marine environment," Senator Lott said. "This year's funding will help continue Hurricane Katrina recovery and restoration efforts involving our Marine Resources, including efforts to promote more public awareness of Mississippi's unique coastal assets."
   This award will provide aid for Coastal Zone Management permitting, the Coastal Preserves Programs, legal assistance, education and outreach programs, technical assistance, and the Comprehensive Resource Management Plan Smart Growth Conference. More specifically, it will include funding to produce six television programs to promote public awareness of the types of coastal management activities that take place in Mississippi. Funds will also aid in post-Hurricane Katrina redevelopment efforts, including restoration plans for the Coastal Preserves and a public access facility redevelopment management plan.
