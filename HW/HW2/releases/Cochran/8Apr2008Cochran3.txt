SENS. COCHRAN, WICKER ANNOUNCE OVER $11 MILLION FOR MISSISSIPPI AIRPORTS
  Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker announced today that the Department of Transportation has released over $11 million in funding for airports across the state of Mississippi. Funding for the grants, administered by the Federal Aviation Administration, was provided through the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill.
   "Our airports are critical to our state's ability to support and attract both small rural businesses and large industry," said Sen. Cochran. "We must continue to build and maintain our aviation infrastructure to compete in today's global economy. I am pleased that the federal government continues to recognize the need for assistance in Mississippi." 
   "Local airports are an asset to both large and rural communities in Mississippi," Sen. Wicker said. "This federal funding will help strengthen these airports and their community's economic development efforts by increasing safety and efficiency through improved airport infrastructure"
