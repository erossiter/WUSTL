SEN. COCHRAN SPEAKS ON TOYOTA DECISION
  Sen. Thad Cochran praised today's announcement of Northeast Mississippi as the home of Toyota's newest automobile manufacturing plant. The plant, which will be located at the intersection of Lee, Union, and Pontotoc Counties, will create an estimated 2,000 new jobs for the region by the time it opens in 2009.  
   "Toyota's decision to locate in Northeast Mississippi represents a significant milestone for this region," Senator Cochran said. "The plant will make an unprecedented impact on the state's economy by energizing the workforce and helping to fuel further economic development. Northeast Mississippians should be proud that the leaders of Toyota recognized the strong work ethic and hospitable environment that thrives in this area of our state."
