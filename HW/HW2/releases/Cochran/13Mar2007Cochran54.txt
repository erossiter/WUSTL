SENS. COCHRAN, LOTT ANNOUNCE HURRICANE RECOVERY GRANTS
  Federal funding totaling more than $7.1 million has been awarded for Hurricane Katrina recovery costs, Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The grants, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), are awarded to the City of Waveland, Jackson County, the Long Beach Port Commission and St. Stanislaus College Prep for costs associated with hurricane recovery. 
   "I am pleased with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's release of additional recovery funding," Senator Cochran said. "Our communities and citizens along the Coast deserve adequate help, not only to recover from the devastation of Katrina and Rita, but also to prepare for emergencies that may lie ahead."  
   Senator Lott said, "We continue to work with FEMA and other appropriate federal agencies to secure funding needed for Mississippi's ongoing recovery. These projects directed at our ports, schools and overall emergency preparedness will certainly bring the Gulf Coast Community a step closer to renewal." 
   Details on today's awards are as follows:
   * $2,682,473.85 - City of Waveland - Recreational or Other. On August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina made landfall along the Mississippi Gulf Coast generating wind speeds in excess of 120 mph along with a tidal surge in excess of 24 feet. Storm water and heavy winds caused extensive damage to the City of Waveland's Garfield Ladner Memorial Recreational Pier. The wood constructed pier consisted of an 800 feet long elevated walking deck supported by piles and having bench seating. It also was the site of the Bait Shop and Ranger Station structures. Adjacent to the pier was a paved shore side approach roadway which had seven location dependent structures. Six were Pagoda Pavilions and the seventh was a restroom facility. Replacement will include renewal of electrical and plumbing utility hook-ups including lighting and sanitary facilities and complete roadway reconstruction. Reconstruction of six 21 ft by 27 ft Pagoda Pavilions, one 15 ft by 30 ft Men's and Women's restroom facility, one 800 ft long 10 ft wide rip-rap protected concrete pile supported 12 ft elevated pier with 20 ft by 70 ft T head, a 15 ft by 15 ft Bait Shop and 21 ft by 29.5 ft Ranger Station. The cost will restore the Garfield Ladner Memorial Recreational Pier to its pre-disaster design, capacity, and function, including required code upgrades and hazard mitigation. The total projected cost estimate is $2,980,526.50. This $2,980,526.50 represents the estimated cost and includes a Hazard Mitigation Proposal of $271,662.46.
   * $1,611,536.74 - St Stanislaus College Prep - Debris. The St. Stanislaus College Preparatory Campus suffered damage from 140 MPH sustained hurricane force winds, heavy rain and a 25 foot storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico. Debris generated from the storm filled the entire campus grounds and presented an immediate threat to public health and safety. Due to the campus layout and the amount of debris present laborers collected the debris by hand and wheel barrow into piles. Heavy equipment then gathered the debris and moved it to the staging area. An estimated 113,400 cubic yards of vegetative and construction and demolition debris was collected and hauled to a staging area for proper removal and disposal by the USACE. All work included on this Project Worksheet was completed between the dates of 8/29/05 and 9/25/05 and is funded at the 100% Federal Cost Share. This $1,611,536.74 is the project cost to remove immediate health and safety hazards returning the grounds to pre-disaster condition.
   * $1,441,829.90 - Jackson County - Emergency Preparedness Measures. Hurricane Katrina resulted in significant flooding in Jackson County, MS. As a result, emergency protective measures were undertaken by the roads department that required additional equipment, materials and overtime hours for certain Jackson County employees. These items were necessary to restore the city infrastructure, establish shelters, points of distribution and secure a safe environment for the city populace. It was also necessary to remove debris that posed an immediate threat to the safety of the general public. The emergency protective measures activity also included the demolition, removal of structures and asbestos inspection that posed an immediate threat to the safety of the general public. The cost for Force Account Equipment, Labor, Material and Asbestos Inspections is estimated at $1,441,829.90.
   * $1,384,902.81 - Long Beach Port Commission - Harbor. Hurricane force winds and tidal surge generated by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused major damage (over 93%) and crippled boat service and docking facilities at the Long Beach Harbor. To return the Long Beach Harbor to its pre-disaster condition, repair, replacement and disposal of damaged pilings, fishing decks, covered shelter, boat launches, fuel dock, all electrical outlets, water supply, navigational aids, fencing and security lighting will have to be completed. To minimize the impact, repairs will be performed in two phases: demolition and repair of the North pier sections in phase 1 and the South pier sections in phase 2. Estimated repairs of $1,538,780.90 to complete phases will be competitively bid. Proposed Hazard Mitigation in the amount of $266,034.00 is included in the estimated cost for expansion of rip-rap coverage to protect and baffle harbor approaches and entrance from wave action.
