SEN. SALAZAR'S STATEMENT ON JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S RETIREMENT
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on Justice O'Connor's retirement announcement today. 
   "I congratulate Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on her announcement that she will retire from the United States Supreme Court. When Justice O'Connor was appointed, she became the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court in the Court's 191 year history. Indeed, she blazed the path for women everywhere to positions of power and authority in the legal and other professions.
   Even more significantly, Justice O'Connor has served the American people with distinction, courage and honor for twenty four years, deciding many important issues that affect our lives every day. I salute Justice O'Connor for her service to the nation.
   I look forward to very careful and full deliberations in the Senate to examine the qualifications of any eventual nominee in fulfilling the Senate's constitutional duty to advise the President and give consent to the nomination. It is my hope that the President will follow through with his pledge to consult with the Senate to ensure the selection of a nominee that Coloradans and the nation can welcome and be confirmed with strong bipartisan support."
