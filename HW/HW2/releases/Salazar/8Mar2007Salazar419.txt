SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES HEARING FOR THREE COLORADO NATIONAL PARKS BILLS, NATIONAL LATINO MUSEUM BILL
  Sen. Ken Salazar today announced that four bills he introduced this year are tentatively scheduled to receive hearings before the Senate Energy Committee's National Parks Subcommittee later this month. Sen. Salazar is scheduled to act as Chairman of the hearing. 
   The four Colorado bills currently scheduled for review on March 20, 2007 are:
   * S. 126, the Mesa Verde National Park Boundary Adjustment Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Allard and Salazar to expand Mesa Verde National Park by incorporating the 324-acre Henneman property (the Hennemans are willing sellers and the National Park Service supports this effort) and 38-acre Mesa Verde Foundation property, both adjacent to the Park. Doing so would protect ancient Puebloan sites and artifacts and several hundred year old pinon-juniper covered hills bordering the Park;
   * S. 443, the Sangre de Cristo National Heritage Area Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator Salazar to preserve the cultural and natural heritage of the San Luis Valley in Conejos, Costilla and Alamosa counties;
   * S. 444, the South Park National Heritage Area Act, introduced by Senator Salazar to preserve South Park by protecting 19 working ranches and 17,000 acres along the headwaters of the South Platte River; and
   * S. 500, the Latino Museum Commission Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator Salazar and 21 other Senators to establish a Commission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of the American Latino Community in Washington, D.C.
   "This is an exciting opportunity to move forward on several important issues for Coloradans," said Senator Salazar. "Conserving our heritage, be it natural, cultural or historical, is one of the most important things we can do as a Nation."
   Later this month, Senator Salazar will release more specifics on time and location of the hearing and the list of witnesses scheduled to testify on behalf of his legislation.
