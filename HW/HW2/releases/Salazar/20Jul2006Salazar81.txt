SEN. SALAZAR VOTES TO REAUTHORIZE HISTORIC VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Sen. Ken Salazar today proudly cast his vote to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and spoke on the floor in support of the measure. 
   On the floor of the Senate, Senator Salazar said, "I am extremely pleased that the Senate is poised to take action on this important reauthorization measure today.
   "Without enforcement and accountability of our Nation's voting laws for ALL Americans, the maxim of one person - one vote, enshrined in our elected laws, are little more than empty words," said Senator Salazar.

   At the request of Senator Salazar, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) offered an amendment in the Judiciary Committee yesterday adding César Ch?vez's name to the title of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Famed civil rights leader César Ch?vez spent his life's work fighting for the rights of America's poor and vulnerable through the power of democracy.
   In a bipartisan and unanimous 18-0 vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and César E. Ch?vez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 yesterday. The House-passed bill, which does not include this title change, is pending in the Senate today.
   "César Ch?vez is an American hero. He sacrificed his life to empower the most vulnerable in America," said Senator Salazar. "César Ch?vez believed strongly in the democracy of America and saw the right to vote as a cornerstone of our freedom. It is fitting that his name be a part of the process of reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act."
