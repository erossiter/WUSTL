SEN. SALAZAR: ARMY NEEDS TO PRESENT SOUND 'WIN-WIN' PLAN FOR PINON CANYON EXPANSION
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar sent a letter to Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, stating that, "before entering the environmental impact statement process, the Army needs to present a sound, defensible plan for expansion that articulates how it will provide real economic benefits to the affected communities." 
   In the letter, Senator Salazar wrote, "In a recent meeting with Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment Keith Eastin, I shared my vision for how the Army might construct a win-win solution. Specifically, I asked him to examine the possibility of permanently stationing a brigade at the maneuver site in a Fort Carson Annex. This arrangement could provide benefits to the Army, which is looking to expand by six brigades, and benefits to local communities, which would finally see a long-term benefit from the Army's presence in southeastern Colorado."
   Also in the letter, Senator Salazar asked that the Army evaluate his suggestions on the permanent stationing of a brigade at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. Senator Salazar asked the Army to provide a response within 30 days to assist him and his Senate colleagues as they consider the Department of Defense budget request for Fiscal Year 2008.
