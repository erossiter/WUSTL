SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON BRIEFING ON POST-DEPLOYMENT ISSUES AT FORT CARSON
  Sen. Salazar's Pikes Peak region staff attended a two-day Post-Deployment Issues briefing at Fort Carson near Colorado Springs, Colorado. Sen. Salazar released the following statement after the conclusion of the briefing today. 
   "Fort Carson officials assured my Pikes Peak regional staff today that they are reviewing their Congressional inquiries process in order to ensure they are getting factual information to Congressional offices in a timely manner. They also assured my staff that they will get us factual and appropriate responses for inquiries we have on several ongoing individual cases.
   "My staff also heard from the soldiers themselves and their family members about the stigma surrounding mental health treatment in the military and that many times their injuries are treated only with larges doses of medication and nothing else. We owe it to our soldiers and their families to provide them the best care available.
   "I continue to believe that the challenges of diagnosing and treating PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, and mental health issues affecting our men and women in uniform are system-wide and not confined to any one installation. I hope today's briefing and inquiry will shed light on what is working and what can be improved in the treatment of soldiers at Fort Carson and that these lessons will help improve care across all services. I will continue to push for additional attention and action on these issues and am hopeful that the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs and the Senate Armed Services Committee will soon hold joint hearings on the mental health issues related to combat in our Armed Forces, as I have requested."
