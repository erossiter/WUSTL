SEN. SALAZAR'S ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE RESIGNATION OF U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL ALBERTO GONZALES
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement on the resignation of United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
   "I had called for Alberto Gonzales' resignation several months ago. With his resignation today, I am hopeful that the American people can have their confidence restored in the Department of Justice. This is an opportunity for a fresh start and I look forward to the President bringing new leadership to a Department that has become overly politicized."
