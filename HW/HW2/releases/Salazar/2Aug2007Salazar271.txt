SENS. SALAZAR, MARTINEZ INTRODUCE PUERTO RICO DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2007
  Building off of feedback received from Congressional hearings last year, today, U.S. Senators Ken Salazar and Mel Martinez introduced the Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007- a bill to assist Puerto Rico in a decision-making process about its future relationship with the United States. 
   "The time has come for the United States Congress to offer Puerto Ricans an opportunity to decide their fate," said Senator Salazar. "Introduced in a bipartisan fashion, this bill will provide a means for the 4 million people of Puerto Rico to self-determine the ultimate status of their island," Sen. Salazar said.
   "This seeks to move the process forward to find a resolution in determining the ultimate status of the island. It will rightly put the democratic process in the hands of the Puerto Rican people," Martinez said. "For too long the question of status has gone unanswered, the Puerto Rican people deserve a solution."
   The Salazar-Martinez bill would designate a deadline for a federally-sanctioned process to occur that will provide an opportunity for Puerto Ricans to choose whether they would like to maintain their present status, seek independence, become a State, or become a nation in free association with the United States.
