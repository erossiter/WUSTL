SEN. SALAZAR: PEOPLE OF PUEBLO DESERVE FAIRER SHAKE ON PUEBLO CHEMICAL PLANT
  Sen. Ken Salazar responded to a letter today from the Department of Defense which stated the DOD would continue studying alternatives for the Pueblo Chemical-Agent Destruction Pilot Plant.
   "I am very disappointed that some in the Pentagon still want to proceed with studying something that is illegal and will not happen. This contradicts what Senator Allard and I were told less than one month ago. The people of Pueblo deserve a fairer shake than they are getting, and I will work with Senator Allard and Congressman Salazar to ensure they do."
