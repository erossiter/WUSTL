SEN. SALAZAR TO VOTE FOR SECURE BORDERS, IMPROVED HOMELAND SECURITY, NATION'S MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar will vote today for two bills, which will help secure the borders, improve homeland security and support our men and women in uniform. Both bills include a number of provisions authored and supported by Senator Salazar, including one focused on improving the communications capabilities of first responders.
   "Homeland security is just political rhetoric without the provisions in these two bills," said Senator Salazar. "I am proud to support these bills and the amendments and funds for Colorado they contain. Our first responders do not have the communications tools they need to respond to large-scale catastrophes; our inspection procedures of agricultural products entering our country are inadequate. The amendments I authored in the DHS bill address both these needs." 
   Of the DHS amendments authored by Senator Salazar, one addresses the communications capabilities of emergency first responders by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to Congress on the steps necessary to achieve effective emergency communication at all levels of government. Salazar's second amendment requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to Congress on measures being taken to improve the inspection of agricultural products entering the United States. A recent report from the non-partisan General Accountability Office called into question the effectiveness of DHS' inspection of passengers and cargo.
   The DOD spending bill contains more than $200 million in projects for Colorado, including $216 million to be shared between Pueblo Chemical Depot and a similar depot in Kentucky for clean-up of those facilities. A full list of Colorado projects that Senator Salazar worked on are listed below.
   The bills, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act for FY2007 and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2007 will go to the President for his expected signature.
   The FY 2007 Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5631), includes the following provisions requested by and fought for by Senator Salazar:
   * $216 million for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (ACWA) program. The money will be utilitized for Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation of the ACWA program and will be shared between the Pueblo Chemical Depot and Bluegrass, Kentucky sites. 
   * $3.9 million for NORAD and STRATCOM for the development of the Single Integrated Space Picture. 
   * $1.1 million for the Air Force's Advanced Power Technology Office (APTO) for the research and development of high-performance, low-cost modular energy systems for hybrid and electric vehicles. 
   * $1.65 million for the development of a Respiratory Biodefense Initiative at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, CO. 
   * $1.4 million for Schriever Air Force Base to replace their ground space electronic security system. 
   * $800 thousand for the United States Air Force Academy to rehabilitate and upgrade its aging static aircraft displays across the campus. 
   * $4 million nationally for the Civil Air Patrol, which had been hurt by proposed cuts to its overall budget. 
   * $6 million for the Minuteman III Propulsion Replacement Program, to be carried out by Northrop-Grumman. This replaces the aging propellant in Minuteman III rocket motors in order to keep the current fleet operational. Wyoming's F.E. Warren Air Force Base has some of these missiles. 
   * $2 million for the development of copper, lightweight induction motors for the military to be carried out by Vforge in Lakewood, CO. Copper rotors result in more efficient motors, meaning they can be smaller and lighter than traditional motors. 
   * $1.1 million for the Deployable Structures Experiment, to be carried out by Microsat in Littleton, CO. The experiment seeks to reduce the design time, cost, and size of satellites in order to allow tactical satellite launches for battlespace management. 
   * $1.4 million for Special Operations Command to develop an air-dropped sensor needed for clandestine missions. This is to be carried out by ADA Technologies in Littleton, CO. 
   * $1 million for the Medical Image Database Holographic Archiving Library System (MIDHALS), which seeks to store, distribute, and retrieve medical documents for the administration of timely medical care for soldiers. Companies to receive funding for this program include Sun Microsystems in Louisville, CO and InPhase Technologies in Longmont, CO. 
   * $2 million for Combat Support Hospital tents, to be produced by Alaska Structures in Delta, CO, which provide state-of-the-art field medical hospitals. 
   * $1.1 million for Polyimide Macro-electromechanical Systems (PMEMS), to be carried out by Ball Aerospace in Boulder and Jefferson Counties, which seeks to save the government money by dramatically reducing the cost of phased arrays for multiple applications and frequency bands. The phased array systems are estimated to save the Navy $88 million dollars for every ship they are used on.
