SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON MIDDLE EAST SITUATION
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding escalating events in the Middle East. 
   "I support Israel's right to defend herself. At the same time, I am deeply concerned about escalating violence in the region, and hope that responsible Israeli, Palestinian, and Lebanese leaders can find a way to de-escalate the conflict and eventually move the region back onto a peaceful path toward a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   "I strongly support American leadership and intense diplomatic engagement toward that end, and I urge President Bush to send a high-level delegation to the region that might be led by former Presidents Bush and Clinton to help bring about an end to this crisis.
   "Recent events have led me to vividly recall standing at the Israeli-Lebanese border in 2003, watching Hezbollah taunt the Israelis with graphic pictures of captured Israeli soldiers. I thought then, and continue to believe now, that the deplorable behavior and provocations of the very worst actors must not be allowed to dictate events in the region."
