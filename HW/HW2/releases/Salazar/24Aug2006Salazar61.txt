SEN. SALAZAR SUGGESTS PUBLIC PROCESS TO CREATE DOMINGUEZ/ESCALANTE CONSERVATION AREA ON WESTERN SLOPE
  Sen. Ken Salazar wrote to the county commissioners of Delta, Mesa and Montrose counties, suggesting a public process to consider creating a National Conservation Area (NCA) for the Dominguez and Escalante area. Recently, roadless areas and other public lands across Colorado and particularly on the Western Slope have been leased for oil and gas drilling, raising the alarm that permanent protection of some of our public lands for the purpose of resource protection and recreational, grazing and other uses is in jeopardy. 
   In the letter Senator Salazar states that an NCA designation would, "place this area within the BLM-managed National Landscape Conservation System, which receives a greater share of resources and funding for recreation and resource protection than other BLM lands."
   Senator Salazar also highlighted that a locally-driven public process would help determine whether a National Conservation Area designation might be appropriate for this area. "Local communities are on the front-lines of the battle for the future of our Nation's public lands; they should be involved in the framework of any decision that affects the public lands in and around their areas," according to Senator Salazar.
   Senator Salazar's proposed NCA would include parcels of lands west of Delta and Montrose, and south of Grand Junction, including Dominguez and Escalante Canyons, Cactus Park, and tens of thousands of acres managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service.
