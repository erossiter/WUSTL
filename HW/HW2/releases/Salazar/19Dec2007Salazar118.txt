SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON MEDICARE AGREEMENT AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE EXTENSION FUNDING
  United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding the bi-partisan agreement reached on the Medicare extension package which passed the Senate by unanimous consent yesterday. The agreement would delay for six months a 10 percent cut to Medicare physician payment rates that is slated to occur on January 1st. The package also extends funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program for the next fifteen months. 
   On Medicare Agreement: "Today, we were able to reach an agreement on a temporary path forward to address time-sensitive issues in Medicare. When we return in January, we should commit ourselves to crafting responsible Medicare legislation that includes appropriate reforms to ensure continued access to high quality services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, address the unique needs of beneficiaries in rural areas, and preserve the long term fiscal viability of the Medicare program."
   On Children's Health Insurance Program: "While I am glad that we didn't leave the current children in the program out in the cold, we must continue the fight to provide access to quality health insurance for the millions of children across our Nation, including the thousands of children in Colorado who still do not have coverage. Investing in our children's health and well being today will pay off in the future."
