SEN. SALAZAR SECURES FUNDING FOR KEY PRIORITIES IN THE HIGH PLAINS REGION; OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL PASSES IN SENATE
  Tonight, by a vote of 76 to 17 the United States Senate passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that he secured funding for key priorities in the High Plains region in the bill. The funding Senator Salazar secured improves transportation infrastructure, provides funds for local law enforcement, supports our military and veterans and increases access to health care. 
   "I am proud that this bill helps meet the needs of Colorado's communities," said Senator Salazar. "These investments are vital to the High Plains region including farmers, ranchers, and rural families."
   Below is a list of key projects that Senator Salazar included in the bill for the High Plains region:
   * Mileage Reimbursement for Veterans: The omnibus includes $125 million in funding that Senators Tester and Salazar added as an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Administration appropriations bill to support a long-overdue mileage reimbursement increase for veterans to 28.5 cents per mile. Currently, veterans living in rural areas who travel long distances to receive medical care are only reimbursed at 11 cents per mile. 
   * $147,600 for Wastewater Treatment Improvements in the Town of Eckley: This funding will help modernize the Town of Eckley's wastewater system to bring it into compliance with federal and state regulations, including arsenic regulations. 
   * $530,000 for the Akron Agriculture Research Station (ARS): The Akron ARS specializes in bio-diesel research, dry land drought-mitigation research, and alternative plant breeding. This funding will allow the Akron ARS to hire and support an alternative crop breeder with an emphasis on oilseeds; establish facilities for the new alternative plant breeding program; and develop an on-farm bio-diesel project. 
   The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 will be sent back to the House of Representatives for final passage. It is expected to be sent to the President's desk by the end of the week.
