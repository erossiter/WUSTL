SEN. SALAZAR CONGRATULATES COLORADO ON BEING SELECTED TO HOST 2008 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement announcing the selection of Denver as the site for the 2008 Democratic National Convention: 
   "I am extremely pleased that the Democratic National Committee has chosen Colorado to host the 2008 Democratic National Convention.
   "This Convention will bring millions of dollars of revenue into the Colorado economy, and showcase the wonders of the Centennial State and the American West to the entire Nation.
   "I have long felt that the Democratic Party has needed to turn its focus to the West. Democrats have made significant gains in the Rocky Mountain west region including victories this year by Senator John Tester in Montana and Governor Bill Ritter in our own great state.
   "We earned these victories because Western values are Democratic values. Denver is a Western city and Colorado is an ideal site to showcase the Democratic Party's resurgence and our hopes for the future. In the West, Colorado has been at the forefront of fresh ideas and innovations on renewable energy, education, transportation, healthcare, and open space protection.
   "I look forward to working with Chairman Dean, Governor Ritter, Mayor Hickenlooper and the Denver Host Committee to ensure this convention is the best our Nation has ever seen. I congratulate the Denver Convention Committee on securing the 2008 Democratic National Convention, and I look forward to welcoming America to look West and into the future."
