SEN. SALAZAR TO CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE DAY WEEKEND IN COLORADO WITH FAMILY
  Sen. Ken Salazar will celebrate our Nation's Independence Day weekend with his mother Emma, wife Hope and daughters Melinda and Andrea at their family's ranch in Colorado's San Luis Valley. 
   Senator Salazar also released the following statement recognizing July 4, 2005, Independence Day:
   "On this Independence Day weekend, we should take the time to reflect on the incredible rights and freedoms that we enjoy as Americans, and the wisdom of the Founding Fathers in their creation.
   But we should also remember those who are defending these rights and freedoms around the world: our men and women in uniform.
   As I spend this holiday weekend with my family in the San Luis Valley, and families across Colorado and the Nation come together for reunions and barbecues, I encourage everyone to take a moment to thank our service members and their families. It is their sacrifices every day of the year that allows all of us to live in peace and freedom."
