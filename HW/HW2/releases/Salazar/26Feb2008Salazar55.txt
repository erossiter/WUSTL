SENATE PASSES LONG OVERDUE INDIAN HEALTH BILL TAKING MAJOR STEPS TO ALLEVIATE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar issued the following statement after Senate passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (S. 1200), which will improve and expand necessary health care services and other important programs for the Native American population. The passage of this bill is vital to the 52,000 Native Americans living across Colorado, including those living in the state's two Native American Reservations in the southwestern Colorado, the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation and the Southern Ute Reservation. 
   "It has been 16 years since Congress conducted a comprehensive review of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act - 16 years since we have addressed the persistent health disparities in Native American communities," said Senator Salazar. "I am proud of the bill that passed today because it funds programs and services to reduce the many health disparities that persist in Native American communities, including the 52,000 Native Americans who live in Colorado. This bill takes a step in the right direction toward making good on the federal government's promise to improve health care for Native Americans."
   Unfortunately, the Native American population, both nationally and in Colorado, are far more susceptible to health disparities such as diabetes and chronic liver disease, which lead to higher death and illness rates. The passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act will help fund and expand necessary health care programs and services to the Native American population living in Colorado and across the country.
   Some highlights of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act:
   * Funds and expands programs to increase the number of Indians entering the health profession and providing health services. 
   * Authorizes a wide-variety of health services and programs to expand access to treatment, facilities and address backlogs. 
   * Implements authority for IHS/tribal programs to collect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. 
   * Establishes and maintains programs in Urban Centers to make health services more accessible and available to Indians living in urban areas. 
   * Authorizes behavioral health prevention and treatment services. 
   * Amends the Social Security Act to provide greater opportunities for Native Americans to access Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP.
