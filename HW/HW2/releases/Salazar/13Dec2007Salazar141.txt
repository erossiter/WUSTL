SEN. SALAZAR EXPRESSES DISAPPOINTMENT ON LOSING KEY ENERGY BILL PROVISIONS BY ONE VOTE
  This morning, the United States Senate was again not able to reach the sixty votes necessary to end debate on H.R. 6 - Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The vote was 59 to 40 with Senator Salazar voting yes while working to get Democrat and Republican Senators to support the measure. 
   "I am extremely disappointed that we fell one vote short of moving forward with strong, comprehensive energy legislation that would get our Nation on track towards a clean energy future. This energy bill is vital to our Nation's economic, national and energy security and we must work to get it done now. With oil reaching upwards of $100 a barrel and oil companies' profits skyrocketing, it is time that we commit ourselves seriously to reducing our dependence on foreign oil and developing a clean energy future. There is too much at stake to continue putting it off. This morning's setback on the financial engine for the Nation's clean energy future will not deter our other work to keep pushing for an energy bill that contains historic increases in fuel efficiency for vehicles and a continuing revolution on renewable fuels."
