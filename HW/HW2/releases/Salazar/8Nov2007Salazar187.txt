SENATE PASSES DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL CONFERENCE REPORT SEN. SALAZAR SECURES CRITICAL PROJECTS FOR COLORADO'S MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN SENATE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Tonight, the Senate passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act Conference Report, which funds our Nation's military. United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that key Colorado military installations will receive over $224 million under the bill. Senator Salazar was successful in securing $142.2 million to accelerate weapons destruction at the Pueblo Chemical Depot with the goal of meeting the congressionally ratified treaty deadline of 2012 for chemical demilitarization activities.
   In addition, Senator Salazar succeeded in including language in the bill to require the Department of Defense to complete chemical weapons destruction activities by 2017 if it fails to meet the Congressionally-ratified treaty deadline of 2012.
   "Colorado is proud to house some of our Nation's top military installations and defense related businesses," said Senator Salazar. "We are one step closer to providing this funding which is vital to the military installations in Colorado and ultimately, the safety and security of our Nation and of our men and women serving in uniform." 
   Included below is a summary of the other projects, grouped by region, Senator Salazar secured in the Defense Appropriations Act of 2008:
   Pueblo Chemical Depot
   * $142.4 million for chemical demilitarization activities at the Pueblo Chemical Depot and language requiring the Department of Defense to complete chemical weapons destruction activities by 2017.
   Non-Regional Initiatives:
   * $46 million to Curb Encroachment Around Military Bases: The Readiness and Environmental Protection Initiative (REPI) allows the Department of Defense to work with government and private partners to establish buffer zones to protect military training and testing areas. The program has been successful in addressing encroachment issues at Fort Carson.
   Pikes Peak Region
   * $3.2 million for Upgrades to Data Networks at Cheyenne Mountain and USNORTHCOM: Funding will help upgrade NORTHCOM's data network at the Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, to ensure that its facilities remain redundant with those in the joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base. In case of a network failure at NORTHCOM's headquarters at Peterson, the upgraded data system in Cheyenne Mountain will allow swift recovery of the network. Funding will also be used on equipment which enables federal, state, and local governments and agencies to coordinate and share information in the event of an emergency or natural disaster.
   * $1.6 million for Security Upgrades at Schriever Air Force Base: Funding will upgrade an aging and increasingly inefficient electronic security system protecting space platforms at Schriever. This upgrade is needed because the current system has been in place for eighteen years, despite the fact that it only has an eight year life cycle. The upgrade will enhance the system's effectiveness and its ability to deter and detect an intruder.
   * $500,000 for the Center for Space and Defense Studies at the United States Air Force Academy: Funding will be applied to support space and defense studies at the Air Force Academy.

The DOD Center for Geosciences/Atmospheric Research at Colorado State University provides research on priority environmental problems and questions of concern to the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force. Currently, researchers are studying ways to forecast floods in northern Iraq, detect caves in Afghanistan, predict clouds and icing that impede use of manned and unmanned aircraft, and better understand environmental conditions in complex urban areas.
   Denver Metro Region
   * $1.6 million for Respiratory Biodefense Research at National Jewish Medical and Research Center: Funds will allow for continued research into preventing and treating respiratory injuries from bioterrorism. National Jewish is studying the mechanisms of injury to develop effective means of detection, prevention and therapy. The initiative is studying threats posed by anthrax, influenza, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and SARS.
   * $1.6 million for a Micro Satellite Target System for the Air Force (MicroSat Systems, Inc., Littleton, CO): The Missile Defense Agency is developing a network of ground radar systems as part of the Ballistic Missile Defense System that can search for, acquire, and identify missile threats. These ground-based radar systems require frequent testing and calibration to ensure they are performing adequately. The Micro Satellite Target System (MTS) program is developing a low-cost micro satellite that can be placed in orbit to support radar calibration and testing. The MTS acts as a simulated re-entry vehicle, flying in an orbit that emulates threat trajectories. The first MTS is currently being built and will be ready for integration and testing in May 2008. Funds will be used to complete the satellite and perform tests required to launch it in late 2008/early 2009.
   * $1.6 million for Environmental Sensors for Special Forces (ATA Technologies, Littleton, CO): The United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has a need for small, lightweight and easily-deployable sensors that can measure weather conditions and a variety of other environmental and situational parameters. These sensors are useful to Special Forces personnel on both the ground and in the air. The SOCOM METOC Program has developed and is currently using a system that is deployed by hand, requiring personnel to physically go to the desired location to set up the sensors. The program plan calls for the development of an air-droppable version of the system, which allows the sensors to be deployed by releasing them from a helicopter or plane. The funding will allow the completion of development of this air-droppable version of the system so that it will be ready for operation in 2010.
   * $1 million for Senior Scout Integrated Mission Trainer (Lockheed Martin Corporation Littleton, CO): Funding will be used to develop, procure, and implement the essential hardware and software for the Senior Scout Mission Trainer. The Senior Scout is an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) system that can be installed in a C-130E/H aircraft. This system is able to detect and geo-locate Signals of Interest (SOI), and report them to air and ground commanders. The Senior Scout will be used by the National Guard in GWOT and counter-drug missions.
   * $1 million for Advanced Materials Processing for Ultra-Efficient Power Systems (Vforge, Lakewood, CO): The Advanced Metals Processing project will develop and test die-cast copper rotors in electrical motors and generators with the goal of reducing the cost of producing these cast copper components. The Army Objective Force initiative, in cooperation with the Army Research Labs and the Defense Logistics Agency, uses these components in legacy defense weapon systems and lightweight induction motors. Copper rotors increase motor energy efficiency and life and reduce manufacturing costs and motor weight/size.
   * $1.6 million for Lightweight Motors for the Future Combat System (Vforge, Lakewood, CO): Future Combat Systems (FCS) is the Army's modernization program. It consists of a family of manned and unmanned systems connected by a common network. This project will test, evaluate, and integrate an ultra-efficient copper rotor in the hybrid drive system in Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT-A3) vehicles. Early tests have shown copper rotors yield a 20% improvement in fuel economy, an important development given that a gallon of fuel in-theater can cost up to $600.
   * $1.6 million for National Item Identification Number Validation and Correction (IHS, Inc., Englewood, CO): The Naval Air Depots (Fleet Readiness Centers) perform aircraft maintenance and repair and overhaul of components, airframes and engines for the Navy and Marine Corps. Currently, parts suppliers for aircraft acquire a National Item Identification Number (NIIN) from the Defense Logistics Agency. However, many inventoried parts that were manufactured more than a decade ago do not have NIIN numbers or have different part numbers than matching parts that are currently being manufactured. This causes a breakdown of the automated material ordering process in over 53% of work orders, leading to significant delays and cost increases. The NIIN Validation and Correction project would fix this problem by reconciling redundant part numbers, assigning all inventoried parts a NIIN, and making all parts compatible with the Navy Depot Maintenance Systems.
   * $1 million for the Medical Image Database Holographic Archiving Library System (MIDHALS) (InPhase Technologies, Longmont, CO): The MIDHALS project will integrate available holographic data storage technology with other storage systems to improve storage, distribution, retrieval, and analysis of picture and archived medical documents for the Army.
   * $1 million for the Implantable Middle-Ear Hearing System, (Otologics, Boulder): This project is will provide funds to continue to develop a minimally invasive, implantable hearing system to meet the requirements of the armed services, allowing highly trained individuals with hearing impairment to remain in their positions, enhancing their quality of life and improving operational effectiveness.
   * $2.4 million for the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (Barber-Nichols Inc, Arvada): Funding will be allocated toward designing methods of reducing the unit and production costs of the U.S. Navy's Anti-Torpedo Torpedo, which protects larger naval vessels from attack. 
  West Slope
   * $4 million for Modular Ballistic Panels to Better Protect Soldiers from Mortar Attacks (Polystrand, Inc., Montrose, CO): The University of Maine has helped develop modular ballistic panels that are ready for pilot manufacturing and demonstration to the U.S. Army. The panels would be used in tents in mobile forward operating bases to provide additional protection against mortar attacks. Funding would allow for initial purchase, production, and demonstration of the panels to be manufactured in Montrose. Prototype panels are already in theater with the National Guard.
   * $3.2 million for Combat Support Hospitals (Alaska Structures/Weatherport LLC, Delta, CO): Combat support hospitals are mobile hospitals that can be assembled in Corps Support Areas to treat wounded service members. This funding will help the Army begin to fulfill its requirement for 10 more 84-bed combat support hospital shelters, and for 30 more 164-bed combat support hospitals.
