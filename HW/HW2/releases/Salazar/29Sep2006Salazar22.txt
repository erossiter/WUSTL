SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON SO-CALLED 'BORDER FENCE' BILL
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after voting against the border fence bill.
   "I voted against the border fence bill because it is nothing more than a political gimmick. I have already voted to actually construct fences along the border where it makes sense as suggested by the Bush Administration. Congress has abdicated its responsibility to address immigration reform in a comprehensive manner and this last minute piecemeal effort demonstrates that politics has triumphed."
