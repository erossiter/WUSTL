SEN. SALAZAR PLEASED WITH JAPAN'S FIRST STEP MOO-VING TOWARDS LIFTING BEEF EMBARGO
  Sen. Ken Salazar today applauded Japan's decision today to lift the beef embargo for most U.S. producers and for cattle 20 months and younger. Sen. Salazar cautioned, however, that the remaining Japanese restrictions to importing U.S. beef must be lifted soon. 
   "I am pleased that Japan has been reassured that U.S. beef is the safest in the world," said Senator Salazar. "U.S. beef producers have gone out of their way over the last few months to provide clear, scientific evidence that their product is safe. Now that this major hurdle has been cleared, I am hopeful that Japan will lift the embargo on the remaining U.S. suppliers and allow shipments of older cattle to enter Japan. The free trade of U.S. beef is essential to our ranchers in Colorado and across the country."
   Ranchers in Colorado and across America have waited more than two years to once again have free and fair access to the Japanese beef market. During that same time, the U.S. beef industry has lost over $6 billion in revenue because of Japan's refusal to open its markets to safe American beef exports.
