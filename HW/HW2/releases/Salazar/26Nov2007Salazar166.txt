SEN. SALAZAR LAUDS LUBICK FOR PUTTING CSU ON THE 'FOOTBALL MAP'
  United States Senator Ken Salazar's statement on Sonny Lubick's transition at Colorado State University. 
   "Coach Sonny Lubick is a living legend and a rarity among football coaches in his dedication to student athletes. We will soon know in what capacity he will continue to serve Colorado State University, its students and its alumni, but his accomplishments over the last decade and a half for the Rams will never be forgotten. He put the CSU Rams on the national football map and I look forward to him continuing his efforts to help CSU athletics thrive."
