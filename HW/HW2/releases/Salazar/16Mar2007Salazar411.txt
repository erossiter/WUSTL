SEN. SALAZAR WINS FUNDING INCREASE FOR NREL FOR FISCAL 2007
  Today, the U.S. Department of Energy will inform Congress that it plans to increase spending for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2007 (FY07) at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) in Golden by more than $107 million. This increase includes $20 million to expand the lab's Integrated Biorefinery Research Facility, $17 million to equip the lab's new Science & Technology facility, and $63 million to design and build a new Research Support Facility on NREL's campus. 
   This increase in funding matches a request made by United States Senator Ken Salazar to Alexander A. Karsner, Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) at the United States Department of Energy just weeks ago.
   "This funding increase is not just a victory for NREL, it is a victory for consumers and for America's movement towards energy independence," said Senator Salazar. "Colorado continues to solidify itself as the renewable energy capital of the world, and keeping NREL well-funded is key to that progress."
