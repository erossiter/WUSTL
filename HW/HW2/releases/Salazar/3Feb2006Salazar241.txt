SEN. SALAZAR SUPPORTS WORKING FAMILIES
  Sen. Ken Salazar supported several measures last night to spark economic growth through targeted tax breaks. 
   Several provisions were approved with Senator Salazar's support, including extending the business tax credits for research and development, providing tax breaks for coal-mining safety equipment, allowing personal deductions for state and local sales taxes and continuing to hold middle-class Americans harmless from the Alternative Minimum Tax.
   "Protecting America's working families is vital to the health of our nation's economy," Salazar said. "I strongly support the bill's provisions to ensure that middle-class families are not unfairly impacted by the alternative minimum tax, to help parents afford the cost of sending their children to college, and to extend the deduction for state and local sales taxes, the research and development tax credit, and the deduction for teachers' classroom expenses.
   "Although I would have preferred these cuts to be fully paid for as they were in the alternative offered by Democrats, I believe this legislation represents a bipartisan effort to provide needed tax relief for millions of working families."
