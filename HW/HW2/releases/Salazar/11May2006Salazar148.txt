SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON NSA'S PROGRAM TO SECRETLY COLLECT PHONE RECORDS
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement in light of a "USA Today" report that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans. 
   "I have long been concerned about the NSA's domestic spying program and today's media reports only reinforce that concern. I also laud Denver-based Qwest communications for its decision not to share private information with the NSA. I believe that the Senate Intelligence Committee must conduct thorough oversight hearings, and that the Senate must seek answers from Gen. Hayden, who once headed the NSA, during his confirmation hearings to head the CIA."
