SEN. SALAZAR WINS KEY DEFENSE PROVISIONS FOR COLORADO'S MILITARY BASES, TRAINING INSTALLATIONS
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced today that crucial funding for military projects in the state of Colorado has been approved by the Senate Committee. 
   "Funding for the upkeep and improvement of our Nation's defense and military training installations is paramount to our homeland security," said Senator Salazar. "I am proud to have fought for these funds to improve Colorado based defense and training facilities and programs. I will continue to work with my Senate and House colleagues to ensure these funds stay in Colorado throughout the appropriations process."
   FY 2007 Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5631), as agreed to by the subcommittee, includes the following provisions for military projects in the state of Colorado:
   * $4 million dollars to upgrade utilities at Fort Carson that will provide utility infrastructure in support of new installation construction through FY2010. 
   * $3.2 million for Schriever Air Force Base to replace their ground space electronic security system. 
   * $57 million ($7 million above the President's budget request) for NORAD and STRATCOM for development of the Single Integrated Space Picture. 
   * $800 thousand for the United States Air Force Academy to rehabilitate and upgrade its aging static aircraft displays across the campus. 
   * $4 million nationally for the Civil Air Patrol, which had been hurt by proposed cuts to its overall budget. 
  Senator Salazar is also proud to support language directing the United States Air Force to come up with a master plan for infrastructure restoration at the United States Air Force Academy. 
   The FY07 Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5631) now goes to the floor of the Senate.
