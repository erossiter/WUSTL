SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROAN PLATEAU
  Sen. Salazar statement on Roan Plateau: 
   "I am extremely troubled with the decision announced today by the BLM.
   "The top of the Roan Plateau is one of Colorado's special places, and I continue to believe that this area should not be opened to drilling for oil and gas at this time.
   "I am also very disappointed that Secretary Kempthorne ignored a request last month by Governor Ritter for an additional 120 days to review the Roan Plateau Management Resource Plan. Earlier this week, I joined the Governor in this request.
   "Throughout this EIS process, the BLM has failed to establish a pressing need for such a rushed process and immediate development. At every opportunity, the BLM has insisted upon forging ahead in this process, limiting and disregarding public input. The result is that the public and I both remain skeptical, and I will examine all of my options to correct the BLM's misguided direction."
