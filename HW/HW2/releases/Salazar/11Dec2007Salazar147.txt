SEN. SALAZAR CALLS PARK SERVICE'S FINAL PLAN FOR CULLING ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK'S ELK HERD, 'REASONABLE'
  United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after reviewing the National Park Service's Final Environmental Impact Statement, released today, regarding the Elk and Vegetation Management Plan for Rocky Mountain National Park. 
   "I appreciate that the National Park Service (NPS) has conducted a lengthy and thorough public comment process before issuing this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS).
   "I am particularly grateful for the leadership of Park Superintendent Vaughn Baker for his willingness to listen to and work with state officials, including the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
   "The preferred alternative in the FEIS is a reasonable proposal and is an improvement over its previous preferred alternative because it:
   Projects far lower costs to the taxpayer than NPS initially proposed - almost 2/3rds lower, in fact; 
  Allows NPS the possibility of using qualified Colorado sportsmen as volunteers in culling operations, if needed; and 
  Ensures that the meat from culling operations may be donated to eligible organizations, in accordance with public health laws. 
   "Should the Park Service move ahead with this preferred alternative, I will work to ensure that NPS upholds its commitment to keep costs down for the taxpayer and adequately considers the possibility of allowing Colorado sportsmen to participate in culling operations."
