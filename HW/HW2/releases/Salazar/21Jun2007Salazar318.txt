SENATE PASSES SEN. SALAZAR RESOLUTION HONORING MODERN OLYMPIC MOVEMENT
  Last night, the United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution introduced by Sen. Ken Salazar supporting the ideals and values of the Modern Olympic Movement. The resolution also calls upon the people of the United States to observe the anniversary of the founding of the movement, June 23, 1894, with ceremonies and activities to appropriately commemorate the day. 
   "The Modern Olympic Movement is a venerable tradition passed from generation to generation which embodies the seemingly contradictory, yet highly consistent values of competition and cooperation at the local, national and international level," said Senator Salazar. "As we approach the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, I ask all Americans to join me in celebrating the Movement's anniversary, as well as support all aspiring U.S. Olympians in their unrelenting endeavors to make our Nation proud."
   S.R. 185 also recognizes a number of the Modern Olympic Movement's noteworthy merits, ranging from its promotion of improved physical fitness to the increased international cooperation it advances. It is co-sponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Wayne Allard (R-CO), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Ted Stevens (R-AK).
   Colorado is home to the U.S. Olympic Complex, the headquarters for the U.S. Olympic Committee administration and the Olympic Training Center. The Complex is located in Colorado Springs.
