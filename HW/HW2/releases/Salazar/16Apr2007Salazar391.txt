SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON VIRGINIA TECH TRAGEDY
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement regarding the shootings at Virginia Tech: 
   "As today's horrific events at Virginia Tech remind us, the passing of eight years has not dimmed the sadness, shock and horror surrounding the school shootings in my own state of Colorado at Columbine High School.
   "My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, friends and the community.
   "After the Columbine High School shootings on April 20, 1999, Colorado came together as a family. This enabled the students, the school and the community to heal.
   "I know the Virginia Tech community will do the same, and I know that Coloradans will offer everything they can to help."
