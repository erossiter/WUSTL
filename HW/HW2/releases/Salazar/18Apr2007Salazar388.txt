SALAZAR BROTHERS DECLARE VICTORY AFTER VA ANNOUNCES NEW OUTREACH CLINIC IN CRAIG
  Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that Craig will be the location for a Community Based Outreach Clinic (CBOC) that will offer medical treatment to veterans in rural Colorado.  
   For more than two years, U.S. Rep. John Salazar (CO-3) and U.S. Senator Ken Salazar (D-CO) have pushed to bring a clinic to the northwest part of the state so that veterans would not have to continue driving several hours over hazardous mountain terrain to the VA hospital in Grand Junction to receive medical care.
   "This is a great success for our veterans," said military veteran John Salazar. "Our veterans are the ones who are willing to put their lives on the line and give their country everything they have to give. Now it is our turn to look out for them and ensure they have the services and health care they were promised. By opening this community clinic, we are keeping our promise to serve and protect our veterans."
   "This is a great victory for the 4,200 veterans in Northwest Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "They earned our admiration and respect for their service to our country. This new Community Based Outreach Clinic in Craig will mean real access for these rural Colorado veterans to the health care our Nation promised."
   The two brothers have worked with community members in the area and have met with representatives from the VA to push for the CBOC to be located in Craig. It will serve veterans from the Craig, Hayden, and Steamboat Springs areas.
   Colorado is home to two VA hospitals, one in Grand Junction and one in Denver, as well as 11 community-based clinics, none of which serve northwest Colorado.
   John Salazar is a member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and is the only military veteran in the Colorado delegation. His son Esteban is also a veteran.
