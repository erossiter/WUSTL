SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON FRONTIER BANKRUPTCY ANNOUNCEMENT
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding Frontiers Airlines' announcement that they would be filing Chapter 11.  
   "This morning I spoke with executives at Frontier about their fiscal condition. They have assured me that they will continue to conduct normal operations and I am confident in their current and future ability to do so. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is meant only to allow them the opportunity to take corrective action concerning certain credit card processing issues. Frontier Airlines is vitally important to Colorado's economy, providing thousands of Colorado jobs and essential services and I remain hopeful that the company will be able to weather this storm."
