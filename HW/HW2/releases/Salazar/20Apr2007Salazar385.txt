SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON EARTH DAY
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement to commemorate Earth Day, April 22: 
   "In the West, we learned long ago that conservation isn't just a twenty-first century trend, it's part of maintaining the land and water we need to make our lives. Not only is conservation good for our health and the economy, the stewardship of our planet is a moral responsibility charged to each one of us.
   "Renewable energy resources are a great way for Coloradans to make sure that 'Every day is Earth Day.' With Amendment 37, we took an important first step forward on renewable resources, and our state has now moved beyond to new goals of renewable energy. The Colorado New Energy Summit I helped host this year showed that there is still a long, exciting path for us to follow on renewable resources.
   "I hope every Coloradan takes a moment today to appreciate the natural wonders around us, and think constructively about ways to conserve them. Whether changing to a fluorescent light bulb, taking a bus, picking up litter out of a watershed or making groundbreaking technology breakthroughs at places like the National Renewable Energy Lab, we can all do our part to ensure we leave this place better than we found it."
