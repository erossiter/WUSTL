SEN. SALAZAR PRAISES AGREEMENT ON MOVING FORWARD ON MUCH NEEDED FARM BILL
  Late last night, Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a tentative agreement on how to move forward on the 2007 Farm Bill next week. United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement praising the agreement and reiterating his continued support to pass a Farm Bill by the end of the year. 
   "A lot of folks are looking to Congress to pass a Farm Bill and I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to a bi-partisan framework to consider the bill. This is a bill that helps the 50 million Americans living in rural communities; it helps kids who deserve fresh fruits and vegetables at school; it helps families put healthy and safe food on their table; and it helps us reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
   "We all benefit from a strong Farm Bill and this agreement is a breakthrough that will allow consideration of the bill to resume. I hope that we can maintain our agreement and continue work towards its swift passage."
