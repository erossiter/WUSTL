SEN. SALAZAR PUSHES PENTAGON TO PULL BACK ON SHIPPING HYDROLYSATE & PUSH FORWARD ON DESTRUCTION AT PUEBLO CHEMICAL DEPOT
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar urged the Department of Defense not to proceed with the latest studies on hydrolysate destruction at the Pueblo Chemical Depot and to issue a final decision to proceed with on-site destruction. In his letter to Under Secretary of Defense John Young, Senator Salazar cited recent studies concluding that shipping hydrolysate off-site would yield few cost-savings and likely would result in litigation. 
   Senator Salazar wrote, "Given the conclusions of these recent studies on hydrolysate destruction, I am perplexed that the Department has commissioned two additional studies on the potential cost-savings of off-site hydrolysate destruction."
   In addition, Senator Salazar wrote, "Furthermore, since construction of a biotreatment facility for hydrolysate is already underway in Pueblo, the money spent to commission two more studies would be more wisely used to expedite construction of the weapons destruction facilities."
