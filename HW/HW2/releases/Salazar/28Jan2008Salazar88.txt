SEN. SALAZAR STATEMENT ON FISA VOTE
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after the Senate voted against cutting off debate on the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).  
   "Today, I voted against cloture on the FISA bill because the bill should be amended to further strengthen civil liberties. I also will be supporting an amendment for appropriate court review of immunity to private companies and for a four-year sunset of the legislation.
   "These are common sense amendments. With these amendments we can pass a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which will provide law enforcement the tools it needs to protect America and at the same time safeguards our cherished civil liberties. Senate Republicans are blocking consideration of these important amendments.
   "It is my duty as a United States Senator to ensure our Nation has the ability to fight terrorism while protecting Americans' civil liberties. Many agree that we need to update and modernize our FISA process. Americans deserve a government that can and will fulfill its primary responsibility - the responsibility of keeping its citizens safe from attack. But we also deserve a government that will not abuse the power entrusted to it."
