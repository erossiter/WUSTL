SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROCKY FLATS SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT VOTE
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after today's vote by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health on Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) status for former Rocky Flats workers: 
   "I am extremely disappointed in today's vote by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health on Special Exposure Cohort status for former Rocky Flats workers.
   "With this exceedingly narrow and confusing decision, the Board has left thousands of former Rocky Flats workers without resolution. By focusing on the issue of 'sufficient accuracy,' the Board has totally lost focus on the other essential purpose of the law: timely compensation.
   "I am on the side of Rocky Flats workers, and our government should be too. These workers have waited more than two years since their petition was filed and they were entitled to an immediate and just decision."
