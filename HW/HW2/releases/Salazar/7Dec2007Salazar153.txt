SEN. SALAZAR: 'NATIONAL, ENERGY, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY AT STAKE IF DELAY OF ENERGY BILL CONTINUES'
  This morning, the United States Senate was not able to reach the sixty votes necessary to proceed to debate on H.R. 6 - Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after the vote urging an agreement on the energy bill. 
   "I am disappointed in this morning's vote. This energy bill is too vital to our Nation's economic, national and energy security to continue putting off. There is too much at stake, and we must come to an agreement on how to move forward. The House passed this bill with a strong majority yesterday, and the Senate must re-double its efforts to come to an agreement so we can get this to the President's desk before year's end."
