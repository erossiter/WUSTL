SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DARFUR RALLIES
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding rallies being held nationwide to bring attention to the crisis in Darfur. 
   "Today, voices are being raised around the country, calling attention to the suffering of the people of Darfur. Today's message is clear - the international interventions undertaken to date are not working, and we must do more to stop the crisis. While I am grateful to the African Union and the humanitarian relief community for the work that they have done, the facts speak for themselves. Civilians remain at grave risk, the displaced cannot return to their homes or rebuild their lives, instability had spread to Chad, and abusive, marauding forces continue to act with impunity.
   "I deeply admire the commitment of the many Americans who continue to insist that our government act to stop the dying in Darfur. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that Congress is not silent on this issue. We must not stop searching for real solutions that protect Darfur's civilians, hold those responsible for atrocities accountable for their actions, and help to build a framework for a just and lasting peace in Sudan."
