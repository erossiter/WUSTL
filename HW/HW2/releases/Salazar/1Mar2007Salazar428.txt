SEN. SALAZAR'S RURAL POLICING INSTITUTE APPROVED BY SENATE
  Earlier today, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to address the unique challenges facing rural law enforcement. By a vote of 82 to 1, the Senate approved a bipartisan amendment introduced by Sen. Ken Salazar to the 9/11 Commission homeland security legislation to create a Rural Policing Institute (RPI) within the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). 
   "This is an important step forward for rural law enforcement agencies everywhere, putting them closer to receiving the cutting edge training that is foregone too often due to budget and time constraints," said Senator Salazar. "I am pleased the Senate recognized the special demands placed on rural law enforcement."
   Senator Salazar's successful bipartisan amendment to the 9/11 Commission bill creating the RPI is identical to bipartisan legislation he introduced last month with Senators Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Mark Pryor (D-AR). These same Senators cosponsored Senator Salazar's amendment today, along with Senators Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Joseph Biden (D-DE) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA).
   The Senate is continuing work on the 9/11 Commission bill, which will increase America's homeland security by implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission along with other important security improvements.
