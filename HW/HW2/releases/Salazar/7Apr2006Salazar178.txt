SEN. SALAZAR DISAPPOINTED IN SENATE'S INABILITY TO ENACT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement today after Senate negotiations broke down and comprehensive immigration reform legislation was denied. 
   "I have worked closely with a dedicated, bipartisan group of Senators to create comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens our border security, increases enforcement and deals with the economic realities of the situation before us today. Our proposal addressed the Nation's homeland and economic security and enjoyed wide, bipartisan support because of it.
   "It was the second bipartisan compromise to be embraced within a week. It still achieved the goals important to me: tough reforms to protect our borders, a crackdown on employers who hire undocumented workers, and a humane and realistic policy to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.
   "I will continue to work on this issue because we cannot continue with porous borders, lax enforcement and with undocumented immigrants living in the shadows."
   The core of the compromise proposals Senator Salazar endorsed throughout the week, along with Senators McCain, Kennedy, Specter, Leahy, and others, was:
