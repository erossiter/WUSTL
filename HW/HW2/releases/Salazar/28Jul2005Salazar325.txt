SEN. SALAZAR: COLORADO TO RECEIVE LARGEST STATE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING INCREASE
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on the Transportation Reauthorization Bill: 
   "I am extremely pleased that Congress will soon be passing this long overdue transportation reauthorization bill. And more importantly for Colorado, I am happy to announce that Colorado receives a 46.75% increase over the last time this bill was reauthorized. That's the largest percentage increase under this bill and more than any other state. That is $156 million more over the life of the bill than we received under the previous transportation bill - TEA-21.
   This increase in transportation funding to Colorado will help ensure that the highest level of our transportation infrastructure is maintained. Having a first class transportation system is critical to Colorado. I look forward to the passage of this very important bill, and I will continue to work to see that this most basic level of infrastructure funding is not only maintained - but improved - so that we can have safe roadways and robust economic development throughout the state.
   I look forward in the coming weeks to meeting personally with the city and county officials with whom I have worked so hard with over the last eight months to secure over $100 million in projects."
