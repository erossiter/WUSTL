SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ VOTES BY SENATE
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on the Senate's votes today on Iraq: 
   "Today, I voted for a new direction in Iraq.
   "I want the U.S. to succeed in Iraq. That requires the Iraqi government taking responsibility for ending the civil war among its sects. U.S. troops should not be a police for the Iraqi civil war.
   "I believe our troops deserve a policy that is worthy of their sacrifice and dedication.
   "Today's resolution was a straightforward resolution that did five simple things:
   * Plainly states that Congress and America support our troops; 
   * Recognizes that the shift in conditions in Iraq demands a new direction; 
   * Sets the goal of redeploying, by March 31, 2008, U.S. troops not engaged in training Iraqi troops, conducting targeted anti-terrorism operations or protecting US personnel and infrastructure in Iraq; 
   * Encourages the President to continue recent efforts to work cooperatively with Iraq's neighbors to develop a comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy for a stable Iraq; and 
   * Demands real action from the President by requiring a report to Congress every 60 days on his progress. 
   "I also voted for Democratic and Republican resolutions that ensure that our troops in the field will be fully supported and fully funded."
