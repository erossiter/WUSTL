SEN. SALAZAR VOTES TO STRENGTHEN HOMELAND SECURITY
  Sen. Ken Salazar voted with a bipartisan majority of the Senate today to pass a bill to increase port security. The Security and Accountability for Every Port Act - of the SAFE Port Act (H.R. 4954) will now go to the President for his signature. 
   "More than $1 trillion in goods enter the U.S. through our ports every year," said Senator Salazar. "Unfortunately, only about six percent of the containers carrying those goods are inspected before they enter the country. This bill will finally, more than five years after the 9/11 attacks, address this serious lapse in our border security. It is a good bill I am pleased to support, but it was far too long in coming."
   The Act includes provisions to:
   * Require the screening for radiological material of each container entering the United States through one of the 22 busiest seaports; 
   * Require the Department of Homeland Security to develop enhanced protocols governing the resumption of trade in the event of an attack on our ports and a comprehensive strategic plan regarding maritime cargo security; and
  * Establish a pilot project in 3 foreign seaports to screen every container entering the United States from those ports.
