SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON SAFETY OF U.S. BEEF
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement in reaction to information indicating that a cow in Alabama tested positive for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. 
   "U.S. beef is the safest in the world. While I was troubled to learn of a positive BSE test in Alabama, the Department of Agriculture's detection process worked just as it should have. Our confidence in U.S. beef's safety is dependent on such safeguards, and these procedures have kept our food supply safe."
   In a separate incident, it was announced today that a shipment of beef from Swift Corporation of Greeley, CO to Hong Kong contained material that may have breached an agreement with the Hong Kong government.
   "We have worked with Hong Kong, and other Asian nations, to formulate standards by which they would accept U.S. beef and it is imperative we hold to those standards. I am pleased that USDA and Swift have reacted quickly to this recent matter and I will continue to work with my colleagues, USDA, the livestock industry and our trading partners to ensure that we continue to take the steps necessary to provide consumers with the safest beef in the world."
