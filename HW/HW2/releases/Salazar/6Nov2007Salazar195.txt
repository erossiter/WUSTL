SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PINON CANYON AMENDMENT IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION VETERANS ADMINISTRATION APPROPS CONFERENCE REPORT
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in response to inclusion of Senator Salazar's, Congressman Salazar and Congresswoman Musgrave's amendment securing a one-year delay on expansion at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS) in the Military Construction and Veterans' Administration Appropriations Bill conference report. The Conference Report must now be approved by the House and Senate and signed by the President. 
   "I am pleased that the amendment Congressman Salazar and I sponsored to block the Army from moving forward for one year on any plans to expand at Pinon Canyon was included in the conference report. This is a positive step and ensures we take the necessary time out to get information from the Army. The Army has not yet provided a sufficient justification for its expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; nor has the Army yet created a plan that protects private property rights and the agricultural heritage of the area. I believe that this one year delay, coupled with a requirement that the Army justify their proposal, is the right thing to do."
