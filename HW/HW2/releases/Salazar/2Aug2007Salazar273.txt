SEN. SALAZAR INTRODUCES BILL TO ADDRESS OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS
  In an effort to prevent wealthy individuals from using offshore financial accounts to evade U.S. tax laws, United States Senator Ken Salazar introduced the Offshore Tax Haven Enforcement Act of 2007 to address this issue. While the U.S. tax code contains several provisions to prevent the use of offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes, the IRS faces significant difficulties in enforcing them in large part because the statute of limitations on investigating offshore tax evasion does not provide sufficient time or flexibility. 
   "Millions of Americans work hard, play by the rules and pay their taxes," said Senator Salazar. "It is grossly unfair that some are able to hide assets offshore in order to avoid paying their fair share."
   This legislation would extend and modify the statutes of limitations for investigations involving offshore tax havens and would give the IRS the tools it needs to go after offshore tax evaders.
   In a March 2007, the General Accountability Office released a study entitled, "Additional Time Needed to complete Offshore Tax Examinations" recommending that Congress extend the statute period for taxpayers involved in offshore activity.
   The Offshore Tax Haven Enforcement Act of 2007:
   * Changes the normal statute of limitations from three to six years for any return for a year in which the taxpayer directly or indirectly formed, owned, transferred assets to, was a beneficiary of, or received money or property or the use thereof from a financial account or an entity in an offshore secrecy jurisdiction.
   * Defines "offshore secrecy jurisdiction" as a jurisdiction that, in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury: (1) has corporate, business, bank, or tax secrecy rules or practices that unreasonably restrict the ability of the U.S. to obtain information relevant to enforcement; and (2) does not have effective information exchange practices.
   * Suspends the running of the statute of limitations on assessment if the taxpayer is resisting the production of offshore financial records.
   * Clarifies that the statute of limitations on assessment remains open on the entire tax return until the taxpayer files all required information returns on foreign entities and transactions. Current law is vague with respect to this matter.
   * Creates a new exception to the 10-year statute of limitations on collections in cases where the taxpayer attempts to evade payment. Under current law, this exception exists with respect to evasion of assessment, but not to evasion of payment.
