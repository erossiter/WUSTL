SEN. SALAZAR CONTINUES PUSH FOR PIKES PEAK REGIONAL CEMETERY/VA TO INITIATE PROGRAMMATIC REVIEW OF SITING OF NEW CEMETERIES
  Sen. Salazar received a letter from Department of Veterans Affairs Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, William Tuerk, regarding Senator Salazar's June, 2006 letter concerning the establishment of a national veterans cemetery in the Pikes Peak region of Colorado. In the past, the VA has expressed a willingness to reevaluate their site selection process for new cemeteries. 
   In response to Senator Salazar's letter requesting a review of their cemetery siting guidelines, the VA and Under Secretary Tuerk announced their plan to conduct a major programmatic review - including a reevaluation of the department's policy regarding the siting of potential new cemeteries - and stated that they will take into account a number of specific factors, including travel time to existing cemeteries and unusual concentrations of veteran population because of the presence of active military installations.
