SEN. SALAZAR SECURES FUNDING FOR KEY PRIORITIES IN I-70 WEST REGION; OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL PASSES IN SENATE
  Tonight, by a vote of 76 to 17 the United States Senate passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that he secured funding for key priorities for the I-70 West region in the bill. The funding Senator Salazar secured improves transportation infrastructure, provides funds for local law enforcement, supports our military and veterans and increases access to health care. 
   "I am proud that this bill helps meet the needs of Colorado's communities," said Senator Salazar. "These investments are vital to the I-70 West region and to the responsible development of our energy resources, to law enforcement officials who are combating meth, and to veterans who deserve better access to health care."
   Below is a list of key projects that Senator Salazar included in the bill for the I-70 West Region:
   * Ensuring a Thoughtful and Deliberative Approach on Oil Shale Development: Senator Salazar, Congressman Salazar and Congressman Udall authored a provision that creates a 'time-out' on commercial leasing of oil shale. The provision prevents the Bureau of Land Management from issuing any final rules or regulations for commercial-scale leasing of oil shale in 2008. It also prevents the BLM from offering any commercial oil shale leases in 2008. The language Senator Salazar worked to include will allow Western communities to take a thoughtful and deliberative approach to oil shale development. 
   * $89,300 for the Eagle County Sheriff's Office for the Eagle County Drug Task Force to curb methamphetamine use. 
   * Mileage Reimbursement for Veterans: The omnibus includes $125 million in funding that Senators Tester and Salazar added as an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Administration appropriations bill to support a long-overdue mileage reimbursement increase for veterans to 28.5 cents per mile. Currently, veterans living in rural areas who travel long distances to receive medical care are only reimbursed at 11 cents per mile. 
   * $980,000 for State Highway 9 from Frisco to Breckenridge: Senator Salazar secured funding that will be used to widen State Highway 9, the main access road from I-70 to the Town of Breckenridge and Breckenridge Ski Area. Widening is needed to meet increasing traffic demands. 
   * $421,500 for St. Mary's Hospital Foundation: St. Mary's is establishing the Saccomanno Education Center, part of a planned hospital expansion called the "Century Project." Senator Salazar secured funds that will purchase new equipment and provide training for physicians, nurses, technicians, first responders, and patients at the center. 
   * $343,000 to the Eagle County Regional Airport for a runway extension. 
   The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 will be sent back to the House of Representatives for final passage. It is expected to be sent to the President's desk by the end of the week.
