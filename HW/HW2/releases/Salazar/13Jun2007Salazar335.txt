SEN. SALAZAR ENDORSES TOUGH NEW FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS
  Sen. Ken Salazar, today, endorsed a provision in the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 to increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and light trucks from 27.5 mpg to 35 mpg by 2020. 
   "Our Nation lags behind most of the industrialized world including the entire European Union, Japan, China, Australia and Canada in average fuel economy; this is not acceptable when we are so dependent on oil from countries in volatile regions," said Senator Salazar. "If we adopt a standard of 35 miles per gallon for our cars and light trucks today, by the year 2025, we would reduce our Nation's oil needs equal to the amount we currently import from the Persian Gulf. To secure our energy independence, it is our duty to enact these CAFE standards now."
   Estimated Benefits of Increasing Fuel Economy Standards to 35 mpg by 2019:

   The CAFE standards provision includes an exemption for farm work trucks that are between 8,500 pounds and 10,000 pounds and are not SUV's.
   According to the Union of Concerned Scientists:
   * A package of modest, proven conventional technologies is all that would be needed to meet a standard of 35 mpg.
   * Today's size and acceleration could remain the same and safety could be improved.
   * The technologies would add about $1,100 to the price of an average vehicle in 2019, an investment that would be recovered in less than three years of driving, assuming that gasoline costs $2.00 per gallon.
   * Over the lifetime of the vehicle the owner would save a total of more than $3,600 in gasoline costs.
