SENATE APPROVES SEN. SALAZAR MEASURE TO ALLOW SHARING OF WILDFIRE FIGHTING RESOURCES BETWEEN FOUR WESTERN STATES
  Today, the Senate unanimously approved bipartisan legislation to allow the states of Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming to share resources used to fight wildfires. The legislation, which ratifies an interstate compact for fighting wildfires, was cosponsored by United States Senator Ken Salazar. 
   "As we have seen in the past and are seeing again this year, wildfires are a real and serious threat in the West," said Senator Salazar. "If states can share resources to help protect people's homes and businesses, as well as our natural heritage, it's a no-brainer to do so. This is an important first step toward better fire protection for the people of Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming."
   Under the U.S. Constitution, for states to enter into interstate compacts, it must be approved by Congress and signed into law by the President. It was approved at the state level in 2006 by the Colorado General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Owens as a part of larger piece of legislation that established Colorado's Wildfire Preparedness Fund.
   This compact, similar to Colorado's many interstate water compacts, will allow these states to legally share their wildfire resources, allowing better regional wildfire fighting focus. In addition, by entering into this compact, Colorado will also be able to receive support from neighboring states in existing compacts.
   S. 975 is sponsored by Sen. John Thune (R-SD), and is cosponsored by Senators Wayne Allard (R-CO), Tim Johnson (D-SD), and Mike Enzi (R-WY). Having been approved by the Senate, S. 975 now must be approved by the House before then going to the President's desk for signature or veto.
