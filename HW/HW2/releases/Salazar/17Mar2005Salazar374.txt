SEN. SALAZAR STATEMENT ON 2005 NATIONAL AG DAY
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement in honor of 2005 National Ag Day: "I have spent most of my life as a farmer and a rancher.  
 I know how important agriculture is, it puts food on our tables, clothing on our backs and provides a connection for all of us to our land and environment. "I have a sign on my desk that reads 'No Farms, No Food.' Every day I look at it and am reminded of just how dependent we are on the people of our agricultural industry in rural communities across Colorado and our great nation. "Today, I am proud to celebrate National Ag Day and to say a humble thank you to those who work so hard in the agricultural industry on our farms and our ranches. I encourage all my colleagues and people across the nation to do the same."
