SEN. SALAZAR CO-SPONSORS ARTIC WILDLIFE REFUGE LEGISLATION
  Sen. Ken Salazar, (D-CO) today announced his co-sponsorship of legislation protecting more than 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, known as the Coastal Plain, as wilderness under the Wilderness Act.  
   Senator Salazar will be an original co-sponsor of this bipartisan bill (S.261), which was authored by Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). 
   Salazar said, "This area of pristine wilderness in Alaska has been called the Serengeti of North America. While it is important to maintain a balanced approach to solving our nation's energy problems, we must commit ourselves to recognize some areas as 'off limits,' and the Artic National Wildlife Reserve is a national symbol of that commitment." 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge represents 19.6 million acres of land in the northeastern corner of Alaska. The acreage of the fragile Coastal Plain being protected under this legislation is home to more than 200 animal species, including approximately 125 species of migratory birds and a 129,000 member Caribou herd which has used the Coastal Plain as a calving area for thousands of years.
