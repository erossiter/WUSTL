SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY
  Sen. Salazar's Martin Luther King Jr. day statement: 
   "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of my personal heroes. He was a role-model for me growing up on my family's ranch in the San Luis Valley. He envisioned the best of humanity, and his never-ending struggle for justice and equal rights remains, to this day, an aspiration for everyone. Today, on January 17, 2005, I will march in Denver's Martin Luther King Jr. Day Marade to honor not only Dr. King's legacy but his hope for the future."
