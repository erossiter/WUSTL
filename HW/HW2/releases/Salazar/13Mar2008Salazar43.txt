SEN. SALAZAR: 'INTERIOR, BLM DECISION RUNS ROUGHSHOD OVER STATE'S PROPOSAL TO PROTECT ROAN PLATEAU'
  Today, in a letter to Governor Bill Ritter, Jr., the Department of Interior and Bureau of Land Management made public their decision to move forward with their original plan regarding oil and gas drilling leases on and around Colorado's Roan Plateau. Senator Salazar's statement regarding that decision is included below. 
   "The Department of Interior and BLM have disregarded the State of Colorado and Division of Wildlife's recommendations in rushing forward with oil and gas development in one of Colorado's last pristine areas. Their decision is irresponsible and shortsighted because it disregards the State of Colorado's proposal in favor of their original plan.
   "Their decision fails to protect the surface of the Roan Plateau. The decision also fails to maximize the economic return to the State of Colorado and the United States by giving away the public resource without the condition of phased leasing.
   "I will do all I can to stop the federal government and I will not let them turn Colorado's West Slope into a sacrificial zone for unimpeded oil and gas development. Their 'drill under every rock approach' will degrade the long-term economy and natural wonder of the Western Slope.
   "In the coming days I will introduce legislation that will protect the unique landscape, wildlife and communities of the Roan Plateau. In the end, we must preserve the natural resources and beauty that make Colorado and the West the envy of the Nation, a destination for travelers from across the world and habitat for our endangered wildlife."
