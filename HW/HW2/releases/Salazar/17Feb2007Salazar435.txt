SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE'S DEBATE ON IRAQ
  Today, the United States Senate debated how to move forward on one of the most important issues facing our Nation today, the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, the Senate was denied a real debate and a vote on the President's "surge" plan for sending an additional 21,500 combat troops to Iraq. 
   After a 56 to 34 vote to move forward and schedule a vote on the President's "surge" plan, the United States Senate adjourned for the Presidents' Day work period because 60 votes were required to move forward on the resolution concerning the President's "surge" plan. After this, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement:
   "I voted to move forward and schedule a vote on the President's 'surge' plan today. I support our troops, as set forth in the resolution. I also disagree with the President's plan to send 21,500 additional combat troops to Iraq.
   "I believe we need a new plan and a new direction for the U.S. presence in Iraq. The new way forward reflected in the bipartisan Warner resolution I sponsored is based on a number of key principles, as follows:
   * First, the central goal of the American mission in Iraq should be to encourage Iraq's government to make the political compromises necessary to foster reconciliation and improve the security situation;
   * Second, the American military strategy should be focused on maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying terrorists a safe haven, promoting regional stability, bringing security to Baghdad, and training and equipping Iraqi forces;
   * Third, the United States should engage nations in the region to develop a regional peace and reconciliation process;
   * Fourth, the U.S. should continue to engage in strong counter-terrorism activity, including operations in Anbar province, in order to deny Al Qaeda and other terrorists a safe haven;
   * Fifth, the American mission in Iraq should be conditioned upon the Iraqi government meeting certain benchmarks, including ensuring an equitable distribution of oil revenues;
   * And sixth, Congress should not eliminate or reduce funds for troops in the field - because the brave men and women fighting this war need our support while they are in harms way.
   "This is not the end of the Senate's discussion on U.S. policy on Iraq and the need for a new way forward that finds a middle ground between the President's plan to send additional troops to Iraq and the plan pushed by some who want us to immediately withdraw from Iraq.
   "I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to build support for a new way forward, as I did earlier this year in support of the Warner resolution calling for a new strategy in Iraq."
