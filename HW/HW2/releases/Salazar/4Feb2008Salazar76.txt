SEN. SALAZAR HOPEFUL SENATE'S VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE MEANS HELP WILL GET TO AMERICANS SOON
  This afternoon, the Senate voted 80 to 4 to proceed to debate on the economic stimulus legislation passed by the House of Representatives last week. The vote was an important first step in the effort to enact a timely economic stimulus package. The Senate will now consider amendments to the House legislation, including the provisions of a more robust package crafted by the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Salazar released the following statement after the vote: 
   "I am pleased that the Senate voted to begin debate on legislation to help middle-class families who are struggling financially and to stimulate our nation's sagging economy. As we consider this legislation over the coming days, I hope Democrats and Republicans can work together to pass the proposal that came out of the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis last week, which represents a significant improvement over the House-passed bill.
   "In addition to moving quickly to provide a much-needed jumpstart to our economy, the Finance Committee package includes critical assistance for 20 million low-income seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans that were left out of the House bill. We must work quickly to deliver this package to the President's desk in order to provide relief to struggling families and get our economy moving again."
