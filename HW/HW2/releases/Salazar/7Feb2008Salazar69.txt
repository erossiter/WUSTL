SENATE PASSES ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after the United States Senate passed an economic stimulus package that will provide tax rebates of $600 for individuals and $1200 for couples up to certain income thresholds, as well as $300 per child. Unlike the bill passed by the House of Representatives, the Senate-passed package also includes critical rebates for 250,000 disabled veterans and 20 million senior citizens. 
   "Today, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a robust economic stimulus package that will get this economy moving again. In addition to putting money into the pockets of hard-working Americans, this package provides targeted tax incentives for small businesses that are the engine of our economy so they can sustain and create new jobs, and give the economy the shot in the arm it needs to get back on the right track.
   "The bill we passed was a significant improvement from the House-passed bill. 250,000 disabled veterans and 20 million senior citizens left out of the House package will now receive rebates under the Senate bill.
   "In addition to passing this short-term economic stimulus package, it is important that we act quickly to bolster our economy in the long run by working to pass a Farm Bill that will revitalize rural America; to create energy tax incentives that will create jobs and expand the new energy economy; and to address the ongoing crisis facing the mortgage and housing industry.
   "I am pleased that the White House and Congressional leaders in both parties agreed to the Senate's improvements. It is my hope that we can quickly reconcile this bipartisan proposal with the House-passed version to give America's economy the jumpstart it needs now, and continue our work to ensure that our economy remains strong in the months and years ahead."
