UPDATE: SEN. SALAZAR LAUDS KEY PROVISIONS IN 9/11 CONFERENCE REPORT IMPACTING COLORADO; ANNOUNCES CRITICAL HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING
  This week the United States Congress took major steps to secure our Nation's borders and ports, and provide much needed funding to our local communities and first responders. Yesterday, the Senate passed the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, and this week a House and Senate conference committee issued its final report implementing the 9/11 commission recommendations. Both of these pieces of legislation included critical funding for Colorado projects that Senator Salazar fought to secure:
   * The Rural Policing Institute (RPI): A bipartisan amendment authored by Senator Salazar creating a special, rural-focused law enforcement training institute to assist rural agencies in receiving cutting-edge training without sacrificing public safety was included in the adoption of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. "The Senate's action to create a Rural Policing Institute is another important victory for rural law enforcement and puts these professionals one step closer to receiving the same cutting-edge training offered to non-rural police officers," said Senator Salazar. "I look forward to discussing the Rural Policing Institute and other training and communications issues in meetings across Colorado with local law enforcement officials." 
   * A Long-Term Plan For Fighting Terrorism: Senator Salazar added a requirement to the Senate version of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill requiring the DHS to develop a strategic plan every four years similar to the Department of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review, including a review of National homeland defense strategy, inter-agency cooperation, preparedness of Federal response capabilities and developing a homeland defense strategy for the next 20 years. "Securing the homeland starts with planning ahead using clear goals and benchmarks for success. A quadrennial review will be an important tool for DHS, Congress and the American people to plan for a secure future for America," said Senator Salazar.
   * Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo: This key provision makes the Transportation and Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI) in Pueblo, the newest member of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium. It authorizes $22 million for the upcoming year, $23 million in Fiscal Year 2009, $24 million in 2010, and $25.5 million in 2011. This provision enables TTCI, the premier rail safety facility in the Nation, to train first responders from around the world in ways to promote rail security and avoid potential disasters such as the London and Madrid bombings.
   "Both of these bills are essential to the security of our Nation," said Senator Salazar. "A government's primary responsibility is the protection of the homeland, and keeping its citizens safe from attack," added Salazar.
   Senator Salazar successfully added one amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill last night, prior to final passage of the bill:
   * Assistance for Wildland Fire Prevention, Planning and Preparations: Senator Salazar's amendment clarifies the fact that wildland fire prevention, planning and preparations are eligible for FEMA grants. It is based on a provision from the Colorado Delegations Forest Health Bill (S. 1797).
   Overall, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill provides over $10.2 billion for border security that will allow for the hiring of over 3,000 Border Patrol agents; $1 billion for border fencing, infrastructure and monitoring technology; and $475 million for interior enforcement. The bill also provides critical funding for our Nation's first responders; $3 billion for state and local emergency preparedness programs; $700 million in firefighter assistance grants; and $300 million for emergency performance grants. It also funds FEMA ($6.9 billion), aviation security (nearly $530 million), port security ($400 million) and mass transit security ($400 million).
   The Homeland Security Appropriations Bill will now proceed to a conference committee to iron out differences between House and Senate versions before being voted upon a second time by both the House and Senate. If the House and Senate both approve the conference report, it will go on to the President's desk for signature or veto. The President yesterday issued a statement of Administration Policy announcing he will NOT support the bill because it provides $2.2 billion in critical funding over his request.
   "We are providing critical funds to ensure that our borders, ports and local communities are secure to prevent terrorist attacks, but also provide much needed funding for first responders to do their jobs in the event of such an attack," said Salazar. "I am hopeful the President will sign this bill given the broad bipartisan support that it has."
   The 9/11 Commission Conference Report will now go to both the House and Senate for final passage and then to the President's desk for signature.
