SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GOV. KEMPTHORNE TO BE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR
  United States Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement today in reaction to President Bush's announcement that he intends to nominate Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne to be Secretary of the Interior: 
   "I am glad the President plans to nominate a Westerner as the next Secretary of the Interior.
   "I look forward to a full, open and honest review of the Governor's record and views on our Nation's public lands and resources, including the issues of oil and gas drilling leases, federal and state water rights and the sales of our public lands.
   "Governor Kempthorne is a former Senator, so I am confident that he understands and respects the Senate's Constitutional responsibilities in this process. I look forward to his testimony before the Senate Energy Committee."
