SEN. SALAZAR INTRODUCES BILL TO PREVENT CLOSURE OF FARM SERVICE AGENCY OFFICES
  Ensuring that Colorado's farmers and ranchers have adequate access to the programs administered by the Farm Service Agency, United States Senator Ken Salazar today introduced legislation that will prohibit the closure or relocation of any Farm Service Agency county office in Colorado for one year. 
   Currently, the Colorado Farm Service Agency is proposing to close FSA offices in Bent, Larimer, Rio Grande, Conejos and El Paso Counties. In August, Senator Salazar and Rep. John Salazar sent a letter expressing their opposition and concern with the current proposal to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns. Producers typically travel to FSA offices at least twice a year to sign up for farm programs and to report their planted acreages.
   "After spending most of my life working on my family's ranch in the San Luis Valley in Colorado and now working in the United States Senate on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, I know the important tools, information and support local FSA county offices provide to our Nation's farmers and ranchers," said Senator Salazar. "I believe that closing these offices will have a devastating effect on an area that heavily depends upon the resources and local services that their FSA office provides."
   The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers and manages farm commodity, credit, conservation, disaster and loan programs as laid out by Congress through a network of federal, state and county offices. These programs are designed to improve the economic stability of the agricultural industry and to help farmers adjust production to meet demand. Economically, the desired result of these programs is a steady price range for agricultural commodities for both farmers and consumers.
