SEN. SALAZAR LAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF ETHICS REFORM BILL
  Today, United States Ken Salazar released the following statement after the Senate passed the most robust ethics reform legislation in the history of Congress earlier this afternoon. 
   "Last November the American people asked for a new direction in Washington and today we acted on our promise to clean up how business is done around here. Today's vote in the Senate, passing landmark legislation to tighten ethics and lobbying rules for Congress, is historic and past due. The passage of this bill will help end the culture of corruption in Washington and I am proud to have supported its enactment."
