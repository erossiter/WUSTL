SEN. SALAZAR QUESTIONS TRANSPARENCY SURROUNDING SALE OF COLORADO'S USFS LANDS
  In a letter addressed to USFS Chief Dale Bosworth, Sen. Salazar again expressed concern about a proposal to sell pieces of America's permanent heritage of public lands as part of a short term budget issue and he asked for an extension of time for public comment on the sale of those public lands. In the letter, Sen. Salazar also asked that the maps of potential USFS land to be auctioned off be made more easily available for citizens of Colorado to view for an informed and educated comment period. 
   "If these lands are to be sold, the process must be transparent and maps made easily available to all citizens who wish to have a say in this issue. The public comment period began on February 28, but maps and information are still not easily accessible.
   "As of today, the public comment process has been almost non-existent. I am therefore asking that the public comment date begin when maps and information surrounding the sale of the parcels are made broadly available," Senator Salazar stated.
   The lands are slated to be sold to provide funding for the President's FY 2007 Budget. The public comment period is currently scheduled to end on March 30.
