SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES PUBLIC SAFETY PROJECTS FOR COLORADO THAT CLEAR FIRST FUNDING HURDLE
  Late last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill (FY08 CJS), which will set funding levels for law enforcement programs, among other items, for the upcoming fiscal year starting in October. Sen. Ken Salazar today announced 16 Colorado projects have received preliminary approval and funding levels as part of the bill. Among the Colorado projects given preliminary funding approval are more than $1 million for Drug Task Forces around the state, and explicit instructions from Congress for the Bureau of Prisons to improve working and security conditions at Supermax in Florence.
   "While this is only a first step to federal funding, these Colorado projects receiving preliminary approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee is a good sign," said Senator Salazar. "I am especially pleased the Committee recognized the importance of fighting the scourge of meth across Colorado, especially in our rural communities where the impact of meth is frequently its most brutal." 
   Senator Salazar made a strong push to combat the growing threat of meth to Colorado's communities and families as part of the FY08 CJS appropriations bill, and secured first-round approval for $1.3 million for nine Drug Task Forces around the state, all of which have been facing increasing workloads and declining funding support:
   * $150,000 for the 22nd Judicial Drug Task Force in the Four Corners region to hire a full-time Project Director to oversee the growing workload of this Task Force, and to pay for operating costs for the three-agent task force, currently in its eighth year of operations;
   * $100,000 for the Delta/Montrose Drug Task Force for equipment, overhead and personnel expenses. The task force has seen increases in drug activity, especially meth;
   * $25,000 for the San Luis Valley Drug Task Force to obtain surveillance camera/ recorder and accompanying equipment. The San Luis Valley Drug Task Force covers an area larger than 8,000 square miles where one in five residents lives below the poverty line; 
   * $100,000 for the Greater Routt and Moffat Narcotics Enforcement Team (GRAMNET), to fund participating agencies' personnel expenses, equipment and technology upgrades and operational expenses. This multi-jurisdictional drug task force covers 9,000 square miles in largely rural Routt and Moffat Counties, and saw meth-related arrests increased by 295 percent from 2003 to 2004, with similar annual increases since then;
   * $100,000 for the Eagle County Drug Task Force to hire two additional narcotics investigators. The Eagle County Drug Task Force covers central Colorado in an area with approximately 50,000 people and 1,700 square miles;
   * $150,000 for the Weld County Drug Task Force to acquire a surveillance system consisting of a laptop computer system and other surveillance electronics, allowing the task force to stake out high crime areas by means of video and audio surveillance that record narcotics activity, provide clandestine surveillance of high crime areas and provide surveillance of narcotics and gang related activities. In the past year, the Weld County Drug Task Force has arrested 171 persons, seized 3.4 kilograms of cocaine, 2.5 kilograms of meth, 2,848 dosage units of MDMA, and shut down seven meth labs;
   * $150,000 for the Larimer County Drug Task Force, to purchase a six-line advanced digital and analog collection system, radio inter-operability system and all source analysis module, giving the Task Force the ability to monitor phones being used by drug trafficking and other criminal organizations. This equipment would also be accessible to other law enforcement agencies within the Northern Colorado region;
   * $400,000 for the North Metro Task Force to purchase the COPLINK computer system, which will allow patrol officers and detectives across multi-jurisdictional lines to have immediate access to vast banks of computer information stored by all police agencies in the county, along with records from the courts, the District Attorney's Office and the probation department; and
   * $125,000 for the West Metro Drug Task Force for drug testing supplies and protective equipment and interoperable radio equipment that can function in Jefferson County's diverse rural and urban settings, to hire a contract District Attorney Prosecutor, and pay for overtime support for Task Force Officers. 
   An additional anti-meth push could be realized with $100,000 for Research on the Impacts of Meth on Children at National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, also approved by the Appropriations Committee at the request of Senator Salazar. Working with the Los Alamos Lab in New Mexico to determine which chemical residues remain in buildings, with the Denver Crisis Center to understand the physical and mental challenges faced by children removed from meth homes, and with the University of Montana to identify how to prevent adverse outcomes to children impacted by meth, National Jewish will the medium and long-term consequences of meth and the impact that meth labs have on children to help develop interventions to prevent long-term consequences to children affected by meth;
   * Other Colorado projects which cleared this important first hurdle to receiving federal funding for FY08 include:
   * $350,000 to establish the Colorado Schools Safety Program at the University of Colorado, Boulder, as part of its Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence. The program will focus on the causes and consequences of school violence, as well as information about evidence-based programs to prevent school violence, in partnership with the CU-Boulder Schools of Law and Education; the Colorado Attorney General's office; and the Colorado Departments of Education and Public Health and Environment; 
   * $200,000 for a Dispatch Center for the City of Montrose. Currently, the City of Montrose contracts out service for its dispatch equipment, located in Montrose County building. The funds would allow the City to establish its own Dispatch Center for use by City police, fire, and emergency medical services, while also allowing Montrose police to increase their focus on traditional law enforcement functions instead of manually inputting data; 
   * $400,000 to establish the National Center for Audio/Video Forensics at University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. The National Center for Audio/Video Forensics (NCA/VF) will establish cross-disciplinary, inter-institutional collaborations for research in forensic sciences and homeland security, including audio/video enhancement and certified transcripts, voice identification, audio/video authentication, and specialized analyses; 
   * $300,000 for Development of a Combined PET/CT Scanner at Colorado State University. A tool that combines the imaging capabilities of computerized tomography (CT) with the biologic and physiologic information from positron emission tomography (PET) is already dramatically improving the quality of cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the real future of a combined PET/CT lays in continued research in the development of new tools for molecular imaging of direct interest to NASA, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of neurological, cardiovascular, and bone disease, all of which may be associated with prolonged deep space flight; and 
   * $300,000 for the Denver Police Department's Gang Bureau, to obtain software, servers and access to national gang databases through implementation of the GangNet program, which will enhance the Bureau's ability to conduct analysis of gang membership linkages and crime patterns. The Denver Gang Bureau investigates gang-related and gang motivated crimes, enforces City, State and Federal laws as they related to gang activity, and develop and maintains gang related information to minimize the influence of criminal street gangs within the Denver Community; and 
   In addition, the FY08 CJS Appropriations bill includes instructions regarding the Administrative Maximum United States Penitentiary [ADX], also known as "Supermax," located in Florence, Colorado from Congress to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The bill instructs the Bureau of Prisons to allocate the necessary funding to address the pressing need to upgrade security infrastructure, provide strict oversight of prisoner activities and communications and ensure safety of the prison staff at Supermax.
   The bill also includes $12.5 million for security funding surrounding the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. These funds are the first installment of security funding for both national conventions and in Denver are expected to help fund additional overtime pay for Denver Police officers as well as bringing in additional law enforcement support from surrounding areas during the Convention, and related security equipment.
   Having been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee, the FY08 CJS Appropriations bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
