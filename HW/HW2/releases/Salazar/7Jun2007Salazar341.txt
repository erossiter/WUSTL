SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOTE FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on the vote regarding the immigration reform legislation on the floor of the U.S. Senate: 
   "I am disappointed the United States Senate did not, today, fix our broken borders and immigration system.
   "This was our best chance to pass a bill that would secure our borders, strengthen and enforce our immigration laws and provide a realistic solution for the 12 million undocumented workers in our Nation.
   "Our Nation badly needs the reform. Failure is not an option. I remain undaunted and will continue to work with the President and my Democratic and Republican colleagues to strengthen our National security and create a real immigration system for the future."
