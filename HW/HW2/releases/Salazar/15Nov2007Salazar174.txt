SEN. SALAZAR RECOGNIZES SERVICE OF SEN. FITZGERALD, CONGRATULATES SEN. GROFF ON ELECTION AS PRESIDENT OF COLORADO STATE SENATE
  Today, United States Ken Salazar released the following statement recognizing the work of outgoing Colorado State Senate President Joan Fitz-Gerald and congratulating incoming Senate President, Peter Groff. 
   "Senator Peter Groff is a sensible and talented State Senator and I am confident that these qualities will be put to good use in his new and historic leadership role at the State Capitol. I have watched and worked with Peter as he has grown in to one of our state's most effective and respected legislators. At the Colorado State Capitol he is lauded for his ability to work with Republicans and Democrats to better our state. I look forward to many productive legislative sessions with Peter at the Senate helm.
   "Additionally, Senator Fitz-Gerald has served the state of Colorado for many years, in several posts, but always with honor and distinction. Her departure from state politics will undoubtedly be felt by those fortunate enough to have worked alongside her, irrespective of the issue at hand. I wish Senator Fitzgerald, her husband John and their two boys only the best of luck in the years that lie ahead."
