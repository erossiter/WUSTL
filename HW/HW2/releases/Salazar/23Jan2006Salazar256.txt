SEN. SALAZAR APPOINTED TO ETHICS AND AGING COMMITTEES
  Today Sen. Ken Salazar announced his appointments last week to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics and the Special Committee on Aging. These appointments are in addition to the Senator's seats on the Energy and Natural Resources, Veterans Affairs, and Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committees. 
   Senator Salazar said, "I am honored by these appointments. Washington needs to embrace the highest ethical standards that Americans have the right to expect of their government. As Colorado's former Attorney General and as former legal counsel to the governor, I know that a high standard of ethics among government officials is required in order for our citizens to have trust in their government.
   "I also look forward to working on matters relating to our seniors. As former Colorado Attorney General I worked to protect the elderly against fraud and intend to continue that fight on the Aging Committee. I believe that respect of our elders is one of our highest moral values."
   Senator Salazar joins Ethics Committee Chairman George Voinovich (R-OH) and Senators Roberts (R-KS), Thomas (R-WY), Johnson (D-SD) and Pryor (D-AR) on the evenly divided committee. The Ethics Committee implements the Senate's Code of Official Conduct and issues rulings and opinions regarding the ethical actions of Senators.
   The Special Committee on Aging studies issues, conducts oversight, and produces investigative reports of fraud and waste on matters relating to older Americans. Most notably, the Medicare Modernization Act and the solvency of Social Security are at the top of an agenda that will continue to grow as more than 50 million baby boomers begin to retire. Senator Salazar joins Aging Committee Chairman Gordon Smith (R-OR), Ranking Member Herb Kohl (D-WI) and nearly 20 other Senators on the committee.
