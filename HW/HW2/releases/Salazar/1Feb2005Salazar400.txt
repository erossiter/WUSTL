SEN. SALAZAR GETS RESPONSE FROM JUDGE GONZALES ON TORTURE, CIVIL RIGHTS
  Sen. Ken Salazar released a letter concerning torture and civil rights he received from Judge Alberto Gonzales concerning his nomination to be Attorney General. Sen.  
 Salazar requested the letter from Judge Gonzales to get assurance from him that he will represent the People of the United States, uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States, and denounce torture in all its forms. 
   In his letter Judge Gonzales states: "I do not condone torture in any form. I confirm to you that the United States of America does not condone the torture of anyone by our country or by anyone else. I reaffirm to you that, if confirmed as Attorney General, I will enforce these laws and international obligations aggressively to prohibit torture in all its forms...I pledge to do so for two reasons. These are the laws of the United States, and I am obligated to uphold those laws. And, secondly, any action by the United States that undermines the Geneva Conventions threatens the safety and security of our troops." 
   "This is an unequivocal statement regarding torture that clearly rejects any notion of the use of torture by the United States anywhere or at anytime," said Senator Salazar. "It was very important for me to obtain this assurance. In addition, it is important for me to get written confirmation on his views on civil rights and the independence of the Attorney General."
