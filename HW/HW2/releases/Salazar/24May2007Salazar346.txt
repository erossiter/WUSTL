SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill approved by Congress today:
   "I am pleased with today's passage of the Iraq supplemental bill, and I encourage the President to sign it.
   "As I have said all along, today's vote shows that the Senate supports our troops and ensures that our forces have the funding they need to do their job. 
   "Specifically, this supplemental bill provides funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and provides additional emergency funds to meet the needs of our troops and veterans and our emergencies here at home. The supplemental includes:
   * $1 billion increase for National Guard and Reserve equipment. That money will ensure that our National Guard and reserve troops have the equipment that they need while they are in harm's way;
   * $1.1 billion for military housing, which the President did not request, but that is essential in order to provide housing for our men and women in uniform and their families;
   * $1.2 billion above the President's request for the purchase of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles. This money is essential given that most of the casualties and wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan are coming from roadside bombs;
   * $4.8 billion that was not requested by the President, but which is necessary for veterans to receive the health care that they deserve. This is especially critical at this time when we have 1.5 millions veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan;
   * $6.4 billion to rebuild the Gulf Coast, which remains in a state of devastation from Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. We should be able to take care of our Nation's emergencies and this money will help restore the Gulf Coast area;
   * $1 billion for Homeland Security to ensure needed enhancements take place in areas such as port and mass-transit security; and
   * $3 billion for agricultural disasters, including money for the storm disasters that hit the eastern plains of Colorado.
   "Equally as important, the benchmarks, reporting requirements and independent assessments are the first time Congress has put into law the requirements for accountability for both the Iraqi government and the President. If signed by the President, the Iraqi government will be held accountable for succeeding on the 18 benchmarks specified in the bill, and America's commitment is made contingent upon the Iraqi government succeeding on these benchmarks.
   "As part of the law, the President will have to report to Congress on July 15 and again on September 15 on progress towards meeting those benchmarks. In addition, General Petraeus will have to independently report to Congress prior to the President's report on Sept 15.
   "Finally, the law will require two assessments independent of the Bush administration concerning whether progress is being made on the benchmarks and on the condition of the Iraq security forces. The overall assessment on the benchmarks will be conducted by the General Accounting Office. The independent assessment of the condition of the Iraqi security forces will be conducted by an outside 501(c)(3) organization.
   "We are systematically changing the direction in Iraq with this legislation.
   "In addition, Senators Mark Pryor (D-AR), Bob Bennett (R-UT), Robert Casey (D-PA), and Judd Gregg (R-NH) joined me and Senator Alexander (R-TN) on the Senate floor announcing that that they will cosponsor the legislation I crafted to implement the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group (ISG) as official U.S. policy."
