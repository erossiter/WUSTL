SEN. SALAZAR PUSHES BILL TO FACILITATE ADMINISTRATION OF BACA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE NEAR GREAT SAND DUNES NATIONAL PARK
  Today, in a National Parks Subcommittee meeting of the Senate Energy Committee, United States Senator Ken Salazar discussed S. 127, which would amend the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Act of 2000, to explain the purpose and provide for the administration of the Baca National Wildlife Refuge. When the Great Sand Dunes National Park was established the legislation lacked a statement of purpose for the Baca National Wildlife refuge. S. 127 would define the purpose of the refuge as, "?to restore, enhance, and maintain wetland, upland, riparian, and other habitats for native wildlife, plant, and fish species in the San Luis Valley." 
   "The lands in the Baca National Wildlife Refuge are unique in their history, geography and floral and faunal make-up," said Senator Salazar. "This bill simply defines the purpose of the refuge to restore and enhance the natural treasures of the area and provides guidelines to administer that purpose."
   The National Park Service's Deputy Director, Daniel N. Wenk, testified in support of Senator Salazar's bill at the hearing. The Park Service also proposed a straightforward change to the bill that would clarify that the Service is obligated to provide a certain amount of water to municipal users without negating a pre-existing water service agreement between the Service and the Baca Grande Water and Sanitation District associated with the refuge. This agreement obligates the Service to lease up to 4,000 acre-feet of water rights - which the Service acquired along with the refuge - to the District. This provision was requested by the Rio Grande Water Conservancy District. The District supports the bill and the amendment.
   S. 127 will not await a 'mark-up' hearing before the full Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
