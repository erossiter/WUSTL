SEN. SALAZAR DISAPPOINTED ROCKY FLATS WORKERS STILL DENIED BENEFITS
  Sens. Wayne Allard and Ken Salazar today sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, S.1042, that would have directed the Secretary of Energy to provide $15 million in benefits for Rocky Flats workers who would have qualified for benefits but for the early completion of the cleanup at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS).  
 The amendment failed by a vote of 38 to 53.
   "This amendment would have ensured that we didn't punish those who have served our nation well and faithfully, at significant sacrifice to themselves and their families," said Senator Salazar. "This amendment would have also sent a message to workers at other DOE clean-up sites that they can work hard to achieve savings of time and taxpayer funds without having to worry that they are depriving themselves or their families of basic retirement benefits. I am disappointed with today's vote and will continue to fight for these workers who I consider to be National heroes."
