SEN. SALAZAR LOOKS TO USE LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND TO HELP IMPROVE COLORADO'S SECURITY/PLEDGES CONTINUED WORK WITH GOVERNOR
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in response to the Department of Homeland Security's audit of Colorado's homeland security programs from 2003 to 2006. 
   "The Department of Homeland Security's audit of Colorado's homeland security programs confirms the findings of the survey my office sent to our state's first responders and emergency officials in early 2005. In 2005, Colorado first responders and emergency officials felt largely unprepared for a major terrorist incident and frustrated with the prioritization of grant funding. I have worked hard with local law enforcement departments to help improve this situation but we still have much work to do.
   "I will continue to work at the federal level to ensure that Governor Ritter and General Whitney have the Homeland Security resources they need to protect Colorado's public safety and security. That includes working to restore critical Homeland Security grant funding that President Bush tried to cut earlier this year and working with the State of Colorado and its agencies to help address the concerns highlighted in this most recent audit. With Governor Ritter's leadership and our joint history in law enforcement and protecting our communities we will do everything we can to make Colorado and its people more secure."
