SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO ANNOUNCEMENT ON FARM BILL
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after President Bush issued a Statement of Administration Policy stating he would veto the bipartisan 2007 Farm Bill which invests in rural development, energy technology, wise stewardship and strengthens our Nation's ability to produce clean, safe, and affordable food. 
   "In announcing today that he would veto the 2007 Farm Bill, President Bush is effectively pulling the rug out from under rural America. We have worked very hard in the Senate Agriculture Committee to forge a bi-partisan, well-balanced and fiscally responsible compromise that brings a new life and energy to rural America, and opens the next chapter of opportunities for our Nation.
   "This bill helps farmers, ranchers and entrepreneurs build a clean energy economy that has roots in America's farms and fields. It lays the infrastructure for accelerating development in rural areas. It creates incentives for the wise stewardship of our land and water. And it invests in nutrition programs that combat hunger and allow our children access to eat healthy lunches at school.
   "I am extremely disappointed that President Bush has so quickly dismissed the farmers, ranchers and rural communities that form the bedrock of our Nation. I strongly urge the President to stop playing politics and reconsider his veto as this bill is completely paid for and represents the best type of work we can do in the Senate- cooperative, bipartisan work that focuses on creating new opportunities for our country."
