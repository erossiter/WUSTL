SEN. SALAZAR VOTES IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING OIL AND GAS SUPPLIES, LWCF FUNDING
  Sen. Ken Salazar voted today in support of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. 
   "I voted for cloture today because I believe we must move forward on bringing additional domestic oil and gas supplies online," said Senator Salazar. "At the same time, we cannot drill our way to energy independence. Regardless of the additional capacity this bill may create, we must make progress on renewable energy initiatives if we are to meaningfully reduce our addiction to foreign oil. I support the bill before us, but we are still waiting for the comprehensive energy debate that this country needs.
   "I am also supportive of this bill because it creates the first dedicated revenue stream for the stateside program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I am proud to have worked to add this permanent source of revenue to the bill with my colleague Senator Lamar Alexander. While this bill falls short of all the funding we need, both Senator Alexander and I will continue to fight for adequate funding in the upcoming Appropriations process. We must protect our Nation's natural heritage and open spaces for future generations.
   "Finally, my support for the Senate bill does not equate to guaranteed support of any bill that may come out of a conference committee. The House version of this legislation is potentially harmful to Colorado and, like many of my colleagues, I will oppose any changes to the Senate bill that are not consistent with the agreement described last week by Senate Leadership."
