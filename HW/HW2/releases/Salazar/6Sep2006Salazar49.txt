SEN. SALAZAR URGES RISK MANAGEMENT AGENCY TO HELP FARMERS SUFFERING FROM WATER EMERGENCY
  Sen. Ken Salazar sent a letter to the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) Administrator Eldon Gould urging him to act swiftly in order to aid Colorado farmers who had their water wells shutoff this year. RMA will visit Colorado on September 12 to meet with the Commissioner of Agriculture, the State Engineer, the Central Colorado Water Conservancy District (CCWCD) and several affected producers. The meeting could determine whether farmers affected by the water well shutdown will receive full crop insurance benefits for their losses. 
   In the letter, Senator Salazar wrote, "?I am pleased to hear that several RMA representatives will be traveling to Colorado on September 12?It is extremely important that RMA programs, which are designed to help our farmers, operate in a fair and farmer-friendly manner."
