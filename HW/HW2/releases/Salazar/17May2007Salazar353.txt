SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIRST-STEP AGREEMENT ON IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement announcing a broad, bipartisan, first-step agreement on immigration reform legislation: 
   "Today, we have finally reached broad agreement on immigration reform.
   "I have spent countless hours working with my Republican and Democratic colleagues to reach an agreement on a plan that first and foremost secures our borders.
   "This bill secures our borders, has tough enforcement of our immigration laws on the border and in the interior, brings the 12 million undocumented workers in our Nation out of the shadows and creates a real immigration system for the future.
   "This compromise includes an agreement on a guest worker program that will help our farmers, ranchers and businesses across Colorado and the Nation.
   "While I still need to see the final language, today's agreement is an important start in the process of moving this bill forward. This is a compromise that we can take to the floor process where I look forward to working with my colleagues to further improve it."
