SEN. SALAZAR PLEDGES TO WORK WITH GOV. KEMPTHORNE TO PROTECT NATION'S NATURAL HERITAGE
  As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. Ken Salazar voted today in favor of moving Gov. Dirk Kempthorne's nomination to Secretary of the Interior forward. That vote passed and now Kempthorne's nomination goes to the full Senate for a vote. 
   "I take Governor Kempthorne at his word that my colleagues and I will be able to work with him as he begins to address the many serious issues currently before the Department of Interior," Salazar said. "I have grave concerns, as I've stated in committee hearings and official correspondence to the Administration, about the Department's position on BLM land sales, LWCF state-side grants, changes to National Parks management rules and many other issues. Governor Kempthorne is a man of the West who has an intimate understanding of how these issues affect a state like Colorado. I look forward to working with him to protect our natural heritage for future generations to enjoy."
