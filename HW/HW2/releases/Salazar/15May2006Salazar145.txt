SEN. SALAZAR RENEWS REQUEST THAT BLM WITHDRAW GRAND JUNCTION AND PALISADE WATERSHED PARCELS FROM LEASE SALE
  Sen. Ken Salazar sent a letter to Bureau of Land Management Director Sally Wisely today asking again that the BLM withdraw parcels of land within and adjoining the watersheds for the municipalities of Grand Junction and Palisade. Currently, if the lease sale goes forward, 70% of Palisade's watershed, including land around the city's spring and reservoir, will be available for oil and gas exploration and production with all the associated risks to water quality. 
   In the letter to Director Wisely, Senator Salazar writes, "Your agency's decision was made over the strong objections and legitimate concerns voiced by those communities (Grand Junction and Palisade). I share those concerns, and I am once again asking you to withdraw these parcels until adequate assurances are provided to these communities as to the future safety of their water supply.
   Also, in the letter, Senator Salazar suggests that, "withdrawing the parcels, and taking the time to work with the communities impacted to ensure adequate agreement and protections is a reasonable and responsible approach, and one I strongly urge you and your agency to take."
