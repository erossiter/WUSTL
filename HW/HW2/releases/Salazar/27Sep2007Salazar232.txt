SEN. SALAZAR WORKS TO PROTECT HISTORY OF CACHE LA POUDRE RIVER
  Today, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on National Parks held a hearing regarding the Cache la Poudre River Corridor National Heritage Area Technical Adjustment Act (S. 128). United States Ken Salazar is a cosponsor of the bill along with Senator Wayne Allard. As a member of the Energy and Natural resources Committee, Senator Salazar will continue to work to ensure that this piece of legislation is approved by the Committee and is considered by the full Senate. 
   "We in Colorado are very proud of the Poudre River and the history it has inspired along its banks," said Senator Salazar. "By strengthening the current National Heritage Area, we are giving local citizens a stronger voice in the preservation of the vital history, spectacular views, world-class recreational opportunities and heritage of the Poudre River of which we are so proud."
   The bill fixes a problem in the law that originally established the heritage area in 1996. Because of a glitch in the statute, the Secretary of Interior has been unable to appoint a commission to manage the heritage area. This bill designates a local non-profit organization, the Poudre Heritage Alliance, as the management entity for the heritage area. It also extends the authorization for the area for an additional ten years, to allow for a total of $1 million in federal assistance for historic, cultural and natural resource preservation.
   The bill has the support of the local communities and stakeholders, including Fort Collins, Greeley, Windsor and the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District.
