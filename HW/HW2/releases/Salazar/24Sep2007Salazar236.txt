BILL WITH $120 MILLION FOR CRITICAL WATER PROJECTS IN COLORADO PASSES SENATE; WILL GO TO PRESIDENT FOR SIGNATURE
  Today, with passage of the conference report for the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA), United States Senator Ken Salazar announced over $120 million for critical water-related projects in Colorado. The report authorizes federal spending on water development, infrastructure, flood control and other projects conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Contained in this year's WRDA is funding authorization for several projects in Colorado, including an authorization for construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, all included at the request of United States Senator Ken Salazar. The conference report will now go to the President for his signature.  
   "To the West and rural America, water is our most important resource," said Senator Salazar. "I am pleased that Congress has recognized the importance of authorizing these water projects for Colorado. The authorization for the long-promised Arkansas Valley Conduit is especially welcome to the people of Southeastern Colorado."
   At Senator Salazar's request, WRDA includes funding authorization for the following projects around Colorado:
   $79 Million for Arkansas Valley Conduit: WRDA includes a $79 million authorization for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in Southeastern Colorado. The construction of this conduit will fulfill a long-standing promise to the people of the lower Arkansas Valley for fresh drinking water and is one of the keystones for the economic revitalization of Southeastern Colorado; 
   * $10 Million for the Boulder County Pipeline: WRDA includes a $10 million authorization for construction of a water pipeline, which will protect drinking water quality and allow for year-round water delivery from Carter Lake to Boulder and other municipal area water providers; 
   * Fountain Creek Watershed Study: WRDA includes specific instructions to the Secretary of the Army to speed up completion of the Fountain Creek Watershed Study, the first step towards the clean-up and protection of Fountain Creek for all the communities. The importance of this study was underscored earlier this year when the Creek flooded parts of Pueblo along Dillon Drive, damaging several homes and businesses. 
   * $5 Million Authorization for a Statewide Selenium Study: WRDA includes a $5 million authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct regional and watershed-wide studies to address selenium concentrations in Colorado, which in high doses can be fatal to humans, livestock and wildlife. 
   * South Platte River, Colorado- WRDA includes a $13.06 million authorization for use in partnership with state and local entities to complete flood mitigation, habitat restoration, and improved recreation along the South Platte River in Denver, to be matched by more than $7 million in non-Federal funds. 
   * $25 million for the Rio Grande Environmental Management Program in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, which provides for the ongoing restoration and management of the Rio Grande, which is headwatered in Colorado, and its tributaries such as the Alamosa and Conejos Rivers. 
   * $1 million for water and wastewater infrastructure for the Ute Mountain Project in Montezuma and La Plata Counties.
