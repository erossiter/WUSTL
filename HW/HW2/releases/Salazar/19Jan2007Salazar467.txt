SEN. SALAZAR INTRODUCES MULTIPLE BILLS TO BREAK AMERICA'S ADDICTION TO FOREIGN OIL
 For Immediate Release
   Over the last 36 hours, Sen. Ken Salazar has introduced and co-sponsored several bills to reduce America's addiction to foreign oil. 
   Initiatives Senator Salazar has introduced would: close tax loopholes that encourage small businesses to buy larger vehicles that consume more fuel; provide grants to gas station owners who install alternative refueling systems; promote the development of renewable energies such as cellulosic ethanol; increase vehicle efficiency by requiring automakers to upgrade their cars with flex-fuel technologies; and much more.
   "This country's addiction to foreign oil puts our national security at risk," said Senator Salazar. "Just as the government defends our borders with advanced military technology and manpower, we must also protect our nation by breaking this addiction, which funds both sides of the war on terror. These bills will move us towards that goal."
   The four bills are:
   * The DRIVE Act - Promotes development of biorefineries, cellulosic ethanol and infrastructure for ethanol pumps at gas stations. It requires automakers to equip 10 percent of their fleets with renewable fuel technology - such as flexible fuel, clean diesel and electricity. It also provides tax credits, loan guarantees and other subsidies to help manufacturers retool their factories and to promote the use of renewable fuels. 
   * The Gas Guzzler Act - Closes the tax loophole that encourages small businesses to buy bigger, heavier vehicles that consume more fuel. Protects the deduction for farmers and ranchers. 
   * The Alternative Energy Refueling Systems Act - Authorizes the Department of Energy to provide grants to gas station owners who install alternative refueling systems. These grants would greatly assist in expanding the availability of alternative fuels such as E-85, Biodiesel, Natural Gas, Compressed Natural Gas, Hydrogen, and Liquefied Petroleum Gas. 
   * 25 x '25 Congressional Resolution - Sets a goal to produce 25 percent of the nation's energy supply from renewable sources by 2025. 
   "These bills are merely a starting point," added Senator Salazar. "These initiatives must be combined with the continuing entrepreneurial drive of the private sector to find sources and uses for renewable energy. They must also work in conjunction with an honest effort on behalf of the American people to conserve energy wherever possible."
