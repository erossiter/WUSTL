SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF USDA LIVESTOCK, CROP DISASTER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will begin to accept sign-ups in early September and October for assistance programs that provide benefits to farmers and ranchers who suffered losses caused by natural disasters, such as droughts, wildfires and blizzards, in recent years. Earlier this year, Senator Salazar supported the "U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007" which authorized funding for the USDA natural disaster aid programs for affected areas across the country. 
   "As a rancher, I understand the challenges farmers and ranchers face when natural disasters strike," said Senator Salazar. "These USDA disaster assistance programs are critical to ensure that our farms and ranches can recover from such disasters."
   Eligible farmers and livestock producers can apply for benefits under The Livestock Compensation Program (LCP) and the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) beginning September 10, 2007. Eligible farmers can sign up for the Crop Disaster Program (CDP) beginning October 15, 2007.
   The LCP compensates livestock producers for feed losses occurring between January 1, 2005 and February 28, 2007 due to natural disaster. This can include those who suffered from losses resulting from blizzards in late 2006 and early 2007. Those that also have suffered from losses related to wildfire natural disasters may also be eligible.
   LIP compensates livestock producers for livestock losses between January 1, 2005 and February 28, 2007 due to natural disasters, including blizzards. CDP provides benefits to farmers who suffered quantity and quality losses of crops between 2005-2007 as a result of natural disasters.
   More information on these programs can be obtained from the USDA's website at http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=home&subject=diap&topic=landing. You may also obtain more information by calling Senator Salazar's office at 303-455-7600.
