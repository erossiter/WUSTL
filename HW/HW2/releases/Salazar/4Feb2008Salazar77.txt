SEN. SALAZAR PLEASED ADMINISTRATION WILL SEEK TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR PUEBLO CHEMICAL DEPOT IN 2009 BUDGET
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in response to President Bush's budget proposal and the funding outlined for weapons destruction at Pueblo Chemical Depot. 
   In Fiscal Year 2009, President Bush is proposing $174.1 million for weapons destruction at Pueblo Chemical Depot. Funding will go toward continued construction of the Agent Processing Building (APB), the Energetics Processing Building, and the Control and Support Building, the Bio Treatment Area, and other components of the facility. The budget documents show that the Department of Defense is currently planning on destroying hydrolysate on-site.
   "I am pleased that the Administration is finally seeing the need to increase funding for chemical weapons destruction at Pueblo to meet the 2017 deadline that we recently put into law. I am also pleased that it is continuing toward construction of the bio-treatment facility to safely destroy hydrolysate on-site.
   "I will fight for this funding as the Congressional budget process moves forward and continue to work closely with the Department of Defense over the coming months to evaluate its progress at Pueblo and to determine what other steps we can take to expedite the safe destruction of the stockpile."
