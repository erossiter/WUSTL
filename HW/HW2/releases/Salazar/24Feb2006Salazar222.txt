SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES GRANTS AVAILABLE TO IMPROVE AIR SERVICE TO SMALL TOWNS, CITIES
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced that the Department of Transportation (DOT) is making $10 million available to help communities address their local air service problems, such as high fares and insufficient levels of service. 
   The DOT's Small Community Air Service Development Program uses federal funds to support communities working to attract or improve air service. Congress appropriated approximately $10 million for up to a total of 40 grants this year to help communities address their local air service problems.
   DOT will give priority to proposals from communities that have high airfares compared to other communities, contribute financially to the project from sources other than airport revenues, have established or will establish a public-private partnership to improve their air service, submitted proposals that will benefit a broad segment of the public with limited access to the national transportation system, and will use the assistance in a timely fashion.
   Applications for grants are due April 7, 2006. The DOT's request for proposals is available on the Internet at http://dms.dot.gov, docket number OST-2006-23671. Community proposals will also be filed in this docket.
   Contact: Cody Wertz, 303/455-7600; Andrew Nannis, 202/224-5852.
