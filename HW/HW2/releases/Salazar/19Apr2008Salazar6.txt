SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT IN REMEMBRANCE OF COLUMBINE TRAGEDY
  United States Senator Ken Salazar today released the following statement in anticipation of the ninth anniversary of the Columbine High School tragedy: 
   "As we go about our daily lives on the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, it is my hope that in each of our own ways we can reflect on the events of that cold overcast day nine years ago.
   "It was a dark day in Colorado and one that showed humanity at its very worst in the actions by the two killers and the very best in the courage shown by the victims and their families.
   "We cannot change what happened that day but we can ensure that we never forget what took place. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the survivors and the victims of that sad day, their families, friends and the community - because at the end of the day - we are ALL Columbine."
