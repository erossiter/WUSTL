SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON LOWER ARKANSAS VALLEY JOB LOSS ANNOUNCEMENTS TODAY
  Sen. Salazar Statement on Lower Arkansas Valley Job Loss Announcements Today 
   "This is a difficult, sad day for Lamar, La Junta and the Lower Arkansas Valley. The combined loss of nearly 500 jobs at Neoplan and Bay Valley is devastating to these communities, and will impact all of Colorado. So many have worked so hard to create jobs and opportunity for people in this part of rural Colorado, and it means that we all have to work together, even harder now, to bring jobs and economic growth to this area. I've talked a great deal about the "Forgotten America", our rural communities too often bypassed. I pledge to continue to do all I can to make sure the Lower Arkansas Valley is not forgotten."
