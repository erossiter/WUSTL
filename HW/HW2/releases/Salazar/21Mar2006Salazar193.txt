SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEMOCRATIZATION, SECURITY, ECONOMIC STABILITY IN IRAQ
  United States Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement from Iraq. 
   "After meeting with US, Iraqi and international officials in Iraq today, I have seen progress in efforts toward democratization, security and economic stability, but a significant amount of work and difficult times remain ahead.
   "Progress has been admirable, but much of the country remains without infrastructure and the Iraqi Army is not yet ready to control its own streets. And, it is obvious our troops are performing admirably in difficult situations.
   "Strict timelines for success in Iraq are not helpful. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the Iraqis to succeed in creating a peaceful nation for themselves."
