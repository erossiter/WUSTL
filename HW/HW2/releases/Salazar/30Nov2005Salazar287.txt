SEN. SALAZAR REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S IRAQ SPEECH
  Sen. Salazar Statement on President's Iraq Speech Today
   "The President's speech in Annapolis today was a step in the right direction, and it begins to address the Senate's call for a successful exit strategy with measurable benchmarks.  
 I look forward to hearing more, including information about the specific benchmarks we expect to achieve, and when we expect to achieve them.
   All Americans can use these shared standards to evaluate our progress going forward, and the progress of the Iraqis in taking responsibility for their own security. An Iraqi insurgency will be most effectively defeated by the Iraqis themselves. I also believe that we need to keep our eye on the big picture - the future health and strength of our all-volunteer military, and the imperative of achieving victory in the global war on terrorism.
   I recently met with some of our soldiers who had just returned from Iraq. They are doing a wonderful job, and they are proud of the progress they are making in Iraq. They deserve a policy and a strategy worthy of their efforts."
