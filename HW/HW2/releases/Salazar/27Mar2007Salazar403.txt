SEN. SALAZAR: 'TODAY'S VOTE ON IRAQ, A VOTE FOR CHANGE'
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on the Senate's vote today on Iraq: 
   "Our troops have done the heavy lifting to free Iraq and now the Iraqis must take responsibility for their country. Today's vote is about ensuring that change takes place and I voted for it. 
   "I continue to believe our troops deserve a policy that is worthy of their sacrifice and dedication. This policy continues to honor them and moves Iraq in a new direction.
   "Today's vote does five simple things:
   * Plainly states that Congress and America support our troops; 
   * Establishes a series of benchmarks which the Iraqi government must meet - including disarming militias, strengthening Iraqi security forces, and sharing oil revenues; 
   * Requires periodic reports on the Iraqi government's progress in meeting the benchmarks; 
   * Sets the goal of redeploying, by March 31, 2008, U.S. troops not engaged in training Iraqi troops, conducting targeted anti-terrorism operations or protecting US personnel and infrastructure in Iraq; and 
   * Encourages the President to continue recent efforts to work cooperatively with Iraq's neighbors to develop a comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy for a stable Iraq. 
   "I remain hopeful the President will listen and support it."
