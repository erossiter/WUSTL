SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON BLM'S DECISION TO GO AHEAD WITH MINSERALS LEASING
  "I am pleased that the BLM has decided to conduct further analysis of the parcels in San Miguel county, although I am disappointed with BLM's decision to move forward with leasing the minerals under land located within the watersheds serving the communities of Palisade and Grand Junction.  
 Postponing this lease sale for a short period of time while the affected parties can evaluate the effect of drilling on their watersheds was a reasonable request and the BLM's response is not only disappointing but short sighted. This energy crisis wasn't created in a day and this wholesale rush to sell leases to the highest bidder in sensitive watershed areas is not going to solve the problem."
