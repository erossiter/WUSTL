SEN. SALAZAR LAUDS GOV. RITTER'S CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, WORK IN SENATE PARALLELS GOVERNOR'S CALL FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
  United States Senator Ken Salazar lauded Governor Ritter's report released today outlining a strategy for the State of Colorado to address global warming and provided an update of his renewable energy and climate change efforts in the Senate. Meaningful steps toward energy independence and the reduction of greenhouse gasses will only occur if the federal and state governments work hand in hand toward solutions. Senator Salazar, as a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources and the Finance Committee, continues to work at the federal level to assemble and support legislation that will bolster Colorado's renewable energy leadership and move our Nation towards energy independence.  
   "I applaud Governor Ritter's vision and strategy to address global warming. Colorado has long been at the forefront of our Nation's efforts to create a new, clean energy economy for the twenty-first century that reduces greenhouse gasses, and the Governor's plan is a huge step toward ensuring we address the issue at the state level," said Senator Salazar. "We are all in this together, and the federal and state governments must have a collaborative relationship in addressing global warming and creating a clean energy economy. I will continue to work hard in the Senate to support and bolster Governor Ritter's initiative."
   In his report, Governor Ritter outlined several initiatives on which he encourages action by the federal government. Senator Salazar is a leader on many of those issues in the United States Senate, including: 
   * National Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard: Colorado's experience with respect to a Renewable Energy Portfolio has been an absolutely positive one, and Senator Salazar is supportive of a national renewable electricity standard. A Renewable Electricity Standard was included in the House-passed energy bill and would require utilities to produce 15 percent of their energy from renewable resources by 2020. Senator Salazar is an original sponsor of a similar provision in the Senate, and supports its inclusion in the final energy bill to be considered by the House and Senate. Senator Salazar strongly supports Amendment 37, which Colorado voters approved in 2004, that requires Colorado's top utility companies to provide a percentage of their retail electricity sales from renewable resources. 
   * CAFE Standards: Senator Salazar was a strong proponent of achievable increases to vehicle efficiency standards. The energy bill passed by the Senate passed took meaningful, but not unrealistic, steps to improve vehicle efficiency standards. Under the Senate-passed version of the Energy Bill (H.R. 6), the overall fleet of new cars and light trucks will be increased to 35 mpg by 2020. 
   * Research and Development for Biofuels, particularly cellulosic ethanol: Senator Salazar believes cellulosic biofuels have a real chance to displace significant amounts of foreign oil, and that we should do everything we can to encourage their production. Senator Salazar was successful in including in the Senate Finance Committee-passed tax package a new Cellulosic Biofuels Tax Credit, which would incentivize the production of cellulosic biofuels. It is a first-of-its-kind tax credit creating a new production tax credit of 67? per gallon (in addition to the current 51?/gallon ethanol credit and the 10?/gallon credit for small producers), for a total credit of $1.28 per gallon for cellulosic fuel production. 
   * Supporting Cutting edge research on energy efficiency and renewable energy in Colorado: Earlier this year, Senator Salazar was successful increasing funding for the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) in Golden by more than $107 million for Fiscal Year 2007. This increase includes $20 million to expand the lab's Integrated Biorefinery Research Facility, $17 million to equip the lab's new Science & Technology facility, and $63 million to design and build a new Research Support Facility on NREL's campus. 
  Senator Salazar was also able to secure an authorization in the Farm Bill of $5 million in annual funds (subject to appropriations) for the Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory which pools the efforts of CSU, CU, NREL and School of Mines into an association. This association takes world class research on new energy technologies and helps deploy those technologies as rapidly as possible to the private sector. The Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory has done important research related to solar and wind energy technology as well as the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels (C2B2). In the coming years, C2B2's research will gradually transition us away from oil and gas and toward renewable sources of energy, which is good for Colorado, good for America and good for our economic and environmental future. 
   * Bolstering Biomass and Biochar development: In the 2007 Farm Bill, Senator Salazar was able to include $500 million for biomass research and development and for competitive grants to develop the technologies and processes necessary for the commercial production of biofuels and bio-based products. Biomass is an organic material, usually referring to plant matter or animal waste. Using biomass for energy can reduce waste and air pollution. Biochar is a byproduct of producing energy from biomass. As a soil treatment, it enhances the ability of soil to capture and retain carbon dioxide. 
   * Development of Carbon Sequestration Technology: To advance technologies for clean coal and carbon sequestration, Senator Salazar has introduced various pieces of legislation addressing carbon sequestration. Senator Salazar introduced the "CO2 Pipeline Study Act of 2007," which would ensure that we develop the pipeline infrastructure needed to capture, transport and sequester a major contributor to global warming - carbon dioxide. It directs the Departments of Energy, Commerce and Interior, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Environmental Protection Agency to prepare a report and offer recommendations to Congress on the myriad of issues that are vital to fostering the development of a CO2 pipeline infrastructure. 
   Senator Salazar was also able to include in the Senate-passed energy bill the "National Carbon Dioxide Storage Capacity Assessment Act of 2007," which would authorizes the U.S. Geological Service (USGS), in cooperation with the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, to conduct a comprehensive inventory of the Nation's ability to store carbon dioxide in appropriate geologic features and other natural basins. This inventory would provide data on storage locations, estimates for the volume of carbon dioxide storage capabilities and other factors.
