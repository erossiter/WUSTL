SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS AGREEMENT RE-OPENING HONG KONG MARKETS TO U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
  Colorado's and America's ranchers have another reason to celebrate this holiday season.  
 The USDA announced today it has reached an agreement with Hong Kong to re-open that nation's beef markets, closed to U.S. beef exports in 2003.
   "I am pleased that Hong Kong has followed the wisdom of its neighbor, Japan, in re-opening its borders to U.S. beef imports," said Senator Salazar. "The message Hong Kong is sending today is one that I and others have maintained all along: American beef is the finest, and safest, in the world. I will remain watchful to make sure that Hong Kong lives up to this new agreement."
   Under the agreement, U.S. ranchers will be able to export boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months of age to Hong Kong. In 2003, when Hong Kong closed its markets to U.S. beef imports, it was the fifth-largest market for U.S. beef products, accounting for $90 million of U.S. beef exports.
