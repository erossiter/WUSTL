SEN. SALAZAR'S BIPARTISAN JUDICIAL SELECTION COMMISSION HOLDS FIRST MEETING
  Today, Senator Salazar's bipartisan judicial selection commission met in Colorado to discuss and formalize the application and review process. The commission has already received several resumes and will announce the formal process for how potential candidates can submit their names for consideration.  
   Less than two weeks ago, in a letter to the White House, Senator Salazar stated his intent to submit names of highly qualified individuals for consideration as nominees to fill the three judicial vacancies. Senator Salazar also announced that he would establish an eight-member, equally balanced, bipartisan commission to help select individuals for consideration to forward to the White House. The commission is now on track to enable Senator Salazar to submit individual names to the White House by March 15, 2008. The commission will also develop a set of recommendations for how to improve and formalize future federal judicial nomination processes.
   Senator Salazar's eight-member bipartisan commission is chaired by Ross Buchanan, co-founder of the Denver law firm, Buchanan, Jurdem & Cederberg, P.C. and past President of the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association. In addition to Mr. Buchanan the commission includes: 
   * Honorable Rebecca Kourlis, former Colorado Supreme Court Justice and West Slope judge and lawyer and current head of the University of Denver Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System;
