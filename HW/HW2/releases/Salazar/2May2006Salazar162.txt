SEN. SALAZAR CO-SPONSORS VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION
  Sen. Ken Salazar today joined a bipartisan group of dozens of Members of Congress from the House and Senate to announce their support to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965. 
   "I am delighted the Congress could rise above the partisanship that often plagues us to renew the promise of inclusiveness that the Voting Rights Act has sought to achieve," Salazar said. "Since the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the doors to opportunity for political participation by previously disenfranchised groups have swung open. Today, as we work to promote democracy in Iraq and other regions of the world, I wish to honor the legacy of this milestone in our own nation's democracy and to thank all those who have been a part of the civil rights movements."
   If certain provisions of the VRA are not reauthorized by 2007, communities who have suffered discrimination at the polls could be vulnerable to future discriminatory practices.
