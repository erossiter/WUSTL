SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS EPA CERTIFICATION OF CLEAN UP AT ROCKY FLATS
  Yesterday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified the clean-up and closure of Rocky Flats, opening the door for the transfer of most of the former nuclear weapons site to the Department of the Interior for management as a National Wildlife Refuge. 
   "This is another important step in the transition of Rocky Flats from a site of Cold War contamination to open space as a National Wildlife Refuge," said Senator Salazar. "Incredibly, the cleanup was accomplished ahead of schedule and under budget through the hard work of many, most notably the workers of Rocky Flats, who served our nation from Cold War to cleanup."
   Senator Salazar has been a long-standing supporter of the Rocky Flats cleanup. Senator Salazar has worked for many years to clean up the pollution at Rocky Flats and to bring to reality a wildlife refuge that will serve the people of Colorado forever. Senator Salazar served as Colorado's Natural Resources Trustee for the site in his capacities as Colorado's Attorney General and as the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. He has worked to connect the decontaminated and reclaimed open space at Rocky Flats - to become a National Wildlife Refuge - with the open space of the communities that surround it. This entire area will become one of Colorado's crown jewels - right in the midst of the heavily populated Front Range.
