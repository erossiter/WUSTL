SEN. SALAZAR CONGRATULATES ROCKY FLATS CLEANUP PROJECT
  Sen. Ken Salazar today congratulated Kaiser-Hill and those involved with the Rocky Flats Cleanup Site as it was named Project Management Institute's (PMI) 2006 Project of the Year. 
   "Rocky Flats has gone from one of the most contaminated places on earth to what will soon be a National Wildlife Refuge. This achievement was possible only through the public-private partnership between the Department of Energy, the private contractor Kaiser-Hill, Congressional support, private leadership and, most importantly, the hard work by the heroes of this effort, the workers at Rocky Flats. It is fitting, then, that the Project Management Institute has awarded its 2006 Project of the Year to this success. The words 'under-budget' and 'on-time' are too rarely heard in regard to our cleanup efforts across the country. I am proud to have been involved with this effort and am proud of the people who made its success possible.
   "However, we shouldn't forget all the men and women who worked at Rocky Flats during the manufacture of nuclear weapon components or during the cleanup of what used to be one of the most dangerous places on earth. Many of these quiet heroes are suffering today from cancer and other illnesses due to exposure to radiation and other toxic substances on the Rocky Flats site. Sadly, due to inadequate record-keeping, it is impossible to determine what many of these workers were exposed to, when they were exposed or in what quantities. We owe it to these men and women to compensate them for their sacrifices, and I will continue to work to provide compensation for them."
