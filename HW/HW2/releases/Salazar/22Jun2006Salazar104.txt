SEN. SALAZAR ADDRESSES VETS HEALTH CARE NEEDS: FITZSIMONS GETS $52 MILLION, RURAL VETS GET VA ATTENTION
  From his seat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Sen. Ken Salazar today scored two major wins on behalf of veterans in two separate bills before the committee. 
   First, S. 3241, contains $52 million for the replacement of the Fitzsimons VA medical center in Denver. Senator Salazar said, "While this process has been slow and frustrating at times, I firmly believe the new medical center on the old Fitzsimons Army campus can be the crown jewel of the veterans' health care system, and I will continue to fight to ensure it receives the resources it needs. I want to thank the committee leadership for helping me improve Colorado's veterans' health care."
   In a second piece of legislation, S.2694, the Veterans Affairs Committee has approved Senator Salazar's idea for an office of Rural Health Care within the Veterans' Health Administration. The original idea for a rural veterans' health care office came as part of The Rural Veterans Care Act (S.2433), legislation Senator Salazar introduced with Senator John Thune (R-SD). Senator Salazar said, "This new office will increase the VA's focus on the more than six million veterans living in rural areas across the country and improve the way our government provides services and care to those veterans."
   A 2004 VA study of 750,000 veterans found that veterans living in rural areas are in poorer health than their urban counterparts. Because of the distance and other difficulties associated with obtaining care, many rural veterans put off preventive as well as necessary treatment. As a result, veterans living in rural areas are in poorer health and pay more for health care than their urban counterparts. Despite the fact that 23 percent of the nation's veterans live in rural areas, the VA does not currently have a high-level office responsible for coordinating care to this vital constituency.
   * There are approximately 5.7 million veterans in the U.S. living in rural areas, including tens of thousands in Colorado. 
   * Many of these veterans are forced to travel hundreds of miles to obtain care. In Northwest Colorado, for example, veterans must drive hours to Grand Junction for care. 
   * According to a recent VA study, veterans in rural areas are in substantially poorer health than their urban and suburban counterparts. With an average U.S. health score of 50, urban veterans scored a 37, and rural veterans scored a 33. 
   * More than 44 percent of U.S. military recruits come from rural areas. In contrast, 14 percent come from major cities. 
   Specifically, the Office of Rural Health would be charged with conducting, promoting and disseminating research into issues affecting rural veterans; and developing and refining policies and programs to improve care and services for rural veterans. The Director of the Office would also be required to identify officials in each of the nation's 23 Service Networks to be the point person for consulting on and coordinating research and policies in their respective areas.
   Finally, the Office of Rural Health will conduct a study on the feasibility of expanding the use of fee-basis care, whereby the VA contracts its services out on a limited basis to third-party provider, in an effort to improve increase access for care for rural veterans.
