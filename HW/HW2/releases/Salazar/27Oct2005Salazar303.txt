SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON MR. LIBBY'S INDICTMENT
  "It is a sad day for our government institutions. These are serious charges. People in high-level positions of the Federal Government have high-level responsibilities. Any use of National Security information for political gain is unacceptable. If these charges are true it is a serious breach of responsibility by someone in such an important position."
