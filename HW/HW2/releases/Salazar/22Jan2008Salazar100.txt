SEN. SALAZAR BROTHERS MAKE PITCH FOR PUEBLO PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT FUNDS
  In a letter to Alphonso Jackson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (USHUD), U.S. Senator Ken Salazar and U.S. Representative John Salazar urged the Secretary to support approval of an application submitted by the Housing Authority of the City of Pueblo (HACP) for HOPE VI funds to replace over 200 low-income public housing units and build a state-of-the art Community Learning Center in the 54-year-old Sangre de Cristo multifamily development.  
   In the letter, the Salazars wrote, "In addition to safe and affordable housing, the HACP hopes to provide a variety of meaningful resident services that will help improve the lives of its tenants. The state-of-the-art Community Learning Center will help facilitate improved school attendance, after-school tutoring, skills and need assessment for adults, job training, and home ownership programs."
   The letter continues, "We strongly urge you to support this application. The Housing Authority is dedicated to obtaining HOPE VI funds that will dramatically improve the living conditions of low-income families in the City of Pueblo."
