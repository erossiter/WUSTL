SENATE TAKES FIRST STEP TOWARDS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after today's bipartisan vote to move forward to debate comprehensive immigration reform on the floor of the United States Senate.
   "I am proud of my Republican and Democratic colleagues who voted to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform today. We took the next step with broad bipartisan support, and I remain cautiously optimistic that we will accomplish the goal of passing a bill that toughens border security, toughens employer sanctions and provides a path towards legalization for the twelve million undocumented immigrants in our country."
