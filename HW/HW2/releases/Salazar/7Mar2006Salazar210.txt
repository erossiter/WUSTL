   "I would like to congratulate all of the delegates to the United States Senate Youth Program," Salazar said. "These delegates represent the future of America and should be commended for their outstanding achievements."

   Delegates to the week-long summit will listen to major addresses from policymakers and meet with a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, among other events. Each student will also be presented with a $5,000 scholarship from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.
   Senator Salazar sits on the Advisory Committee of the program.
