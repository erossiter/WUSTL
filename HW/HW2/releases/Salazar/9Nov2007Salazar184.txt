SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in commemoration of Veterans Day: 
   "Veterans Day is a time for our nation to come together to remember and honor those who have served our country. Without their brave efforts, our country would not stand so boldly, shine so brightly or live so freely.
   "I am honored and humbled by the dedication to service and pride America's veterans have displayed since the dawn of our Nation. This dedication echoed in my father's last words as he asked for us to bury him in his World War II uniform. He was a proud veteran and member of the Greatest Generation. I am proud of him and am proud of all of the men and women who have served our Nation. As we honor their sacrifices this Veterans Day we should also remember our fighting men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan, the veterans of tomorrow, and keep them in our thoughts and prayers."
