SEN. SALAZAR CALLS TO DOUBLE STANDARDS OF AMENDMENT 37 IN COLORADO
  In a letter last week to the leadership in Colorado's General Assembly, United States Senator Ken Salazar urged state lawmakers to double the renewable energy standards of Amendment 37. Colorado's Amendment 37 was the first set of renewable energy standards in the nation to be passed by citizen initiative. 
   "More than two years ago, Amendment 37 set out a vision for an energy independent Colorado, powered by clean and renewable sources," said Senator Salazar. "I congratulate Colorado energy providers for meeting and exceeding the standards set by Amendment 37. Colorado should maintain this positive momentum and become a national leader in renewable energy use."
   Adopted in 2004, Amendment 37 currently requires Colorado utilities to generate or purchase a percentage of their electricity from renewable sources according to the following schedule:
   * 3 percent from 2007 through 2010;
   * 6 percent from 2011 through 2014; and
   * 10 percent by 2015.
   As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Salazar is working to pass national renewable energy standards and to require the implementation of new renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. Additionally, in this session of Congress, Senator Salazar will introduce three bills to create new tax credits and tax-free renewable energy bonds for small and mid-sized wind projects and to increase and extend tax credits for solar and fuel cell technologies.

Senator Salazar addressed his letter to Senate President Joan Fitz-Gerald, House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon, House Majority Leader Alice Madden, Senate Minority Leader Andy McElhany and House Minority Leader Mike May.
