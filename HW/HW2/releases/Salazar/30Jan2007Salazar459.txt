SEN. SALAZAR PROTECTS FUNDING FOR PUEBLO CHEMICAL DEPOT IN FISCAL 2007 CONTINUING RESOLUTION
  Last night, the Fiscal Year 2007 Continuing Resolution (FY07 CR) was filed in the House. The FY07 CR will fund the chemical weapons demolition project at the Pueblo Chemical Depot in 2007 at $42 million, preventing further delays this year. The funding came at the specific request of Sen. Ken Salazar, who has repeatedly urged the Appropriators to maintain the funding over the past six weeks. 
   "I am very pleased for the people of Pueblo that this Continuing Resolution maintains momentum for the weapons destruction at the Pueblo Chemical Depot," said Senator Salazar. "I urge my colleagues in the House and the Senate to preserve these funds, so that the Pueblo Chemical Depot can continue its progress."
   Under the FY07 CR, worked out by both House and Senate Appropriators, chemical weapons demolitions projects at Pueblo Chemical Depot and a similar facility, the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky, will be funded at the President's FY07 requested level, $131 million. Earlier this year in his FY07 defense budget, the President committed the Department of Defense to spending at Pueblo $42 million of the $131 million slated for demolitions projects. With this funding level, demolitions efforts can move forward at Pueblo as planned.
   In December 2006 and again last week, Senator Salazar, along with Senator Allard and Senators McConnell and Bunning of Kentucky, wrote to Appropriators urging them to fully fund demolition project at Pueblo Chemical Depot.
