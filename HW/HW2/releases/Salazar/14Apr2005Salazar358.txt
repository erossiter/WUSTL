SEN. SALAZAR SECURES FUNDS TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN LEBANON
  Sen. Ken Salazar secured $5 million in assistance to promote democracy in Lebanon, including political party development. Sen.  
 Salazar successfully added the amendment to the Iraq Supplemental bill today. 
   "We must ensure that Syria has free and fair elections and the strong and vibrant democracy they have earned," Senator Salazar said. "The Lebanese people who stood up to Syria deserve to know we are here to support them." 
   Outrage over the death of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri on February 14, 2005 was the catalyst for change in Lebanon. Mass demonstrations by the Lebanese population forced the resignation of the Lebanese government and intensified the international campaign for Syria to withdraw its troops from the country.
