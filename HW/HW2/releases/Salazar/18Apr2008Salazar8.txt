SEN. SALAZAR PLEASED AT SOUTH KOREANS' MOVE TO SCRAP BLOCK ON U.S. BEEF
  United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement lauding today's announcement that South Korea intends to fully open its market to all U.S. beef products, consistent with the guidelines of the World Animal Health Organization. 
   "I am very pleased with South Korea's decision to re-open the market to U.S. beef. U.S. beef is the safest in the world and its free trade is essential to the livelihoods of ranchers across Colorado and America. I am encouraged with today's announcement and will monitor its implementation closely, so as to ensure that as Colorado's ranchers continue to provide safe beef for consumers throughout the world, they have fair and equal access to Korean markets."
   Korea closed its market to U.S. beef imports in 2003. Prior to the ban, the U.S. had accounted for more than two-thirds of South Korea's beef imports - about $850 million a year worth of products - and South Korea had been the third largest export market for U.S. beef products. Korea partially opened its market in September 2006 to boneless beef imports from cattle under the age of 30 months under an agreement that has seriously restricted U.S. exports. International scientific guidelines of the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) support the safety of U.S. beef - whether boneless or bone-in - regardless of age.
