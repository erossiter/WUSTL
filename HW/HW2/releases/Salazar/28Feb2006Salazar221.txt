SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SELL US FOREST SERVICE LANDS TO GENERATE REVENUE
  Sen. Salazar released the following statement on the Administration's legislative proposal to sell 300,000 acres (21,572 in Colorado) of USFS lands. 
   "I oppose the President's proposal to sell off 300,000 acres of forest lands to address budget needs. I have made it clear to Forest Service officials today that I will fight the proposed sell-off of Forest Service land as part of a budget gambit," said Senator Salazar. "On principle, I am not opposed to selling United States Forest Service parcels that have been identified through a public process that is transparent, but I am troubled by the idea of doing it to fill a 'budgetary need.'"
   "In addition, Colorado currently is slated to have a sale of 21,572 acres, or nearly 7.2%, of the 300,000 acres on the block, yet Colorado would only receive 1.67% of the funding each year. That's inequitable and I will fight this allotment if it moves forward."
