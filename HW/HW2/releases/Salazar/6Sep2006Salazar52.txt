  Sen. Salazar statement on the President's announcement regarding detainees in CIA facilities: 
   "All Americans wish to see the terrorists who have worked to do us harm brought to justice. The President's announcement that he intends to move detainees from CIA facilities abroad into the military justice system is a step in the right direction.
