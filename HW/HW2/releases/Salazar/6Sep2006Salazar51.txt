  Senate Armed Services Committee Senate Armed Services Committee 
   Dear Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin,
   As you continue work on the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, I urge you to oppose provisions expanding Presidential authority to federalize members of the National Guard without the consent of the governors.  
   Section 511 of the House version and section 1042 of the Senate version both provide the President with new powers to federalize the National Guard. These measures are strongly opposed by the governors of 49 states, as well as the governors of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These measures are also opposed by the National Guard Association of the United States.
   I add my voice to their dissent. In an emergency, a Governor is "closer to the ground" than the President, making the Governor best situated to know the military priorities for his or her state. Any changes to existing policies related to this matter should be developed in consultation with the governors to ensure that our government most effectively provides for the protection of the American people.  
   Thank you for your consideration of this important matter. 
    Sincerely,
  Ken Salazar
  United States Senate.
   Contact: Cody Wertz, 303/455-7600; Andrew Nannis, 202/224-5852.
