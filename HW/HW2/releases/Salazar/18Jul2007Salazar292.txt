SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON FAILURE TO INVOKE CLOTURE ON REID-LEVIN PROPOSAL
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar made the following statement after the motion to invoke cloture on Senator Reid and Levin's proposal failed in the Senate. 
   "I am disappointed that after a marathon session last night that we will not have an opportunity to continue to chart a new way forward in Iraq. I support a change in our mission in Iraq and while many disagree on the best path forward to end this war, we must continue to work together for a change in our policy. I hope that as we continue through the summer and into the fall that we develop a bipartisan solution that creates a diplomatic, economic and military roadmap to end American combat operations in Iraq."
