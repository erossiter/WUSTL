BIPARTISAN COALITION INTRODUCES BILL AIMED AT REDUCING AMERICA'S DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL
  Sen. Ken Salazar (D-CO), joined by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-IN), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) and others today introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at breaking America's dependence on foreign oil. Through a variety of steps including increased production of ethanol and tax incentives to encourage the production of fuel efficient vehicles, the DRIVE Act would reduce U.S. oil use by seven million barrels per day in 20 years - more than twice what we import from the Middle East today.
   "The DRIVE Act would help the US save 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2016 and 10 million barrels per day by 2031," said Senator Salazar. "Our bipartisan bill includes simple, sensible strategies for getting more plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road and for getting more biofuels to the market. Since first introducing this bill in the Senate last year, we have enjoyed broad bipartisan support and it is time Congress approves it." 
   "Meeting our future energy needs is one of the great challenges of this generation, and one that will impact everything from our national security to our economy," Senator Bayh said. "Voters made it clear this fall that they want real progress on these issues, not more partisan fighting. With cosponsors from the right, left, and across the country, my energy plan offers a realistic solution to reducing our dependence on foreign oil."
   The DRIVE Act is the re-introduced version of the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act from the 109th Congress, which attracted 28 Senate co-sponsors last year. The bipartisan legislation was supported by Senators from across the ideological and geographical spectrum, and the re-introduced bill is expected to build on that support. Twenty-two senators have already signed up to co-sponsor the DRIVE Act upon its re-introduction today.
   "Foreign oil dependence undermines America's national and economic security," said Coleman. "The DRIVE Act will require a government-wide, coordinated plan to save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day by 2016 - the amount we currently import from the Middle East. This isn't just another goal, but a real plan, a blueprint to gain oil independence from nations that do not share our love of liberty. America is blessed with an abundance of innovative minds supplying a deep reservoir of energy answers to our problem of foreign oil dependence. The bill offers an aggressive strategy and real-world solutions - utilizing many of the resources I have back in my home state of Minnesota, such as renewable fuels. Now is the time to start on the path toward energy independence, and I am proud to take action with a strong, bipartisan group of Senators to secure our nation's future."
   "In no other piece of legislation do you see such a large and ideologically diverse group of Senators signed up for such a dramatic reduction in US oil dependence," said Lieberman. "We have attracted Republicans and Democrats - including many from the key Senate Committees - to a suite of forceful measures that will set America free from its oil addiction. I am committed to seeing these strong, common-sense measures passed into law."
   Among the steps outlined in the bill are proposals that would:
   * Increase availability of home-grown, renewable fuels like ethanol, so that every American who wants to use alternative energy is able to do so; 
   * Provide tax credits for manufacturers who to retool their factories to build hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and flex fuel vehicles; 
   * Requires federal and state vehicle fleets to cut oil use by 30 percent by 2016 and ensure that 23 percent of their fleets are advanced diesels, hybrids or plug-in hybrids to ensure that government sets an example and spurs the market for energy innovation; 
   * Encourages the development and mass marketing of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and 
   * Lifts the per manufacturer cap on consumer tax credits for the purchase of hybrids and advanced diesels so more consumers receive tax incentives to purchase hybrids.
