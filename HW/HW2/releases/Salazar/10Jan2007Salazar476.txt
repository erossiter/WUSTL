SEN. SALAZAR SKEPTICAL OF TROOP ESCALATION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Ken Salazar stated his skepticism today for the President's plan to increase the number of troops in Iraq. 
   "We need a new direction in Iraq," said Senator Salazar. "I am skeptical that sending more troops to Iraq will help us achieve the security that is needed in Iraq. It will certainly put more of our troops in harm's way. Moreover, escalating our involvement with an increase in the number of troops in Iraq will further strain our own military and reduce our ability to fight a global war on terror.
   "I look forward to the hearings Congress will hold on Iraq in the days and weeks to come. But the President must realize that his plan for Iraq needs to be a departure from his failed Iraq policy of the past."
