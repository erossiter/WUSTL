SEN. SALAZAR SECURES OVER $150 MILLION IN NEW FEDERAL FUNDING FOR COLORADO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  In an effort to improve and expand Colorado's transportation system, United States Senator Ken Salazar supported Senate passage of the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill (FY 08 TTHUD) which provides approximately $150 million in new federal funding for Colorado transportation projects. Overall, the bill, which is expected to pass the full Senate later tonight or tomorrow morning, provides $104.6 billion to fund a number of much needed infrastructure improvement projects throughout the United States. 
   As infrastructure experts across the Nation and the recent Minneapolis bridge collapse have highlighted, America's system of highways, roads and bridges needs improvement. Senator Salazar supported a key amendment added to the bill yesterday that will boost crucial spending for bridge repairs and inspections across the country by $1 billion.
   "Recent events have underscored the fact that our Nation's infrastructure is severely under strain and in dire need of repair, including many of our State's rural bridges and highways," said Senator Salazar. "The funding provided in this bill signals that this Congress is committed to providing the investment necessary to adequately operate and maintain America's preeminent system of highways, roads and bridges. I urge President Bush to reconsider his threat to veto this bill, which addresses the growing need to improve these crucial public assets. "
   Senator Salazar requested and secured over $150 million in funding for the a number of projects throughout the State of Colorado under the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Key Colorado projects included in FY 08 TTHUD include:
   * $70 million for the Regional Transportation District's West Corridor Light Rail Project 
   * $70 million for the Regional Transportation District's Southeast Corridor Multi-Modal Project (T-REX)

   * $300,000 for the City and County of Denver for Homeless Veterans Supportive Housing 
   * $300,000 for a new Colorado River Park in the City of Grand Junction 
   The Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill will now go to conference committee where differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill will be reconciled. Upon completion of the conference report, the bill will then go to both the House and Senate for final passage and then to the President's desk for signature. President Bush has issued a statement indicating that he will veto the bill in its current form.
