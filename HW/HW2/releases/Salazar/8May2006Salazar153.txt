SEN. SALAZAR REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE TO HEAD CIA
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement today regarding President Bush's nominee to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, General Hayden. 
   "The CIA requires expert, independent leadership capable of guiding a vitally important part of our intelligence community in the post-9/11 world. General Hayden comes to this process with strong credentials. I believe the hearings associated with General Hayden's nomination to be the next CIA Director must be thorough and fair. I also share the concerns expressed by colleagues, including the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, regarding the Administration's policy of wiretapping American citizens without a warrant - a policy that General Hayden has played a leading role in defending."
