SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DRAFT GAO REPORT ON IRAQ
  United States Ken Salazar released the following statement today regarding the draft report from the General Accounting Office, which reportedly shows that Iraq has failed to meet all but three of the eighteen required benchmarks for political and military progress. 
   "The draft GAO report is an important tool that provides an independent assessment of progress, or lack of progress, on the political and military situation in Iraq. The unbiased nature of this report paints an accurate picture of the Iraqi government's inability to take control of their own country. Coupled with the most recent National Intelligence Estimate, the GAO's findings will be a key part of the debate in September as we take stock of the realities on the ground and chart a direction that will transform the United States' role in Iraq from one of combat to one of support."
