SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF BILL TO MOVE NORTHERN COLORADO WATER FACILITIES FROM FEDERAL OWNERSHIP TO LOCAL MANAGEMENT
  Legislation pushed by Sen. Ken Salazar to transfer water distribution facilities to the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District passed the Senate today. It now goes to the President for his signature. 
   "Water facilities such as these should be operated and maintained locally," said Salazar. "I am pleased that local Coloradans will now have more control over this significant natural resource. Local involvement will ensure cost-effective and community-based water management and I welcome the President's signature to this bill."
   The legislation transfers 58 miles of water conveyance facilities associated with the Colorado-Big Thompson Project to the District. These facilities include the St. Vrain Supply Canal, Boulder Creek Supply Canal, and South Platte Supply Canal.
