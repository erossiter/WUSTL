COLORADO DELEGATION URGES AIR FORCE TO CONSIDER COLORADO SPRINGS FOR CYBER COMMAND HEADQUARTERS
  Today, the Colorado Congressional delegation sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne, urging the Air Force to consider Colorado Springs as a potential site of the headquarters for the newly established Cyber Command (AFCYBER). Cyber Command plays a critical role in protecting our Nation and military's cyber networks and communications from infiltration and attack.  
   Currently, Colorado Springs is also home to Air Force Space Command and the United States Northern Command (NORTHCOMM), both of which are headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base. Locating Cyber Command in Colorado Springs would provide many advantages because of the proximity to other military command centers as well as the already developed resources and infrastructure at area military installations. In addition, Colorado Springs longstanding history of support for the military and the extraordinary quality of life that exists there makes it an attractive location for Cyber Command.
   The delegation writes, "the Pikes Peak region would make an ideal home for the Air Force's newest command, offering significant operations benefits, economic advantages, and an unparalleled quality of life."
   Headquartering Cyber Command in Colorado Springs, in close proximity to Air Force Space Command and NORTHCOMM would only serve to create a stronger partnership and communication between these agencies.
   The delegation continues, "In order to bring our defenses against a cyber attack on the homeland in line with the capabilities that other countries posses or are developing AFCYBER must work hand in glove with NORTHCOM, both supplementing NORTHCOM's operation capabilities and making use of the intelligence capabilities that NORTHCOM can provide."
   The Colorado delegation also invited Secretary Wynne and other Air Force officials to visit Colorado Springs to further explore the potential of headquartering Cyber Command center there.
