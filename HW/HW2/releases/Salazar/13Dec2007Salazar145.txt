SEN. SALAZAR: 2007 FARM BILL OPENS A NEW CHAPTER FOR RURAL AMERICA
  On March 2, 2005, in his maiden speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Senator Ken Salazar vowed to fight for the nation's rural communities, like those in the San Luis Valley, where his family has farmed and ranched for five generations. He called these communities a 'Forgotten America' because Washington, DC has for too long ignored and neglected the priorities of farmers, ranchers, and rural families.
   Today, Senator Salazar hailed the Senate passage, by a vote of 79 to14, of the 2007 Farm Bill (The Food and Energy Security Act), as a "new chapter" for the 50 million Americans living in rural communities. The bill, which he and his colleagues in the Senate Agriculture Committee have been working on for over three years, makes much-needed investments in rural communities, will help deliver safe and healthy food to family dinner tables, provide fresh fruits and vegetables to kids at school, improve stewardship of the nation's land and water, and will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The House of Representatives passed its own Farm Bill earlier this year and the House and Senate will now work together to produce a final version of the legislation. 
   "Today was an important day for rural America and rural Colorado. In passing the 2007 Farm Bill, we are one step closer to opening a new chapter of investment and opportunity for rural America," said Senator Salazar. "Nearly three years ago, in my 'maiden' speech on the floor of the United States Senate, I called attention to those rural communities across our country, like those in my native San Luis Valley, that have been withering on the vine, forgotten by the policies of Washington DC. Since then I have worked tirelessly with farmers and ranchers from every corner of Colorado and with my Senate colleagues to help write a Farm Bill that capitalizes on the opportunities in rural America. The ingenuity, hard work, and resources of rural communities are vital to ensuring a safe, healthy food supply and to reducing our dependence on foreign oil. The 2007 Farm Bill is a tremendous accomplishment."
   Below is a summary of key provisions in the 2007 Farm Bill that fall under 1) rural development, 2) protecting our land and water, 3) energy independence, 4) reform and 5) and keeping Americans healthy.
   Senator Salazar sponsored or led all of the provisions listed below.
   I. RURAL DEVELOPMENT: For too long, Washington's policies have overlooked the troubles that are affecting small towns and rural communities across America. Rural communities are losing population, jobs are hard to come by, and family farmers and small business owners are struggling to make ends meet. It is time that we make smart investments in our rural communities. This bill will provide $355 million in mandatory rural development funding over the next five years.
   Four provisions of critical importance to rural Colorado are:
   Farm Service Agencies: Earlier this year, there were reports that the Farm Service Agency was proposing to close the FSA offices in Bent, Larimer, Rio Grande, Conejos and El Paso Counties. During committee consideration, Senator Salazar fought for and passed an amendment to prevent the closure of Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices in Colorado. The amendment will keep the FSA offices open for at least five additional years. 
   Investments in Rural Broadband and Closing the Digital Divide: Senator Salazar led an effort to invest in the expansion of access to broadband in rural areas. According to the Government Accounting Office, only 17 percent of rural households currently have broadband access to the internet. These investments, loans and loan guarantees, will expand economic and educational opportunities for rural residents. 
   Permanent Ag Disaster Fund: Senator Salazar helped lead efforts in the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Agriculture Committee to create an agriculture disaster trust fund. The $5.1 billion that Senator Salazar secured will provide needed assistance to those farmers and ranchers suffering from disasters. It will also streamline the process so that aid can be provided in a timely manner to help prevent bankruptcies and foreclosures. 
   Micro Enterprise Loans: Senator Salazar helped secure $40 million for the Micro Enterprise Loan program, which provides technical assistance and small loans and grants to beginning rural entrepreneurs. Micro Enterprise Loans will provide incentives for beginning entrepreneurs to open their businesses in rural communities, thereby creating jobs and decreasing the rates of rural out migration. According to the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, micro-enterprises account for 30 percent of the jobs in 37 of the state's mostly rural counties. 
   II. CONSERVATION: Farmers and ranchers are some of our best stewards of our land and water. We need programs in the Farm Bill that reward farmers and ranchers not just for the food, feed, fiber and fuel they supply, but also for the clean water, clean air, and wildlife habitat they provide and protect.
   Three conservation programs of particular importance to Colorado:
   Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP): This bill reauthorizes this working lands program, which provides farmers and ranchers with financial and technical assistance to plan and implement soil and water conservation practices. Average annual funding to Colorado ranges between $30-40 million for over 1,000 projects, and this bill will ensure that farmers and ranchers continue to have access to this essential program. 
   Conservation Security/Stewardship Program (CSP): This program will enroll up to 3 million acres of working land in Colorado with contracts for the state valued at $156 million over the life of the 2007 Farm Bill. The Conservation Security/Stewardship Program (CSP) is a voluntary stewardship program that provides financial and technical assistance to promote the conservation and improvement of soil, water, air, energy, plant and animal life, and other conservation purposes on private working agriculture lands. 
   Conservation Reserve Program (CRP): The bill reauthorizes this important land retirement program, which means that Colorado will be able to maintain the 2.375 million Colorado acres that are currently enrolled in CRP. Colorado received $75.3 million in CRP payments in 2006, and this bill will ensure that Colorado continues to receive these investments in our most environmentally sensitive lands to protect our land and water. 
   Colorado River Basin States Salinity Parallel Program: The bill includes an amendment authored by Sen. Salazar, which clarifies the Bureau of Reclamation's authority to administer on-farm financial assistance for salinity control activities in Colorado and throughout the upper Colorado River Basin. Since the program's inception, nearly $3.5 million of on-farm financial assistance has already come through the Colorado State Conservation Board to improve irrigation efficiency and prevent deep percolation. An additional $4.8 million is committed to landowners through contracts for irrigation improvements. The program helps producers improve irrigation infrastructure by providing incentives to convert dirt delivery and head ditches to concrete, underground, and gated pipe systems and to install a variety of sprinkler systems, measuring and cleaning structures, and diversion boxes. Colorado has been able to fund needed salinity reduction projects that could not have been funded by EQIP. It has also funded projects to improve wildlife habitat on private and state lands. 
   III. GROWING OUR ENERGY AND RURAL ECONOMIES: The investments this bill makes in energy independence open a new chapter of opportunities for rural America. It spurs innovation in the rural energy sector, thereby advancing America toward energy independence, protecting our environment, and stimulating rural economies. Senator Salazar believes that Colorado is poised to become the renewable energy capital of the world; this bill will help accomplish that vision by providing $1.3 billion to important energy programs. Coupled with a package of legislation drafted by the Senate Finance Committee there will be an investment of nearly $3 billion in renewable energy programs.
   The key renewable energy provisions for Colorado:
   * Renewable Energy Collaboratory: Senator Salazar authorized $5 million in annual funds for the "Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory," which pools the research efforts of CSU, CU, NREL and School of Mines. The Collaboratory will allow Colorado to more effectively harness this world class research, develop new energy technologies, and to transfer these advances to the private sector. 
   * Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP): Senator Salazar assisted in securing $230 million in mandatory funding over the life of the Farm Bill for REAP, which is a program to assist farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses in becoming more energy efficient and provides them assistance to transition to using renewable energy technology and resources. 
   * Biomass Research and Development: Senator Salazar worked to include $75 million over the life of the bill for grants and education programs for biomass research and development. 
   * Grants for Biomass Projects: Senator Salazar helped secure $30 million in grants for feedstock harvest, handling, transport, and storage as well as additional research and demonstration grants for biomass. 
   * Biodiesel Education Program: Senator Salazar helped to reauthorize the Biodiesel Education Program providing $10 million in funding for the program over the next five years. 
   * Sun Grant Initiative: Senator Salazar assisted in extending the authorization for the Sun Grant Initiative, which is a national network of land-grant universities that partner with Department of Energy laboratories to work on advancing the bio-based industry, including NREL in Golden, Colorado. 
   * Creates bio-refinery re-powering grants: Senator Salazar assisted in creating and funding bio-refinery re-powering grants at $300 million. 
   * Investing in Hydroelectric Power: Senator Salazar worked to ensures that small, low-impact hydro projects are included in the list of projects that will be eligible for loans and grants. Hydroelectric power contributes 7% of our energy. DOE estimated in 2006 there are 5,400 potential small hydro projects in the U.S. which, if developed, could increase U.S. annual hydro power generation by more than 50%. 
   * Creating grants for "biochar": Senator Salazar worked to create over $500 million in grants over the next five years for feedstock harvest, handling, transport, and storage as well as additional research and demonstration grants for "biochar," which is added to soil to improve fertility, nutrient retention, and soil carbon sequestration. 
   * Federal Biobased Products Procurement Program: Senator Salazar worked to extend the federal Biobased Products Procurement Program. This program purchases biobased products for Federal agencies. This will aid in the development and application of economically useful bio-based energy products such as small wind and cellulosic biofuels tax credits. 
   IV. FARM BILL REFORM: 
   * Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) Test: The Senate Farm Bill enacts stricter income limitations for participating in farm programs. Currently a part-time farmer may not receive payments if their income exceeds $2.5 million. This legislation lowers that limit by 70% to $750,000. 
   * Three-Entity Rule: Under current law, a producer may double his/her commodity payments by splitting their operations into three entities. This complex system has allowed individuals to evade existing payment limits. This legislation eliminates this loophole. 
   * Direct Attribution: Under current law, farm program payments are not tracked to actual human beings, but instead go to corporate structures leading to an unclear picture as to who exactly is receiving what payments. The 2007 Farm Bill requires every payment to be attributed to an actual person. This reform is largely recognized as one of the most important reforms in the bill. 
   * Payment Limit Cap: The payment limit cap for direct and counter-cyclical payments is cut by 5%. 
   * Cowboy Starter Kits: Under current law, owners of land that had once been in agricultural production but has been subdivided and developed for residential purposes are nonetheless eligible for commodity payments. A Salazar-Nelson amendment to the Senate Farm Bill attacks this loophole by requiring the USDA to permanently reduce base acres for land that has: 
   * been developed for commercial or industrial use (already in law); or 
   * sub-divided and developed into multiple residential units or other non-farming uses or is otherwise no longer intended to be used in conjunction with a farming operation. 
   * Crop Insurance: Although crop insurance is sold and serviced by private insurance companies, the federal government shares in program losses and reimburses the companies for their administrative and operating (A&O) expenses. The current reimbursement rate averages out to 22-24% of total premiums, and has made A&O expenses a financial drain on the federal government. The Senate Farm Bill includes a 2 percentage point reduction in A&O (nearly 10%) expenses. This is a PERMANENT reduction and is intended to address the growth in A&O payments.
   Other crop insurance reforms include: 
   - Reduction of the loss ratio (total indemnities divided by total premiums) from 1.075% to 1%. 
   - Increase in fees for catastrophic (CAT) insurance and the non-insurable (NAP) crops program. 
   *These crop insurance reforms alone represent $3.6 billion in crop revenue offsets over five years*
   Overall, $7.5 billion is removed from the commodity programs and re-allocated to conservation, nutrition, energy, and rural development programs.
   V. KEEPING AMERICANS HEALTHY - This bill invests in our public health and safety, improves nutrition and fights hunger in our Nation and in Colorado.
   * Country of Origin Labeling: Country - of - Origin Labeling: The 2007 Farm Bill ensures that consumers will be able to know where the foods they feed their families comes from. Specifically, country-of-origin labeling will be provided for beef, lamb, pork and goat meat, fruits and vegetables, and peanuts. A product can be labeled as a product of United States if the commodity was exclusively born, raised and slaughtered in the United States. 
   * Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program: Today, over 346,000 Colorado children eat school lunches. Under this bill, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which provides fruits and vegetables to school children, will be expanded to all 50 states. Colorado was among 15 states that were not eligible for the program and therefore received $0 through this program under the 2002 Farm Bill. Colorado will now receive $45 million in federal funds to provide fresh fruit and vegetables to approximately 80,000 schoolchildren per year. 
   * Providing Locally Produced Foods for School Meal Programs: Section 9 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act encourages institutions that are participating in the school lunch program to buy "locally produced foods for school meal programs, to the maximum extent practicable and appropriate." The 2007 Farm Bill provides an option for school meal programs to purchase locally grown fruits and vegetables.
