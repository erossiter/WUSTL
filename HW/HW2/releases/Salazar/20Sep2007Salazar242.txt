SEN. SALAZAR TO PRESENT AWARD TO GOV. RITTER, WESTERN GOVERNORS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY
  Tonight, United States Senator Ken Salazar will present the Charles H. Percy Award for Public Service to Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, who will accept the award on behalf of the Western Governor's Association at the annual Alliance to Save Energy Award Dinner. 
   The Charles H. Percy Award is in honor of Senator Percy (D-IL), who in 1977 co-founded the Alliance to Save Energy. The Charles H. Percy Award is the Alliance's most prestigious award. It is presented to an individual or organization in the public or private sector in recognition of an outstanding public service contribution and/or a lifetime commitment to energy efficiency.
   "The Western Governors Association has been at the forefront of our Nation's efforts to create a new, clean energy economy for the twenty first century. Their collaborative partnership has produced much-needed energy efficiency improvements to the western United States. Their work with all levels of government to invest, develop and expand renewable energy technologies, makes them more than deserving of this award. I look forward to working with them to advance our Nation's renewable energy portfolio."
   The Western Governor's Association addresses important policy and governance issues for 19 states and three U.S.-flag Pacific islands, advancing their role in the federal system, while strengthening the social and economic ties within the region. This is achieved through policy and program development in a variety of areas including natural resources, the environment, economic development and human services.
