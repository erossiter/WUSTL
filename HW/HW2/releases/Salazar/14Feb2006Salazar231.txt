SEN. SALAZAR MEETS WITH PRESIDENT BUSH TO DISCUSS ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  Sen. Ken Salazar met with President Bush today at the White House along with a bipartisan group of senators, including Energy and Resource Chairman and Ranking Members, Domenici (NM) and Bingaman (NM), to discuss reducing America's dependence on foreign oil. 
   President Bush called the meeting to bring together leaders in the Senate on energy issues.
   "I welcome the President's bipartisan overtures on this issue," Salazar said. "In the President's State of the Union address, he recognized the role alternative energy must play in America's future, and called for an end to America's addiction to foreign oil. I welcome the President to this fight. It is a national security and economic imperative."
   In his discussion with the President, Senator Salazar discussed the importance of a bipartisan approach to address the energy challenges of the nation. Senator Salazar also emphasized the importance of renewable energies such as solar, ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and wind. Senator Salazar spoke to the President about the importance of funding the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, CO, and agreed to visit the laboratory with the President. Finally, Senator Salazar discussed with the President the importance of clean coal in the menu of meeting America's future energy needs.
   At the same time, Senator Salazar today wrote to the Senate Budget Committee Chairman and Ranking Member to push to restore funding to the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). NREL is the Department of Energy's premiere research facility for renewable energy and was recently forced to lay off researchers and employees due to budget cuts. Senator Salazar is pushing for increased funding next year. That letter is available at: http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/060214.pdf.
