SEN. SALAZAR EXPRESSES CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM REGARDING VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar hosted a meeting of Colorado's Congressional Delegation with Veterans Administration Secretary James Peake to discuss the future plans for Fitzsimons Veterans Hospital. At the meeting Secretary Peake provided an overview of a proposed relationship between the Veterans Administration and the University of Colorado. At its heart, the concept and vision would include an outpatient health care center, a new hospital tower built and owned by the University of Colorado and leased by the VA and a new ambulatory unit. In addition, the concept provided by Secretary Peake included expanded services for veterans in Colorado Springs, Grand Junction and other Western areas. 
   Because the concept is newly formed, Senator Salazar believes that it is essential to reach out to Colorado's nearly 500,000 veterans to determine if this is the best way to meet their needs. In addition, Senator Salazar believes the preliminary proposals need further examination.
   "I appreciate Secretary Peake meeting with our delegation today to discuss the VA's intentions for moving forward with a world-class veterans' healthcare facility at the Fitzsimmons campus. The Colorado delegation has worked hard to secure important funding to keep the Fitzsimons veterans' project moving forward and I will carefully review his proposal. My goal, first and foremost, is to ensure that veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserve who live in Colorado and across the Rocky Mountain region have access to the best health care and technology available. I will continue to work with rest of the delegation to keep the Fitzsimons veterans' project on track to make it a reality."
