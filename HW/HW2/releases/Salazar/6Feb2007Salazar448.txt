SEN. SALAZAR INVITES USDA HEAD TO COLORADO TO VIEW AFTERMATH OF DEVASTATING SNOW STORMS/URGES SUPPORT FOR COMPREHENSIVE ASSISTANCE
  In a letter this week, United States Senator Ken Salazar urged the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Mike Johanns, to visit Colorado and tour the areas most affected by the recent snow storms and bitter cold. 
   Senator Salazar also repeated his calls for Secretary Johanns to use Secretarial disaster declarations to provide additional assistance to Southeastern Coloradans, support Senator Salazar's comprehensive disaster assistance package and release any available funds for recovery efforts. Over 10,000 cattle have perished already as a result of the winter storms in Colorado.
   In the letter Senator Salazar wrote, "I hope the Administration revises its position on comprehensive disaster assistance. Rural Coloradans show inspiring dedication to their farms, ranches and way of life. At all levels we must ensure the survival of these essential producers."
