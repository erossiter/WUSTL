SEN. SALAZAR PROPOSAL TO RENAME VAIL POST OFFICE AFTER LATE PRESIDENT FORD PASSED BY SENATE
  The Senate today passed H.R. 49, a bill to rename the U.S. Post Office in Vail, Colorado after the late President Gerald R. Ford. The proposal is identical to one introduced earlier this year by Sen. Ken Salazar after President Ford passed away late last year at the age of 93. 
   "It is a fitting tribute to designate the Vail Post Office after President Ford," said Senator Salazar. "He was a public servant of honor, integrity and courage, and a man who loved Colorado, its people and its culture, including his adopted home town of Vail. The people of Colorado are grateful for his service, and I am proud to have cosponsored this bill."
   In January 2007, Senator Salazar, along with Senator Wayne Allard, introduced S. 194, to rename the Vail Post Office as the "Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Post Office Building." It is identical to H.R. 49, which now goes on to the President for signature or veto.
