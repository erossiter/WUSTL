SEN. SALAZAR: 'ANOTHER VICTORY FOR RESPONSIBLE OIL SHALE DEVELOPMENT'
  Today, the United States Senate voted down a Republican amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution that sought to override a one-year moratorium on oil shale development included in the omnibus appropriations bill late last year. The one-year moratorium is necessary to allow states and affected communities to work with the BLM to help restore order to the regulatory process, so that oil shale development can occur responsibly. 
   "The defeat of this amendment is another victory for responsible oil shale development in our Nation and especially in Colorado. BLM is rushing towards a commercial lease sale when the technology is not ready and the potential environmental impacts are unknown. Because of this uncertainty, we do not even know whether state and local governments support a commercial lease sale.
   "The communities of Colorado's West Slope are wary of unchecked oil shale development in their backyard. We must take a judicious approach that will help, not hurt, West Slope communities and avoid any economic bust that could follow an unchecked boom on commercial leasing. This amendment would have put that approach in jeopardy.
   "I have long fought for responsible oil shale development on Colorado's West Slope. I am very pleased that the Senate voted down this amendment and said yes to responsible, tempered oil shale development."
