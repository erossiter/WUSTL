SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar gave his initial impressions of the President's State of the Union address: 
   "After 5 years of rising gas prices and dangerous growing over-dependence on foreign oil, tonight the President is finally recognizing the role alternative energy must play in America's future. We must break our addiction to foreign oil and I welcome him to join us in a true quest for energy independence.
   "After 5 years of silence on America's health care crisis, I am delighted the President has recognized the enormity of the problem. Now we will see whether he helps us find real solutions to the crisis.
   "But solving our nation's energy crisis or fixing our health care system will require more than rhetoric. The President must be willing to take real steps, on a truly bipartisan basis, to address these major problems. I look forward to hearing the President's concrete proposals in the coming weeks and hope we can all work together to solve these important issues."
