SEN. SALAZAR MEETS WITH JAPANESE AMBASSADOR ON U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
  Sen. Ken Salazar and a group of bipartisan Senate colleagues today met with the Ambassador of Japan His Excellency Ryozo Kato, to discuss the timeline for reopening Japanese markets to American beef imports.  
   In the meeting, Salazar pressed Ambassador Kato to reopen Japan's market to American beef imports immediately, pointing out that since Japan had closed its borders 15 months ago, no cases of so-called "mad-cow" disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE) had been detected in American livestock. 
   Salazar said, "Ambassador Kato understands that we are serious about reopening the Japanese border to American beef, but I will judge the success of this meeting on exactly one standard: Will Japan open its market? I will also seek out ways to encourage the Japanese government to allow the free trade of American beef, so that our ranchers in Colorado can benefit from this lucrative market. We must do everything we can to fight for the U.S. beef industry and protect rural livelihoods."
