SEN. SALAZAR AWARDED BY WHEAT GROWERS
  Last week, the National Association of Wheat Growers and U.S Wheat Associates (NAWG) presented Sen. Ken Salazar with their 2006 Wheat Advocate Award. The Wheat Advocate Award is given annually by NAWG to Members of Congress who have demonstrated extraordinary support for the wheat industry. 
   "I am very proud to be awarded the 2006 Wheat Advocate Award from the National Association of Wheat Growers," said Senator Salazar. "I believe strongly in not only protecting this country's farmers and rural communities but revitalizing them. I will continue to work with my colleagues to fight for pro-rural policies in Congress."
   Grant Leslie, Senator Salazar's Legislative Director, also received the 2006 Friend of Wheat Award. The Friend of Wheat Award is given annually by NAWG to congressional staff members who have successfully advanced the goals and policies of the wheat industry.
   Other Senators receiving the 2006 Wheat Advocate Award are Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Sen. Ben Nelson (D-NE) and Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT). House members receiving the 2006 Wheat Advocate Award are Rep. Jerry Moran (R-KS); Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX); and Rep. Nydia Velasquez (D-NY).
