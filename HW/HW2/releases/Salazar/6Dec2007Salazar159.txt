SEN. SALAZAR: PRESIDENT'S VETO THREAT ON ENERGY BILL HIGHLIGHTS LACK OF COMMITMENT TO NATION'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, SECURITY
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after President Bush released a Statement of Administration Policy that he would veto H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act, that would put our Nation on a path toward energy independence--by strengthening national security, lowering energy costs, growing our economy and creating new jobs, and beginning to reduce global warming. 
   "President Bush is being disingenuous to the American people regarding his stated commitment to renewable energy, CAFE standards, and energy conservation and efficiency. Over the last year and a half the President has talked a big talk on energy security but is now not walking the walk. He is refusing to work with Congress to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and broaden our energy portfolio with cleaner alternatives by announcing a threat to veto the current energy bill. This threat contradicts his previous statements and demonstrates his lack of commitment to our Nation's national and energy security."
