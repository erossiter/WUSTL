SEN. SALAZAR REACTS TO FOREST SERVICE'S WOLF CREEK DECISION
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement in reaction to today's U.S. Forest Service decision concerning the Village at Wolf Creek. 
   "Due to the size and scope of the Village at Wolf Creek project, the allegations of improper actions need to be addressed to remove any cloud of inappropriate activity in the permit application, review and approval process. Former high ranking officials within the Forest Service itself have stated that the scope of the Environmental Impact Study was fatally flawed because it did not assess the environmental impact of the development itself. This matter needs to be fully reviewed and finally resolved. I will continue to press for an investigation and review by the Inspector General's office in to any improprieties concerning the inadequate scoping of the EIS."
