SEN. SALAZAR FIGHTS TO REINSTATE COMMON SENSE BUDGETING IN WASHINGTON
  Sen. Ken Salazar today continued his fight to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington.  
 Salazar voted for a bipartisan budget amendment to introduce Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules for the upcoming budget process. The amendment sponsored by Sen. Feinstein failed on a 50/50 vote. If passed the amendment would have restored bipartisan rules regulating spending and tax policies that led to record fiscal surpluses in the 1990s. All new spending and tax breaks would have to be paid for. The Administration could have sent the Vice-President to break the tie and reinstate the PAYGO rules, but instead they allowed the amendment to fail without a majority vote. "The federal government has gone from record surpluses to record deficits in just a few years. Washington should be subject to the same rules all Americans use for their personal checkbooks - if you buy something you have to have the money to pay for it. Instead Washington has initiated a 'credit card-like' mentality to spending that must stop. The mountains of debt we are piling on future generations are outrageous - initiating real PAYGO rules will end this spendthrift nonsense," Salazar said. Salazar continued, "I am disappointed that the Administration and Congress have allowed this rubber-stamp lunacy to govern the budget process in Washington. However, I will not be deterred by this vote and continue to work hard to make sure that Washington plays by the same budget balancing rules as families in Colorado and across America."
