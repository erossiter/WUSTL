SEN. SALAZAR: PASSAGE OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE MAKES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE
  Tonight, by a vote of 68 to 31, the Senate reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program, providing health care coverage to millions of American children and tens of thousands of children in Colorado. With over 180,000 uninsured children living in Colorado, Senator Salazar supported bolstering the children's health insurance program providing Colorado with $127 million for the program in 2008, $56 million more to Colorado than last year. This increased funding would cover most of the 70,000 children eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in Colorado. 
   "It is our moral and economic obligation to invest in our children's healthcare. Tonight, we took an important first step to invest in the future of our children, providing health care coverage to millions who would otherwise go uninsured. This is an important first step as we being to tackle the issue of providing affordable healthcare coverage to all Americans."
