UPDATE: BREAKTHROUGH DEAL FOR BETTY DICK'S RMNP HOME PASSES SENATE
  Betty Dick, the 83-year-old woman with a private family residence in Rocky Mountain National Park is poised to be able to live out the rest of her life at her home.  
 Earlier today, the full Senate approved the Betty Dick Residence Protection Act (S.584). This breakthrough compromise legislation between Mrs. Dick and the Department of the Interior was sponsored by Sen. Ken Salazar.
   "I am pleased that Betty Dick, an 83-year-old grandmother will be able to continue to live in her family home for the remainder of her days," said Senator Salazar. "A home is not just a building, it is place with memories of family, friends and loved ones - Mrs. Dick will be able to keep those memories alive with this legislation."
   Under updated compromise language:
   * Mrs. Dick will hold a life estate on the property in Rocky Mountain National Park; 
   * The life estate will be for 8 acres instead of 23; and 
   * Mrs. Dick will continue to pay $300 per year, the same amount she has been paying.
  Under a 1980 settlement agreement with the National Park Service, Fred Dick and his wife Betty were allowed to lease and occupy their property for 25 years. Fred Dick passed away in 1992 but Betty remains at the property. Mrs. Dick's lease with the Park Service expired this past July.
