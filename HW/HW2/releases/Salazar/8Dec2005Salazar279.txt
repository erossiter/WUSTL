SEN. SALAZAR CONGRATULATES REP. MENENDEZ ON SENATE APPOINTMENT
  I congratulate Rep. Robert Menendez on his appointment to the United States Senate. I have known him for many years and he is a genuine leader in America and always has the best interest of the people of New Jersey at heart. I look forward to working with him in the future.
   I also want to congratulate Governor-Elect Jon Corzine on a very good and thoughtful decision. I wish him the very best in his new position.
