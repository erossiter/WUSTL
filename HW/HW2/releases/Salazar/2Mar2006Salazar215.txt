SEN. SALAZAR FIGHTS TO RESTORE TRANSPARENCY TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING
  As part of his ongoing efforts to end the culture of corruption in Washington and restore Americans' trust in government, Sen. Ken Salazar today announced he is an original co-sponsor of the landmark Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting Act of 2006. 
   "Coloradans, and all Americans, should not have to wonder if their tax dollars are being improperly awarded or spent. This bill is another step in the right direction of restoring honor and integrity to Washington," said Senator Salazar.
   The Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting Act of 2006, introduced by Sen. Byron Dorgan (ND), restores confidence in fair government contracting practices by: 
   * Creating a $1 million fine and 20-year jail sentence for those convicted of war profiteering; 
  * Banning companies that repeatedly break the law from pursuing contracts;
  * Limiting the use of no-bid contracts, known as "monopoly contracts;"
  * Creating a "Truth in Contracting" website requiring disclosure of contractors that overcharge the government;
  * Preventing the government from outsourcing its contract oversight practices;
  * Closing the lobbying revolving door for federal contracting officials to take jobs as lobbyists for companies to whom they previously awarded contracts;
  * Stopping the practice of political patronage jobs to unqualified appointees;
  * Strengthening whistleblower protections for those who see problems and report them.
   "Government contracting is big business," said Senator Salazar. "But it should be conducted on a fair, open and honest playing field, not behind closed doors with partisan concerns and political allies seated at the table. We can do better for Americans, and this bill will accomplish that."
   Senator Salazar was recently awarded a position as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, which investigates allegations of misconduct by members, and recommends disciplinary action to the full Senate.
