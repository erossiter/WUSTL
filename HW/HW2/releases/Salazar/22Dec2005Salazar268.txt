SEN. SALAZAR REACTS TO HOUSE PASSING ONE-MONTH PATRIOT ACT EXTENSION
  Sen. Salazar's Reaction to House Passing One-Month PATRIOT Act Extension
   "I am glad the House chose to agree with the Senate on extending the PATRIOT Act. Our task remains striking the proper balance between providing law enforcement agencies the tools they need to keep us safe and protecting civil liberties that maintain our freedom. I look forward to working in good faith with my House and Senate colleagues in both parties in the coming month to forge that balance."
