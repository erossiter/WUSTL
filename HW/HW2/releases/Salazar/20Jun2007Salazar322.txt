SEN. SALAZAR DISAPPOINTED IN PRESIDENT'S STEM CELL BILL VETO
  Sen. Ken Salazar voted for the legislation to responsibly expand stem cell research earlier this year. The Senator expressed his disappointment in the President's veto decision with the following statement: 
   "I am disappointed in the President for vetoing responsible legislation that would have allowed federal funding for expanded stem cell research.
   "My family's experience with my father's battle with Alzheimer's disease strengthened my conviction that we should do everything we can within ethical bounds to cure this and other debilitating diseases.
   "The bill would have provided access, with guidelines, to new stem cell lines, to ensure that our scientists have every opportunity for medical advances while avoiding ethical challenges that have previously kept many from withholding support for stem cell research.
   "The bill also had broad scientific support from hundreds of expert medical groups, including medical facilities like the Mayo Clinic and National Jewish Medical Center in Denver, medical organizations like the Colorado Bioscience Association and the American Medical Association, and research institutions like the University of Colorado.
   "The President has once again dashed the hopes of thousands of Americans who were waiting for breakthrough cures that could be reachable through the provisions of this bill.
   "I will continue to urge action on this issue to restore America's hope for the future."
