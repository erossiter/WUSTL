SEN. SALAZAR LAUDS $6.5 MILLION GRANT AWARD TO MODERNIZE, IMPROVE FORT COLLINS ELECTRICITY GRID
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar lauded the award of a $6.3 million grant from the Department of Energy to the City of Fort Collins and a consortium of public and private partners to support its pursuit of a more modern and efficient electricity grid. The grant, coupled with $4.9 million in non-federal money, will go to the City of Fort Collins in cooperation with several other local entities to research, develop and demonstrate a 3.5 megawatt coordinated system to achieve a 20-30 percent peak load reduction on the electricity grid. 
   "Fort Collins, CSU and northern Colorado are helping to lead the nation in renewable energy and energy efficiency efforts - it only makes sense that the City of Fort Collins would secure this grant to demonstrate improvements to its electricity grid what will reduce wasted energy," said Senator Salazar. "I am pleased the city was able to form such a strong coalition to take the important step of modernizing and improving its electricity grid. Fort Collins is and should continue to be a shining example to the rest of Colorado and the nation that saving energy does not mean reducing services."
   The Fort Collins grant was a part of a bigger announcement made today by the Department of Energy as they will invest $50 million over the next five years in nine similar demonstration projects across the country, subject to appropriations from Congress.
