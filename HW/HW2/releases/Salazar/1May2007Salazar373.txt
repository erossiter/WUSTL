SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON MAY DAY IMMIGRATION RALLIES
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding immigration rallies being held nationwide. 
   "For the second year in a row thousands of people are marching in peace across the Nation in support of comprehensive immigration reform legislation that has been too long in coming. Over the past several months, I have been involved in countless meetings with my Republican and Democratic colleagues to develop a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate. Like President Bush, I believe we must reform our immigration laws in a manner that meets America's needs for the 21st century. I remain hopeful that in the coming weeks we will have a sensible and strong comprehensive immigration reform bill.
   "As I said last year, I would hope people demonstrate during their off hours, not during work and school hours. I believe it's important for all kids to stay in school and for workers to stay at their jobs."
