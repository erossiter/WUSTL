PRESIDENT SIGNS SEN. SALAZAR'S BILL NAMING VAIL POST OFFICE AFTER PRESIDENT FORD
  Earlier today, President Bush signed into law H.R. 49, a bill to rename the U.S. Post Office in Vail, Colorado after the late President Gerald R. Ford. The proposal is identical to one introduced earlier this year by Sen. Ken Salazar after President Ford passed away late last year at the age of 93. 
   "When Gerald Ford made Colorado his home, he honored our state by sharing his wisdom and experience," said Senator Salazar. "I am pleased that President Bush signed this small but fitting tribute to a President whose service helped our Nation heal."
   In January 2007, Senators Salazar, along with Senator Wayne Allard, introduced S. 194, to rename the Vail Post Office as the "Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Post Office Building." It is identical to H.R. 49.
