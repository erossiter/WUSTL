SEN. SALAZAR ADDS CRUCIAL LANGUAGE TO COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL IN SENATE
  Sen. Ken Salazar successfully pressed for an addition to the comprehensive immigration reform bill today in action on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
   Earlier today, Senator Salazar worked to amend the immigration reform bill (S. 2611) to require that the President determine that a guest worker program will strengthen U.S. national security before those provisions can take effect. Senator Salazar's amendment passed the Senate earlier today by a bipartisan vote of 79-16.
   Salazar said on the floor, "What I am advocating is a focus on a core principle - our national security. And the President will make that call. Last night, President Bush told the country that 'a temporary worker program would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our country and why they are here.' I agree. That's why I support this bill. But for those who have doubts, I offer this amendment that requires an explicit Presidential determination to this effect before comprehensive reform moves forward."
