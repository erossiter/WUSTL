SEN. SALAZAR PUSHES FOR FUNDING FOR SOLAR MONITOR TO BE DEVELOPED AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO
  Earlier this week, United States Senator Ken Salazar sent a letter[http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/071025_TSIS_CJS.pdf] to Senate Appropriators asking for their support in retaining $850,000 for the University of Colorado's Total Solar Irradiance Monitor (TSIS) instrument in the final version of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill. 
   The TSIS instrument is currently being developed at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado. The instrument gathers data on radiant energy emitted by the sun, which is vital to creating accurate models of climate change. The instrument would allow scientists to continue to add to a 30-year library of data that permits them to accurately document changes to the earth's temperature.
   "The Total Solar Irradiance Monitor instrument plays an important role in making sure that we are able to accurately collect data and models on climate change," said Senator Salazar. "Not only is the instrument important to our Nation's efforts to monitor and curb global warming and climate change, its development at University of Colorado keeps important jobs in Boulder."
   The funding was originally supported by Representative Mark Udall in the House-passed version of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill. Senator Salazar's letter asks that the funding be included in the final Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, which is now being discussed in conference committee.
