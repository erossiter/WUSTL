SEN. SALAZAR BLASTS PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO THREAT OF PROGRAM TO INSURE COLORADO'S CHILDREN
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding President Bush's SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) veto threat: 
   "It is unconscionable that the President would announce a veto threat before we have even begun to mark up the SCHIP bill in Committee. Reauthorizing SCHIP is a no-brainer. It has become a critical resource that provides much needed coverage to children who would otherwise go uninsured. It is our moral and economic obligation in Washington to invest in our children's healthcare, as our investment today, will pay off tomorrow. We are making positive headway in Congress to responsibly improve and expand the program, and it is very discouraging that the President has made this threat before we even have a final bill."
   SCHIP is a highly successful program in Colorado. There are currently 180,000 uninsured children living in Colorado. Under the current bill being considered in the Senate Finance Committee, Colorado would receive $127 million for the SCHIP Program in 2008, providing $56 million more to Colorado than last year, which would provide thousands of additional Colorado children with access to health care, covering over 120,000 of the state's uninsured children.
   According to statistics from FamiliesUSA, children without health insurance are ten times less likely to have a regular doctor; four times more likely to delay seeking needed care; five times more likely to use the emergency room as a regular source of care; and six times less likely to fill a prescription because of cost.
   Salazar intends to offer several amendments to the SCHIP bill being considered in the Senate Finance Committee during its markup later tonight.
