SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE NOMINATION
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in response to President Bush's nomination of Ed Schafer to be Secretary of Agriculture.  
   "I am pleased the President has sent forth a nomination for Secretary of Agriculture. This is a critical time for the Department of Agriculture as we are poised to take up a Farm Bill that reinvests in rural America, our Nation's energy security and conservation. We need quality leadership at the Department of Agriculture to see the implementation of the Farm Bill through to ensure that we continue to support and bolster our Nation's agricultural economy. I look forward to learning more about Mr. Schaefer in the coming weeks as the nomination process moves forward."
