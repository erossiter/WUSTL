SEN. SALAZAR URGES HOUSE, SENATE TO FINISH JOB ON IMMIGRATION
  "The Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 earlier this year. It is a law and order bill with three major components: border security, immigration law enforcement, and penalties and registration for the millions of undocumented workers in America. Democrats and Republicans in both chambers, along with President Bush, have already stated a willingness to enact comprehensive immigration reform. In fact, there have been months of hearings and several weeks of debate on the Senate floor. 
   "It is unfortunate that that willingness to enact reform is being held hostage in order to score political points for the November 2006 elections. Hearings like the one today do nothing to move the ball forward on immigration reform or to strengthen our National security. I will continue to urge leadership in the House and Senate to put politics aside and finish the job on comprehensive immigration reform."
