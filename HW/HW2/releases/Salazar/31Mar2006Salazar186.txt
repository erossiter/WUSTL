SEN. SALAZAR RAISES AWARENESS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION
  This week is recognized by the United States Senate as "Week of the Young Child," drawing attention to the development of the Nation's 20 million children under the age of five. The recognition came after the Senate unanimously approved a commemorative resolution on the subject authored by Sen. Ken Salazar. 
   "Part of fulfilling the promise of the American dream is receiving a good education, so you can make the most of every opportunity," said Senator Salazar. "Improving early childhood education will make that Dream more possible than ever."
   Senate Resolution 418, passed unanimously by the Senate on March 31, noted that:
   * America is home to 20 million children under the age of five, one-fifth of whom live in poverty; 
   * Children in early childhood education programs are more likely to have improved development and less likely to drop-out or be placed in special education programs; 
   * Congress has taken several significant steps to promote and improve early childhood education, including the creation of Head Start, Early Head Start and the Child Care Development Block Grant programs; and 
   * For every $1.00 invested in early childhood education yields a public return of between $4.00 and $13.00. 
   The Resolution also encourages people to celebrate the services of early childhood education providers and recognize the value of early childhood education to children's future education and lifelong success.
   "Studies have consistently shown that early childhood education is a key component for the success of any child," said Senator Salazar. "As a Nation, we can do better to promote and recognize the value of these important opportunities, to ensure greater access for all."
   The "Week of the Young Child" was begun by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. A copy of Senator Salazar's early childhood education resolution can be viewed by clicking here: http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/060403ece.pdf.
