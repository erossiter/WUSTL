SEN. SALAZAR HELPS SECURE BETTER PENSION SYSTEM/PROTECTS HARD WORKING AMERICANS' RETIREMENT
  Sen. Ken Salazar took much needed steps today to create a more secure private pension system so that Americans, including all Coloradans, will receive the pension benefits that they worked so hard to earn. Sen. Salazar voted for the Pension Security and Transparency Act, which passed 97 to 2, that ensures companies live up to their pension obligations, thereby preventing future taxpayer bailouts of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC), without compromising the ability of employers to offer defined benefit pension plans in the first place. Today, Colorado has 385,000 workers and retirees with pension plans living in the state. 
   "We cannot undo the fiscal irresponsibility of some companies but we can protect the people who have worked their entire careers in hopes of a comfortable retirement," said Senator Salazar. "This bill takes steps to ensure that companies live up to their pension obligations, thereby preventing future taxpayer bailouts without compromising the ability of employers to offer defined benefit pension plans. It is the result of true bi-partisan compromise. I hope the House will follow the Senate's lead and take action soon."
   The Pension Security and Transparency Act:
   * Requires companies to fund pension promises by strengthening rules for single-employer plans, 
   * Helps prevent future pension failures, 
   * Gives workers timely and accurate information on pension plan finances, 
   * Protects workers and businesses in multiemployer pensions, 
   * Protects older workers in cash balance plan conversions, 
   * Adopts post-Enron worker pension protections for workers in 401(k) plans, 
   * Gives workers access to independent investment advice, 
   * Provides greater retirement security for widows/widowers and former spouses, 
   * Enhances Retirement Savings and Benefits, Relief for Pension Plans Affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, 
   * Provides for Equal Treatment of Certain State and Local Governmental Pension Plans, 
   * Modernization of Tax Court Retirement Benefits, and 
   * Provides Limited Additional Exemptions to ERISA Prohibited Transaction Rules among other things.
