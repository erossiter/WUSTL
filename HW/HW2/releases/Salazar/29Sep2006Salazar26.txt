  Stakeholders from around Colorado - including local elected officials, business groups, conservationists and representatives from the timber, water and recreation sectors met today with representatives from the staffs of every member of the Colorado Congressional delegation today and renewed their commitment to develop consensus legislation on forest health and pine beetles. The group agreed to move forward to set an aggressive timeline for draft legislation to be developed as soon as possible. 
   "Bark beetles are a scourge on our state's natural beauty and resources; it is time for us all to work together, including members of the Colorado delegation, local governments and businesses to quickly get a consensus bill introduced while we still can," said Senator Salazar. "I applaud the efforts of all the parties at the meeting today for their commitment to move the process forward quickly and have a draft delegation bill by the middle of November."
