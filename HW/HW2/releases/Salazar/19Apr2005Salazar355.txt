PUEBLO CHEM DEMIL TO GET FUNDS TO MOVE FORWARD
  Sen. Ken Salazar today received the attached memo from the Department of Defense which makes clear that after considerable delay the Pentagon will make available to the ACWA Program Manager all FY05 funding that had been withheld to date for the Pueblo Chemical Depot. 
   In follow up conversations, the Pentagon made clear, too, that the water neutralization will be the technology of choice in Pueblo and that the study of transferring chemical weapons from Pueblo has been suspended. "This is good news - the Department of Defense is recognizing that on-site water neutralization of the chemical weapons at Pueblo is the best path forward," said Salazar. "And I am pleased that the Pentagon is recognizing the urgent need to destroy all of these weapons before the Chemical Weapons Convention deadline of 2012." 
   The memo provided to Senator Salazar contends that by releasing the previously withheld money, Pueblo will have all it needs to continue work through FY06. Senator Salazar intends to verify that will be the case. "I want to work with my colleagues in the delegation to ensure that this program goes forward with the urgency it demands," said Salazar.
