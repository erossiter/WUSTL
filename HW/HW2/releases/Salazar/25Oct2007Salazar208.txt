SEN. SALAZAR LAUDS MAJOR STEP TO PASS FARM BILL THAT REINVESTS IN RURAL AMERICA
  United States Senator Ken Salazar grew up on his family's ranch and understands the contributions rural communities, farms and ranches make to America's economy and culture. That is why he fought for and helped pass the 2007 Farm Bill (The Food and Energy Security Act) out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry today. The bill invests in our rural communities, protects our natural heritage, makes us less dependent on foreign oil and helps secure our food supply.
   "Today was a historic day in the United States Senate. In passing the 2007 Farm Bill out of committee, we took a major step forward in revitalizing rural America and rural Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "Nearly three years ago my 'maiden' speech on the floor of the United States Senate painted a picture of rural America - what I call the 'Forgotten America.' Since then I have worked tirelessly with farmers and ranchers from every corner of Colorado, my Senate colleagues, and a myriad of others to help revitalize rural America. The 2007 Farm Bill will help accomplish that goal." 
   "The bill makes investments that not only will strengthen family farms and small businesses in rural America, but will also help us grow our way towards energy independence and bolster and secure America's food supply."
   Below is a summary of key provisions in the 2007 Farm Bill that fall under 1) rural development, 2) protecting our land and water, 3) energy independence, 4) closing commodity loopholes, and 5) and keeping Americans healthy.
   Senator Salazar sponsored or led all of the provisions listed below.
   I. RURAL DEVELOPMENT: For too long, Washington's policies have overlooked the troubles that are affecting small towns and rural communities across America. Rural communities are losing population, jobs are hard to come by, and family farmers and small business owners are struggling to make ends meet. It is time that we make smart investments in our rural communities. This bill will provide $400 million in mandatory rural development funding over the next five years.
   Four provisions of importance to rural Colorado are:
   1) Farm Service Agencies: Senator Salazar fought for and passed an amendment to the 2007 Farm Bill to keep the Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices in Colorado. The amendment will keep the FSA offices open for at least five additional years. Earlier this year, there were reports that the Farm Service Agency was proposing to close the FSA offices in Bent, Larimer, Rio Grande, Conejos and El Paso Counties.
   2) Investments in Rural Broadband and Closing the Digital Divide: Senator Salazar led an effort to invest $26 million to expand access to broadband in rural areas. According to the Government Accounting Office, only 17 percent of rural households currently have broadband access to the internet. These investments will expand economic and educational opportunities for rural residents.
   3) Permanent Ag Disaster Fund: Senator Salazar helped lead efforts in the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Agriculture Committee to create a permanent agriculture disaster trust fund. The $5.1 bill that Senator Salazar secured will provide much-needed assistance to those farmers and ranchers suffering from disasters. It will also streamline the process so that aid can be provided in a timely manner to help prevent bankruptcies and foreclosures.
   4) Micro Enterprise Loans: Senator Salazar helped secure $40 million for the Micro Enterprise Loan program, which provides technical assistance and small loans and grants to beginning rural entrepreneurs. Micro Enterprise Loans will provide incentives for beginning entrepreneurs to open their businesses in rural communities, thereby creating jobs and decreasing the rates of rural out migration. According to the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, micro-enterprises account for 30 percent of the jobs in 37 of the state's mostly rural counties.
   II. CONSERVATION: Farmers and ranchers are some of our best stewards of our land and water. We need programs in the Farm Bill that reward farmers and ranchers not just for the food, feed, fiber and fuel they supply, but also for the clean water, clean air, and wildlife habitat they provide and protect.
   Three conservation programs of particular importance to Colorado:
   1) Conservation Security/Stewardship Program (CSP): Colorado received $1.9 million in average annual CSP payments from 2003-2005. Under the Chairman's Mark, CSP will enroll up to 3 million acres of working land in Colorado with contracts for the state valued at $156 million over the life of the 2007 Farm Bill. The Conservation Security/Stewardship Program (CSP) is a voluntary stewardship program that provides financial and technical assistance to promote the conservation and improvement of soil, water, air, energy, plant and animal life, and other conservation purposes on private working agriculture lands.
   2) Conservation Reserve Program (CRP): The bill reauthorizes this important program, which means that Colorado will be able to maintain the 2.375 million Colorado acres that are currently enrolled in CRP. Colorado received $75.3 million in CRP payments in 2006, and this bill will ensure that Colorado continues to receive these important conservation investments that protect land and water.
   3) Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP): This bill reauthorizes this working lands program, which provides farmers and ranchers with financial and technical assistance to plan and implement soil and water conservation practices. Average annual funding to Colorado ranges between $30-40 million, and this bill will ensure that farmers and ranchers continue to have access to this essential program.
   III. GROWING OUR ENERGY AND RURAL ECONOMIES: The investments this bill makes in energy independence open a new chapter of opportunities for rural America. It spurs innovation in the rural energy sector, thereby advancing America toward energy independence, protecting our environment, and stimulating rural economies. Senator Salazar believes that Colorado is poised to become the renewable energy capital of the world; this bill will help accomplish that vision by providing $1.3 billion to important energy programs. Coupled with a package of legislation drafted by the Senate Finance Committee there will be an investment of over $3 billion in renewable energy programs.
   The key renewable energy provisions for Colorado:
   * Energy Collabratory: Senator Salazar authorized $5 million in annual funds for the "Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory," which pools the efforts of CSU, CU, NREL and School of Mines into an association, which more effectively can harness this world class research to develop new energy technologies and to transfer these advances as rapidly as possible to the private sector. 
   * Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP): Senator Salazar assisted in securing $230 million in mandatory funding over the life of the Farm Bill for REAP, which is a program to assist farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses in becoming more energy efficient and provides them assistance to transition to using renewable energy technology and resources. 
   * Biomass Research and Development: Senator Salazar worked to include $75 million over the life of the bill for grants and education programs for biomass research and development. 
   * Grants for Biomass Projects: Senator Salazar helped secure $30 million in grants for feedstock harvest, handling, transport, and storage as well as additional research and demonstration grants for biomass. 
   * Biodiesel Education Program: Senator Salazar helped to reauthorize the Biodiesel Education Program providing $10 million in funding for the program over the next five years. 
   * Sun Grant Initiative: Senator Salazar assisted in extending the authorization for the Sun Grant Initiative, which is a national network of land-grant universities that partner with Department of Energy laboratories to work on advancing the biobased industry. 
   * Creates biorefinery repowering grants: Senator Salazar assisted in creating and funding biorefinery repowering grants at $300 million. 
   * Investing in Hydroelectric Power: Senator Salazar worked to ensures that small, low-impact hydro projects are included in the list of projects that will be eligible for loans and grants. Hydroelectric power contributes 7% of our energy. DOE estimated in 2006 there are 5,400 potential small hydro projects in the U.S. which, if developed, could increase U.S. annual hydro power generation by more than 50%. 
   * Creating grants for "biochar": Senator Salazar worked to create over $500 million in grants over the next five years for feedstock harvest, handling, transport, and storage as well as additional research and demonstration grants for "biochar," which is added to soil to improve fertility, nutrient retention, and soil carbon sequestration. 
   * Federal Biobased Products Procurement Program: Senator Salazar worked to extend the federal Biobased Products Procurement Program. This program purchases biobased products for Federal agencies. This will aid in the development and application of economically useful bio-based energy products such as small wind and cellulosic biofuels tax credits. 
   IV. CLOSING COMMODITY LOOPHOLES: As a result of loopholes in the 2002 Farm Bill and FSA operating manual, recent reports have identified situations in which non-farmers were receiving commodity support payments for land that is no longer agricultural. Some studies have estimated that more than $1 billion in commodity payments have filtered through these loopholes to non-farmers.
   Senator Salazar included a provision that takes an important step to close a loophole commodity program loophole .
   V. KEEPING AMERICANS HEALTHY - This bill invests in our public health and safety, improves nutrition and fights hunger in our Nation and in Colorado.
   * Country of Origin Labeling: Country - of - Origin Labeling: The 2007 Farm Bill ensures that consumers will be able to know where the foods they feed their families comes from. Specifically, country-of-origin labeling will be provided for beef, lamb, pork and goat meat, fruits and vegetables, and peanuts. A product can be labeled as a product of United States if the commodity was exclusively born, raised and slaughtered in the United States.
   * Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program: Today, over 346,000 Colorado children eat school lunches. Under this bill, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which provides fruits and vegetables to school children, will be expanded to all 50 states. Colorado was among 15 states that were not eligible for the program and therefore received $0 through this program under the 2002 Farm Bill. Colorado will now receive $45 million in federal funds to provide fresh fruit and vegetables to approximately 80,000 schoolchildren per year. 
   * Providing Locally Produced Foods for School Meal Programs: Section 9 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act encourages institutions that are participating in the school lunch program to buy "locally produced foods for school meal programs, to the maximum extent practicable and appropriate." The 2007 Farm Bill provides an option for school meal programs to purchase locally grown fruits and vegetables. 
   Now that the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry has completed its "mark-up" of the Farm Bill, it will now proceed to consideration by the full Senate.
