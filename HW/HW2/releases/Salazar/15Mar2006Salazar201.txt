SEN. SALAZAR'S INDEPENDENCE RECOGNIZED BY U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  United States Sen. Ken Salazar's record as an independent voice for Colorado was recognized this morning by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with their "Spirit of Enterprise Award." 
   "I am pleased the Chamber has recognized my efforts on behalf of all Coloradans," said Senator Salazar. "I thank them for their support and will continue to be an independent voice for the people of Colorado, regardless of the issue."
   "Senator Salazar has worked tirelessly as an independent voice in Washington. The Chamber is proud to honor him with this award," said Tom Donohue, President and CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "Senator Salazar has been a friend to business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."
   Said Senator Salazar of the Chamber's award, "As I have previously said, many of the bills we voted on this year were not perfect. But Washington has a responsibility to produce results for the Nation, and we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good."
   Each year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recognizes members who score above 70 percent on the Chamber's annual "How They Voted" report. In 2005, Senator Salazar scored 72 percent on the Chamber's measure of 18 "key votes" in the Senate. Senator Salazar was one of 61 Senators to be recognized by the Chamber in the 2005 "Spirit of Enterprise" list.
   More information is available on the award, including a complete list of key votes and ratings, at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's website, www.uschamber.com.
