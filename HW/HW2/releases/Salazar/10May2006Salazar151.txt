SEN. SALAZAR MEETS WITH JUDICIAL NOMINEE GORSUCH
  Late yesterday, Sen. Ken Salazar met with Neil Gorsuch, President Bush's nominee to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   After the meeting Senator Salazar said, "I have recently met with Mr. Gorsuch and believe he has impressive credentials. I will carefully study his nomination evaluating Mr. Gorsuch on the same basic principles I have judged all nominees:
   * Professional excellence as a lawyer or judge; 
   * A demonstrated dedication that they will be a fair and impartial judge; and 
   * A demonstrated dedication to upholding the rule of law, avoiding a judicial activist on either the left or the right. 
   "I respect the long-standing process of the Senate and will reserve judgment on his nomination until after Mr. Gorsuch's confirmation hearing. I look forward to learning more about Mr. Gorsuch during the nomination process."
