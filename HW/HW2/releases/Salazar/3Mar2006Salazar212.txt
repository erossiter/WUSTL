BILL RENAMING ARRIBA POST OFFICE AFTER POSTAL CARRIER HERO, WILLIAM H. EMERY, CLEARS SENATE HURDLE
  Sen. Ken Salazar applauded the recent passage of Senate Bill 1445, which renamed the Post Office located at 520 Colorado Avenue in Arriba, Colorado, as the 'Arriba Post Office dedicated to William H. Emery.' Sen. Salazar sponsored the legislation and Sen. Allard was a co-sponsor. 
   "William H. Emery carried the mail in Arriba, Colorado for 50 years and six months, a record for any carrier west of the Mississippi River. He started when he was only nineteen years old, delivering the mail on horseback. At different points in his career he also delivered the mail using a single buggy, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, and a Model T Ford.
   "Emery was extraordinarily dedicated to his duty, despite the difficult conditions of Eastern Colorado. Often, he dug through snowdrifts and forded swollen streams in order to complete his route.
   "William Emery retired at the age of 70, having served the Arriba Post Office his entire career. He was married to Luella Frances Emerson. The couple had three children, six grandchildren, and many great-grandchildren, many of whom still call Colorado home.
   "The renaming of the Arriba Post Office after William H. Emery is a fitting tribute to a man who served the people of Colorado for over a half century. Emery was a legendary rural mail carrier whose fortitude and dependability will not soon be forgotten."
   The House is expected to take up the legislation in the coming weeks. If the bill clears the House, it will move on to the President's desk for his signature. Senator Salazar will continue to monitor the bill's progress so that Mr. Emery's dedication receives the honor it deserves.
