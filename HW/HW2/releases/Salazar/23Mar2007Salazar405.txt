SEN. SALAZAR CONGRATULATES COLORADO RECIPIENTS OF USDA WOODY BIOMASS UTILIZATION GRANTS
  On Tuesday, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns announced the award of over $565,000 in grants to three businesses in Colorado for wood biomass utilization projects. The grant recipients, Mountain Park Electric Incorporated, Mountain Valley Lumber and Ranch Creek Limited, were chosen from 93 applications proposing a wide range of innovative uses for woody biomass. 
   "Developing innovative uses for woody biomass is essential to managing pine beetle kill in Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "This region of Colorado is the epicenter of one of the most significant outbreaks of pine beetle kill in recent memory and I applaud the USDA's decision to award these three projects the necessary funding to help develop new technologies and markets for woody biomass."
   The three grants awarded to Colorado include:
   * $242,500 to Mountain Park Electric Incorporated to develop a 3-4 Woody Biomass CHP Facility in Walden, CO;
   * $179, 260 to Mountain Valley Lumber to provide funding to mill for utilization of smaller timber in Saguache, CO; and
   * $144,000 to Ranch Creek Limited to utilize and manage low-value timber in Grand County, CO.
   In October, Senator Salazar sent letters to the USDA urging the support for the grant applications from Mountain Parks Electric Incorporated and Ranch Creek Limited.
