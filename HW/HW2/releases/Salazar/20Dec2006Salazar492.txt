SEN. SALAZAR'S VICTORY FOR LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND, ENERGY TAX CREDITS MADE OFFICIAL WITH PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE
  As the President signed The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (S.3711) into law today, Sen. Ken Salazar's efforts to deliver permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) as well as key provisions that will help lead America to energy independence paid off.
   S. 3711 dedicates 12.5 percent of offshore drilling revenues to the LWCF - the first such dedicated funding stream in the program's more than 40-year history. The funding for LWCF was secured through the bipartisan efforts of Senators Ken Salazar, Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and others. The LWCF state-side grant program has provided hundreds of millions in funding to projects in the past. 
   "The President's signature today is a decisive step in preserving America's state and local parks and recreation projects," said Senator Salazar. "This law, guaranteeing permanent and dedicated funding for LWCF, is a great victory, but it is merely the first step. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that LWCF has the funds it needs so that Americans can keep enjoying our outdoor spaces."
   The dedicated funding will bring LWCF an average of $15 million a year in the first ten years, but will likely increase to more than $200 million in funding in 2017 and beyond when the potential of the oil and gas reserves can be fully realized. To compensate for the lower funding in the first ten years, Senator Salazar and Alexander received a commitment to send an additional $100 million to the LWCF through the appropriations process in FY 2007. Senator Salazar voted for the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act in July. His statement in support of the bill can be accessed at http://www.salazar.senate.gov/news/releases/060731drill.htm.
   Also included in the bill the President signed into law today were several initiatives that Senator Salazar has worked on over the last session. These include:
   * An extension of tax credits for energy efficiency improvements to new or existing homes and commercial buildings [S. 2614 was introduced by Senators Salazar and Thune (R-SD)] 
   * An extension of tax credits for electricity produced from certain renewable resources. This Section 45 extension for one-year is critical to continued installation of commercial electricity generation projects from wind and solar sources. [Senator Salazar introduced S. 1093, which would extend these credits to 2010.] 
   * An extension of tax credits for ethanol, biodiesel, and other alternative fuels [S. 2748 was introduced by Senators Salazar and Bingaman (D-NM)] 
   * An extension of tax credits for holders of clean renewable energy bonds. [S. 2401 was co-sponsored by Senator Salazar] 
   * An extension of existing business and residential solar credits [S. 2677 was introduced by Senators Salazar and Gordon Smith (R-OR)] 
   * An extension of the investment tax credit for the installation of qualified fuel cells [S. 2677] 
   "America's Energy independence is an attainable goal, and these tax credits will go a long way towards making the dream of breaking our dependence on foreign oil a reality," added Senator Salazar. "I will continue to work on these important issues with my colleagues in the 110th because we are far from the finish line, however, as industry and consumers begin to realize the economic advantages we will continue to move in the right direction."
