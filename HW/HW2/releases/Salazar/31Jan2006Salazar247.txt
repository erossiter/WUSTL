SEN. SALAZAR RELEASES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  Upon hearing of the passing of Coretta Scott King, United States Senator Ken Salazar issued the following statement: 
   "It is with deep regret that I learned of the passing of one of our nation's most dynamic and dedicated proponents of civil rights, Coretta Scott King.
   "Coretta Scott King worked to further the dream of her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., of racial and social harmony here in the United States. After her husband's death, Mrs. King went on to become a spokesperson for racial and economic justice for all Americans.
   "My thoughts and prayers are with her four children, Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice, and the entire King family. She will be deeply missed by all Americans."
