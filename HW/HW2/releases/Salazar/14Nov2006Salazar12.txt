SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF BETTY DICK
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement on the passing of Mrs. Betty Dick: 
   "I am saddened by the passing of Mrs. Betty Dick. Betty Dick was a graceful and courageous human being. She loved Colorado and Rocky Mountain National Park. I will miss her.
   "I am glad that she was able to see the resolution of the issue about her home before she passed on. I am proud to have been able to assist her. I am confident her final summer in her family home in Rocky Mountain National Park was a joyful one with family and friends.
   "Tonight, I will remember Betty in my prayers. In the two years I worked closely with her to help preserve her family home, I counted her as a good friend. She will be missed."
   Senator Salazar sponsored legislation to preserve Mrs. Dick's family home in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP). The bill passed both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, and was signed into law by the President earlier this year.
