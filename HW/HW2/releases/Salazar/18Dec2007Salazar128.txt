SEN. SALAZAR SECURES FUNDING FOR KEY PRIORITIES IN THE PIKES PEAK REGION; OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL PASSES IN SENATE
  Tonight, by a vote of 76 to 17 the United States Senate passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that he secured funding for key priorities in the Pikes Peak region in the bill. The funding Senator Salazar secured improves transportation infrastructure, provides funds for local law enforcement, supports our military and veterans and increases access to health care. 
   "I am proud that this bill helps meet the needs of Colorado's communities," said Senator Salazar. "These investments are vital to the Pikes Peak region, including our service members and their families."
   Below is a list of key projects that Senator Salazar included in the bill for the Pikes Peak region:
   * $470 million for Military Construction at Fort Carson: Senator Salazar fought to include $470 million in military construction funds for Fort Carson to accommodate the arrival of an additional 12,000 active duty and 18,360 active duty family members that are currently moving to Fort Carson. 
   * $2,214,800 to the Colorado Department of Transportation for an interchange at Fort Carson's Gate 20: As a result of a May 2005 recommendation of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission, Fort Carson is anticipated to see an increase of over 12,000 new personnel between now and 2009. This funding would accelerate the completion of an interchange reconstruction project at I-25 and State Highway 16. This will reduce delays for service members and civilians entering the base through Gate 20. 
   * $147,000 for the Fountain Creek Watershed Study: The ACOE began the Fountain Creek Watershed Study in 2003 to guide the development of a watershed plan, improvements to infrastructure, restoration of habitat, and construction of flood mitigation projects. Problems on Fountain Creek, including sewage spills and naturally occurring floods, have recently provoked regional conflict and have increased the urgency for completing the study. The Fountain Creek Watershed Study directly affects and involves Teller, Pueblo and El Paso Counties, and eight municipalities within those counties. Participating local entities have already contributed close to $1.5 million in non-federal matching funds. The funding Senator Salazar secured will complete the study. 
   * Mileage Reimbursement for Veterans: The omnibus includes $125 million in funding that Senators Tester and Salazar added as an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Administration appropriations bill to support a long-overdue mileage reimbursement increase for veterans to 28.5 cents per mile. Currently, veterans living in rural areas who travel long distances to receive medical care are only reimbursed at 11 cents per mile. 
   The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 will be sent back to the House of Representatives for final passage. It is expected to be sent to the President's desk by the end of the week.
