SEN. SALAZAR JOINS COLLEAGUES, INDUSTRY TO PRESS FOR ALTERNATIVE FUEL TANKS AT GAS STATIONS
  Sen. Ken Salazar joined Sen. John Thune (R-SD) today to highlight their Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006 (S. 2614). 
   The bill would provide incentives for gas station owners across the country to install alternative fuel tanks, giving consumers greater opportunities to opt for cleaner, more environment-friendly fuels such as those containing ethanol, compressed natural gas or bio-diesel, in an effort to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil.
   "The number one thing we can do to decrease gas prices is to cut demand through conservation," Salazar said. "We have to commit ourselves to a long term strategy to reduce our dependence on oil - especially foreign oil - by increasing our energy efficiency and by developing alternative fuels that we can produce here at home, including ethanol and bio-diesel. But these efforts will do little if a driver has no place to fill their car with an alternative fuel. This bill is a crucial step in taking our mission for energy independence from the drawing table to the highway."
   Thune and Salazar were joined by the sponsors of the House companion legislation, along with representatives from the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Corn Growers Association, and representatives from DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors, who brought a few of their Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV) for the Senators to examine.
   The bill would reimburse gas station owners to replace and/or add new alternative fuel storage tanks, such as: E-85, Compressed Natural Gas, Natural Gas, Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Hydrogen.
