SEN. SALAZAR PROPOSES KEEPING CANADIAN BORDER CLOSED - SAFETY, ACCOUNTABILITY OF KEY CONCERN
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced today, along with Sens. Thomas (R-WY), Conrad (D-ND), Reid (D-NV), Domenici (R-NM), Enzi (R-WY), Dorgan (D-ND), Johnson (D-SD) and Bingaman (D-NM) the introduction of a bipartisan resolution to disapprove of USDA's rule to reopen the border to Canadian live cattle and beef imports by March 7, 2005.  
   The border has been closed to Canadian cattle since December 2003 after the U.S. discovered its first case of "Mad Cow Disease" or BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in a Canadian-born cow. 
   "I think it is paramount that we take proper steps to ensure the safety of our food supply and domestic livestock herd," said Salazar. "Yesterday the USDA took a first step toward that assurance by delaying the effective date for imports of meat from animals 30 months and over. I applaud this effort but we need to address the whole problem, not just one portion of it, before we move forward." 
   This bill's purpose is to motivate the Department to rewrite the rule that would reopen the border and focus on important issues such as: whether this rule includes BSE-risk mitigation measures that will help us regain our lost beef markets, especially in Japan, and whether Canada is implementing and in compliance with the highest food safety standards. 
   "I do not believe that this rule, as currently written, gives us the proper safety and market assurances," said Salazar. "What will the BSE-risk mitigation standards be? How many inspectors will the border have? How many cattle will they check and which cattle will they check? These are just some of the questions our consumers and producers deserve answers for before the border is opened."
