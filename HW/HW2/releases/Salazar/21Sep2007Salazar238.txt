SEN. SALAZAR WORKS TO PRESERVE $100 MILLION FOR COLORADO HIGHWAYS
  Today, as a part of the reauthorization of the Aviation Trust Fund, the Senate Finance Committee approved critical funding for the Highway Trust Fund which is currently forecasted to experience a shortfall in revenues in 2009. This bill addresses that shortfall, which if left unaddressed would mean a $100 million loss for Colorado highways in 2009. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, United States Senator Salazar worked to ensure this funding is included in the bill. 
   "The residents of Colorado know first hand that our highways are our state's economic vessels. To ensure that our state continues to prosper we must make sure our highways are in their best condition. The Highway Trust Fund is on the verge of not being able to meet its obligations outlined in the Transportation bill passed in 2005. Today, we took critical action to make certain that the Highway Trust Fund has sufficient funding to meet its obligation of keeping our roadways safe for the millions that travel on them each day."
   Now that the bill has passed out of the Senate Finance Committee, it will move to be considered by the full Senate.
