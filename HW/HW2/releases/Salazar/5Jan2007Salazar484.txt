SEN. SALAZAR CONTINUES CALL FOR HEARINGS ON VETERANS' MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES
  After representatives from Senator Salazar's office completed two days of meetings with officials at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Sen. Ken Salazar reiterated his call for the Veterans Affairs and Armed Services Committees to hold joint hearings on the programs available to our Nation's veterans experiencing mental health issues including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 
   "Soldiers coming home with mental health issues, including PTSD, must have access to the best care available," said Senator Salazar. "The care and treatment of our soldiers returning home from active duty is a national issue and deserves to be looked at in a comprehensive manner. I appreciate the willingness of those at Ft. Carson to reach out to my office and other congressional staff; Congress now owes it to our fighting men and women and to our veterans to give this critical issue the thorough and thoughtful examination it deserves."
   Ft. Carson has hosted several briefings with Senator Salazar's staff over the past year on this issue. Yesterday and today's briefing was held with staff representatives of Senators Salazar, Wayne Allard, Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Barack Obama (D-IL) and others to discuss the military's response to soldiers with PTSD.
