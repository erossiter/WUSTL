SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW DEAL TO MOVE FORWARD ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on the announcement of a new deal to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform: 
   "During the last week I have worked with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to solve one of the most pressing national security issues facing our Nation. Our legislation will secure our borders, strengthen our interior security and enforcement and provide a realistic solution for the 12 million undocumented workers in our country.
   "This announcement is reassuring that we can truly get real reform done. But now my colleagues, both Democrats and, most importantly, Republicans, need to live-up to their end of the deal and vote for cloture.
   "I commend Majority Leader Harry Reid for his leadership in helping guide us to where we are today - on the cusp of real reform.
   "As I have said before, failure is not an option. And those who are using this opportunity to divide us instead of bringing real solutions to the table will be to blame if comprehensive immigration reform is not accomplished."
