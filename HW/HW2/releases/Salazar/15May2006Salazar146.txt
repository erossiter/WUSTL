SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT IN ADVANCE OF PRESIDENT'S IMMIGRATION SPEECH
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement in advance of the President's address on immigration tonight. 
   "I welcome the President's stated commitment to enacting comprehensive immigration reform. I hope the President's remarks this evening echo the work being done in the Senate to enhance border security, enforce our current laws and recognize the economic and human reality of the millions of undocumented workers currently living within our borders."
   "The comprehensive reform I support includes doubling the number of border control officers and other measures that will strengthen our borders in a permanent way. I am deeply concerned that the militarization of our borders, both to the north and to the south, is a shortsighted strategy which has far reaching repercussions on our relationships with nations throughout the Western hemisphere. We do not need another short-term fix to the immigration problem, but a long-term, comprehensive solution to securing our borders, enforcing our laws and dealing with the human and economic reality of the millions of undocumented workers currently living in the U.S."
