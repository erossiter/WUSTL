SEN. SALAZAR: 'MUSHARRAF DECISION A WELCOME MOVE'
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in response to Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf's announcement today that he expects to step down as army chief by the end of November and begin a new presidential term as a civilian. 
   "President Musharraf's decision to take off his uniform and not try to hold the titles of both Chief of the Army and President is a welcome move. Although I am still disappointed with his earlier actions of suspending the constitution and imposing martial law, I applaud his decision to accept the will of the Pakistani people and not serve in both positions.
   "Pakistan is an important ally in the war on terror and I want to ensure that peace and order are restored so we can continue fighting Al Qaeda. While Musharraf's action today is a welcome move, there is a long way to go to restore democracy and order. The President should begin with releasing Benazir Bhutto from house arrest as this would help restore some semblance of calm. Parliamentary elections should also continue to take place as scheduled in January, and I urge President Musharraf to uphold his commitment to ensure they happen freely and fairly."
