SEN. SALAZAR WINS FUNDS TO SUPPORT NATION'S TROOPS, COLORADO'S MILITARY INSTALLATIONS
  Later today, the Senate will pass the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2007, and with it several provisions introduced by United States Senator Ken Salazar to provide crucial funding to support US troops and military operations. The Defense spending bill will also include an amendment to provide funds to create a new team focused on the capture of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda leaders - Sen. Salazar was an original co-sponsor of that amendment.
   "To ensure strong homeland security, we must ensure our Nation's defense and military operations have the funding they need to get the job done," said Senator Salazar. "I am proud to have fought for these funds to improve our Nation's defense programs. I will continue to work with my Senate and House colleagues to ensure these funds stay in Colorado throughout the appropriations process." 
   Various press sources have reported that the CIA's Osama bin Laden unit and the bin Laden Issue Team at the Counter Terrorism Center have both been deactivated. In response to those reports, the Defense spending bill includes an amendment from Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) which would provide $200 million to constitute a new team dedicated to bring bin Laden and other top al Qaeda leaders to justice. It also requires classified reporting to Congress on national strategy and ongoing efforts to bring to justice the top leadership of al Qaeda.
   It has now been over 1800 days since President Bush said "this act will not stand; we will find those who did it; we will smoke them out of their holes; we will get them running and we'll bring them to justice."
   "We must hold Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda accountable for the attack on this country," added Senator Salazar. "For the Administration to suggest deactivating the task force focused on bringing those responsible for the 9/11 attacks to justice weakens our National Security. I am proud to help sponsor this amendment to ensure our attention is not diverted as we hunt the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks."
   The FY 2007 Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5631), will include the following provisions requested by and fought for by Senator Salazar:
   * $10 million to purchase communications packages capable of linking more than 1,000 first responders during an emergency for the United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM). Each of these packages includes a mobile cellular base station that supports voice, video and data. Each package also includes cellular handsets, broadband-enable laptops, and air cards for additional computer devices. Satellite phones are included to provide telephone coverage outside of cellular coverage zones. 
   * $19 million in full funding for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC). The center's mission is to serve active duty military, their dependents and veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) through state-of-the-art medical care, innovative clinical research initiatives, and educational programs. The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center requested $19 million for the coming year, citing the growing number of patients, the cost of long-term care, current staffing requirements, and the need for research to improve treatment and prevention. The appropriations had been cut to only $7 million, but Senator Salazar cosponsored an amendment providing funding at the level requested by the center. 
   * $216 million for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (ACWA) program. The money will be utilitized for Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation of the ACWA program and will be shared between the Pueblo Chemical Depot and Bluegrass, Kentucky sites. 
   * $57 million ($7 million above the President's budget request) for NORAD and STRATCOM for development of the Single Integrated Space Picture. 
   * $2 million for the Air Force's Advanced Power Technology Office (APTO) for the research and development of high-performance, low-cost modular energy systems for hybrid and electric vehicles. 
   * $3 million for the development of a Respiratory Biodefense Initiative at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, CO. 
   * $4 million dollars to upgrade utilities at Fort Carson that will provide utility infrastructure in support of new installation construction through FY2010. 
   * $3.2 million for Schriever Air Force Base to replace their ground space electronic security system. 
   * $800 thousand for the United States Air Force Academy to rehabilitate and upgrade its aging static aircraft displays across the campus. 
   * $4 million nationally for the Civil Air Patrol, which had been hurt by proposed cuts to its overall budget. 
   * Senator Salazar is also proud to support language directing the United States Air Force to come up with a master plan for infrastructure restoration at the United States Air Force Academy. 
   * $11 million for the Minuteman III Propulsion Replacement Program, to be carried out by Northrop-Grumman. This replaces the aging propellant in Minuteman III rocket motors in order to keep the current fleet operational. Wyoming's F.E. Warren Air Force Base has some of these missiles. 
   * $2 million for the development of copper, lightweight induction motors for the military to be carried out by Vforge in Lakewood, CO. Copper rotors result in more efficient motors, meaning they can be smaller and lighter than traditional motors. 
   * $2 million for the Deployable Structures Experiment, to be carried out by Microsat in Littleton, CO. The experiment seeks to reduce the design time, cost, and size of satellites in order to allow tactical satellite launches for battlespace management. 
   * $2.5 million for Special Operations Command to develop an air-dropped sensor needed for clandestine missions. This is to be carried out by ADA Technologies in Littleton, CO. 
   * $1 million for the Medical Image Database Holographic Archiving Library System (MIDHALS), which seeks to store, distribute, and retrieve medical documents for the administration of timely medical care for soldiers. Companies to receive funding for this program include Sun Microsystems in Louisville, CO and InPhase Technologies in Longmont, CO. 
   * $2 million for Combat Support Hospital tents, to be produced by Alaska Structures in Delta, CO, which provide state-of-the-art field medical hospitals. 
   * $2 million for Polyimide Macro-electromechanical Systems (PMEMS), to be carried out by Ball Aerospace in Boulder and Jefferson Counties, which seeks to save the government money by dramatically reducing the cost of phased arrays for multiple applications and frequency bands. The phased array systems are estimated to save the Navy $88 million dollars for every ship they are used on. 
   After passage, the FY07 Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5631) will then go to Conference Committee.
