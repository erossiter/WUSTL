SEN. SALAZAR SEEKS FOLLOW-UP FROM FAA ON DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT DE-ICING SCANDAL
  United States Senator Ken Salazar sent a letter to the Acting Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Robert Sturgell, urging him to release the findings of an FAA investigation of Servisair USA's de-icing training program at Denver International Airport (DIA). 
   In his letter, Senator Salazar wrote, "As you may recall, Servisair came under scrutiny last year when it was revealed that a trainer for the vendor provided job candidates with answers to questions on qualifying exams..."
   The letter continues, "According to [Homeland Security] Secretary Chertoff, that investigation was conducted by the FAA, which 'held hearings, completed appropriate corrective actions, and closed the case. Therefore, I respectfully ask that you provide me with information about what the FAA uncovered and what actions were taken to ensure that the safety of American air travelers is not compromised."
