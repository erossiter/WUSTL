SEN. SALAZAR FIGHTS TO PRESERVE HISTORY, HERITAGE OF POUDRE RIVER AS ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE PASSES BILL, ONE STEP CLOSER TO BECOMING LAW
  Today, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed the Cache la Poudre River Corridor National Heritage Area Technical Adjustment Act (S. 128), bringing it one step closer to becoming law. As a member of the Senate Energy Committee, United States Senator Ken Salazar is a cosponsor of the bill along with Senator Wayne Allard. The bill will now be considered by the full Senate and Senator Salazar will continue to work for its passage. 
   "We in Colorado are very proud of the Poudre River and the history along its banks," said Senator Salazar. "By strengthening the current National Heritage Area, we are giving local citizens a stronger voice in the preservation of the vital history, spectacular views, world-class recreational opportunities and heritage of the Poudre River of which we are so proud."
   The bill fixes a problem in the law that originally established the heritage area in 1996. Because of a glitch in the statute, the Secretary of Interior has been unable to appoint a commission to manage the heritage area. This bill designates a local non-profit organization, the Poudre Heritage Alliance, as the management entity for the heritage area. It also extends the authorization for the area for an additional ten years, to allow for a total of $1 million in federal assistance for historic, cultural and natural resource preservation.
   The bill has the support of the local communities and stakeholders, including Fort Collins, Greeley, Windsor and the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District.
