SEN. SALAZAR PRESSES ARMY FOR 'WIN-WIN' SOLUTION AT PINON CANYON WITHOUT USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN
  Local residents of southeastern Colorado are concerned about the Army's proposed expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site because of the effects it could have on their livelihoods, their way of life, their land, and the agricultural economy of the region. With these concerns in mind Sen. Ken Salazar today urged the Army to ensure there is ample candid and public dialogue on the proposed expansion and to do all it can to craft a "win-win" solution for both the residents and the Army. 
   Senator Salazar suggested several concepts to Assistant Secretary of the Army, Keith Eastin, in a letter, "As the Army works with local communities to develop its expansion plan it should explore a variety of concepts, including:
   * Creating an economic development fund that will sustain growth and new investments in southeastern Colorado; 
   * Allowing grazing to continue in the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; 
  Leasing land from private landowners so that ranchers can continue to own and graze their lands; 
   * Using goods and services from the communities of southeastern Colorado; 
   * Minimizing any tax impacts on citizens who choose to sell land to the Army; and 
   * Allowing public access to cultural and historic sites on Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. 
   "In addition, the Army should demonstrate that its plans for expansion at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site: 1) do not involve the use of eminent domain; 2) are fiscally responsible; 3) are fully necessary for the training of our soldiers; 4) protect the agricultural, natural, cultural and environmental heritage of the region; 5) thoroughly consider alternate acquisition sites and smaller acreage levels for expansion; and 6) are available for public scrutiny, discussion, and comment."
   On February 8, 2007, the Secretary of Defense granted a waiver to the United States Army to develop an acquisition plan for the expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. In the weeks and months ahead, the Army will develop a proposed acquisition plan which will then be subject to the NEPA process, including the development of an environmental impact statement (EIS).
   Senator Salazar said, "I want complete openness and a thorough public scrutiny of the Army's acquisition plan. Until this occurs, I will reserve judgment as to whether I will support the Army's plan to expand the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site."
