SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON EXECUTION OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement regarding the execution of Saddam Hussein: 
   "The trial, sentence, and execution of Saddam Hussein by the Iraqi government was a just end. Saddam's ruthless dictatorship over the Iraqi people was a painful chapter in that nation's history - a chapter that is now closed. Now it is imperative that we focus on the future and work with the Iraqis to find a solution in Iraq that allows us to bring our own brave men and women in uniform home."
