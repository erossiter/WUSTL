SEN. SALAZAR: 'PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO ATTEMPTS TO END COLORADO'S URGENT WATER PROJECTS'
  Today, President Bush vetoed the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA), which provides over $120 million for critical water-related projects in Colorado. The report authorizes federal spending on water development, infrastructure, flood control and other projects conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. The WRDA conference report passed in both the House of Representatives and Senate with veto-proof majorities (381-40 in the House, 81-12 in the Senate). A vote to override the President's veto is expected in the coming weeks. Senator Salazar released the following statement in response the Presidents veto: 
   "In vetoing the Water Resources Development Act today, President Bush has attempted to end some of Colorado's most urgent water projects. By vetoing this bill the President is demonstrating that he is not on the side of the farmers, ranchers, and communities of Colorado that rely on the precious amount of water the projects in the bill help provide. Fortunately, we were able to pass WRDA in both the House and Senate with substantial majorities to override the President's veto. I look forward to casting my vote to override his veto so we can move forward on these projects that will have critical and long lasting impact throughout Colorado."
   At Senator Salazar's request, WRDA includes funding authorization for the following projects around Colorado:
   * South Platte River, Colorado- WRDA includes a $13.06 million authorization for use in partnership with state and local entities to complete flood mitigation, habitat restoration, and improved recreation along the South Platte River in Denver, to be matched by more than $7 million in non-Federal funds. 
   * $79 Million for Arkansas Valley Conduit: WRDA includes a $79 million authorization for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in Southeastern Colorado. The construction of this conduit will fulfill a long-standing promise to the people of the lower Arkansas Valley for fresh drinking water and is one of the keystones for the economic revitalization of Southeastern Colorado; 
   * $25 million for the Rio Grande Environmental Management Program in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, which provides for the ongoing restoration and management of the Rio Grande, which is headwatered in Colorado, and its tributaries such as the Alamosa and Conejos Rivers. 
   * Fountain Creek Watershed Study: WRDA includes specific instructions to the Secretary of the Army to speed up completion of the Fountain Creek Watershed Study, the first step towards the clean-up and protection of Fountain Creek for all the communities. The importance of this study was underscored earlier this year when the Creek flooded parts of Pueblo along Dillon Drive, damaging several homes and businesses. 
   * $1 million for water and wastewater infrastructure for the Ute Mountain Project in Montezuma and La Plata Counties. 
   * $5 Million Authorization for a Statewide Selenium Study: WRDA includes a $5 million authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct regional and watershed-wide studies to address selenium concentrations in Colorado, which in high doses can be fatal to humans, livestock and wildlife. 
   * $10 Million for the Boulder County Pipeline: WRDA includes a $10 million authorization for construction of a water pipeline, which will protect drinking water quality and allow for year-round water delivery from Carter Lake to Boulder and other municipal area water providers.
