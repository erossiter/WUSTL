SEN. SALAZAR RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S SPEECH
  Tonight, United States Senator Ken Salazar issued the following statement responding to President Bush's address to the Nation on the situation in Iraq and his acceptance of General Petraeus' recommendation to withdrawal 30,000 troops from Iraq in the next six months. 
   "Tonight, President Bush announced that he will be drawing down our troops by 30,000 by the end of the year, followed by possible additional withdrawals next year. However, those troop withdrawals only put us at the same number of troops we had in 2006 before the surge.
   "At the end of the day, we need a mission change in Iraq. I have said for many months that we need to begin the transition of our troops' mission in Iraq from one of combat to one of training and support. That was the core recommendation of the Iraq Study Group. We must make a fundamental change in our mission that would accelerate the removal of our troops and that will require the Iraqi government to take greater responsibility for their country's future.
   "I continue to believe that our Iraq Study Group bill is the only coherent, comprehensive and bipartisan piece of legislation that has been put forward. I am eager to return from my trip to Iraq to our work that awaits us in the Senate next week and finding a new way forward in Iraq."
