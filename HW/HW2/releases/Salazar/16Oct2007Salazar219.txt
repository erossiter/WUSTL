SEN. SALAZAR FIGHTS FOR SAFETY IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN CJS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  As Colorado's former Attorney General and the state's top law enforcement officer, Senator Salazar knows how important it is for our local law enforcement agencies to have the resources they need to do their jobs. This week, as the United States Senate continues consideration of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Department Appropriations bill, Senator Salazar was able to secure over $2.9 million in funding for Colorado to combat meth usage in communities throughout the state and also secured funding for several programs that will keep Colorado's communities and schools safer. Senator Salazar also included critical language urging the Bureau of Prisons to provide the funding necessary to address safety issues at Supermax correctional facility.
   "Meth is poisoning our communities and is especially rampant in rural Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "This bill will provide critical funds to the arsenals of those who on the ground fighting the meth scourge. I will continue to fight for those funds and anything additional that will give our local law enforcement the tools they need to do their jobs and keep our communities safe." 
   The bill also includes over $550 million for Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), which provides grants to tribal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. These funds go towards community policing initiatives, which provides necessary resources for the law enforcement professionals on the streets so they can build relationships with the people they serve. By earning the trust of the members of their communities and making those individuals stakeholders in their own safety, community policing makes law enforcement safer and more efficient.
   Additionally Senator Salazar fought to include $110 million for the Universal Hiring Program (UHP), which would allow local law enforcement agencies to hire additional officers. The Bush Administration had previously completely cut funding for this program over the last couple years, to the detriment of local law enforcement agencies. The Universal Hiring Program, administered under the COPS program, allows local law enforcement agencies to apply for funds to put more cops on the beat. 628 officers have been hired under this program in Colorado in the last ten years of its existence.
   "I fought to restore funding for the Universal Hiring Program because it has brought over 600 additional police officers to the streets in Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "It is a highly successful program and it has provided many resources for local law enforcement to fill in the gaps to keep our communities safe."
