SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON 4,000 MILITARY DEATH IN IRAQ
  United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement on the 4,000th military death in the war in Iraq: 
   "The cost of this war has been tremendous. Today, as we surpass this grim milestone in the Iraq war, we are reminded of the sacrifices our men and women of the Armed Forces and their families have made.
   "This statistic is more than a number. Each of those who died serving our Country was a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, a son or a daughter. They were friends, colleagues and members of our communities. They paid the ultimate price and for that we are forever in their debt.
   "For our troops who are still serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must continue our efforts to implement a responsible change in mission that steadily reduces our combat role in Iraq, while ensuring that Iraqi leaders take responsibility for their own country.
   "Here at home we must continue to support the men and women who valiantly serve our Nation overseas, and I will keep working to ensure that all our veterans receive the benefits they have earned and a quality of care worthy of their sacrifice."
