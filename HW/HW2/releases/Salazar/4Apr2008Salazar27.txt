SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON LABOR, BUSINESS BALLOT INITIATIVES
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding proposed ballot measures by certain business and labor groups: 
   "I am very concerned about the looming ballot initiative battle between certain business and labor groups. At a time when the uncertain future of Colorado's economy requires that we all put our shoulders to the wheel to create jobs, compete in a global economy, solve our transportation problems and adequately fund our higher education system, we cannot afford to be divided. If these ballot issues go forward, both business and labor will waste millions of dollars on campaigns-money better invested in Colorado jobs and needs.
   "From my own conversations with Colorado business leaders who have worked for decades to make Colorado prosper, I know that reasonable business leaders do not want a labor-business meltdown. I also know that union leaders want to avert prolonged strife. The best course of action may simply be for both sides to withdraw their initiatives. I urge both sides to take a 'time out' and try to resolve their differences. I support Gov. Ritter's call for negotiation and stand ready to lend my assistance."
