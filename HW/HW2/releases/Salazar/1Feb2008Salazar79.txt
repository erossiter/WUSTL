SEN. SALAZAR-LED INCREASE TO VETERANS REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO BEGIN
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that as of today, February 1, 2008, the Veterans Administration will increase the mileage reimbursement rates for veterans from 11 cents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile. Senator Salazar fought to include this increase in the Veterans Affairs Administration Appropriations Act that passed late last year. While increasing the reimbursement rate, the Secretary of the VA has also decided to increase the deductible that is charged against veterans receiving this benefit. Accordingly, the deductible will rise from $6 per round trip (max. of $18 per month) to $15.44 per round trip (max. of $46.62 per month). 
   A 2004 study by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) found that even though one in four U.S. veterans lives in a rural area, these rural veterans tend to be in poorer health than those in urban or suburban areas. The distance and other difficulties associated with obtaining care causes many rural veterans to put off preventive care as well as other necessary treatments. The result is poorer health and increased health expenditures for these courageous Americans.
   "This is a long-overdue increase for our veterans, especially those living in rural Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "With one in four veterans living in rural areas, we must do what we can to help defray the costs they incur because they have to travel significant distances for medical care. This is one small way that we can ensure our vets have access to quality health care and show our gratefulness and appreciation for their service and sacrifice. I will continue to fight to improve the reimbursement rates and to ensure that the deductibles are affordable to all veterans."
