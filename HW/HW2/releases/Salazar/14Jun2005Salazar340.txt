SEN. SALAZAR HONORS AMERICAN FLAG ON FLAG DAY
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement in honor of Flag Day. 
   "The American flag is a symbol of America's traditions of liberty, freedom and equality. Today, we all should reflect upon the patriots who fought for the flag of this great nation in the past and who are serving abroad defending it today."
   In 1776, Gen. George Washington commissioned Philadelphia seamstress Betsy Ross to create a new flag for the colonies. This flag was adopted by the Continental Congress in 1777. Flag Day was first observed in 1877, on the 100th anniversary of the Continental Congress' adoption of the Stars and Stripes. The holiday was officially proclaimed on June 14, 1916, by President Woodrow Wilson to commemorate the American flag.
