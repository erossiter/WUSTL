   In his letter to the Ambassador, Senator Salazar said, "Because of efforts on the part of the US Embassy in Beijing and the US Consulate in Chengdu, search operations have been initiated with ground teams in Sechuan and Yunan provinces. The purpose of my letter is to request assurances that the efforts of the United States Embassy to work with local Chinese officials will continue unabated."
