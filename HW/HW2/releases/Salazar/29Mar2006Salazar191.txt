SEN. SALAZAR VOTES FOR ETHICS, LOBBYING REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar voted today for the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which passed the Senate. 
   "Today, the Senate passed important ethics and lobbying reform legislation, which I was proud to support. Over the past year, the American people have been shocked by revelations of corruption and illegality in both Congress and the Executive branch. These revelations have shaken the public's trust in their government - and Congress had an obligation to act swiftly.
   "The bill we passed today was the product of a strong bi-partisan effort, and reflected the way things should work in Congress: Senators from both sides of the aisle working together, finding accommodation, and taking action.
   "While the bill is not perfect, it will take important steps to change the way people lobby Congress and the way Senators conduct their work."
