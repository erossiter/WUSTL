SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  Today, United States Senator Salazar released the following statement regarding President Bush's veto of the State Children's Health Insurance Program: 
   "I am extremely disappointed that President Bush vetoed the strong, bipartisan and fiscally responsible package we sent to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. With the stroke of his pen, President Bush is denying coverage to over 100,000 Colorado children and nearly 10 million children Nationwide. It is reprehensible that he has chosen against investing in the health and well being of our Nation's children which is our moral and economic obligation."
