U.S. BEEF CONFIRMED AS SAFE; BEEF MARKETS IN KOREA, JAPAN, ELSEWHERE EXPECTED TO OPEN SHORTLY
  In a unanimous ruling earlier today, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) announced it had granted U.S. beef "controlled risk" status for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). With this status change, U.S. ranchers are poised to regain access to a number of partially-closed foreign beef markets, including Korea, Japan, China, and Russia. 
   "Today's unanimous decision by OIE confirms what Americans have known all along - that American beef is the safest in the world. This is an important step forward for ranchers in Colorado and across America, and now the finish line is in sight," Senator Salazar. "I expect the markets of Korea, Japan, China, Russia and other nations with bans in place to recognize international science and immediately and fully lift their bans on imports of U.S. beef."
   The "controlled risk" status for U.S. beef recognizes that science-based mitigation measures are in place to effectively manage any possible risk of BSE in the cattle population. This classification means that international scientific guidelines confirm the safety of U.S. beef products from cattle of all ages, including boneless, bone-in, and offals.
   Several countries have imposed at least partial bans on U.S. beef imports, including Korea, Japan, China, and Russia.
