SEN. SALAZAR INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PRESERVE FAMILY HOME
  Sen. Ken Salazar yesterday introduced legislation (S. 584) to save 83-year-old Betty Dick from eviction from her home in Rocky Mountain National Park. Mrs.  
 Dick has a lease with the National Park Service that is set to expire in July of this year that the Park Service has not extended. 
   Under a 1980 settlement agreement with the National Park Service, Fred Dick and his wife Betty were allowed to lease and occupy their property for 25 years. Fred Dick passed away in 1992 but Betty remains at the property. That lease with the Park Service expires in July. This legislation would allow her to live on the property her remaining years. 
   "Evicting an 83-year-old woman from her family home sets a bad precedent," said Salazar. "This legislation keeps her where she would like to spend the rest of her life - at home." Mrs. Dick has been a good citizen and has been happy to share her family's beautiful cabin for civic events, and she has been a good neighbor to the National Park. The bill would require the Secretary of the Interior, as head of the National Park Service, to enter into an agreement that will allow Betty Dick to continue to occupy her family cabin and property within Rocky Mountain National Park.
