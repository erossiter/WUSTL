SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE RESOURCES COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF BETTY DICK BILL
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after the House Committee on Resources unanimously approved S.584 earlier today: 
   "The approval of this legislation by the House Committee on Resources brings Congress one step closer to resolving this dispute.
   "The Committee's unanimous approval today sends a strong bipartisan message that Mrs. Betty Dick should be allowed to remain in her family home in Rocky Mountain National Park.
   "I am hopeful that the whole House of Representatives will follow the wisdom of their colleagues on the Resources Committee and pass this important bill."
   Mrs. Betty Dick is the 83-year-old owner of a family home in Rocky Mountain National Park. Under a 1980 settlement agreement with the National Park Service, Fred Dick and his wife Betty were allowed to occupy their family home on its existing property for 25 years. Fred Dick passed away in 1992 but Betty remains at the property. That arrangement with the Park Service expired in July of last year. Senator Salazar's Betty Dick Residence Protection Act, S.584, would allow her to live on the property for her remaining years.
   The next step for Senator Salazar's legislation will be approval by the entire House of Representatives. If passed unchanged, it would then go to the President's desk for signature or veto.
