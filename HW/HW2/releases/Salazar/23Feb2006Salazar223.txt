SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS NEXT STEP IN BUILDING NEW VA HOSPITAL
  Sen. Ken Salazar applauded the agreement reached today between the Veterans Administration and the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority on a purchase price for land to build a new Veterans hospital at Fitzsimons. 
   "I am very pleased with today's announced purchase price agreement for land on the Fitzsimons campus," said Salazar. "This is a very significant step forward and puts us closer to our ultimate goal: a new, state-of-the-art Veterans' hospital at Fitzsimons.
   "It goes without saying that there is still a long way to go, and that this goal can only be continued with our collective and cooperative efforts. Our veterans deserve nothing less than for this Nation to keep its promises to them. I am confident we will succeed."
