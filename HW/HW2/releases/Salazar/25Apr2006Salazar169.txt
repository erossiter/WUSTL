SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEETING WITH BUSH ON IMMIGRATION
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement: 
   "A bipartisan group of 17 senators, including Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid, met with President Bush for over an hour to discuss immigration reform. The President asked that we pass comprehensive immigration reform before Memorial Day. The President also stated his support for legislation that would: Strengthen border security; provide for the enforcement of our immigration laws; and create a guest worker program that would address the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States.
   "I am hopeful that the President maintains a high degree of involvement in the coming weeks so that we can succeed in passing a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill."
