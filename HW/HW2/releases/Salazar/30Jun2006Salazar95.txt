  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on China's announcement today of a limited market opening that includes U.S. boneless beef under 30 months of age. 
   "I am encouraged by China's decision today to open its markets to U.S. boneless beef under the age of 30 months - it is a step in the right direction," said United States Senator Ken Salazar. "I am confident that our U.S. ranchers and producers abide by the highest food safety standards and produce the highest quality beef in the world. Their hard work and dedication to safety and quality is second to none. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to fully open China's markets - as well as other international markets - to our beef."
