SEN. SALAZAR: PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER GOVERNMENT OPERATING EFFICIENCY
  Sen. Salazar urged the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to prioritize the public interest and public health and safety over competitive bidding in research and testing of our Nation's water supply quality. Sen. Salazar opposes USGS and OMB's intention to competitively bid research and testing performed by the National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) in Lakewood, Colorado.  
   Senator Salazar's letter urging USGS and OMB to reconsider their decision is available at http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/060918_OMB.pdf.
