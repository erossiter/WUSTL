SEN. SALAZAR JOINS BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS TO INTRODUCE MEASURE TO AID U.S. WORKERS IMPACTED BY OUTSOURCING
  Today, in an effort to soften the impact of outsourcing and offshoring on workers in the United States as a result of globalization, United States Senator Ken Salazar joined a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to introduce the Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2007. 
   The bill would reauthorize all existing Trade Adjustment Assistance programs through 2012. For the first time, the bill would extend aid to service workers who lose their jobs as a result of offshoring to countries like China and India. It would also provide critical assistance to rural and distressed communities, and make training, healthcare and wage insurance more accessible and flexible.
   "While globalization is inevitable, leaving American workers and businesses behind is not an option," said Senator Salazar. "Coloradans have felt the impact of globalization first-hand. But as we work to secure the economic benefits of free trade, we must also recognize that American jobs and workers come first. This bill will go a long way toward ensuring that U.S. workers who are negatively impacted by the global economy receive the assistance and training they need to remain competitive."
   Key pieces of the bill include a $300 million authorization for trade adjustment assistance to communities adversely impacted by trade. Both economic development and strategic planning grants are made available, with preference given to rural communities. In addition to extending coverage to the service sector, which comprises 27% of Colorado's economy, the bill also strengthens the existing safety net for dislocated workers by increasing the Health Care Tax Credit program for those who have lost their employer-sponsored coverage.
