SEN. SALAZAR WORKS TO SECURE CRITICAL PROJECTS FOR COLORADO'S MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN SENATE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Today, the Senate began consideration of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 3222) which provides $459.3 billion to fund the Department of Defense. United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that key Colorado military installations will receive over $167 million under the bill. Senator Salazar was successful in securing $142.2 million to accelerate weapons destruction at the Pueblo Chemical Depot with the goal of meeting the congressionally ratified treaty deadline of 2012 for chemical demilitarization activities. This funding will supplement $35.2 million that Senator Salazar successfully fought to include in the Senate-passed FY 2008 Military Construction-Veterans' Affairs Appropriations Act on this same issue.
   In addition, Senator Salazar succeeded in including language in the bill to require the Department of Defense to complete chemical weapons destruction activities by 2017 if it fails to meet the treaty deadline of 2012.
   "Colorado is proud to house some of our Nation's top military installations and defense related businesses," said Senator Salazar. "I will continue to fight for the Colorado provisions in this bill as they will have long-lasting impact on the military installations in Colorado and ultimately, the safety and security of our Nation." 
   Included below is a summary of the other projects, grouped by region, Senator Salazar requested in the Defense Appropriations Act of 2008. This list will be updated as the bill progresses through the Senate this week:
   Pikes Peak Region
   * $4 million for Upgrades to Data Networks at Cheyenne Mountain and USNORTHCOM: Funding will help upgrade NORTHCOM's data network at the Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, to ensure that its facilities remain redundant with those in the joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base. In case of a network failure at NORTHCOM's headquarters at Peterson, the upgraded data system in Cheyenne Mountain will allow swift recovery of the network. Funding will also be used on equipment which enables federal, state, and local governments and agencies to coordinate and share information in the event of an emergency or natural disaster. 
   * $2 million for Security Upgrades at Schriever Air Force Base: Funding will upgrade an aging and increasingly inefficient electronic security system protecting space platforms at Schriever. This upgrade is needed because the current system has been in place for eighteen years, despite the fact that it only has an eight year life cycle. The upgrade will enhance the system's effectiveness and its ability to deter and detect an intruder. 
   * $500,000 for the Center for Space and Defense Studies at the United States Air Force Academy: Funding will be applied to support space and defense studies at the Air Force Academy. Specifically, funds will be used to enhance the academy's curriculum in space studies, foster intellectual development on contemporary issues of space policy study, and promote cadet and faculty research, internships, and scholarships. The programs supported will increase the number of future Air Force officers with an understanding of the importance of space for the national and economic security of the nation. 
   * $4 million for a Naval Postgraduate School Ph.D. Program in Homeland Defense at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs: In partnership with the Naval Postgraduate School and USNORTHCOM, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is establishing the nation's first mission-focused, operationally-responsive, and federally-funded Ph.D. program in Homeland Defense. These students will be trained to conduct both basic and applied research on homeland defense and security. Funding will allow three cohorts of 10-15 students (military personnel) each to complete the three year program. It will also allow for the hiring of tenure-track faculty and the construction of "smart classrooms" to support the program. 
   * $2 million for STEM Curriculum Development at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, to Expand the Pipeline of Engineers: The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) is working with the national Space Education Consortium to develop a replicable curriculum and program to expand K-12 students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The Partnership in Innovative Preparation for Educators and Students (PIPES) program is designed, through a system of tracks designed for students, teachers, administrators, and STEM experts, to expose students to the possibilities of careers in science, space, and security industries, and the post-secondary education these careers require.
   North Central Region
   * $2 million for the Department of Defense's Center for Geosciences/Atmospheric Research at Colorado State University: Funding will allow for ongoing research into environmental conditions that affect military, counter-terror, humanitarian, peacekeeping, and training operations. This research is important to ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of special operations in theater. The DOD Center for Geosciences/Atmospheric Research at Colorado State University provides research on priority environmental problems and questions of concern to the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force. Currently, researchers are studying ways to forecast floods in northern Iraq, detect caves in Afghanistan, predict clouds and icing that impede use of manned and unmanned aircraft, and better understand environmental conditions in complex urban areas. 
   Denver Metro Region
   * $2 million for Respiratory Biodefense Research at National Jewish Medical and Research Center: Funds will allow for continued research into preventing and treating respiratory injuries from bioterrorism. National Jewish is studying the mechanisms of injury to develop effective means of detection, prevention and therapy. The initiative is studying threats posed by anthrax, influenza, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and SARS. 
   * $2 million for a Micro Satellite Target System for the Air Force (MicroSat Systems, Inc., Littleton, CO): The Missile Defense Agency is developing a network of ground radar systems as part of the Ballistic Missile Defense System that can search for, acquire, and identify missile threats. These ground-based radar systems require frequent testing and calibration to ensure they are performing adequately. The Micro satellite Target System (MTS) program is developing a low-cost micro satellite that can be placed in orbit to support radar calibration and testing. The MTS acts as a simulated re-entry vehicle, flying in an orbit that emulates threat trajectories. The first MTS is currently being built and will be ready for integration and testing in May 2008. Funds will be used to complete the satellite and perform tests required to launch it in late 2008/early 2009. 
   * $2 million for Environmental Sensors for Special Forces (ATA Technologies, Littleton, CO): The United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has a need for small, lightweight and easily-deployable sensors that can measure weather conditions and a variety of other environmental and situational parameters. These sensors are useful to Special Forces personnel on both the ground and in the air. The SOCOM METOC Program has developed and is currently using a system that is deployed by hand, requiring personnel to physically go to the desired location to set up the sensors. The program plan calls for the development of an air-droppable version of the system, which allows the sensors to be deployed by releasing them from a helicopter or plane. The funding will allow the completion of development of this air-droppable version of the system so that it will be ready for operation in 2010. 
   West Slope
   * $5 million for Modular Ballistic Panels to Better Protect Soldiers from Mortar Attacks (Polystrand, Inc., Montrose, CO): The University of Maine has helped develop modular ballistic panels that are ready for pilot manufacturing and demonstration to the U.S. Army. The panels would be used in tents in mobile forward operating bases to provide additional protection against mortar attacks. Funding would allow for initial purchase, production, and demonstration of the panels to be manufactured in Montrose. Prototype panels are already in theater with the National Guard. 
   Non-Regional Initiatives:
   * $50 million to Curb Encroachment Around Military Bases: The Readiness and Environmental Protection Initiative (REPI) allows the Department of Defense to work with government and private partners to establish buffer zones to protect military training and testing areas. The program has been successful in addressing encroachment issues at Fort Carson.
