SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S VA SECRETARY NOMINATION
  Today United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after President Bush nominated retired Army General James Peake for Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
   "I am pleased that President Bush has sent us a nomination to fill the position of Secretary of Veterans Affairs. This is a critical position that requires effective leadership to ensure that we fulfill our duty to those who have served our great Nation. If confirmed, General Peake will have many challenges and responsibilities ahead. From protecting their personal information to addressing the newer injuries like Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the Department of Veterans' Affairs has an obligation to give our servicemen and women the treatment and care that they have earned. I look forward to learning more about General Peake's experience and qualifications through the nomination process in the coming weeks."
