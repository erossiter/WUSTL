SEN. SALAZAR: TODAY'S FOUNTAIN CREEK FORUM A GOOD FIRST STEP
 Today, El Paso County and the City of Pueblo co-hosted the Fountain Creek Forum on the future of Fountain Creek. The forum focused on how to move forward to develop a positive vision for Fountain Creek including its clean-up, improving water quality and creating recreational opportunities along its stretch. Senator Salazar's Pikes Peak regional staffer Richard Skorman attended the forum. Senator Salazar's statement on the results of the meeting is included below: 
   "I am pleased that a Fountain Creek taskforce has been formed to figure out the next steps in the process to develop a better future for Fountain Creek and the communities surrounding it. I am also proud that Richard Skorman, a member of my staff, was named to the taskforce. Richard has worked countless hours already on issues surrounding Fountain Creek, including helping me create the Fountain Creek Crown Jewel Vision. Today's actions indicate there is general region-wide desire to clean-up and protect Fountain Creek for all the communities involved - that is a good first step. I look forward to the first meeting of the Fountain Creek taskforce and steps beyond."
