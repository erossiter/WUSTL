SEN. SALAZAR INTRODUCES BILL TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR STATE, LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS
  Sen. Ken Salazar has introduced the Homeland Security Information Guidance and Training Act of 2005, S.888, to improve and clarify standards for access to homeland security intelligence, training curriculum and grants information for state and local law enforcement and first responder officials.  
   The Homeland Security Information Guidance and Training Act of 2005 would focus on three specific areas for reform in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the actions of state and local law enforcement and first responders: 
   * Best practices: Senator Salazar's homeland security reform legislation directs the DHS' Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) to establish more detailed best practices for state and local governments to help them determine what homeland security information should be made public, what should remain classified, and how different government entities and emergency personnel can share and use sensitive information. 
   * Training: Senator Salazar's homeland security reform legislation directs the DHS's Office of Domestic Preparedness to establish a training curriculum based on the best practices established by IAIP and to offer this training to state and local officials. 
   * Grant Information: Senator Salazar's homeland security reform legislation directs DHS to provide more detailed instructions to state and local officials about how to manage information about homeland security grants that are applied for and awarded by DHS. 
   "I have already heard from over 40 of Colorado's police, fire and emergency medical departments who feel largely unprepared for a major terrorist incident and frustrated by inconsistent direction from the federal government," said Salazar. "This legislation will help get them the information they need to safely handle any situation, the training they need to protect the public and the access to grants to purchase the proper tools to do their jobs." 
   Earlier this week Senator Salazar released preliminary results of a survey to Colorado's police, fire, and medical workers as well as state and regional emergency planners around Colorado. The survey asked them to share their experiences and concerns about homeland security issues with him. So far Salazar's office has received results from over 40 officials from all corners of the state. Colorado's emergency officials reported a variety of concerns: More than 70 percent face significant problems using their radio equipment to communicate with other agencies. Five out of six responders believe federal grants are not going to the right priorities. By a four-to-one margin, officials feel unprepared to handle a weapon of mass destruction attack. By a two-to one margin, responders feel that antiterrorism information they receive from the federal government is insufficient or not actionable. 
   Nearly all departments have joined forces with other regional departments to share emergency personnel, training and equipment, but they report mixed results. Emergency medical responders are largely out of the loop for homeland security funding and antiterrorism information. State and local emergency officials represent more than 95 percent of America's counterterrorism capability but are not getting critical help they need in several key areas.
