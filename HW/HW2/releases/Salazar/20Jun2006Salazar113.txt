SEN. SALAZAR RESPONDS TO HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP'S DELAY TACTICS ON ENACTING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement today in response to the House Republican Leadership's plan to delay enacting comprehensive immigration reform. 
   "Today's action by the House Republican Leadership is nothing more than a political ploy. Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have already stated a willingness to enact comprehensive immigration reform, but now the House Republican Leadership is holding that reform hostage in order to score political points for the November 2006 elections. It is unfortunate that some will sacrifice our national security in their selfish quest for political power."
