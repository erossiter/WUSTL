SEN. SALAZAR URGES PRESIDENT BUSH TO RECONSIDER VETO THREAT ON HOMELAND SECURITY BILL; PRAISES COMPROMISE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS
  As the Senate debates the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill taking steps to better secure our borders, our ports and provide much needed funding to our local communities and first responders, United States Ken Salazar issued the following statement regarding the bill and the compromise that will implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations: 
   On Homeland Security Appropriations: "Recent news about prospective terrorist attacks on our own soil have underscored the importance of investing in a strong plan for securing our homeland. We are providing critical funds to ensure that our borders, ports and local communities are secure to prevent terrorist attacks, but also provide much needed funding for first responders to do their jobs in the event of such an attack.
   "I am very discouraged by the President's statement today threatening to veto this bill. I urge the President to reconsider as his veto threat is obstructing our ability to achieve our Nation's homeland security."
   On Compromise on Implementation of 9/11 Commission Recommendations: "In 2005 our Nation received failing grades from the 9/11 Commission regarding first responder communications, information sharing and the security of weapons of mass destruction. Now, nearly six years after 9/11, we are still woefully under prepared for a major catastrophe or terrorist attack. I have long advocated for us to implement the Commission's recommendations and I am glad we have finally begun the process to implement them.
   The Homeland Security Appropriations bill funds border security ($10.2 billion), FEMA ($6.9 billion), aviation security (nearly $530 million), port security ($400 million) and mass transit security ($400 million), while also rejecting cuts in first-responder grants.
