SEN. SALAZAR HOLDS GROUND ON BETTER BLM/INTERIOR COOPERATION
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar continued his fight for a more cooperative working relationship between the State of Colorado, the BLM and the Interior Department concerning oil shale and oil and gas development in Colorado. In a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, Senator Salazar reiterated the utmost importance of the need for a constructive working relationship between the BLM and the State of Colorado given the fact that the BLM owns 27.1 million subsurface acres and 8.4 million surface acres in Colorado. Senator Salazar's letter to Secretary Kempthorne is in response to a letter he received yesterday responding to his original request concerning the need for additional time to review drilling plans on the Roan Plateau and proposed commercial development of oil shale. Senator Salazar informed Secretary Kempthorne that he was dissatisfied with the Secretary's response and asked the Secretary to address: 
   * His request for a 120-day extension of time for the State of Colorado to review and comment on the Resource Management Plan (RMP) for the Roan Plateau; 
   * His request that the BLM refrain from proposing any new leasing within the Roan Plateau Planning Area (RPPA) until the State of Colorado has had a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the RMP, and the BLM and the Department have answered critical questions raised by the State of Colorado, including development on top of the Roan, revenue sharing under the Transfer Act and the cleanup of Anvil Points; and 
   * His request that the Department reconfirm that the State of Colorado will be granted an appropriate amount of time, as reasonably requested by the State, to review and comment on the draft Oil Shale and Tar Sands Program Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). 
   In the letter, Senator Salazar informed Secretary Kempthorne that he will not consent to further action by the Senate on President Bush's nominee, James Caswell, until he receives a commitment that the BLM will delay issuance of any leases on and around the Roan Plateau and until the State of Colorado has had sufficient time to consider the Agency's proposed plans with respect to oil and gas drilling on the plateau.
   In his letter to Secretary Kempthorne, Senator Salazar wrote, "I remain hopeful that we can quickly resolve these management decisions so that Mr. Caswell can move expeditiously to a confirmation vote. However, these issues are of utmost importance to the future of Colorado, and I must insist on greater clarity with respect to how we move forward on the Roan Plateau and commercial oil shale development. Therefore, until I receive those assurances from you, as Secretary of Interior, I will withhold my consent to Mr. Caswell's nomination."
