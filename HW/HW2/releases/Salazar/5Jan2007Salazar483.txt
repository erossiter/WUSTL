SEN. SALAZAR INTRODUCES BILL ADDING C?SAR CH?VEZ'S NAME TO VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Sen. Ken Salazar introduced a bill late yesterday to add César Ch?vez's name to the title of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Famed civil rights leader César Ch?vez spent his life's work fighting for the rights of America's poor and vulnerable through the power of democracy. The bill is S. 188. 
   Last year, at the request of Senator Salazar, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced an amendment in the Senate Judiciary Committee which added Chavez' name to the Senate's bill. The Committee reported out the "Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and César E. Ch?vez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006," but ultimately the House version of the bill was approved by the full Senate and did not include Ch?vez's name. Given the historic and future impact of the civil rights law on the Latino community, incorporating Ch?vez is critical. 
   "César Ch?vez believed strongly in the democracy of America and saw the right to vote as a cornerstone of our freedom," said Senator Salazar. "He is an American hero and his contributions to our democracy are undeniable. It is fitting that his name be a part of the process of reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act." 
   Senator Salazar proudly cast his vote last year to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and spoke on the floor in support of the measure. The complete text of Senator Salazar's floor speech, as prepared, can be accessed at http://www.salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/060720VRAfs.pdf.
