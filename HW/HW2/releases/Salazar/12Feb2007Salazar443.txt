SEN. SALAZAR 'EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED' IN USDA FAILURE TO MAKE DISASTER DECLARATION FOR SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO BLIZZARD VICTIMS
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement after the USDA announced it would not make disaster declarations for Baca, Bent, Cheyenne, Crowley, Huerfano, Kiowa, Las Animas, Lincoln, Otero and Prowers counties for losses suffered as a result of December and January blizzards: 
   "I am extremely disappointed in the USDA's short-sighted decision to not provide a disaster declaration for southeastern Colorado counties hit hard by recent blizzards.
   "I am sure that the ranchers in southeastern Colorado who have lost about 10,000 cattle from these storms would agree that these storms have resulted in production losses that could affect their futures at a fundamental level.
   "With the USDA failing farmers and ranchers in Colorado, it is now more important than ever for Congress to fight on their behalf. The bipartisan disaster relief bill I am cosponsoring will provide direct emergency disaster relief for losses due to ongoing natural disasters such as these blizzards.
   "Washington cannot afford to continue to fail Colorado's farmers and ranchers. This is a crisis that demands immediate action."
