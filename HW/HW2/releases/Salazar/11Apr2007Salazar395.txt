SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS STEM CELL VOTE IN SENATE
  Today, Republican and Democratic Senators passed legislation to expand stem cell research, which could find cures for diseases that afflict millions of Americans, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Sen. Ken Salazar voted for this legislation and stem cell research, and afterwards released the following statement: 
   "I am pleased to have joined the Senate today in a bipartisan vote to allow federal funding for expanded stem cell research.
   "My family's experience with my father's battle with Alzheimer's disease strengthened my conviction that we should do everything we can within ethical bounds to cure this and other debilitating diseases.
   "The bill passed by the Senate today provides hope for millions of Americans. It provides access, with guidelines, to new stem cell lines, to ensure that our scientists have every opportunity for medical advances while avoiding ethical challenges that have previously kept many from withholding support for stem cell research.
   "This bill also enjoys broad scientific support from hundreds of expert medical groups, including medical facilities like the Mayo Clinic and National Jewish Medical Center in Denver, medical organizations like the Colorado Bioscience Association and the American Medical Association, and research institutions like the University of Colorado.
   "I respect that the President has a differing view on this challenging subject. But with such overwhelming support from the public, the scientific community and the medical community, I urge him to sign this legislation into law. Holding up this research is holding up hope."
