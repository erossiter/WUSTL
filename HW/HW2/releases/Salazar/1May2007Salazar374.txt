SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S IRAQ VETO ANNOUNCEMENT
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after the President's announcement earlier this evening that he had vetoed the Emergency Supplemental appropriations bill: 
   "I am disappointed the President vetoed the bill.
   "This legislation supported our troops, our veterans and their families, and sent a direct message to the Iraqis that our military commitment is not open-ended. It launched a new diplomatic, economic and political offensive while taking real steps to rebuild our overburdened military.
   "This bill also provided desperately-needed emergency relief for our farmers and ranchers suffering from years of sever drought and, more recently, devastating blizzards. It also provided funds for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to rebuild their homes, communities and livelihoods.
   "The most important charge we have is to continue to seek a new way forward in Iraq, one that seeks input from both Democrats and Republicans as the Iraq Study Group did in developing its report released last year. I believe that the Iraq Study Group's recommendations can and should be our blueprint for a compromise that could gain broad support here in the Senate."
