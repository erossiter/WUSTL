SEN. SALAZAR TELLS CONGRESS TO 'GET REAL' ON ENERGY INITIATIVES
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar joined a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce two bills aimed at addressing America's energy crisis with practical, long term solutions, not political pandering. 
   "Washington has chosen to ignore this issue for the entire year," Sen. Salazar said. "It is time for Congress to get real and realize that we have to commit ourselves to a long term strategy to reduce our dependence on oil - especially foreign oil - by increasing our energy efficiency and by developing alternative fuels that we can produce here at home, including ethanol and bio-diesel. To come together in the bipartisan way we have today will hopefully push the Senate into enacting real solutions to help us achieve our energy independence."
   The bipartisan group, including Senators Salazar, Bingaman (D-NM), Chafee (R-RI), Lieberman (D-CT), Coleman (R-MN) and Cantwell (D-WA), introduced two bills, the Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006 and an Energy Tax bill.
   The "Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006" will push the federal government to save 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2016 and at least 10 million barrels per day by 2031. The bill also includes provisions to:
   * Push federal and state vehicle fleets to reduce petroleum consumption by 30 percent 
   * Authorize a program to conduct R&D for electric drive transportation options 
   * Increase the funds available for production incentives of cellulosic biomass fuel 
   *Provide loan guarantees for the manufacture of fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles 
   * Establish disaster loans to small businesses harmed by the increases in the prices of heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, propane and kerosene 
   The Energy Tax bill provides multiple incentives to manufacturers, businesses and consumers to utilize energy efficient alternatives. The bill includes provisions to: 
   * Add tax credits for consumers and manufacturers of hybrids and other advanced vehicles 
   * Expand tax credits for alternative fueling station infrastructure 
   * Extend the current tax credits through 2010 for: The creation of electricity from alternative sources; the use of solar energy; the issuance of clean energy renewable bonds; businesses to install fuel cells and micro-turbines 
   * Extend the current enhanced deduction for energy efficient buildings through 2010 
   * Create a tax credit for the purchase of energy efficient appliances 
   "If we had remained focused on energy independence since the Arab Oil Embargo, more than 30 years ago, we would not be caught in this crisis today," Salazar added. "Unless we develop and stick to the cause of energy independence, we will continue to place our national security in jeopardy and suffer from current price peaks to a greater and greater extent, more and more frequently, over the next 30 years. It is time for Congress to get real and get to work."
