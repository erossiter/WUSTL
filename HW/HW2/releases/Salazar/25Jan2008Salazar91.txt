SEN. SALAZAR COMMITS TO REMAIN VIGILANT & ENSURE EPA PROTECTS WATER RESOURCES & HEALTH OF NORTHERN COLORADO
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in response to a letter he received from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) addressing concerns he aired late last year on the environmental risks posed by injection mining at a proposed uranium mining project in Weld County, Colorado. 
   "It is the Environmental Protection Agency's duty to protect the public's water resources and environment, but in the end it is northern Colorado's water, air, public health and livelihoods that are at stake," said Senator Salazar. "I will continue to be vigilant and keep a watchful eye on the EPA to ensure that it lives-up to its commitment to me that it will 'remain diligent in its responsibilities' related to these permitting processes."
