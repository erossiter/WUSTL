SEN. SALAZAR FIGHTS FOR IMPORTANT WATER PROJECTS FOR COLORADO
  This week, the Senate began consideration of the Water Resources and Development Act of 2007 (WRDA), which authorizes federal spending on water development, infrastructure, flood control and other projects conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Contained in this year's WRDA is funding authorization for several projects in Colorado, including an authorization for construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, all included at the request of Sen. Ken Salazar. 
   "In the West, we all understand how important water is to our lives, businesses and communities," said Senator Salazar.
   The WRDA includes funding authorization for six water projects around Colorado, including two projects critical to southern Colorado:
   * $10 Million for Ark Valley Conduit: WRDA includes a $10 million authorization for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in Southeastern Colorado. The construction of this conduit will fulfill a long-standing promise to the people of the lower Arkansas Valley for fresh drinking water and is the keystone for the economic revitalization of Southeastern Colorado; and
   * Instructions to Speed Up Completion of the Fountain Creek Watershed Study: WRDA includes specific instructions to the Secretary of the Army to speed up completion of the Fountain Creek Watershed Study, the first step towards the clean-up and protection of Fountain Creek for all the communities. The importance of this study was underscored earlier this week when the Creek flooded parts of Pueblo along Dillon Drive, damaging several homes and businesses.

   "Protecting and delivering clean water for communities and farmers in southeastern Colorado is critical to its future economic vitality," said Senator Salazar.
   The WRDA also includes funding authorization for two projects critical to Denver and Boulder Metro Area:
   * $10 Million for the Boulder County Pipeline: WRDA includes a $10 million authorization for construction of a water pipeline, which will protect drinking water quality and allow for year-round water delivery from Carter Lake to Boulder and other municipal area water providers; and
   * $13.7 Million for Restoration of the South Platte: WRDA includes a $13.7 million authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct ecosystem restoration work along the South Platte River in Denver, to be matched by more than $7 million in non-Federal funds.
   "As our state continues to attempt to balance growth with conservation of our natural resources, we must make sure that our water-transporting capabilities are updated and improved," said Senator Salazar.
   In addition, the WRDA includes:
   * $25 million for the Rio Grande Environmental Management Program in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, which provides for the ongoing restoration and management of the Rio Grande, which is headwatered in Colorado, and its tributaries such as the Alamosa and Conejos Rivers; and
   * $5 Million Authorization for a Statewide Selenium Study: WRDA includes a $5 million authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct regional and watershed-wide studies to address selenium concentrations in Colorado, which in high doses can be fatal to humans, livestock and wildlife.
   The Senate is expected to pass WRDA early next week.
