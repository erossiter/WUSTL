SEN. SALAZAR SAYS RIPPLE EFFECT OF SWIFT ARRESTS CALLS ATTENTION TO HUMAN SIDE OF ENFORCING IMMIGRATION LAWS
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding yesterdays Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid on Swift Company plants. 
   "Yesterday's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, raid on Swift Company plants across the Nation underscored the need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. We can not forget that those arrested broke the law - but the ripple effect of the detention and arrest of hundreds of workers at these plants calls attention to the human side of the enforcement of our immigration laws and the impact it has on our local communities and businesses.
   "At the same time, the identities of many of American citizens have been stolen creating untold financial burdens for innocent people. ICE officials are continuing to investigate the source of the stolen IDs - we should bring all those involved in this fraud to justice.
   "We must have the will to pass comprehensive immigration reform that addresses this ripple effect including a guest worker program to reduce identity theft, a sound employer verification system and a family reunification program to minimize the pain of separation.
   "I will continue to do everything I can to motivate Congress to act quickly, decisively and comprehensively on immigration reform."
