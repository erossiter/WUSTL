SEN. SALAZAR RECEIVES AWARD FROM NATIONAL RECREATION AND PARKS ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Ken Salazar was awarded the National Recreation and Park Association's (NRPA) Congressional Award today for his work on the Land and Water Conservation Fund State Assistance Program (LWCF). 
   "For many years, I have fought to protect our land and water resources," Senator Salazar said. "The nation's parks - especially ours in Colorado - are a treasure we must work to maintain. I am proud of this award and I look forward to continuing to fight for this program."
   The LWCF was created in 1965 and assists communities in developing parks and recreation resources for its citizens. Since its inception, nearly 1,000 grants totaling more than $58 million have funded local government and state parks in Colorado. In his 2006 budget, President Bush allotted no funds to LWCF. Senator Salazar successfully led the Senate to protect this important source of funding in an amendment to the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2005.
   Founded in 1965, The National Recreation and Park Association is an organization of citizens and professionals working to extend the social, health, cultural, and natural resource-based benefits of parks and recreation.
