$67 MILLION IN FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS IN COLORADO ANNOUNCED BY SEN. SALAZAR
  $67 million in federal water funds may soon be flowing into Colorado as part of the Energy and Water Appropriations conference report expected to be approved by Congress and signed by the President in the near future. Sen. Ken Salazar successfully fought for over $67 million in federal funds for 17 projects under the Energy and Water Appropriations bill conference report. 
   "In the West, and especially in Colorado, water is central to our way of life. These federal funds will ensure that Coloradans are able to maintain, preserve and enjoy their water resources to the best of our abilities," said Senator Salazar.
   Overall, Senator Salazar was able to include over $58 million in funding for Western Slope water projects, over $2.6 million for projects in the Arkansas River Valley and over $4 million for projects in the Denver metro area. These projects include:
   * $56M for the Animas-La Plata Project to fund continued construction activities on the Durango pumping plant and the dam located in Ridges Basin, the lynchpin of the 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement. This is $4 million more than the request submitted by President Bush earlier this year; 
   * $125K for study of the Fountain Creek Watershed in El Paso County; 
   * $2.6M for the John Martin Reservoir for routing operations and maintenance of this 2.6-miles-long concrete and earthfill structure in Bent County that controls flood waters from an 18,130 square mile drainage area; 
   * $4M for Chatfield Lake and Cherry Creek Lake for continued renovation and construction work; 
   * $1.5M for Trinidad Lake for continued renovation and construction work; and 
   * $400K for Tamarisk eradication by the across the state of Colorado at a variety of identified locations including the Colorado River, Arkansas River, and the Dolores River.
