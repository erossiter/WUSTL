SEN. SALAZAR: IN JAPAN TONIGHT, U.S. BEEF, IT'S WHAT'S FOR DINNER!!!
  In response to this morning's announcement by the Japanese government that it would reopen its market to U.S. beef imports, Sen.  
 Ken Salazar released the following statement:
   "I am very pleased that the Japanese government acknowledged what we have known all along: that U.S. beef is the best, and safest, in the world.
   "This is a victory for American ranchers who have been unjustly shut out of this market for far too long. While American ranchers can never recoup the $3 billion lost to them during the two years of Japan's boycott on U.S. beef, they will no longer be stuck on the outside looking in.
   "I will remain watchful of the practices of the Japanese government on this issue. If I feel they are not truly re-opening their markets, I will have no hesitation about pushing forward once again with any and all tools at my disposal to ensure real access to their markets for our beef producers."
