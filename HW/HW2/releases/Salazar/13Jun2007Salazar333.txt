SENS. ALLARD, SALAZAR RECOGNIZE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO'S CROSS COUNTRY NATIONAL TRIUMPH
  Last night, the United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution introduced by Sen. Wayne Allard and co-sponsored by Sen. Ken Salazar congratulating the University of Colorado at Boulder men's cross country team for winning the 2006 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's Cross Country Championship. At the request of the White House, five of the seven athletes who participated in the national championship will travel to Washington, DC to meet President George W. Bush early next week. 
   "Anytime the President of the United States honors you at the White House, you have achieved something very special," said Allard. "The hard work and tenacity of these young men has brought great honor to Colorado."
   "Time and time again, the CU cross country team has demonstrated an extraordinary ability to rise above the competition, no matter what the stakes," said Senator Salazar. "With this National title triumph, these young men have made the CU-Boulder community and the great state of Colorado extremely proud."
   The Resolution sponsored by Senators Allard and Salazar resolves that the Senate congratulate the men's cross country team for their triumph, as well as recognize the achievement of all those who were instrumental in the Buffaloes' win at the 2006 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's Cross Country Championship.
   This is the second straight year the Buffs will be represented at the White House, with the CU ski team being the first team to receive this coveted honor after winning the 2006 NCAA Title in their respective sport. The University of Colorado at Boulder men's cross country win on November 20th represents the third National title in school history.
