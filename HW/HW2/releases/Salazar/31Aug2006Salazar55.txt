   Dear Mr. Dorsey and Dr. Keyes:
   Recent newspaper articles indicate that contract negotiations between HCA-HealthOne and United Healthcare may be reaching an impasse. For the health and well-being of nearly one million Colorado residents, I write to urge you to redouble your efforts to reach an agreement by September 1, 2006.
   The consequences of failing to reach a contractual agreement endangers the health of over 850,000 Coloradans insured by United Healthcare, who could potentially be left without health care providers. Because HCA-HealthOne co-owns and/or operates seven Denver metropolitan area hospitals and ten surgical centers, the prospect of securing another health care provider will be particularly difficult for residents of the Denver metropolitan area. Many will simply go without medical services. In addition, the failure to resolve this contract dispute may have a devastating impact on Colorado's health care delivery system, as non-HealthOne medical providers will have to accommodate the health care needs of the 850,000 Coloradans insured by United Healthcare.
   Because I know that the delivery of health care is your primary mission, and because of the far-reaching health consequences of not reaching a successful contractual agreement, I urge you to work diligently to resolve this matter. I stand ready to be of assistance, and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can help in any appropriate manner. 
   Sincerely,
   Ken Salazar
  United States Senator.
   Contact: Cody Wertz, 303/455-7600; Andrew Nannis, 202/224-5852.
