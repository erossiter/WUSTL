   "The Village at Wolf Creek has the potential to make a significant economic and environmental impact on southwestern Colorado. The proposed project warrants continued careful and thoughtful administrative action and public participation. I remain concerned about the size and scope of this project and I will intently monitor future developments.
   "I appreciate the USDA IG looking into the issues raised in my letter. I am always concerned when there are reports that suggest that there is improper lobbying and political pressure placed on agency employees.
   "The fact remains that Inspector General Fong's investigation should serve as a reminder to agency officials and to those doing business with Federal agencies that their dealings are always subject to public scrutiny and accountability."
