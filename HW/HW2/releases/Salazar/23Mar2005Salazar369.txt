SEN. SALAZAR 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' ON DOD DECISION ON PUEBLO CHEMICAL DEPOT
  Sen. Ken Salazar said he was "cautiously optimistic" over the Department of Defense's announcement today that it would re-start the process of cleaning up Pueblo Chemical Depot by moving forward with proposals for facility re-design and neutral construction work at the facility.  
 "The directive to revise the design, project milestones and cost targets is not surprising since this is the course DOD has indicated it wants to pursue. I am pleased the bulk of FY05 funds are being released. All in all, this seems like a positive step forward but the devil remains in the details," Sen. Salazar said. "I welcome this overdue step and pledge to work with Pueblo, my colleagues in Congress and DOD to get the destruction of the 780,000 chemical munitions done safely and soon." Under the decision signed by Acting Under Secretary Wynne, the Department of Defense will proceed with proposals for facility re-design work and neutral construction work for the Pueblo Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant (PCAPP). The $40 million in military construction funds for PCAPP appropriated for FY05 but currently unspent will be released for preliminary work. The Department of Defense decision comes after months of bi-partisan pressure from the Senate and Congress. Sen. Salazar and Sen. Wayne Allard wrote to Wynne requesting reconsideration of his decision to halt work on the PCAPP due to "limited financial resources." Rep. Salazar (CO-3) succeeded in bringing the Department of Defense to meet with Pueblo residents at a town hall meeting in February. Both Senators and the Congressman introduced legislation to limit the DOD's ability to transfer weapons across state lines.
