SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS HOUSE FOR PROTECTING RIO GRANDE RIVER, WATER RIGHTS FOR SAN LUIS VALLEY
  The Rio Grande Natural Area Act (S. 56) passed the House of Representatives yesterday and now awaits the President's signature before being enacted. Senator Salazar is an original co-sponsor of the bill sponsored by Sen. Allard. S.56 was one of the first bills Sen. Salazar co-sponsored after being sworn-in in January 2005. 
   "I am proud the Rio Grande Natural Area Act passed the House; this bill is part of my broad vision for protecting the San Luis Valley's land, water, heritage and way of life and fits together with my Sangre de Cristo Natural Heritage Area, which I hope we can pass as possible," said Senator Ken Salazar. "The Rio Grande river, as it flows through the San Luis Valley is a life-giving artery for the farms, ranches and wildlife that depend on its waters. This act, if signed by the President, will protect miles and miles of natural wildlife habitat and protect the water rights of Colorado users. I look forward to the President's signature to enact this designation."
   S. 56 establishes the "Rio Grande Natural Area" one quarter mile from both sides of the bank of the Rio Grande River from the Southern Boundary of the Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge to the New Mexico Border.
