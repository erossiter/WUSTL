SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON MAY DAY IMMIGRATION RALLIES
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding immigration rallies being held nationwide. 
   "Today, millions of people are demonstrating for comprehensive immigration reform. The Congress should act and complete its work on a new and effective immigration law for the 21st Century. We must do so for the good of America's national and economic security.
   "I would hope people could have demonstrated during their off hours, not during work and school hours. I believe it's important for all kids to stay in school and for workers to stay at their jobs."
