SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON GENERAL PETRAEUS TESTIMONY BEFORE CONGRESS
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding General David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker's testimony before Congress. 
   "Today, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker spoke of the success of the surge in Iraq that was implemented last year. While we have made some tactical military gains, they have not resulted in substantial political reconciliation. The short-term security provided by the surge is no substitute for a long-term strategy for success.
   "Thus far, the Iraqis have failed to meet most of the political benchmarks that are required to make real political progress. In the meantime, the war has cost us over 4,000 American lives and resulted in more than 30,000 Americans wounded. It costs the American taxpayers over $12 billion per month and jeopardizes the readiness of our military. And there is still no end in sight.
   "The men and women of our armed forces deserve a policy that is worthy of their bravery and their sacrifice. After more than five years of this conflict, it is time for us to hold the Iraqis accountable for their own future and to begin the responsible redeployment of our troops from Iraq so that we can rebuild our military and strengthen our strategic posture as we confront terrorist and extremist threats around the world."
