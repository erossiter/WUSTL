SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON COLORADO FIRES
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding recent fires in Colorado that have affected the communities of Carbondale and Ordway and the Fort Carson area. 
   "My heart goes out to the families and communities affected by the fires in Colorado. I am particularly saddened by the deaths of three firefighters who were putting their lives on the line to save others. They were selflessly battling blazes that were endangering life and property. Their loss is a terrible tragedy.
   "While the causes of the fires are still under investigation, the dangerously dry and windy conditions in certain parts of Colorado require that we take all appropriate precautions to contain the fires and prevent new ones from starting. I will continue to monitor the developments across the state, and I will reach out to local and state governments to help ensure that these communities have the resources they need to recover."
