SEN. SALAZAR VOTES AGAINST DIVISIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after voting against the motion to proceed on a Constitutional Amendment defining marriage.
   "I believe marriage should only be between one man and one woman. However, I oppose the Constitutional Amendment because the regulation of marriage should be left to the States. This proposed amendment is politics, pure and simple, and does nothing to strengthen our families or our homeland security, improve our energy security, relieve the health care crisis, or help educate one child."
