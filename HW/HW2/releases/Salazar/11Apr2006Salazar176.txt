SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS 'BIG WIN' FOR COLORADO'S LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY: CHINA AGREES TO REOPEN ITS MARKET TO U.S. BEEF EXPORTS
  Sen. Ken Salazar applauded the Chinese government for agreeing to reopen its market to U.S. beef exports. Today, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns and United States Trade Ambassador Rob Portman met with Vice Premier Wu Yi for the 17th annual senior-level meeting of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT). On Friday, Sen. Salazar along with Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS), and 19 of their colleagues, sent a letter to President Bush suggesting that this meeting would 'provide an ideal forum to address this issue.' 
   "This is a big win for the Colorado livestock industry. Reopening what was the seventh-largest export market in the world for U.S. beef will hold great potential as a market to build on. I applaud the Chinese Government for committing to address the enhancement of access of U.S. companies and farmers and ranchers to the Chinese market and for agreeing to open their market to U.S. beef exports."
