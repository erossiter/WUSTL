SEN. SALAZAR CONGRATULATES COLORADO RECIPIENTS OF DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR COOPERATIVE CONSERVATION AWARD
  United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement congratulating the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program, the San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program, the Milsap Mill Tailings Restoration Partnership and the Animas River Stakeholders Group for winning the Department of the Interior (DOI) Cooperative Conservation Award. 
   "Through collaborative partnerships that span ideology, industry and even state lines, these groups have helped further our efforts to protect Colorado's land, water and wildlife habitat. Their work is guided by the principle that we are members of our natural landscape - neighbors with a stake in the health of our surroundings. I thank them for their contributions to natural resource conservation, and congratulate them on this wonderful distinction."
