SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUTH TO VISIT SENATE
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced this year's United States Senate Youth Program, which provides young people from around the country an opportunity to visit the U.S. Senate and immerse themselves in how our Nation's government works.  
 This year's application process has just begun and Sen. Salazar encouraged all who qualify to take advantage of this program. The Senate Youth Program is sponsored by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.
   "The United States Senate Youth Program provides a unique opportunity for Colorado students to learn about the federal government from inside Washington, D.C. I strongly urge Colorado's young leaders to apply for this program," said Senator Salazar.
   The United States Senate Youth Program was founded in 1962 by the United States Senate. The goal of the program is to send two high school juniors or seniors from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia to Washington for a week-long on-site introduction to the functions of the federal government, including specifically the United States Senate. William Randolph Hearst Foundation provides $1,000 for trip expenses for each delegate.
