SEN. SALAZAR BROKERS DEAL ON JUDGES
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced an agreed-to compromise on the judicial impasse currently clogging the U.S. Senate.  
   "I came to the United States Senate for the people of Colorado to be a uniter. This agreement reflects the best spirit of bipartisanship. In the best tradition of the Senate, moderation and reason won out today," said Salazar. "We have a good faith agreement that preserves the rules, restores the practice of consultation on the President's judicial nominees and permits us to get back to the people's business. The 'nuclear option' is halted and this agreement allows everyone to take a step back and some comity to be restored to this great institution."
