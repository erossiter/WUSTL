SEN. SALAZAR: 'GANG OF 14' REMAINS UNITED
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after today's 'gang of fourteen' meeting.
   "The 'gang of fourteen' is united. Each of us individually is reserving judgment on Judge Alito and none of us are at a point to make a final decision - it is too early in the process. We have agreed to meet again as this process unfolds over the next several months."
