SEN. SALAZAR CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO PROTECT WOMAN'S FAMILY HOME IN ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK
  With legislation to preserve the family home in Rocky Mountain National Park 
  (RMNP) of 83-year-old widow Betty Dick having now passed both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, Sen. Ken Salazar today urged President Bush to sign the legislation into law and protect Mrs. Dick's family home. 
   Earlier today, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed S. 584, Senator Salazar's "Betty Dick Residence Protection Act," which passed the Senate on November 16, 2005. Senator Salazar's bill is a companion bill to Mark Udall's H.R. 432.
   "I urge the President to sign this bill without delay to allow Ms. Dick to return to her home in the park for the 2006 summer season and to remain a part of her local community," said Senator Salazar.
   Under a 1980 settlement agreement with the National Park Service, Fred Dick and his wife Betty were allowed to lease and occupy their family cabin in RMNP for 25 years. Fred Dick passed away in 1992 but Betty remains at the property. Mrs. Dick's lease with the Park Service expired in July, 2005. Under the Salazar-Udall proposal, Mrs. Dick will hold a life estate on the property in Rocky Mountain National Park; the life estate will be for 8 acres instead of 23; and Mrs. Dick will continue to pay $300 per year, the same amount she has been paying.
   "Letting Ms. Dick live her final years in the dignity of her family home is the least we can do for a woman who has been an excellent steward of the land and has made the property available for community events, without ever being a detriment to the Park in any way," said Senator Salazar.
   Having been passed by both the Senate and House, S.584 now goes on to the President for his signature or veto.
