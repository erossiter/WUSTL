SEN. SALAZAR WINS KEY DEFENSE PROVISIONS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT TROOPS AND MILITARY OPERATIONS
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced today that crucial funding for new technologies have been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "Funding for the enhancement and improvement of our Nation's defense and military operations is paramount to our homeland security," said Senator Salazar. "I am proud to have fought for these funds to improve our Nation's defense programs. I will continue to work with my Senate and House colleagues to ensure these funds stay in Colorado throughout the appropriations process."
   FY 2007 Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5631), as agreed to by the committee, includes the following provisions:
   * $2 million for Combat Support Hospital tents, to be produced by Alaska Structures in Delta, CO, which provide state-of-the-art field medical hospitals. 
   * $2 million for the development of copper, lightweight induction motors for the military to be carried out by Vforge in Lakewood, CO. Copper rotors result in more efficient motors, meaning they can be smaller and lighter than traditional motors. 
   * $2 million for the Deployable Structures Experiment, to be carried out by Microsat in Littleton, CO. The experiment seeks to reduce the design time, cost, and size of satellites in order to allow tactical satellite launches for battlespace management. 
   * $2.5 million for Special Operations Command to develop an air-dropped sensor needed for clandestine missions. This is to be carried out by ADA Technologies in Littleton, CO. 
  $11 million for the Minuteman III Propulsion Replacement Program, to be carried out by Northrop-Grumman. This replaces the aging propellant in Minuteman III rocket motors in order to keep the current fleet operational. Wyoming's F.E. Warren Air Force Base has some of these missiles. 
   * $1 million for the Medical Image Database Holographic Archiving Library System (MIDHALS), which seeks to store, distribute, and retrieve medical documents for the administration of timely medical care for soldiers. Companies to receive funding for this program include Sun Microsystems in Louisville, CO and InPhase Technologies in Longmont, CO. 
   * $2 million for the Air Force's Advanced Power Technology Office (APTO) for the research and development of high-performance, low-cost modular energy systems for hybrid and electric vehicles. 
   * $2 million for Polyimide Macro-electromechanical Systems (PMEMS), to be carried out by Ball Aerospace in Boulder and Jefferson Counties, which seeks to save the government money by dramatically reducing the cost of phased arrays for multiple applications and frequency bands. The phased array systems are estimated to save the Navy $88 million dollars for every ship they are used on. 
   * $3 million for the development of a Respiratory Biodefense Initiative at the National Jewish Hospital in Denver, CO. 
   The FY07 Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5631) now goes to the floor of the Senate.
