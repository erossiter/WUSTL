SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT DECISION ON COLORADO REDISTRICTING
  In 2003, then Attorney General Ken Salazar, challenged the decision of the Colorado General Assembly to redistrict Colorado's Congressional districts. The General Assembly's actions sought to change the districts originally drawn by the judiciary after the General Assembly could not reach agreement in 2002. 
   Today, Senator Salazar stated, "Four years ago I sued the Colorado Secretary of State to defend the Colorado Constitution. We are a Nation of laws and it was clear to me then that the Colorado Constitution required that redistricting for Congressional seats occur only once every ten years following the census. For those four years, we have stood by that principle and I am delighted that the United States Supreme Court has finally brought this matter to its final conclusion.
   "I thank the Colorado Attorney General and others for continuing to defend that fundamental position which we advocated for since 2003."
