SEN. SALAZAR SUPPORTS PATRIOT ACT EXTENSION
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after the United States Senate successfully extended the PATRIOT Act to March 10, 2006.
   "The PATRIOT Act must be reauthorized. I am proud of our bipartisan coalition and the extension we approved today. As former Attorney General of Colorado I know a balance can be struck between the rights of citizens and the needs of law enforcement. I will continue to work with the bipartisan "SAFE Act Six" to strike this balance."
