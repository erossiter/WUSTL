SEN. SALAZAR LAUDS COLORADO PROJECTS IN DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced his strong support for several Colorado-specific projects funded in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007 which was filed today. The Authorization bill is expected to be debated over the next two weeks in the Senate. 
   "As introduced, this bill contains funding that will solidify Colorado as America's crown jewel for National Defense and Homeland Security," Sen. Salazar said. "After working with base commanders in Colorado and officials at the Pentagon in Washington, I am extremely pleased with the initial contents of the bill."
   The $517.7 billion Defense Authorization bill includes increases to military salaries, increased troop levels, funding for military aircraft, missile defense and many other provisions. Colorado's role in maintaining America's Homeland Security and National Defense is supported by several provisions specific to Colorado:
   Military Construction in Colorado - $130.7 million:
   * Fort Carson: $50 million - Authorizes $26 million for a Combat Services Support Complex for Special Operating Forces. Another $24 million is authorized for military construction for the next phase of construction of the Airfield Arrival/Depart Complex. 
   * Buckley Air Force Base: $17.7 million - $10.7 million authorized for construction of the Consolidated Fuels Facility. Another $7 million is authorized for a new Air National Guard Squadron Operations Facility. 
   * Schriever Air Force Base: $21 million - $21 million for construction of the Space Test & Evaluation Facility. 
   * Pueblo Chemical Depot: $42 million - Authorizes $42 million for Pueblo Chemical Depot construction. 
   Also included was $10 million to purchase interoperable communications equipment for NORTHCOM. Senator Salazar said, "I added an amendment to the Budget Resolution to provide for $10 million for NORTHCOM interoperable communications and am pleased the authorizers have included this funding in the bill."
   BRAC (Base Realignment And Closure) Funds for Colorado - $202 million:
   * Fort Carson: $202 million - Authorizes $118 million for the construction of a Brigade Combat Team Complex and $84 million for the construction of a Division Headquarters for the 4th Infantry Division relocating from Fort Hood, TX. 
   "The bill that the Senate takes up today is an excellent start toward the funding needs of Colorado and the Nation," Sen. Salazar added. "I am currently examining amendment options - and will continue to do so over the next two weeks of debate - to further support Colorado's military needs and strengthen our National Defense."
