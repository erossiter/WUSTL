SENS. ALLARD & SALAZAR HELP NATIONAL CONVENTIONS OBTAIN FUNDING VITAL FOR SECURITY PLANNING
  United States Senators Wayne Allard and Ken Salazar supported Senate efforts to ensure the Republican and Democratic conventions in St. Paul, MN and Denver, CO, obtain the $100 million necessary to help pay for security planning and personnel for the national conventions being held next summer. The security funding is included as a part of the Commerce, Justice, State title of the omnibus appropriations spending bill. 
   "With Denver front and center on an international stage, we cannot afford to be ill-prepared and risk a security disaster," said Senator Allard. "Securing this funding for our Colorado law enforcement personnel has been a bipartisan effort and I am pleased that we can move forward with the planning for the convention and prepare for the influx of attendees, members of the media and special guests."
   "I am proud of my Republican and Democratic colleagues for working so hard to secure these funds," said Senator Salazar. "Providing this funding now allows both cities to adequately plan for and request the law enforcement personnel and supplies necessary to ensure that both conventions can be carried out in the safest way possible."
