SEN. SALAZAR FIGHTS TO FUND KEY PRIORITIES AT NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB
  Sen. Ken Salazar today urged Alexander A. Karsner, Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) at the United States Department of Energy, to direct $113 million to the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) in Fiscal Year 2007. Specifically, Senator Salazar pointed out the funding needs of the lab's key infrastructure priorities for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2007: (1) $30 million to equip the new Science & Technology facility; (2) $20 million for expansion of the lab's Integrated Biorefinery Research Facility; and (3) $63 million to design and build a new Research Support Facility. 
   After speaking directly with Secretary Karsner on the phone about funding at NREL, Senator Salazar wrote him a letter stating, "I look forward to working with you to ensure that the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado - the Nation's premier research laboratory for energy efficiency and renewable energy - is funded at a level necessary to achieve energy security for the nation.
   "?I therefore urge you to direct $113 million to NREL in Fiscal Year 2007."
   "...I am confident you will agree NREL must have the necessary facilities and research equipment to carry out its mission."
   In the letter Senator Salazar also expressed that he would continue to fight for the additional $300 million investment for the Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) budget for Fiscal Year 2007 when the Continuing Resolution (CR) is debated on the Senate floor.
