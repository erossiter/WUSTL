SEN. SALAZAR, COLLEAGUES CONVINCE NATIONAL GUARD TO DROP REQUEST TO CUT PERSONNEL LEVELS
  Sen. Ken Salazar joined a bipartisan group of 75 Senators in writing to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to strongly oppose reported proposals that National Guard force levels would be cut. Yesterday, General Peter Schoomaker, the Army's chief of staff, announced that personnel levels would remain where they were. 
   "The National Guard is a vital element of our nation's security," Salazar said. "The Army's announcement yesterday that the Guard would not be cut is good news for Coloradans who rely on their services. I am also hopeful that this action will remind members of Congress what they can do when they work in a bipartisan manner to get things done."
   The Army had proposed cutting the Guard strength by about 17,000 positions. The letter the Senators sent to Secretary Rumsfeld is available at: http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/060118ngrd.pdf.
