SEN. SALAZAR MOVES TO PROVIDE SOUTHWESTERN COLORADANS BOTH DENVER, NEW MEXICO TELEVISION STATIONS
  Southwestern Coloradans are isolated from Colorado televised news coverage, sports entertainment including the Denver Broncos and the Colorado Emergency Alert System. These viewers instead receive their television from Albuquerque, New Mexico as a result of being located in the Albuquerque Designated Market Area (DMA). Sen. Ken Salazar today introduced a bill, S. 760, to provide certain counties with the ability to receive television broadcast signals of their choice to fix this inequity and include the Four Corners region in the Denver television market so that they will receive both the Denver television stations and Albuquerque television stations. 
   "Coloradans deserve access to Colorado television stations and all the benefits that come with that coverage - including Denver Bronco games and vital state emergency information," said Senator Salazar. "Television viewers in this area also deserve to get news from their region, and that includes news from the Albuquerque designated market area - this bill will accomplish this goal. It will keep Southwestern Coloradans informed about the news in their region and their state and ensure they can cheer on their Broncos at the same time."
