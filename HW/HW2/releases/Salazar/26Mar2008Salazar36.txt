SEN. SALAZAR, REP. SALAZAR URGE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO ASSIST STATE IN ALAMOSA WATER ISSUE
  United States Senator Ken Salazar and Congressman John Salazar (CO-3) grew up on a ranch less than thirty miles south of Alamosa, Colorado in the San Luis Valley. Alamosa is the largest town located in the Valley and is the hub of its government and business activity. In response to the recent salmonella crisis and resulting disaster declaration there by Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, Senator Salazar and Congressman Salazar sent a letter to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Michael Leavitt urging the Department to provide the State of Colorado the assistance it needs to provide important services to Alamosa residents. 
   In their letter, Senator Salazar and Congressman Salazar wrote, "We visited with Alamosa City officials and town residents on Saturday, March 22 and saw that the community has responded admirably to this crisis. Alamosa has received a great deal of assistance from the State of Colorado and other communities across Colorado. However, the resources of the State and local governments are reaching their limits. Therefore, the Governor has requested that your Department provide five environmental personnel to assist with food establishment inspections, two epidemiologists to assist with community surveys, two risk communication experts and additional water engineers and water quality experts. This assistance from the federal government will provide important services to Alamosa residents.
   "We urge your prompt attention to the Governor's request and look forward to the Department's assistance in Alamosa."
