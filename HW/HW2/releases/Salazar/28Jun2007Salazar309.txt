SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING VOTE ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after today's vote on comprehensive immigration reform on the floor of the United States Senate. 
   "I am proud of those who had the courage to attempt to deal with this enormously difficult and complex National security issue. We will have another opportunity down the road to secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws and establish a realistic solution that addresses the twelve million undocumented workers in our Nation.
   "I remain hopeful that logic and reason will eventually prevail, and that one day soon, we can accomplish the goal of passing a bill that protects America and modernizes our Nation's immigration system."
