SEN. SALAZAR SENDS ARMY 'BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD' ON PINON CANYON EXPANSION
  Today, Senator Salazar received a letter from Peter Geren, the Acting Secretary of the Army, stating that the Army will comply with Senator Salazar's suggestion that they go 'back to the drawing board' regarding their land acquisition approach at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS). Last month Senator Salazar wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, outlining his thoughts on how the Army could create a 'win-win' process for the PCMS. Senator Salazar also asked that the Army take the time to meet with and listen to the local community for their ideas and suggestions to improve the process. 
   "The Army's announcement to go 'back to the drawing board' on their land acquisition approach to the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site is a major positive step for Southeastern Coloradans," said Senator Salazar. "If any plan is going to move forward, it must protect the ranchers and the ranching economy and provide positive economic benefits to Southeastern Colorado. It must also protect private property rights. I am encouraged that the Army has recognized that it needs to fundamentally rethink its plans for expansion at Pinon Canyon."
   Specifically in the letter, the Army agreed to:
   1. Go back to the drawing board on its land acquisition approach at PCMS, 
   2. Listen and look to the local community for some additional ideas and suggestions to improve the process, and 
   3. Fully consider potential economic enhancements to local communities, while stating it as their goal to acquire land only from willing sellers.
