SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF PRESIDENT FORD
  Sen. Salazar's Remarks on the Passing of President Ford:
   "I personally had the great honor of working with President Gerald R. Ford. He is a true statesman whose life and example should inspire Americans for generations to come. He left an indelible mark of leadership that brought our Nation back together during a time of great crisis. He was a brilliant strategist and a decent man who for many years called Colorado home. I will miss him and our country will miss him."
