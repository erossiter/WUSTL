SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS JUDICIARY COMMITTEE COMPROMISE
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement in response to the Judiciary Committee's compromise on immigration legislation. 
   "I am pleased the Senate Judiciary Committee has arrived at a compromise that addresses our country's immigration challenges so critical to strengthening our national and border security. Like many, I believe the only way to tackle this problem is through a bipartisan consensus. As immigration reform now moves to the floor, I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to build upon the work of the Committee. It is my hope that the Senate will enact a comprehensive immigration reform law that protects our borders and addresses the human and economic realities within our homeland."
   Senator Salazar is an original co-sponsor of the bipartisan McCain-Kennedy immigration reform bill.
