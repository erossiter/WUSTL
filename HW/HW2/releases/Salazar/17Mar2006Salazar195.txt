SEN. SALAZAR REJECTS ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO SELL FOREST LANDS
  Sen. Ken Salazar today responded to legislation the Administration is attempting to introduce that would sell off 300,000 acres of Unites States Forest Service (USFS) lands. 
   "I oppose the Administration's proposed legislation to sell off 300,000 acres of forest lands. In hearings, letters and personal conversations I have stressed my opposition to this proposal to sell off pieces of America's permanent heritage of public lands as part of a short-term budget issue."
   "Further, the Administration's proposed bill would eliminate virtually all formal opportunity for the public to comment on, or object to, proposed land sales, short of going to court. I will continue to oppose this proposed sale and intend to do what I can to prevent the Administration's bill from becoming law from my seat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee."
   Colorado is currently slated to have a sale of 21,572 acres, or nearly 7.2%, of the 300,000 acres on the block, yet Colorado would only receive 1.67% of the funding each year.
