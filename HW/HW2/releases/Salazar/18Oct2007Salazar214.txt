SEN. SALAZAR DISAPPOINTED BY HOUSE VOTE FAILING TO OVERRIDE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

For Senator Salazar's audio recording of this statement please visit http://demradio.senate.gov/actualities/salazar/salazar071018_1.mp3. 
   "It is unconscionable that certain members of the House chose to side with the President and shortchange America's uninsured children. By sustaining the President's veto, they are denying healthcare coverage to over 100,000 Colorado children and nearly 10 million children Nationwide. This was a hard fought and fiscally responsible agreement that garnered strong bipartisan, bicameral support and the backing of a large majority of the American people.
   "Investing in the Children's Health Insurance Program is about investing in the future of America's children. Our investment in their health and well-being today is our moral and economic obligation and will pay off well into the future. This vote dashes the hopes of millions of uninsured children."
