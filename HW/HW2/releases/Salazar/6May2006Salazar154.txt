SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES BI-PARTISAN LEGISLATION TO PERMANENTLY FUND LAND & WATER CONSERVATION FUND
  After helping cut ribbon at the South Suburban Park Foundation's "Passport to the Trails Celebration and Dedication" for the new canopy bridge that links three parks via the Big Dry Creek Trail, Sen. Salazar announced that he and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) will propose legislation to permanently fund the Land & Water Conservation Fund stateside grants program.
   Senators Salazar and Alexander will introduce an amendment to S. 2253 to make permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) stateside grants program. S. 2253 is a bill that would authorize oil and gas exploration and drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (lease area 181). Senator Salazar's amendment specifies that, beginning in FY08, at least $450 million of the revenue generated from lease sales in Area 181 shall be appropriated to the LWCF stateside grants program. 
   "LWCF is essential to our quality of life. LWCF funds helped complete portions of this trail system including the Platte River Bridge connection and a significant portion of the trail from the South Platte River to Broadway," said Senator Salazar. This legislation would ensure LWCF is permanently funded by at least $450 million annually from lease sale revenues on the Outer Continental Shelf so that LWCF can fulfill its mission and so that we and future generations can continue to enjoy the great outdoors."
   As an initiative started by President John Kennedy, Congress established the Land and Water Conservation Fund in 1964 to meet America's needs for outdoor recreation opportunities, wildlife habitat conservation and open space. The LWCF Act directed that royalties from offshore oil and gas development, $900 million a year, be used for the purchase of land, waterways, and wetlands and to provide matching grant assistance for state and community open space and recreation projects. Unfortunately, Washington has consistently under funded the LWCF stateside grants program and failed to appropriate any available funds for playing fields, parks, and trails. In addition, the President has proposed to eliminate funding for stateside LWCF grants, despite the National Park Service's high praise for the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.
   S. 2253 was introduced by Senators Domenici (R-NM) and Bingaman (D-NM) and voted out of the Energy Committee in March. It may be debated on the Senate floor this week. Senators Salazar and Alexander will introduce their amendment at that time.
   Senator Salazar has long worked to preserve Colorado's land and water. He led the effort in the creation of the Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) program, was executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and created the Youth in Natural Resources program.
