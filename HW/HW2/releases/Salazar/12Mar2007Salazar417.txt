COLORADO HOSTS IMPORTANT FARM BILL FIELD HEARING
  Today, Colorado hosts a field hearing on the upcoming reauthorization of the Farm Bill by Congress, the first hearing this year on the Farm Bill outside of Washington, D.C. Agriculture, energy and other experts representing Colorado farmers, ranchers and rural residents testified today at a hearing at the Adams County Fairgrounds. In a press conference preceding today's hearing, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA), Sen. Ken Salazar (D-CO), and Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter discussed the importance of the Farm Bill and Colorado's opportunity for input.
   "The farm bill is the single most important piece of legislation for spurring rural development, economic growth and jobs, and improving the quality of life in rural communities," said Chairman Harkin. "All Americans have a stake in this legislation, which is why views and recommendations from around the country are so critical. I thank Senator Salazar for inviting me to hold this hearing in Colorado and I look forward to taking the information learned here back to Congress."  
   "Agriculture and rural communities are the backbone of Colorado and the Nation. The reauthorization of the Farm Bill will affect tens of thousands of Coloradans, and this hearing is an important opportunity for them to have their voices directly heard," said Senator Salazar. "I thank Chairman Harkin for giving Colorado such a high-profile opportunity to help shape America's food and energy security for the next five years."
   Governor Ritter thanked Senators Harkin and Salazar for holding the field hearing in Colorado. Agriculture is one of the state's largest economic sectors, generating more than 16 billion dollars a year and providing more than 100,000 jobs. Ritter said the Farm Bill and energy title will go a long way toward advancing Colorado's New Energy Economy. He also urged lawmakers to include a permanent disaster relief title in the farm bill to aid southeast Colorado farmers and ranchers still reeling from this winter's blizzards. "Despite the best efforts of Sen. Salazar and others in the Colorado delegation, we cannot find a disaster relief program that is on the books and funded," Ritter said. "Congress can help creating and funding a permanent, standing disaster title in the Farm Bill."

   * Mr. John Stulp, farmer, rancher and Commissioner of Agriculture for the State of Colorado;

   Earlier this year, Senator Salazar invited Chairman Harkin to hold an Agriculture Committee field-hearing on the 2007 farm bill in Colorado to highlight the issues most important to Colorado's agricultural industries and rural communities. The final 2007 Farm Bill will be essential to farmers, ranchers and rural communities in Colorado and the Nation.
