SEN. SALAZAR ASKS BLM TO SUSPEND GRAND MESA DEVELOPMENT
  In a letter to the Colorado State Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Sen.  
 Ken Salazar requested that BLM postpone leasing parcels of land in Grand Mesa.
   The Senator's request stems from concerns brought to his attention by the communities of Grand Junction and Palisade who noted BLM's proposals fail to protect their drinking water supply. The land was set to be developed for oil and gas drilling.
   "America's energy problem did not come about overnight," Senator Salazar said in his letter. "Neither rushing to lease these parcels...nor disregarding the concerns of local communities would be a prudent path toward solving the nation's energy problems."
