SEN. SALAZAR CONGRATULATES GURA ON PROCUREMENT OF $200,000 EPA GRANT
  Sen. Ken Salazar made the following statement upon receiving word of the Golden Urban Renewal Authority's (GURA) procurement of a $200,000 EPA grant to assist with the Gateway Station project in Golden, Colorado: 
   "I am extremely pleased to hear that the Environmental Protection Agency has decided to award the nationally competitive Brownfield Cleanup Grant to Colorado's very own Golden Urban Renewal Authority.
   "These funds will undoubtedly prove essential in helping offset the remediation costs of the Gateway Station project, and will allow GURA to fully honor its ambitious seventeen-year mission of revitalizing Golden's downtown and supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy efforts in the area."
   GURA has committed to a $1.1 million Perchloroethylene (PCE) cleanup, a $4.5 million public parking garage and an additional $1.25 million in public purpose support for the mixed-use phase of the project as part of the Gateway Station Project in Golden, Colorado.
   Earlier this year, Senator Salazar wrote a letter[1] to EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson urging him to lend his support to GURA's proposal for the Brownfield Cleanup Grant.
