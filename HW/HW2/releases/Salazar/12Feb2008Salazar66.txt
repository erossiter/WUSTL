SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON FISA PASSAGE
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after the Senate voted to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by a vote of 68 to 29. 
   "I believe it is my duty as a United States Senator to ensure our Nation has the ability to fight terrorism while protecting Americans' civil liberties. Americans deserve a government that can and will fulfill its primary responsibility - the responsibility of keeping its citizens safe from attack. But we also deserve a government that will not abuse the power entrusted to it.
   "The bill we passed today made several important improvements to the current FISA program. It will provide law enforcement the tools it needs to protect America and at the same time provide necessary safeguards to our cherished civil liberties. The bill increases the role of the FISA court in enforcing procedures for protecting privacy, explicitly prohibits the targeting of any person reasonably believed to be in the United States, requires yearly audits of intelligence collection, and sets a six-year sunset to allow Congress to evaluate how the new authorities are being carried out.
   "While these are important improvements, I supported several amendments that would have gone further in protecting civil liberties and would have limited the immunity protection provided to telecommunications companies involved in helping the government collect intelligence, including a four-year sunset review as well as a required FISA court review of liability issues for telecom companies. These amendments were not adopted, but I am hopeful that they will be considered as we reconcile the Senate bill with the House-passed bill."
