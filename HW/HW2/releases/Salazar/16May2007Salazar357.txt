WATER BILL PASSES SENATE; AUTHORIZATION FOR COLORADO WATER PROJECTS INCLUDED BY SEN. SALAZAR
 Today, the Senate passed the Water Resources and Development Act of 2007 (WRDA), authorizing federal spending on water development, infrastructure, flood control and other projects conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Contained in this year's WRDA is funding authorization for several projects in Colorado, including an authorization for construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, all included at the request of Sen. Ken Salazar. 
   "To the West and rural America, water is our most important resource," said Senator Salazar. "I am pleased that Congress has recognized the importance of authorizing these water projects for Colorado. The authorization for the long-promised Arkansas Valley Conduit is especially welcome to the people of southeastern Colorado."
   At Senator Salazar's request, WRDA includes funding authorization for six water projects around Colorado, including two projects critical to southern Colorado:
   * $10 Million for Ark Valley Conduit: WRDA includes a $10 million authorization for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in Southeastern Colorado. The construction of this conduit will fulfill a long-standing promise to the people of the lower Arkansas Valley for fresh drinking water and is the keystone for the economic revitalization of Southeastern Colorado; and
   * Instructions to Speed Up Completion of the Fountain Creek Watershed Study: WRDA includes specific instructions to the Secretary of the Army to speed up completion of the Fountain Creek Watershed Study, the first step towards the clean-up and protection of Fountain Creek for all the communities. The importance of this study was underscored earlier this week when the Creek flooded parts of Pueblo along Dillon Drive, damaging several homes and businesses.
   WRDA also includes funding authorization for two important projects for Denver and Boulder Metro Area:
   * $10 Million for the Boulder County Pipeline: WRDA includes a $10 million authorization for construction of a water pipeline, which will protect drinking water quality and allow for year-round water delivery from Carter Lake to Boulder and other municipal area water providers; and
   * $13.7 Million for Restoration of the South Platte: WRDA includes a $13.7 million authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct ecosystem restoration work along the South Platte River in Denver, to be matched by more than $7 million in non-Federal funds.
   Finally, WRDA also includes:
   * $25 million for the Rio Grande Environmental Management Program in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, which provides for the ongoing restoration and management of the Rio Grande, which is headwatered in Colorado, and its tributaries such as the Alamosa and Conejos Rivers; and
   * $5 Million Authorization for a Statewide Selenium Study: WRDA includes a $5 million authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct regional and watershed-wide studies to address selenium concentrations in Colorado, which in high doses can be fatal to humans, livestock and wildlife.
   Having been passed by the Senate and the House, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (H.R. 1495) now proceeds to conference committee to iron out differences before being passed again by both House and Senate in final form and then submitted to the President for signature or veto.
