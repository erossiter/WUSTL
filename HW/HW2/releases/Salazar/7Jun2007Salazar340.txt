SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ARMY'S ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING PINON CANYON
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after the Army held a public meeting in Trinidad, CO to announce its 'Area of Interest' for expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site: 
   "I will oppose any expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site unless it provides an economic win-win for southeastern Colorado. And any proposal must protect the livelihoods, land, property rights, and agricultural economy of the region.
   "I will continue to study the Army's plans for expansion as they emerge and consider other steps to ensure all of Southeastern Colorado benefits from any action that may eventually be taken.
   "For example, I asked the Army about one win-win possibility: the creation of a Fort Carson Annex in Southeastern Colorado. As the Army expands to strengthen our armed forces, I believe it should consider the construction of a permanent facility - such as an annex where soldiers would live year round - that might provide substantial economic benefits to Southeastern Colorado."
