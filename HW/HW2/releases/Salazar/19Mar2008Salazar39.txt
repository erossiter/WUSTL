SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF WAR IN IRAQ
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in recognition of the five year anniversary of the war in Iraq. 
   "On the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq, we pay tribute to the nearly 4,000 Americans who have given their lives in this conflict, the nearly 30,000 Americans who have been wounded in the line of duty, and to their families who have sacrificed so much.
   "Our troops and their families have shown tremendous commitment and bravery over the last five years. But these American heroes deserve a policy worthy of the great sacrifices they have made.
   "I believe we must implement a responsible change in mission that steadily reduces our combat role in Iraq while ensuring Iraq's leaders take responsibility for their own country. I have called for and will continue to call for such a change in mission. Here at home I will continue to support the men and women who valiantly serve our Nation overseas and I will keep working to ensure that all our veterans receive a quality of care worthy of their sacrifice."
