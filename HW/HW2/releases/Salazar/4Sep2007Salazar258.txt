SEN. SALAZAR PUSHES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN RURAL COLORADO
  In an effort to ensure that rural communities in Colorado have access to health care, United States Senator Ken Salazar is pushing for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to begin the certification process that would enable Pikes Peak Regional Hospital to open and accept Medicare patients. In a letter to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt, Senator Salazar asks that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid begin the certification process so that the hospital can open in October 2007, as planned, and bring much-needed services to an underserved portion of rural Colorado. 
   "Colorado is such a regionally diverse state where many rural communities lack convenient access to quality health care," said Senator Salazar. "The opening of Pikes Peak Regional Hospital is a long awaited facility for those living in rural central Colorado. I want to ensure that the hospital is able to complete the certification process through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services so that it can open without delay and provide vital services to an underserved population."
   The Medicare certification is required in order for the hospital to serve Medicare beneficiaries and individuals with private insurance. The hospital, which is set to open in October 2007, will serve as one of the only providers of emergency services and medical care to those living in Teller, Park and western El Paso and southern Douglas counties. In addition, the hospital will provide laboratory, radiology and surgical care to thousands of residents in those counties, who would otherwise have to go without such services or have to travel great distances to access these services.
