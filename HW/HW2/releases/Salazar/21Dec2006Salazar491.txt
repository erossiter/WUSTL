COLORADO'S SENATORS PUSH APPROPRIATORS TO FULLY FUND PUEBLO CHEMICAL DEPOT
  Colorado's Sens. Ken Salazar and Wayne Allard wrote to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee urging them to fully fund the chemical weapons demolition project at Pueblo Chemical Depot in 2007. 
   Earlier this year the Senate approved $141 million to pay for the destruction of the chemical weapons stockpiles in Pueblo, CO and Blue Grass, KY, but under the current Continuing Resolution that funding is restricted to the 2006 levels of $50 million. These stockpiles are to be destroyed by 2012. The Pentagon, however, has already reported that completion of this project may stretch to 2023. A reduction in funding for next year will cause further delays.
   In the letter to the Appropriators, Senators Salazar and Allard wrote, "Destruction of these chemical weapons is a homeland security imperative, an arms control priority and is required by United States law?Reducing funding to this low level will severely limit progress at both sites, and in direct contrast with the Sense of the Congress, will result in further delaying the destruction of these weapons."
   The letter was also signed by Kentucky Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Jim Bunning (R-KY). The full letter can be accessed at http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/061220ACWA.pdf.
