SEN. SALAZAR URGES IMMEDIATE REMEDIES AT 'SUPERMAX' TO ENSURE SECURITY
  Sen. Ken Salazar requested Attorney General Gonzales take immediate steps to ensure that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) remedy the security flaws at a Colorado 'Supermax' prison that led to convicted terrorists' ability to send letters aimed at recruiting suicide bombers. Senator Salazar made the request of Attorney General Gonzales in a letter today that outlined a report issued last week by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (OIG) regarding surveillance of inmates at Bureau of Prisons facilities. 
   In his letter Senator Salazar listed the following conclusions from the OIG report:
   * There was a failure to read all of the mail from the highest-risk prisoners and only 1.8% of inmate mail was randomly monitored; 
   * Less than 50% of the telephone calls made by Supermax prisoners on the "alert list" (which includes convicted terrorists) were monitored;
  * At seven of the 10 prisons surveyed, the monitoring of mail sent by convicted terrorists has decreased since fiscal year 2005;
  * The BOP did not hire any full-time Arabic language specialists to translate inmate communications until 2005. Those specialists, once hired, did not receive counterterrorism intelligence training during the first year of their employment - which made it difficult to analyze the mail they were translating; and
  * Intelligence-sharing between the BOP and the FBI has been inadequate. 
   In his letter Senator Salazar noted, "I have great faith in the hardworking men and women who staff the Supermax facility. They do difficult work at great personal risk - and deserve the best possible leadership from the BOP? I strongly urge you [Attorney General Gonzales] to take immediate steps to ensure that the BOP remedies the serious problems outlined in the OIG report and to respond to this letter detailing those steps."
