SEN. SALAZAR ASKS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LOCAL COMMISSIONERS ON DOMINGUEZ-ESCALANTE PROPOSAL
  In an effort to gather additional input from local communities on the concept to create a National Conservation Area (NCA) for the Dominguez and Escalante area, United States Senator Ken Salazar sent a letter to county commissioners in Mesa, Montrose, and Delta counties today seeking their input on a recent proposal drafted by the Natural Resources and Land Policy Institute (NRLPI) at Mesa State College. The NRLPI report summarizes discussions from a set of public meetings that the Institute organized to discuss the Dominguez-Escalante NCA proposal and provides recommendations for further action. 
   "Local communities should have a strong voice in any land management decision that is made," said Senator Salazar. "Much time has been spent hearing public opinion on the creation of a National Conservation Area for the Dominguez-Escalante area and it is important the county commissioners now have the time to review the public's input. I look forward to hearing their recommendations and stand ready to assist in anyway possible on further action."
   The proposed NCA would include approximately 200,000 acres of land west of Delta and Montrose, and south of Grand Junction managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Giving the Dominguez-Escalante area a National Conservation Area designation would place the area within the Bureau of Land Management's National Landscape Conservation System, which receives a greater share of resources and funding for recreation and resource protection than other BLM lands. 
   In 2006, Senator Salazar sent a letter to commissioners encouraging them to establish a formal, public process to solicit public opinion on establishing an NCA.
