SEN. SALAZAR SECURES $9.2 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR DENVER METRO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved $9.2 million in funding for transportation and veterans outreach projects in the Denver Metro region. The projects were funded at the request of Sen. Ken Salazar as part of the FY07 Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill (FY07 TTHUD).
   "Colorado's infrastructure is already under severe strain, and with our state's population expected to blossom over the next 20 years, it's important for us to get out ahead of the curve," said Senator Salazar. "I'm pleased to announce the projects, which will bring much-needed improvements to Denver area." 
   Under the FY07 TTHUD, the six major transportation projects were funded for the metro Denver region:
   * $3 Million for Preliminary Engineering for I-225 at Colfax and 17th: This intersection is the lynchpin to the Fitzsimons Redevelopment project, and is the number one regional transportation priority for DRCOG. 
   * $4.2 Million to Complete the Replacement of the JeffCo Air Traffic Control Tower: The Jefferson County Airport currently has 177,000 annual operations and expects to add an additional 150,000 in future growth. The current circa-1963 tower suffers from several blind spots as poor depth perception (because of the mountains to the west) as well as other safety issues. 
   * $800,000 for a Congestion Relief Study on SH44 (104th Ave) in Thornton: This congested 5.2-mile, two-lane roadway that begins at Colorado Boulevard in Thornton and runs east to E-470, serving as a major access road to DIA. 
   * $1 Million for the I-70 Stapleton Interchange: This interchange will ensure smooth access to the extensive retail areas (10 million square feet of office and 3 million square feet of retail) as well as the 12K homes and apartments that will ultimately be built at Stapleton and avoid long lines and congestion on the interstate created by vehicles using the existing interchanges to the East and West of Stapleton. 
   RTD benefited under FY07 TTHUD as well, receiving $80 Million for T-Rex, the annual payment required to RTD under the Full Funding Grant Agreement for construction of T-Rex, slated to open later this year for light rail service, as well as $35 Million for FasTracks to continue work on the first project sector, the West Corridor Light Rail. 
   Denver will also benefit from the $5 Million for the Colorado Transit Coalition, the state transit coalition, to be allocated for bus transit services and facilities among the 29 partners of the Coalition, including RTD, Adams County, Castle Rock, Fort Collins, Greeley and others.
   In addition, Denver received $200,000 for Housing for Denver Homeless Veterans, to provide for the acquisition and renovation of transitional housing (30 units) for homeless Vietnam Era, Gulf War and Iraq War veterans with substance abuse, mental illness and co-occurring disorders. This transitional housing creates the critical link to permanent housing and services for homeless veterans, as well as job training to promote self-sufficiency. The project is consistent with Denver's Road Home (10 Year Plan to End Homelessness) and represents a partnership between Denver Department of Human Services, U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs Medical Center in Denver, and Arapahoe House.
   The FY07 TTHUD Appropriations now goes on to the full Senate for consideration later this year.
