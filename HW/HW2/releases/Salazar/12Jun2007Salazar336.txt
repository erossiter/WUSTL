SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROCKY FLATS SEC RECOMMENDATION
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after today's vote by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to recommend inclusion of only a small segment of former Rocky Flats workers in the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC): 
   "The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health on Special Exposure Cohort Status has failed the former Rocky Flats workers once again.
   "Today's vote not to recommend all of the workers for Special Exposure Cohort status has left thousands of former Rocky Flats workers in a continuing state of limbo, waiting for yet one more recalculation of their radiation doses.
   "Over the past 28 months, the review of the Rocky Flats workers' petition for SEC status has greatly improved our knowledge of the radiation exposures sustained by the Nation's nuclear weapons workers. However, the intent of Congress was to provide timely compensation to these Cold War veterans, not merely to advance science.
   "The SEC process has failed miserably to achieve this primary goal.
   "I continue to be on the side of Rocky Flats workers. I have already called for a Senate hearing to investigate the failures of the federal program to compensate nuclear weapons workers. I will now look to Health and Human Services Secretary Leavitt to ensure our heroes of the Cold War receive the benefits and health care they deserve."
