SEN. SALAZAR, REP. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON PASSING OF POPE PAUL II
  Sen. Ken Salazar and Rep. John Salazar released the following statement today on learning of the passing of Pope John Paul II. 
   "Faith has been the foundation of our family, reminding us about the importance of sacrifice and guiding us with principles of justice and integrity. It is our faith that allows us to stay strong and face the challenges ahead." 
   "Today, the world lost a great spiritual leader of conscience and a statesman. Pope John Paul II was a guiding light for us all - a man of strong character and integrity. In the last quarter-century he illuminated - and challenged the entire world to recognize and celebrate the dignity of each and every person. Our greatest tribute to him will be to continue his challenge to do more and to be better. We mourn our loss with a hope for the future." - Ken and John Salazar.
