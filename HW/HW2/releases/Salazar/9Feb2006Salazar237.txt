SEN. SALAZAR SUPPORTS AIR FORCE'S RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION GUIDELINES
  Sen. Ken Salazar, (D-CO) supports the U.S. Air Force's decision to update their guidelines pertaining to the religious expression of its service members. 
   "I am pleased that our United States Air Force continues to seriously consider and modify their guidelines for the free exercise of religion by its service members. It is of vital importance that all Americans who nobly choose to serve their country can also choose to worship as they see fit, without fear of intimidation. I believe these interim guidelines demonstrate the Air Force's commitment to that goal and I am hopeful this most recent change represents a renewed commitment to tolerance from the Air Force."
