SEN. SALAZAR URGES DOD TO CONSIDER THOROUGH COST ANALYSIS ON DISPOSAL OF HYDROLYSATE AT PUEBLO CHEMICAL DEPOT
  As DOD officials undertake the cost analysis of the alternatives to the overall plan on chemical weapons destruction, Sen. Salazar has urged Kenneth Krieg, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, to ensure that they take into account (1) the costs of potential legal challenges, including the costs due to any delays that may occur as a result of those challenges, and (2) the impact any such delays might have on chemical weapons destruction timetables.  
   Senator Salazar's letter to Under Secretary Krieg is available at http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/060911Puebchem.pdf.
