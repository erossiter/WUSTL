SEN. SALAZAR FIGHTS FOR FAMILY FARMS AND RANCHES/ HIS BIPARTISAN BILL EXEMPTS THEM FROM ESTATE TAX
  The value of farmland in many regions of the country has skyrocketed in recent years, and because of that increase in value, the federal estate tax can hit family farms and ranches especially hard. Because many farming and ranching families do not have sufficient assets to be able to pay the federal estate tax in the event the estate-holder passes away, the tax can force family farmers and ranchers to sell all or part of their operation in order to foot the bill.
   Last week, United States Senators Ken Salazar (D-CO) and Pat Roberts (R-KS) introduced the Family Farm and Ranch Act of 2007, which grants an estate tax exemption for family farms and ranches that stay in the family and continue operations after the original estate-holder passes away. 
   "It is extremely disheartening to see our Nation's farmers and ranchers being forced to sell their land simply because they cannot bear the financial burden of the estate tax," said Senator Salazar. "By exempting family-owned and operated farms and ranches that stay in the family from the estate tax, we will ensure that those who choose to continue the agricultural tradition of their forefathers are allowed to do so."
   "As farms are passed down among the generations, estate taxes have made it increasingly harder to keep the operation in the family," Senator Roberts said. "This legislation will go a long way to keep our young people farming into the future, preserving our rural way of life and our rural communities."
   Under the Family Farm and Ranch Act of 2007, a farmer or rancher would not have to pay any estate tax as long as the following conditions are met:
   * In the past eight years before the decedent's death, the decedent or a member of his/her family owned the farm for a cumulative period of at least five years;
   * In the past eight years before the decedent's death, the decedent or a member of his/her family must have been actively involved in the management and operation of the farm for a cumulative period of at least five years;
   * The decedent or a member of his/her family must be using the land for farming purposes on the date of his death; 
   * At the time of his/her death, the decedent must be a U.S. citizen or legal resident of the U.S.
   * EITHER (1) for at least three of the last five taxable years of the decedent's life, over 50 percent of his/her income was acquired through the business of farming, OR (2) the qualified farmland comprises over 50 percent of the decedent's adjusted gross estate at the time of death 
   Moreover, to ensure that people do not take advantage of this exemption, this legislation would institute a "recapture tax" in the event that the heir disposes of any interest in the farmland to anyone outside his family, and/or the heir ceases to use the property for farming purposes.
   "Meaningful financial relief for family farms and ranches, as well as for small business, must be part of Congress' effort to comprehensively and responsibly reform the estate tax," said Senator Salazar. "This bill signals an important first step in the right direction."
   Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) have also signed on as co-sponsors to the Family Farm and Ranch Act of 2007. Congressman John Salazar of Colorado (D-03) has introduced similar legislation in the United States House of Representatives. The text of the Senate version can be found here.
