SEN. SALAZAR MEETS WITH SOUTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR ON U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
  Sen. Ken Salazar and a group of bipartisan Senate colleagues today met with the Ambassador of Korea, His Excellency Lee Tae-Sik, to discuss the timeline for reopening Korean markets to American beef imports. 
   In the meeting, Salazar pressed Ambassador Lee to reopen Korea's market to American beef imports immediately. Since South Korea lifted their ban on US beef, only three shipments have been made to that country. All three of these shipments were rejected on claims that bone fragments were found in those shipments. Prior to the ban, the U.S. had accounted for more than two-thirds of South Korea's beef imports - about $850 million a year worth of products - and South Korea had been the third largest export market for U.S. beef products.
   "U.S. beef is the safest in the world," said Senator Salazar. "While I am pleased that South Korea has said that they will resume importing some U.S. beef, I am extremely concerned that, to date, they have not actually accepted any U.S. beef shipments. I am hopeful that South Korea will agree to start allowing consistent shipments of beef, including older cattle and bone-in products to enter their important markets.
   "The free trade of U.S. beef is essential to my ranchers in Colorado and across the country, and I will continue to work with my colleagues, the USDA and our trading partners to ensure that the United States continues to provide our consumers with the safest beef in the world."
   On September 8th, 2006 South Korea announced that it would once again reopen its border to U.S. beef imports from cattle less than 30 months old, on the condition that there is no bone in the product.
