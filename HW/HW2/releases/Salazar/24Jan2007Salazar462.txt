SEN. SALAZAR CO-SPONSORS BOTH IRAQ RESOLUTIONS, SEEKS SINGLE BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION TO REFLECT WILL OF PEOPLE
  "I am encouraged by the growing bipartisan consensus in Congress that we need a new direction in Iraq. I commend the efforts of Senators Hagel, Biden and Levin as well as Senators Warner, Collins and Nelson to express Congress' disagreement with the President's plan and to provide a positive framework for protecting our national security, supporting our troops, and defining our mission in Iraq. 
   "I am cosponsoring both the Hagel-Biden-Levin and the Warner-Collins-Nelson resolutions regarding the war in Iraq. I believe that both resolutions send a strong signal that Congress opposes the President's proposal to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq and that the United States needs a new plan and direction in Iraq. I now intend to work with my colleagues to seek agreement on a single, bipartisan resolution that reflects the will of the American people - that we must chart a new course in Iraq."
