SENS. SALAZAR, SNOWE, OTHERS URGE ARMY TO FIX BODY ARMOR SHORTFALL
  As the President continues to move forward with his plan to surge an additional 21,500 U.S. combat troops into Iraq, many of these soldiers could enter combat without the body armor that could save their lives. A January 25, 2007 report from the Inspector General indicates shortages in force-protection equipment for our soldiers in Iraq and other 'forward areas,' including shortages in body armor, up-armored vehicles, communications equipment, and electronic countermeasure devices.
   In a bipartisan letter today to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, United States Senators Ken Salazar (D-CO), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and others urged the Department of Defense take immediate steps to ensure that U.S. troops receive complete body armor sets and that the DOD provide him and his colleagues with accurate information on force-protection equipment availability and distribution. The letter to Secretary Gates can be viewed at http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/070215mil.pdf. 
   "The best way that Washington can support our troops is to ensure they are adequately equipped," said Senator Salazar. "Congress needs to know where the shortfalls in equipment and supplies are for our troops so that we can take immediate action to get them the tools they need to do their jobs."
   "It is of the utmost importance that our courageous troops are given the best available resources as they bravely defend this nation," said Senator Snowe. "This legislation will ensure that Congress is adequately updated on the availability and distribution of protective equipment to our troops. These men and women give their lives to keep our country safe and it is essential that we supply them with nothing less than the best tools we have to keep them safe on the job."
   In their letter, the Senators asked Secretary Gates to provide an update on:
   * The number of troops currently in Iraq and Afghanistan that have not been issued body armor with side armor plates; 
   * The percentage of troops currently being mobilized in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that are not being issued complete sets of body armor that include side armor plates; 
   * The number and proportion of troops in each of the services, including figures for both the National Guard and the Reserve, receiving this essential protective equipment; and 
   * The steps the Department of Defense is taking to implement the recommendations made by the Inspector General in its January 25 report on force-protection equipment shortages among deployed units. 
   The Senators ended their letter, writing, "We are sure you agree that our men and women in uniform deserve nothing less than the best protective equipment. If there are indeed shortages of complete body armor sets, or shortages of other force-protection equipment, among our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, we urge you to take immediate action to correct this grave problem. You can be certain that we stand ready with our colleagues to assist you overcome any shortfall that you identify in the most expeditious way possible."
   Senators Salazar and Snowe were joined in the letter by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Richard Durbin (D-IL), John Kerry (D-MA), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Charles Schumer (D-NY), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).
