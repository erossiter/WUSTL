SEN. SALAZAR REQUESTS IMMEDIATE DISASTER RELIEF FOR SOUTHEAST COLORADO
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar urged President Bush and Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to take immediate action to aid the people and livestock of Southeastern Colorado. In letters to both, Senator Salazar asked the President and Secretary of Agriculture to assist in disaster relief efforts including an immediate disaster declaration for affected counties, the release of emergency funds for livestock rescue and recovery, the release of emergency funds for programs administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as well as any other disaster assistance tools under existing presidential authority. 
   In the letters Senator Salazar wrote, "The situation is dire for farmers, ranchers and rural communities. According to the Colorado Division of Emergency Management, there are approximately 350,000 cattle in the area at immediate risk due to the storms. In addition, the Colorado National Guard is performing admirably in its efforts to reach stranded cattle by air. However, the need for additional large scale snow removal equipment is immediate in order to save southeastern Colorado's livestock herds. The loss of livestock currently at risk could ultimately result in severe economic losses across the state. Without proper aid, the situation could mimic a similar blizzard that occurred in 1997, which killed over 30,000 cattle."
