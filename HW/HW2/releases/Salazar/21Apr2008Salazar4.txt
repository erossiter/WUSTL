SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT FOR EARTH DAY
  United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement in anticipation of Earth Day, April 22, 2008: 
   "Only a matter of years ago it was a challenge to convince our world of the significance of Earth Day. But now, due to overwhelming evidence that our planet is in peril, an ever-increasing number of Americans and people around the globe realize its relevance. It can no longer be denied that the impact of human beings on the planet is pronounced and in some cases detrimental. That is why it matters what each of us does, in our own way, to lessen our footprint on the natural environment."
   "Whether your family changes all of your household light bulbs to energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs, you carpool to work or school, you use canvas bags instead of plastic bags to carry your groceries or you choose any of a myriad of other planet-friendly actions - it makes a positive difference. If you haven't yet started to do your part, I hope you choose to today - and for those who have - thank you and keep up the good work. Happy Earth Day."
