UPDATE: PRESIDENT VETOES BILL WITH IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION PROJECTS IN COLORADO
  Today, with the stroke of his pen, President Bush vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 which contained over $4.6 million in funding for several important health care and education projects in Colorado requested by United States Senator Ken Salazar.
   "I am very disappointed that the President vetoed this bill with important funding for projects that will make immediate differences in the quality of life for Colorado families," said Senator Salazar. "These are critical projects that will benefit thousands of people in Colorado by providing better health care, enabling important research at medical facilities and educational institutions, and address substance abuse in our communities. I will continue to do what I can to ensure that these projects can become a reality." 
   The Colorado projects funded at the request of Senator Salazar were:
   $300,000 for Mercy Health Foundation in La Plata County to expand its primary care and prevention services for the elderly, children and underserved, filling a major gap left by the departure of Valley Wide; 
   * $450,000 for Denver Health in Denver, the only major trauma center to care for the majority of low-income and uninsured individuals in Denver, to immediately expand and upgrade their facility; 
   * $85,000 for the Health District of Northern Larimer County to help build a Combined Services Center in Larimer County for mental and substance abuse treatment services. Currently, admissions to Larimer County's "Detox Unit" are growing at a rate of five to 10 percent each year, straining the County's budget and facilities; 
   * $85,000 for St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver to help fund its Mobile Mammography Program, which has screened over 3,000 uninsured women for breast cancer. 
   $170,000 for the San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center in Alamosa to help purchase software for its information technology system upgrade, which will improve patient care in its pharmacy, laboratory, radiology and nursing departments. 
   * $125,000 for the Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association based in Steamboat Springs to help pay for capital improvements (including operating costs, equipment purchases and furnishings) for primary care facilities in Walden, Hayden, and Craig. 
   * $45,000 for Aims Community College in Greeley to purchase equipment for its new Allied Health and Science learning facility, which will help train students in fields with a high demand for health professionals. Between 2003 and 2006, Aims increased its degree and certificate programs in allied health fields from one to six in an effort to meet local and state demands. 
   * $320,000 for The Children's Hospital to help with its re-location from downtown Denver to the redevelopment at the former Fitzsimons Army Medical Campus in Aurora. 
   * $254,250 for CU-Denver Health Sciences Center to establish a Linda Crnic Institute for Research and Treatment of Down Syndrome (LCI) on the Anschutz Campus in Aurora, and to attract faculty who will focus on the full spectrum, from basic research, clinical research, clinical care and treatment of children, adolescents and adults with Down's Syndrome at the state, regional and National level. 
   * $169,500 for the Colorado School of Mines in Golden to develop the Mine Safety and Rescue through Sensing Networks and Robotics Technology (Mine-SENTRY) system for mining safety applications, focusing on sensors and sensor networks, improving mine communications and predicting and reducing the risks and hazards of mining operations. 
   * $127,000 for Fort Lewis College in Durango to create an entrepreneurship center within the School of Business Administration. The center will bring and the regional community together and encourage them to form partnerships that foster creativity and enhance regional economic development. 
   * $300,000 for the Allied Jewish Federation of Colorado for a naturally occuring retirement communities demonstration project. This funding will allow for the expansion of two retirement communities for low-income seniors: Crestmoor Downs and Allied Jewish Apartments, both in Denver. 
   * $100,000 for Jefferson County for a child abuse prevention and treatment program. This program will focus on early intervention and specialized treatment plans aimed at encouraging families to utilize support systems within their own communities. 
   * $320,000 for Avista Adventist Hospital for an electronic medical record system that will unify the hospital, a community health clinic, the county health department, and private physicians. The program will enable physicians to electronically access the records and lab tests of patients, avoid duplication of services, and improve the quality of health care. 
   * $300,000 for Colorado State University for a Combined PET/CT Scanner. This cutting-edge machine is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological, cardiovascular, and bone disease, as well as cancer. 
   * $150,000 for Healing Tree Addiction Treatment Solutions, Inc. for the Northeast Colorado Substance Abuse Collaborative. Currently, the northeast corner of Colorado does not have a regional alcohol and substance abuse detoxification/treatment center, and residents who receive treatment in other areas of Colorado receive services only and have no connection to local service agencies once they return to northeast Colorado. The collaborative will bring law enforcement, social service, hospital and other medical providers in the region together to provide these residents with the support they need. 
   * $440,000 for St. Mary's Hospital Foundation in Grand Junction for the Saccomanno Education Center. The center is part of a planned hospital expansion called the "Century Project," and funds will be used to purchase new equipment and provide training for physicians, nurses, technicians, first responders, patients, and the general public. 
   * $450,000 for the University of Northern Colorado for the National Center for Nursing Education. The center will provide academic programs in nursing education, provide professional development opportunities for nurse educators, and establish a National Nursing Education Research Center. 
   * $500,000 for the National Jewish Medical and Research Center for the Center for Environmental Research. These funds will go toward the construction of the center, which will house research on clinical studies on patients with respiratory and immune diseases. Special focus will be placed on eradicating environmental and occupational illness in the Rocky Mountain region. The center will serve as a regional resource on the delivery of environmental clinical health services.
