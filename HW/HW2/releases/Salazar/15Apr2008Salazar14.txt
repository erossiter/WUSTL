SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON POPE BENEDICT XVI TRIP TO UNITED STATES
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar issued the following statement regarding Pope Benedict XVI's first visit as Pope to the United States. Senator Salazar will be attending the welcoming ceremony for the Pope at the White House on Wednesday and will also attend the Papal Mass at Washington National's Stadium on Thursday morning. 
   "I am hopeful that this week's visit to America by Pope Benedict XVI will help our nation and the world move to a greater realm of possibilities.
   "A realm of possibilities that includes finding a new direction in Iraq, addressing the issue of global terrorism and fighting the borderless issues of poverty and disease.
   "In 1993, my state of Colorado hosted Pope John Paul II for World Youth Day. Over 500,000 young people from across the globe participated in those events in Denver. After the events of that week, Pope John Paul II left Colorado and America with a message of hope and opportunity for humanity.
   "I am hopeful Pope Benedict XVI leaves our nation with a similar optimism. I look forward to hearing his message as I attend his Arrival Ceremony at the White House on Wednesday and as I participate in his Papal Mass on Thursday."
