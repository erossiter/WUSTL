SEN. SALAZAR HAILS EXTENSION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION INCENTIVES
  The United States Senate took another step toward extending renewable energy production and energy efficiency tax incentives today when it passed an amendment sponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) to the housing bill, by a vote of 88 to 8. The housing bill passed the Senate 87 to 12 earlier today. Senator Salazar, who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, has long supported extending these incentives for one year to prevent a downturn in the renewable energy production sectors, prevent a lapse in tax law, create more jobs and help reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
   According to the Denver Metro Economic Development Council, direct employment in renewable energy sector jobs in the Denver metro area surged from 5,760 in 2004 to 13,940 in 2007. The number of renewable energy companies in the seven county metro area, including Weld and Larimer counties exploded from 104 in 2004 to 1,010 in 2007. 
   The provision extends clean energy production incentives including:
   * Renewable energy production tax credits,
   * Solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credits, and
   * Residential energy-efficient property credits.
   In addition, the provision extends energy efficiency improvement tax credits for:
   * Improvements to new and existing homes,
   * Commercial buildings, and
   * The purchase of energy-efficient appliances.
   "In Colorado, and across America, renewable energy businesses and producers are making huge strides in providing cleaner, more efficient power from the wind, the sun, biological materials and more," said Senator Salazar. "These businesses work in a technological frontier where there are many risks but where the rewards will serve the public and our nation for years to come. We owe it to them to ensure stability in their sector so that they can provide more jobs in our rural areas and help improve our economic, energy and national security - extension of these tax incentives will help do just that."
   Specifics on the amendment are included below.
   Title I - Extension of Clean Energy Production Incentives
   Extension and modification of renewable energy production tax credit (IRC Section 45).
