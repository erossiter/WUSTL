SEN. SALAZAR: PRESIDENT SHOULD PROVIDE BENCHMARKS FOR SUCCESS
  I strongly share the President's hope for successful elections in Iraq this week, and for a successful democratic transition in Iraq. I also share the frustration felt by most Americans who are anxious to hear more about the specific, measurable benchmarks we expect to achieve in Iraq, and when we expect to achieve them. The American people know that our brave men and women in the military are performing an outstanding job every day. They deserve a policy worthy of their efforts.
