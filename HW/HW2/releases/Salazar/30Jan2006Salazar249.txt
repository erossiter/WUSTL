SEN. SALAZAR HELPED CONVENE GANG OF 14 TO ENSURE CONTINUED BIPARTISANSHIP
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar helped convene the 'Gang of 14' in advance of an expected vote to invoke cloture on the debate for Judge Alito's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 On Sunday, Sen. Salazar spoke with Sens. Warner (R-VA) and Nelson (D-NE) and suggested the meeting. His statement follows:
   "In anticipation of today's cloture vote on Judge Alito, I asked the 'Gang of 14' to come together to ensure the bipartisan resolve of the organization is sustained beyond today's actions. It is imperative that as the Senate provides advice and consent to the President's future judicial nominees, a bipartisan consensus will continue to be sought and the American people's values upheld."
