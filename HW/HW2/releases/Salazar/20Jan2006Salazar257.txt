SEN. SALAZAR REACTS TO JAPAN'S REPORTED HALT OF U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
  Today, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement in reaction to reports that Japan has halted all US beef imports. 
   "U.S. beef is the safest in the world. However, I am troubled to learn that Japan has found a banned material in U.S. beef shipment. Over the past couple years we have worked with Japan to formulate standards by which they would accept U.S. beef and it is imperative we hold to those standards. I am pleased that USDA has reacted quickly to this recent matter by sending a team to Japan and requiring additional export protocols in this country, including unannounced inspections of export facilities and additional training to all officials involved in the export of U.S. beef.
   "I will continue to work with my colleagues, the USDA and our trading partners to ensure that we continue to take the steps necessary to provide consumers with the safest beef in the world."
