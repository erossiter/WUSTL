SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE SENDING RESPONSIBLE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE LEGISLATION TO PRESIDENT'S DESK, AGAIN
  This afternoon the Senate once again worked to provide health care coverage to ten million uninsured children in the United States and thousands in Colorado by passing the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (H.R. 3963). The bill will now go to the President, who has said he will veto the critical piece of legislation. United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement regarding its passage: 
   "We have worked hard with Democrats and Republicans in both chambers to come to an agreement that continues to be fiscally responsible and provides critical coverage to millions of American children and thousands of children in Colorado. As demonstrated by the strong bipartisan vote in the Senate and the broad support of the American people, investing in our children's health is a high priority. Investing in the Children's Health Insurance Program is about investing in the future of America's children, ensuring they can lead healthy and successful lives. Despite that, President Bush has said yet again that he will not sign this bill. This is very disappointing. And it threatens the health and future of America's most vulnerable children. It is paramount that the President meets us halfway and signs this bipartisan bill into law. Millions of children whose health care is on the line cannot afford to wait."
