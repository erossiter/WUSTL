  On Saturday, Sen. Ken Salazar hosted two receptions for his 2007 U.S. Service Academy nominees in Denver and Colorado Springs. This year, Sen. Salazar chose 60 of the 230 students who applied for a nomination to attend one of the nation's service academies. 
   Photographs of the 40 nominees who attended the receptions are available at http://salazar.senate.gov/other/academy07.html.
   "This year's nominees show outstanding qualifications," said Senator Salazar. "I am constantly inspired by these young people. Their dedication to excellence and to their communities is second to none. I am hopeful they are all chosen for an academy appointment."
   Nominees traveled from counties across Colorado to attend Senator Salazar's receptions. Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Delta, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Garfield, Jackson, Jefferson, Mesa, Montezuma, Morgan, Otero, Pueblo and Yuma Counties were represented.
   To be considered for an appointment to one of the U.S. Service Academies (U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy) students must have a nomination from a Member of Congress or other nominating authority. Nominees are notified of final appointments by the service academies between February and April. If selected they will start at the academy in June.
