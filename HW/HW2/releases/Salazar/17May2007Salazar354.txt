CONGRESS PASSES FISCALLY DISCIPLINED BUDGET THAT CUTS TAXES FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES
  The Senate today passed the FY08 Budget Conference Report, just moments after the House approved the same, setting the blueprint for Congress' spending priorities for the upcoming Fiscal Year. After voting in favor of the budget, Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement: 
   "I am proud to support this budget. After failing to even pass a budget last year, Washington has taken an important step in restoring its credibility with the American people.
   "This budget cuts taxes for middle class families by extending marriage penalty relief and the child tax credit while providing real relief for the middle class from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). It also gives small businesses, family farms and ranches estate tax relief.
   "This budget also restores fiscal discipline to Congress by instituting Pay-As-You-Go budgeting rules. And it puts our Nation on the path to balancing the budget in just four years.
   "Finally, this budget sets funding levels for important Colorado priorities, including increasing funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides health care services to 50,000 Colorado children and 1,300 pregnant women. It also includes more than $43 billion for veterans programs, an historic increase of $3.6 billion, to improve services for our veterans around the Nation, including 424,000 veterans in Colorado. $70 million of this funding was included at the request of myself and Senator Lincoln to reduce the backlog of veterans claims, which as of last week had reached more than 647,000 claims."
