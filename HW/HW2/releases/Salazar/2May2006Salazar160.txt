SEN. SALAZAR WINS $30 MILLION TO REDUCE FOREST FIRE DANGER, BARK BEETLE BLIGHT
  Today, the U.S. Senate approved Sen. Ken Salazar's amendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill (HR 4939), the purpose of which is to provide $30 million in additional funding this year to reduce the risk of fire danger and to mitigate the effects of the widespread insect infestation.  
   In the face of extended drought over much of the state and increased hazardous fuels such as beetle killed trees, Senator Salazar introduced the Amendment to further the work the United States Forest Service is undertaking to address this dangerous situation. Senator Salazar has consistently expressed concern about fire danger this coming summer. 
   35,000 acres in Colorado are expected to receive hazardous fuels treatments in 2006, but Colorado has 47,000 additional acres in need of, and approved for, treatments to reduce fire danger. However, the USFS lacks the funding to move these projects forward in 2006. The funds in this amendment would be directed to address fire hazards resulting from insect infestation, including the bark beetle, across the country. 
   "I am pleased the Senate has agreed to provide these important funds for Colorado and the West," Salazar said. "The fire hazard created by bark beetles will impact our communities soon and this funding is vital to prevent a disaster. This modest amendment will help the USFS to move important projects off the shelf and to completion during this fire season and beyond." 
   A final vote on the Senate's version of the Emergency Supplemental is expected this week. That bill is expected to pass.
