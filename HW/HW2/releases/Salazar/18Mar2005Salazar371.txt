SEN. SALAZAR JOINS BI-PARTISAN DELEGATION ON TRIP TO MIDDLE EAST
  Sen. Ken Salazar today announced that he is part of a bi-partisan delegation, led by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), to the Middle East.  
 The trip will focus on security issues and ways in which the United 
  States can support the spread of democracy and freedom across the globe. 
   Sen. Salazar and Reid are joined by Assistant Democratic Leader Richard Durbin (D-IL), and Sens. Robert Bennett (R-UT), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Patty Murray (D-WA) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN). The delegation will be traveling next week. Due to security concerns, details of the trip will not be released in advance. 
   Sen. Salazar said, "I am excited and honored to be part of this bipartisan trip and returning to the Middle East. It will be my second trip to the area and I look forward to meeting our courageous men and women who are serving over there as well as evaluating the changes the region has undergone and lessons learned by its people and leaders." 
   Sen. Salazar is planning to meet with servicemen and women from Colorado who are serving in the area, as well as Foreign Service personnel, Peace Corps volunteers and other civil society representatives. 
   This is Sen. Salazar's second trip to the Middle East in two years. In June 2003, then Attorney General Salazar visited Israel as part of a bi-partisan delegation of state Attorneys General.
