SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON WEEK OF COLUMBINE ANNIVERSARY, VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTINGS
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement on the eighth anniversary of the Columbine High School tragedy: 
   "Today brings to close a somber week, one with the bookends of the tragedies at Virginia Tech and Columbine at either end.
   "Monday's horrific events in Blacksburg remind us that the passing of eight years has not dimmed the sadness, shock and horror surrounding the school shootings in my own state of Colorado at Columbine High School.
   It was eight years ago today that two dark souls roamed the halls of Columbine High School, acting out of a warped sense of vengeance that none of us will ever understand. When it was over, 13 innocent Coloradans were taken from this life.
   "As with Columbine High School, it is a sad truth that the name Virginia Tech will forever be synonymous with this terrible incident, which has caused a dark curtain to fall over the campus in Blacksburg. We must never forget what took place there, as we have not with Columbine. But this tragedy need not be an epitaph for an institution as proud and storied as Virginia Tech. This dark curtain shall rise, as it did in Colorado.
   "Coloradans found a way to learn from the terrible ordeal of Columbine, not only about school safety, but about our character. After the Columbine High School shootings on April 20, 1999, Colorado came together as a family. This enabled the students, the school and the community to heal. I know the Virginia Tech community will do the same, and I know that Coloradans will offer everything they can to help.
   "My thoughts and prayers, and those of the entire Nation, are with the victims of both of these sad days, their families, friends and the community."
