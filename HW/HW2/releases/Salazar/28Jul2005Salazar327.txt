SEN. SALAZAR RELEASES SPECIFIC LOCAL/STATE HIGHWAY PROJECTS FUNDED UNDER TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced specific highway projects that he expects will be funded under the transportation bill today. 
   "Transportation infrastructure is critical to the health and vitality of our state," said Senator Salazar. "I am pleased that the work I have done with Colorado's city and county officials over the past several months has translated into the funding of these essential projects. Funding them will help improve our state's transportation system so that residents and visitors alike are able to travel throughout Colorado with safety and ease."
   Included below is a list of the highway projects and the dollar amount Senator Salazar has succeeded in funding so far this year:
   * Improvements to US287 Ports to Plains - $7 million 
   * Improvements to US 160 Wolf Creek Pass - $9 million 
   * Improvements to US - 36 $9 million 
   * Fort Carson I-25 & Highway 16 Interchange - $5 million 
   * US 50 East Pueblo to Kansas Border - $5 million 
   * Heartland Expressway Improvements - $5 million 
   * I-25 Denver to Ft. Collins Improvements - $9 million 
   * Pueblo Dillion Drive at I-25 Overpass & Ramp - $2 million 
   * Denver Union Station Improvements - $3 million 
   * Improvements to 56th & Quebec Street - $9 million 
   Earlier today Senator Salazar announced that Colorado will receive a 46.75% increase over the last time the Transportation Authorization bill was reauthorized. That's the largest percentage increase under this bill and more than any other state. That is $156 million more over the life of the bill than we received under the previous transportation bill - TEA-21.
