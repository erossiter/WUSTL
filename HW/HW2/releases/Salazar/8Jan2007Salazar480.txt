SEN. SALAZAR: CONGRESS BEGINS RESTORING FAITH OF AMERICAN PEOPLE TODAY
  Senate efforts to restore Americans' faith in Congress began today as Sen. Ken Salazar spoke on the floor in favor of ethics reform. 
   "Today we begin to restore the faith of the American people in Congress," said Sen. Salazar. "Last November the American people sent a clear message that the relationship between Members of Congress and lobbyists was too cozy. They were fed up with special interest groups lavishing members with gifts, meals and travel. In return, special projects were inserted into bills with no knowledge of who sponsored them or even if they were essential to the government and bills were being passed with little time for review. This culture of corruption ends today as we bring accountability back to the process and show the nation we are worthy of the faith they have put in us to lead this country."
   Highlights of the bill include:
   * A ban all gifts, meals, and travel paid for by lobbyists. 
   * Requirements of public disclosure, within 3 days, of any "hold" placed on a nomination or piece of legislation. 
   * Close the "revolving door" between Congress and K Street by extending the "cooling off" period for Members of Congress and stiffening the rules regarding the lobbying activity of former senior staff. 
   * Require that conference reports be made available to the public at least 48 hours before their consideration by the Senate. 
   * Require a list of earmarks in each bill, the identity of the Senators who proposed them, and their essential government purpose. 
   Senator Salazar has also introduced an amendment with Senator Kerry (D-MA) today to cancel taxpayer-funded pension benefits to Members of Congress who are convicted of serious ethics offenses - crimes such as bribery and conspiracy. The amendment was offered last year as a bill called The Congressional Pension Accountability Act, or "The Duke Cunningham Act."
   "The only thing crazier than giving a member of Congress convicted of a crime a federal pension is the fact that we still need a bill to prevent a convict from receiving their pension. Any member of Congress who abuses their position of authority for their personal profit deserves a prison sentence, not a government pension," said Senator Salazar.
