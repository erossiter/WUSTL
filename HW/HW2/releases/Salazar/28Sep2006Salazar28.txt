SEN. SALAZAR VOTES FOR LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING MILITARY TRIBUNALS
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after voting for legislation that would create a military tribunal system. 
   "The bill I voted for today was the best bill we could reasonably expect in this highly charged political environment. I am relieved that Senators McCain, Warner and Graham, former Secretary of State Collin Powell, and others helped preserve the fundamentals articulated in the Geneva Convention; a cornerstone to preserving America's moral high ground in the global efforts against terror.
   "Due to the many controversial and far-reaching implications of this bill, I believe it would be appropriate to force Congressional review of this bill in five years. I have concerns with this bill, but on balance it meets my personal view of what America needs to get the job done."
