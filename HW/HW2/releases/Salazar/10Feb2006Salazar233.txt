SEN. SALAZAR SUPPORTS WHITE HOUSE PATRIOT ACT DEAL
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced that he has joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in support of the compromise reached between the Senate and the White House on the PATRIOT Act. 
   "As Colorado's former Attorney General, I feel the PATRIOT Act must be re-authorized in order to provide our Nation's law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to keep the public safe. I believe this compromise does a better job of giving law enforcement those tools while protecting the civil liberties of Americans than the earlier law and the initial conference report.
   "This compromise is not perfect, but it does reflect some concessions from the White House. I am pleased the compromise includes provisions shielding most public libraries from turning over information. I always knew this was a negotiation and we weren't going to walk away with everything we wanted."
   The new measure would give recipients of subpoenas the explicit right to challenge an accompanying judicial order not to discuss the case publicly, though they would have to wait one year. This would also prevent the F.B.I. from demanding the names of lawyers consulted by people who receive secret government requests for information. The deal would also prevent most libraries from being subject to those requests.
