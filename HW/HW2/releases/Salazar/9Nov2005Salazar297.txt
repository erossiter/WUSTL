SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR COLORADO POLICE
  $1 million in federal funds is poised to help provide Colorado's police with improved training, patrol vehicle technology upgrades and better anti-crime tools as part of the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations bill conference report expected to be approved by Congress and signed by the President in the near future. United States Senator Ken Salazar successfully fought for almost $1.6 million in federal funding for nine Colorado projects under the CJS Appropriations conference report. 
   "Every day, the over ten thousand police officers across the state Colorado are putting their lives on the line for our safety. These funds will help them do that better and safer, so they can return home to the families safely, the same as they allow us to do every night," said Senator Salazar.
   Overall, Senator Salazar was able to include $1.15 million in federal funds for six public safety projects under CJS Appropriations conference report. These projects include:
   * $300K to the Central Mountain Police Training Facility to purchase communication equipment, tactical vests, respirators and personal protection equipment as well as a mobile command center and allow for training at various levels. The Central Mountain Region is made up of seven counties: El Paso, Pueblo, Teller, Park, Chaffee, Custer and Fremont; 
   * $250K to the Western Forensic Law Enforcement Training Center to support the Center's research in forensic sciences and homeland security; 
   * $100K for In-Car Video for Grand Junction to purchase in-car video systems for marked patrol vehicles in the Grand Junction Police Department; 
   * $200K for In-Car Video for Durango and Alamosa to purchase in-car video systems for marked patrol vehicles in each city's police department; 
   * $150K for Jefferson County Combat Methamphetamine Project to enhance Jefferson County's ability to interdict methamphetamine availability and provide a safe and effective response to the children involved in these interdiction efforts; and 
   * $150K to the National Center for Audio/Video Forensics to be used by CU-Denver to strengthen cross-disciplinary, inter-institutional collaborations for research in forensic sciences and homeland security. 
   Senator Salazar also secured $400,000 in educational and social service funds for three additional projects:
   * $100K to the I Have a Dream Foundation to support programs in Colorado that operate in low-income, educationally underserved areas to help students work toward and realize the goal of a college education; 
   * $200K to the Challenger Center for Space Science Education of Colorado Springs to aid the Center's mission of designing and developing space-related educational programs that will attract Colorado students to careers in science, mathematics, engineering and technology fields; and 
   * $100K to the Denver Rescue Mission to support the New Life Drug and Alcohol Addiction Rehabilitation program for homeless individuals in Denver. 
   The CJS Appropriations bill conference report now heads back to the House and Senate for final approval, which is expected. Once approved by both houses of Congress, it will head to the President's desk where it is expected to be signed into law.
