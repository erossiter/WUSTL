SEN. SALAZAR CONTINUES PUSH FOR GREATER COOPERATION FROM BLM, INTERIOR
  Today, Senator Ken Salazar continued his efforts to secure greater cooperation from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Department of Interior with the state of Colorado regarding oil and gas development in the State, drilling on and around the Roan Plateau, and other public land-use issues. Senator Salazar met with Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne outlining his concerns about the need for prudent and thoughtful development of oil shale and oil and gas drilling on public lands, including the Roan Plateau. 
   Also, in an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing today, Senator Salazar voted to send Bureau of Land Management nominee James Caswell's nomination to the Senate floor, therefore making Senator Salazar's 'hold' on the nominee official. Mr. Caswell's nomination will not move forward until Senator Salazar receives commitments from the BLM and the Department of Interior.
   In his meeting with Secretary Kempthorne, Senator Salazar asked the Secretary for:
   * A letter committing that the BLM and the Department of Interior will work cooperatively with the state of Colorado and the communities on the Western Slope with respect to the development of public lands; 
   * A commitment by the Department of Interior to create sufficient opportunities for the state of Colorado and local communities to provide meaningful input regarding oil shale development; and 
   * A commitment from the BLM to delay issuance of any leases on the Roan Plateau until the state of Colorado has had ample time to consider the options with respect to drilling. 
   "The BLM and Department of Interior need to work in a cooperative manner with the state of Colorado and local communities as they develop oil and gas drilling leases and plans," said Senator Salazar. "Today, I asked Secretary Kempthorne for a commitment that the BLM and Department of Interior will not continue to run roughshod over Colorado and our Western Slope communities in regards to the Roan Plateau and other energy development issues."
