SEN. SALAZAR SECURES $1 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR NORTHWESTERN COLORADO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved $1 Million in funding for transportation projects in Northwestern Colorado. The projects were funded at the request of Sen. Ken Salazar as part of the FY07 Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill (FY07 TTHUD). 
   "Colorado's infrastructure is already under severe strain, and with our state's population expected to blossom over the next 20 years, it's important for us to get out ahead of the curve," said Senator Salazar. "I'm pleased to announce the projects, which will bring much-needed improvements to Northwestern Colorado."
   Under the FY07 TTHUD, the Northwestern region of Colorado received $1 Million for Safety and Shoulder Improvements on SH13 from Craig to the Wyoming-Colorado Border: SH13 is one of the only north-south routes in Northwestern Colorado to connect I-70 and I-80 in Wyoming, and is seeing increased use by heavy trucks because of its proximity to federal lands now seeing extensive new oil and gas leasing under the Energy bill passed by Congress and signed into law last year.
   Northwestern Colorado will also benefit from the $5 Million for the Colorado Transit Coalition, the state transit coalition, to be allocated for bus transit services and facilities among the 29 partners of the Coalition, including Grand Junction, Telluride, Roaring Fork Transportation Authority, Berthoud, Gunnison Valley RTA and others.
   The FY07 TTHUD Appropriations now goes on to the full Senate for consideration later this year.
