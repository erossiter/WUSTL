SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS DECISION TO LOCATE NATIONAL MAPPING CENTER IN DENVER
  Denver will soon be home to the newly reorganized National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC), part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Sen.  
 Salazar along with Sen. Allard, Representative Beauprez, Mayor of Lakewood Steve Burkholder and others have urged Patrick Leahy, Acting Director of the USGS, to locate the NGTOC in Denver. The NGTOC will consolidate the operations currently performed in four USGS mapping centers (Menlo Park, Calif.; Rolla, Mo.; Denver, Colo.; and Reston, Va.) and other sites to one location, the Federal Center in Lakewood.
   "This decision is good news for Colorado and supports what I've known all along; we have a highly skilled workforce that is second to none," Senator Salazar said. "One of the reasons we maintain this level of talent in our region is our high quality of life." Criteria cited by USGS in choosing Colorado includes Livability, Infrastructure, Program Effectiveness, Operational Costs, Partnership Coordination and Strategic Skill Development.
   The NGTOC will support all production activities and technical services associated with the USGS Cooperative Topographic Mapping Program, The National Map, Federal Geographic Data Committee, Geospatial One Stop, and Department of Interior Enterprise Geospatial Information Systems. Services to be provided by the Center include geospatial data integration and quality assurance, cartographic production, contract management, software and applications development, and hosting of geospatial data and applications.
