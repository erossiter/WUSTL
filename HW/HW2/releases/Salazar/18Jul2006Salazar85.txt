SEN. SALAZAR, REP. SALAZAR SECURE FUNDS FOR ALAMOSA, CORTEZ AIRPORTS
  Rep. John T. Salazar, a Member of the House Aviation Subcommittee, and Sen. Ken Salazar today announced their combined efforts have resulted in Essential Air Service (EAS) funds being secured for airports in Cortez and Alamosa. 
   Said Congressman Salazar: "Small airports are what keep rural communities and economies connected together. It's astonishing that a person can fly roundtrip to Europe for cheaper than it costs to fly from our district to Denver. This money will allow rural Colorado to better connect with the national air transport system, opening up new economic opportunities and helping make rural travel easier and more affordable."
   When reports of Great Lakes Aviation service being discontinued were first circulated last year, both Salazars initiated a campaign to increase funds for subsidized air service to guarantee rural communities' continued access to affordable air travel. Through their efforts, Great Lakes Aviation has received the needed levels of EAS funding which will guarantee Great Lakes flights each day from Alamosa and Cortez for the next two years. Alamosa will be receiving $1,150,268 in federal funds to provide three daily non-stop flights to Denver and Cortez will be receiving $796,577 to provide the same service.
   Said Senator Salazar: "Essential Air Service is an important economic artery for our rural communities, and I am very pleased that the Department of Transportation will be continuing EAS service to these two airports."
