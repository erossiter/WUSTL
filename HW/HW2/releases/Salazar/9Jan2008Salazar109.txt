SEN. SALAZAR NOMINATES ELBERT COUNTY STUDENT FOR U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar announced that he nominated 40 outstanding Coloradans from all across the state to our Nation's service academies. All of the nominees show outstanding qualifications. The candidates come from very diverse backgrounds and their academic and extracurricular accomplishments are impressive. From Elbert County, Senator Salazar is nominating the following students: 
   Mark Palmer (United States Air Force Academy): Mark is a Cherokee Trail High School senior and Varsity Golf Captain. Mark has always dreamt of becoming an officer in the United States military. Mark's enthusiasm, consistency and positive attitude has made him a valuable leader in both the classroom and his activities. With a strong work ethic and knowledge about the world, Mark eagerly seeks to continue his success at the Air Force Academy. 
   "Each year, the applicants for the service academies get better and better," said Senator Salazar. These applicants are future leaders of our country, and I am encouraged by their drive to succeed and their eagerness to serve our Nation. Choosing to serve our Nation is one of the most admirable aspirations a young person can have and I respect each of the students for making that choice."
   To honor the 2008 Service Academy nominees, Senator Salazar will be hosting two receptions on Saturday, January 12 at 11:00 AM in Denver (PPA Event Center, 2105 Decatur Street, Denver, CO) and 2:00 PM in Colorado Springs (Tutt House, 1205 N. Cascade Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO). Press is welcome to attend.
   Senator Salazar received over 200 applications from high school seniors from across Colorado and chose candidates through a rigorous application and interview process. To be considered for an appointment to one of the U.S. Service Academies (U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy) students must have a nomination from a Member of Congress or other nominating authority.
   Nominees are notified of final appointments by the service academies between February and April. If selected they will start at the academy in June.
