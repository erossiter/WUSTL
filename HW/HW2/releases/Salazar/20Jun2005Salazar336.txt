SEN. SALAZAR'S STATEMENT REGARDING CLOTURE VOTE ON JOHN BOLTON
  "I voted today to support my Senate colleagues in our quest for information pertaining to Mr.  
 Bolton so that we can exercise our constitutional responsibility of advise and consent. As Colorado's former Attorney General, I know the importance of sharing intelligence between different organizations. It is no different here in Washington. The White House is abusing its power by withholding this information and preventing the Senate from making a fully informed decision. We should be improving the sharing of intelligence here in Washington not blocking it."
