SEN. SALAZAR URGES DOD TO SET FIRM SCHEDULE FOR SAFE DESTRUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AT PUEBLO
  Sen. Ken Salazar introduced Senate Resolution 480 Tuesday stressing the importance of the United States meeting its obligations to clean up Pueblo Chemical Depot as soon as possible. 
   The Department of Defense has already said they will miss the 2012 deadline imposed by the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty deadline. Senator Salazar hopes that this resolution will keep the Department of Defense on track to finish their work as soon as they can.
   "The people of Pueblo deserve to have this project completed as quickly as possible. The Department of Defense must not lose sight of their goals to complete their task. While I understand that deadline may be missed, that does not mean that the eventual destruction of all the weapons at the Pueblo Chemical Weapons Depot should become less of a priority."
   Senator Salazar's resolution also requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with a schedule for the safe destruction of the U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles, including those stored at the Pueblo Chemical Weapons Depot.
   "The U.S. must remain accountable for our commitment under the Chemical Weapons Convention to clean up Pueblo Chemical Depot," Salazar added. "The people of Pueblo deserve no less."
