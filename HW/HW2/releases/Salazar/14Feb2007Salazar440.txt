SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ARMY'S DECISION REGARDING PINON CANYON
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after the Army announced its plan to move forward on a five-year acquisition plan to expand its Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site: 
   "The farmers, ranchers and residents of the Pinon Canyon area have earned the right to be involved in the Pinon Canyon expansion decision-making process. I will watch carefully as this process unfolds and emphasize to the Army that they should not use eminent domain if they move forward with an expansion, that they should openly share any and all plans for expansion with the public as soon as they formulate them and that the public should have ample opportunity to comment and participate in any process put in place.
   "Farmers, ranchers and Fort Carson are all vital to Colorado -- any potential expansion at Pinon Canyon should seek to minimize any potential negative impacts."
