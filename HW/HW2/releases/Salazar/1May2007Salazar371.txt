SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES NEW VA CLINIC FOR EASTERN COLORADO
  Veterans in eastern Colorado will no longer have to drive hours to Denver for a doctor's appointment. Sen. Ken Salazar today announced that the Department of Veterans' Affairs will locate a VA outreach health care clinic in Burlington, Colorado. 
   "This is a great victory for the veterans of eastern Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "After serving our Nation with honor and distinction, we owe our veterans the respect of providing real access to the health care they were promised. This is an important piece of keeping that promise."
   The award of a clinic to Burlington comes less than three weeks after a specific request by Senator Salazar to the VA to place the new veterans outreach clinic for VISN 19 in Burlington. A copy of Senator Salazar's letter to VA requesting the clinic can be viewed at http://salazar.senate.gov/images/pdf/070413vac.pdf.
   Colorado is home to two VA hospitals, one in Grand Junction and one in Denver, as well as 11 community-based clinics. However, this new clinic in Burlington is the first to specifically serve Eastern Colorado, and is expected to serve an estimated 10,000 Colorado veterans.
