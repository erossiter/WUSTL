SEN. SALAZAR CO-SPONSORS BILL TO DESIGNATE ?HEARTLAND EXPRESSWAY' FOR NORTHEASTERN COLORADO
  Sen. Ken Salazar on Tuesday became an original cosponsor of S.549, a bipartisan bill written by Colorado's senior Sen.  
 Wayne Allard, to recognize two Colorado highways as the "Heartland Expressway." 
   The "Heartland Expressway," according to the official legislation, would extend from Denver, through Scottsbluff, Nebraska to Rapid City, South Dakota. Specifically, I-76 from Denver to Brush and Colorado Highway 71 from Limon north to the Colorado-Nebraska border would be designated as the "Heartland Expressway." These roads would also be designated a high-priority corridor and be eligible for additional funds from the Borders and Corridors program. 
   Senator Salazar said, "I am proud to help bring this historic designation to Northeastern Colorado, which will provide an accessible and easy route to connect cities and regional trade centers. I look forward to working with Senator Allard and my colleagues Senator Thune of South Dakota and Senators Hagel and Nelson of Nebraska towards the completion of this very important corridor."
