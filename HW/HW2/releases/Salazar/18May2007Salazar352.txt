SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT CONCERNING U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  Sen. Salazar's Statement Concerning U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: 
   "Over the past several months I have followed closely the events and revelations related to Alberto Gonzales as United States Attorney General and White House counsel. I have concluded that it is in the best interest of the Department of Justice to have new leadership to restore the trust and confidence of the American people in this keystone department of our Nation's government.
   "The people deserve a Justice Department that is an independent and forceful voice in defense of our Nation's laws. Therefore, I believe it is in the best interest of our Nation for the Department of Justice to get a fresh start with a new Attorney General."
