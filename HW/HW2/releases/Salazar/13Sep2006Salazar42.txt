'GOOD SAMARITAN' MINE CLEAN-UP BILL APPROVED BY COMMITTEE
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced today that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved the "Good Samaritan" mine clean-up bill. 
   S. 1848, the "Cleanup of Inactive and Abandoned Mines Act," introduced by Sen. Salazar, encourages community groups, companies, and individuals to clean up mines under the provisions of a permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and exempts them from liabilities outside the strict obligation to complete a carefully considered clean-up plan. State approval and full public participation is required in every instance.
   "Those Good Samaritans who want to clean up Colorado's numerous inactive or abandoned mines should be able to do so," said Senator Salazar. "This bill will promote the clean up of these sites under the guidance of the appropriate interests - the EPA, the states, and the public. Colorado's and the West's natural landscape is a part of our national heritage and we must work towards preserving them so their legacy can be passed on to future generations."
   Senators Harry Reid (D-NV), Wayne Allard (R-CO), Max Baucus (D-MT), Tom Carper (D-DE) and Johnny Isakson (R-GA), and Governors Bill Owens (R-CO) and Kenny Guinn (R-NV), have rallied to support the legislation introduced by Senator Salazar. Several major mining companies, the Colorado Water Congress, Trout Unlimited and the Western Business Roundtable have also endorsed the bill, as have several public officials. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson has also expressed his strong support for passing Good Samaritan legislation this year.
   The bill will now go to the full Senate for consideration.
