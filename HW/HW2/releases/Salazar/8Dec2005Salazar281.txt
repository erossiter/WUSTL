SEN. SALAZAR OFFERS CONGRATULATIONS ON ROCKY FLATS CLEAN-UP
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement congratulating all those who worked so hard to clean-up Rocky Flats. Today the Department of Energy approved their work, moving the former nuclear weapons plant one step closer to becoming a National Wildlife Refuge. 
   "Completion of the cleanup of Rocky Flats is a remarkable achievement. What was one of the most contaminated and dangerous places on earth will soon become a National Wildlife Refuge. Incredibly, the cleanup was accomplished ahead of schedule and under budget. This success is due to the hard work of many people and organizations: Kaiser-Hill, whose creative leadership was essential to this project; the local residents and governments, who demanded the transformation of Rocky Flats; the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment; the U.S. Department of Energy; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; the Colorado Attorney General's office and, of course, the workers of Rocky Flats, who served our nation from Cold War to cleanup. All Coloradans, and all Americans should take pride in the accomplishments of this outstanding public and private partnership."
