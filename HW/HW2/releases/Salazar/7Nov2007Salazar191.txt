SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON FUNDING FOR PUEBLO CHEMICAL DEPOT, 2017 DEADLINE IN DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT
  Coloradans living near the Pueblo Chemical Depot could soon have certainty on the progress of weapons destruction at the Depot as the 2008 Defense Appropriations bill is one step closer to passage. Senator Salazar announced today that the 2008 Defense Appropriations bill conference report includes $142.4 million in funding for chemical demilitarization activities at the Pueblo Chemical Depot. 
   "This funding is a huge step forward and great news of the residents of Pueblo," said Senator Salazar. "This deadline will ensure the DoD moves as quickly and as safely as possible to finish the job. And, it provides them the resources they need to meet this goal allowing Coloradans living near Pueblo Chemical Depot to breathe a sigh of relief."
   This funding will accelerate weapons destruction at Pueblo Chemical Depot, with the goal of meeting the congressionally ratified treaty deadline of 2012 for chemical demilitarization activities. This funding will supplement $35.2 million that Senator Salazar and Allard successfully fought to include in the Senate-passed FY 2008 Military Construction-Veterans' Affairs Appropriations Act and conference report. The bill also includes language requiring the Department of Defense to complete chemical weapons destruction activities by 2017 if it fails to meet the treaty deadline of 2012.
   Now that the conference report has been finalized, it must now be passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the President.
