SEN. SALAZAR HOLDS HEARING FOR 83-YEAR-OLD BETTY DICK TO PRESERVE HER FAMILY HOME IN ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK
  Sen. Ken Salazar today helped take the next critical step forward in the fight to preserve the family home of Mrs.  
 Betty Dick located in Rocky Mountain National Park.
   "The Park Service pulled a bait-and-switch on Betty Dick, and this attempt to remove her from a family home is an over-reach by the government that should be halted," Senator Salazar said. "Today, Mrs. Dick helped put a human face to this issue and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that she can live out her days in her family home."
   Today, Mrs. Dick was able to testify before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks as part of a hearing on Senator Salazar's Betty Dick Residence Protection Act, S.584.
   Mrs. Betty Dick is the 83-year-old owner of a family home in Rocky Mountain National Park. Under a 1980 settlement agreement with the National Park Service, Fred Dick and his wife Betty were allowed to occupy their family home on its existing property for 25 years. Fred Dick passed away in 1992 but Betty remains at the property. That arrangement with the Park Service expired earlier this month. This legislation would allow her to live on the property for her remaining years.
   The next step for Senator Salazar's legislation will be a markup (review, revision and Committee vote to approve or disapprove) by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee before then going on to the full Senate for consideration.
