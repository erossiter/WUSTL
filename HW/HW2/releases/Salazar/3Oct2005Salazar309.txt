SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS TO U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Salazar Statement on Nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court of the United States 
   "I congratulate Ms. Harriet Miers for her nomination to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court."
   "As I did with Justice Roberts, I will judge the President's next nominee on the following basic principles: fairness, impartiality and a proven record of upholding the law. I will also take into account that this nominee will fill a vacancy left by a 'trailblazer' of the Supreme Court, Justice O'Connor. She was not only the first woman on the court but she brought an independent and moderate perspective to the court. I will take those qualities into consideration when deliberating the record and qualifications of Ms. Harriet Miers."
   "The Senate Judiciary Committee will complete a full, fair and proper review of Ms. Miers' record. Based on the Committee's work, and my own careful study, I will perform my constitutional duty."
