SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROCKY FLATS SEC RECOMMENDATION
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement after today's recommendation by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health on Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) status for former Rocky Flats workers: 
   "I remain extremely concerned over the very limited class of workers approved by the Advisory Board.
   "I am glad, however, that the Board is adhering to the June 12, 2007 deadline for NIOSH to demonstrate that they have alternative methodologies that can estimate dosages with sufficient accuracy.
   "If NIOSH can not meet this standard by the June 12 meeting of the Board, I will join the petitioners in their request that the Board recommend approval of additional classes of workers for the Special Exposure Cohort.
   "As I said yesterday, I am on the side of Rocky Flats workers, and our government should be too. They are entitled to a final and just answer."
