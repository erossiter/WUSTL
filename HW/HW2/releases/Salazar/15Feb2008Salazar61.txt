SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY SHOOTINGS
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar issued the following statement in response to the massacre that occurred at Northern Illinois University yesterday, killing six people and injuring several others.  
   "Yesterday's horrendous acts at Northern Illinois University are tragic. It is difficult to comprehend that this has happened again at one of our Nation's institutions of higher learning. In Colorado, we have faced the terrible massacre of Columbine and the senseless shooting of a high school student at Platte Canyon High School in 2006. And this past winter we dealt with the tragic shootings at New Life Church and the Arvada missionary center, but through all, we came together as one community to overcome such tragedies and heal. The Virginia Tech community came together after that tragedy last year and I believe that the community at Northern Illinois will do the same. My thoughts and prayers, and those of the entire Nation, are with the victims of this massacre, their families, friends and the community."
