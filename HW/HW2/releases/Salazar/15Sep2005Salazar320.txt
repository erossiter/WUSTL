SEN. SALAZAR'S BILLS FOR BLIND VETERANS, LONG-TERM CARE ADOPTED BY SENATE VETS COMMITTEE
  Veterans in Colorado and across America are now one step closer to improved health care after Senate Committee action today. Two provisions by Sen. Ken Salazar, one to expand sight rehabilitation programs and the other to improve long-term care, were added to the Veterans Health Care Act (S.1182).  
  "As a nation, we made a promise to America's veterans, including the 433,000 in Colorado, to provide them with the highest quality health care assistance when they returned safely home. These bills bring us one step closer to fully keeping that promise," said Sen. Salazar.
   Senator Salazar's two additions to the Veterans Health Care Act will:
   * Increase the number of outpatient specialists at VA medical centers by placing Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialists (BROS) at 35 medical centers within 30 months of passage at a cost of $14.5 million over five years ($3.5 million a year for two years and $2.5 million a year for three additional years). While the VA introduced BROS in 1996 to offer training with living skills, mobility and technology, there are only 10 world-class VA blind rehab centers across the nation, and in many parts of the country, including Colorado, there are no BROS at all. For these veterans, treatment can mean the difference between being imprisoned at home and living independent, rewarding lives. Currently, there 135,000 blind veterans in America (35,000 of whom are already in the VA system), including 1,400 in Colorado, 700 of whom live in the Denver area. Senator Salazar first introduced this proposal as S. 1190, the Blinded Veterans Continuum of Care Act, in June, 2005; and 
   * Require the VA to publish its strategic long-term care plan within six months. This plan was recommended by the CARES Commission over a year ago but the VA is still working on the plan. Sen. Salazar's proposal sets a deadline and puts in place key requirements, including cost-and-quality analyses of the entire spectrum of care. Currently, Colorado has 135,000 veterans over the age of 65 but only 100 beds in two VA nursing homes - a 60-bed facility in Denver and a 40-bed facility in Pueblo, along with six state-run nursing homes around the state which were facing drastic funding cuts under the FY06 budget proposal by President Bush. Senator Salazar first introduced this proposal as S.1189 in June, 2005. 
   The Veterans Health Care Act (S.1182), with Senator Salazar's improvements, will now proceed to the full Senate for consideration.
