SEN. SALAZAR INTRODUCES BILL TO ENCOURAGE DOMESTIC VIGILANCE, PROTECT INNOCENT AMERICANS
  United States Senator Ken Salazar introduced legislation today to ensure that Americans who report suspicious terrorist activity are immune from lawsuits brought against them. In addition, the legislation clarifies that federal officials who responsibly respond to reports by individuals are immune from lawsuits that exist under federal laws and statues. Language is also included in Senator Salazar's legislation to protect innocent Americans from false reports. 
   "Protecting the homeland is the first responsibility of the federal government, and Washington should encourage Americans to be vigilant and protect them when they do the right thing," said Senator Salazar. "At the same time, we must protect the civil rights and liberties of every American. My proposal does both."
