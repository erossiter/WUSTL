SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES 'PRIORITY' FEDERAL FUNDING STATUS FOR 10 COLORADO DRUG TASK FORCES
  Methamphetamine use and addiction is a growing and dangerous problem across Colorado, especially in rural areas on the Eastern Plains and Western Slope. Sen. Ken Salazar today announced that his efforts in Congress to combat meth have led to 10 drug task forces across Colorado securing "priority" funding status under the FY07 Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) appropriations bill, the first step towards a share of $85 million in national anti-meth funding. 
   "Meth is a shadow falling across Colorado, especially our rural communities," said Senator Salazar. "Ten Colorado agencies will now be at the front of the line for funding because they are already on the front lines of the war against meth."
   The "priority" funding status for these drug task forces come as a result of direct outreach to law enforcement experts and leaders in Colorado by Senator Salazar earlier this year, including the County Sheriffs of Colorado, the Colorado District Attorneys Council and the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police.
   The 10 multi-jurisdictional drug task forces tagged for "priority" funding are:
   * Delta/Montrose Drug Task Force; 
   * Greater Routt and Moffat Narcotics Enforcement Team (GRAMNET); 
   * 16th Judicial District Drug Task Force (Bent, Crowley, Otero); 
   * Canon City/Fremont County Combined Drug Task Force; 
   * San Luis Valley Drug Task Force; 
   * Weld County Drug Task Force; 
   * Eagle County Drug Task Force; 
   * 22nd Judicial District Drug Task Force (Dolores/Montezuma County); 
   * West Metro Drug Task Force (Jefferson County area); and 
   * North Metro Drug Task Force (Thornton/Adams County). 
   "Every day, these multi-jurisdictional drug task forces are fighting the spread of meth in Colorado, and I plan to fight in the Senate to make sure that these 'priority' designees are retained in the final bill and eventually receive the federal funding they need to continue their outstanding efforts," said Senator Salazar.
   Since coming to the Senate in 2005, Senator Salazar has been especially active in fighting methamphetamine. In 2006, Senator Salazar successfully added the Combat Meth Act, one of his first co-sponsored bills in the Senate, to the PATRIOT Act reauthorization signed into law by President Bush earlier this year. The Combat Meth Act limits the sale of pseudoephedrine, the primary ingredient used to make methamphetamine, stiffens penalties for production and trafficking, and creates restrictions on the production of meth. It also provides an additional $99 million per year for the training of local and state officials on identifying and locking up meth offenders, and $20 million to help all levels of government provide help and education to children who have been affected by meth. Senator Salazar has also fought to create an anti-meth task force within the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).
   The FY07 CJS Appropriations bill now goes on for consideration by the full Senate.
