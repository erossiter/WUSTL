SEN. SALAZAR BROTHERS TOUT INCLUSION OF MESA VERDE EXPANSION BILL IN YEAR-END APPROPRIATIONS MEASURE
  The move to expand Mesa Verde National Park took a major step forward this week with its inclusion in the year-end appropriations bill. The Mesa Verde National Park Boundary Expansion Act of 2007 (H.R.783/S.126) will be voted on in the House tonight as part of the omnibus spending bill and may be considered as early as tomorrow in the Senate. 
   "Mesa Verde is the home to some of the world's most remarkable archeological treasures," Rep. Salazar said. "With this expansion and the passage of this legislation, this incredible national park will be further preserved and enhanced for future generations."
   "Mesa Verde is of immeasurable historical, archeological and environmental value to the Four Corners area and our Nation," said Senator Salazar. "I am proud that this expansion resulted from cooperation between the National Park Service, the local community, and landowners. Their good work will help ensure the protection of these priceless resources for generations to come."
   The National Park Service, a local Montezuma County family, the Conservation Fund and the Mesa Verde Foundation are working together to make the expansion possible. The property includes 324 acres owned by the Henneman family. Their property would be purchased by the Conservation Fund and transferred to the park. On top of that 324-acre transaction, the Mesa Verde Foundation will donate another 38 acres to the park. The bill will help facilitate the creation of a new Mesa Verde Visitor's Orientation Center. 
   The Henneman property is adjacent to Mesa Verde National Park. At one time, a mile of the park's access road ran across the family's property. The Henneman family has owned the property for more than 30 years.
