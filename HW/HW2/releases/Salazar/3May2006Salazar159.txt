SENS. ALLARD, SALAZAR REMIND COLORADO SENIORS OF MAY 15 DEADLINE TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN
  The May 15, 2006 deadline for enrollment into the Medicare drug benefit plan (known as Part-D) is fast approaching. However, 100,000 eligible Coloradans on Medicare not covered by any prescription drug plan have yet to enroll in Part-D. In response, Colorado's Sens. Wayne Allard and Ken Salazar today reminded these 100,000 Coloradans to enroll today. 
   "As the final date for enrollment draws near it is important for Coloradoans to sign up for the Medicare Part D benefits," said Senator Allard. "There are many resources available for those who need assistance when signing up for a plan. Please contact my nearest district office where a member of my knowledgeable staff can help you sign up and answer any questions."
   "The cost of prescription drugs is a tough challenge for Coloradans on Medicare to meet, and enrollment in this plan will make these life-preserving medications more affordable," said Senator Salazar. "Coloradans on Medicare who have yet to enroll should do so immediately."
   Medicare beneficiaries who miss the enrollment deadline will face long-term financial penalties once they do decide to enroll. Those who fail to enroll by May 15th will not be able to enroll until November 15, 2006 and will face a one percent per month premium increase for each month that they wait to enroll. If Medicare beneficiaries don't enroll by December 31, 2006, the next enrollment period begins November 15, 2007 and enrollees will be penalized an additional 12% of whatever the national average is on that date.
