SEN. SALAZAR SUPPORTS FREE DIGITAL SIGNAL TO DENVER
Sen. Ken Salazar (D-CO) released the following statement today after S. 4902 passed the Senate yesterday. 
 "I supported the bipartisan legislation adopted yesterday to ensure that Colorado does not become a dark hole of digital broadcasting. Without this legislation, Colorado would not have had the infrastructure in place to meet the 2009 deadline to switch to a digital signal. As Colorado has been known as a world class state, we must ensure that we are not saddled with second rate infrastructure and technology."
 The bill now awaits action in the House.
