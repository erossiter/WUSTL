SEN. SALAZAR ANNOUNCES ENERGY, WATER PROJECTS FOR COLORADO THAT CLEAR FIRST FUNDING HURDLE
  Colorado could see as much as $68.4 million in federal funding headed its way for Fiscal Year 2008 under the FY08 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee late last week. The funding would be used to support 16 Colorado energy and water projects included in the bill at the request of Sen. Ken Salazar.
   "The approval of this bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee is the first step in a long process to securing funding for these important Colorado projects," said Senator Salazar. "These projects will improve water quality for residents and continue to make Colorado the renewable energy capital of the Nation. I am pleased with today's results." 
   The bill contains funding for nine water projects for Colorado included at the request of Senator Salazar:
   * $63 million for the Animas-La Plata project in Durango to build the project, which will supply an additional 66,000 acre-feet (AF) of water (plus another 38,000 AF for municipal and industrial uses) to 100,000 people in southwestern Colorado and nearby areas. The project is the lynchpin of the 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement (amended in 2000) and is currently under construction. The funding represents a $5 million increase from the President's request of $58 million;
  * $149,000 for Fountain Creek in El Paso, Pueblo and Teller Counties for the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the watershed study on Fountain Creek, which has been troubled recently by flooding and sewage spills. The study was started in 2003 to evaluate improvements to infrastructure, restoration of habitat, and construction of flood mitigation projects;
   * $273,000 to continue the Chatfield Reallocation study by the Army Corps of Engineers;
   * $2 million for Cherry Creek and Chatfield Reservoirs and Trinidad Lake for renovations of recreation facilities in conjunction with the State of Colorado. These three sites host over three million visitors annually, but have aging and under-designed recreation facilities that often fail to meet basic public health, safety and accessibility standards;
   * $100,000 for South Boulder Creek in Boulder for the Army Corps of Engineers to begin a reconnaissance study on the South Boulder Creek floodplain, after a recent technical analysis showed several hundred homes were within the floodplain and at risk for flood damage; and
   * $1 million for the Colorado School of Mines' Colorado Center for Sustainable Energy, to expand research and development into coal gasification and carbon sequestration technologies as well as hybrid fuel and biomass fuel systems.
   Also included in the bill at the request of Senator Salazar were instructions to the Army Corps of Engineers to give "priority" designation for four Colorado projects:
   * Arkansas River Habitat Restoration in Pueblo, to complete the Arkansas River Fisheries Habitat structures along a nine-mile stretch of the River below Pueblo Dam, including removal of non-native plants and the planting of native trees, shrubs, willows, and wetland plants. The project is currently 95 percent completed;
   * Goose Creek in Boulder, to improve, restore, or enhance approximately one mile of South Goose Creek (and the associated riparian zones) and Cottonwood Pond, which suffer from storm water discharges from Pearl Parkway and adjacent industrial and commercial areas;
   * Lower Boulder Creek in Boulder, to help re-establish the creek, which was straightened and channelized due to gravel mining in the 1950s and 1960s and is now dominated by non-native species; and
   * Tamarisk eradication along the Colorado River and in Mesa County, to remove and manage tamarisk and Russian olive plants and help restore the riverbanks, flood plain hydrology, and fish spawning and habitat areas.
   In addition, the bill includes instructions for the Department of Energy to gather enough geologic information at specific sites in Colorado to allow the development of an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) project in Colorado, which will blaze a trail as the first coal-based commercial-scale IGCC power plant in the nation to actually employ CO2 capture and sequestration.
   Having been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee, the FY08 Energy and Water Appropriations bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
