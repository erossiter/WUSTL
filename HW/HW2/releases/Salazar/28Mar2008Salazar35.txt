SEN. SALAZAR, ENERGY SECRETARY BODMAN HIGHLIGHT COLORADO AS NEW FRONTIER IN RENEWABLE ENERGY, LEADING NATIONAL EFFORTS FOR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE
  America is too dependent on foreign oil, our economy is struggling, climate change is a threat to our environmental security, and Colorado -through its unique combination of renewable energy resource potential, world-renowned research institutions and highly capable workforce- is leading the national effort to create a new, clean energy future for America.
   These, and other energy-related topics, were the focus of United States Senator Ken Salazar's 3rd annual energy summit, New Frontiers in Energy Summit 2008, which provided over five-hundred of Colorado's government, business and research leaders with a forum to discuss how Colorado's renewable energy revolution is providing real solutions to the unique national, environmental and economic security challenges of our time. 
   The New Frontiers in Energy Summit 2008 featured a keynote speech from the United States Secretary of Energy, Samuel W. Bodman. It also included presentations from pioneers and trailblazers in the new energy frontier, including Mitch Mandich, CEO, Range Fuels; Soren Bo Christensen, Vestas-American Wind Technology; David Hiller, Executive Director, Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory; Stephen Brand, Senior Vice President, Technology, Conoco Phillips; and many others. In their remarks, each speaker highlighted Colorado's leadership in the new energy economy, and commended its forward-thinking research, business and government communities for leading the charge.
   "Our energy future is bright, but only if we continue to commit ourselves to developing our next frontier: a new energy economy," said Senator Salazar. "There is a clean energy revolution underway in Colorado. Anchored by preeminent renewable energy research institutions such as NREL and the Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, Colorado is quickly making itself into the renewable energy capitol of the world. The simple fact that Energy Secretary Bodman participated in this summit exemplifies Colorado's essential leadership towards meeting our Nation's energy security challenges."
   "I am proud to host my third annual New Frontiers in Energy Summit to highlight the great work that is being done here in Colorado, as we continue to be a trailblazer in our Nation's quest for a cleaner energy future."
   "Putting clean energy technologies to work is a key component of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's mission," NREL Director Dan Arvizu said. "Secretary Bodman's and Sen. Salazar's support for collaborations between researchers and industry has given a huge boost to our efforts to move renewable energy technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace."
   "We at the Collaboratory are proud of our contribution to Colorado's leadership in renewable energy, and we're honored to be a co-sponsor of Senator Salazar's third energy summit," said David Hiller, Executive Director of the Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory. "I look forward to our continued work together as we put Colorado on the map as home to some of the world's most premier renewable energy research and development."
   With 300 days of sunshine in a year, strong winds sweeping the eastern plains and plenty of biomass, plant and animal waste, Colorado has a diversity of world-class renewable energy resources, and is home to some of the world's most renowned research facilities. Colorado has thus quickly become a prime location for several renewable energy companies from across the world and from an array of energy sectors that find the state supportive of their efforts.
   A few reasons why Colorado is the renewable energy capitol of the world:
   Forward-thinking Leadership
   * The State Renewable Electricity Standard: Colorado was the first state to adopt a renewable electricity standard (RES) by ballot initiative in 2004 (Amendment 37). The original RES required 10 percent of Colorado's electric portfolio to be from renewable sources of energy by 2015. Renewable energy development outpaced this standard by such a wide margin that Colorado's goal will be met seven years early, in 2008. As such, Colorado's state legislature doubled the RES goal last year to 20 percent by 2020.
   World Renowned Renewable Energy Research Institutions
   * DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO is the only federal laboratory whose primary mission is to conduct research and development of renewable fuels and energy sources that fundamentally change the way we power our homes, businesses, and cars. The federal lab employs about 1,000 people and is currently building a $100 million research center and preparing to start work this year on a $55 million facility to expand its research into renewable-energy technologies.
   * The Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory was launched in 2007, with the public signing of an agreement between the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU), Colorado State University (CSU), the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), and Midwest Research Institute, manager of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The four Colorado-based institutions committed to join forces to perform world class research, develop new energy technologies in partnership with private industry, and transfer these advances as rapidly as possible to the marketplace.
   Abundant Renewable Energy Resource Potential
   * Wind Energy: With strong winds sweeping Colorado's eastern plains, Colorado offers exceptional wind power potential and is a prime location for wind energy development.
   * Colorado's installed wind power capacity jumped from 250 MW at end of 2003 to more than 1,000 MW by end of 2007.
   * Currently, Colorado has two on-line utility size wind farms generating 60MW and 162MW. Xcel Energy's Windsource program, which offers consumers the choice of paying a modest premium for clean energy, is the most successful program of its type in the US. The power plant, rated at 162 megawatts (MW) will be built in southeast Colorado near Lamar. It will be the largest wind power plant in the Rocky Mountains, and the first to be included in a utility's "rate base" or its standard portfolio of power generation.
   * Solar Energy: Colorado's San Luis Valley and Eastern Plains are home to some of the U.S.'s best concentrated solar power potential.
   * SunEdison's 8.22 MW Alamosa, CO plant completed in December 2007 is the second largest Solar Photovoltaic plant in the world. It is smaller than only Nellis Air Force Base's new 14 MW plant in Nevada.
   * Fort Carson, in Colorado Springs, is Colorado's largest military base and is also taking steps to integrate solar energy. The Mountain Post's award-winning Solar Energy Array is a 2-megawatt ground-mounted solar photovoltaic system that has the potential to produce energy for over five hundred homes.
   * Biofuels
   * In 2004, there were no ethanol plants in Colorado. Today, there are four plants producing over 125 million gallons per year.
   * Range Fuels, based in Adams County, Colorado, will soon be the first company in the country to have an operational commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant (currently under construction near Soperton, Georgia).
   Smart Energy Technology
   * Xcel Energy: Colorado's biggest utility, which serves 1.7 million gas and electric customers - has been expanding wind and solar farms since voters passed Amendment 37, the original renewable-energy goal, in November 2004. In March 2008, Xcel announced that it would make Boulder the first full-scale "smart grid city." With this move Xcel will transform Boulder into an important test bed for emerging smart grid technologies and will bring up to $100 million in investment from a consortium of five companies that will install smart gird components throughout the city's electric infrastructure. The smart grid will make the electric grid more efficient and reliable, and will provide an important means for consumers to become aware of the real-time costs of electricity, enabling them to understand and manage their own energy usage and change consumption habits.
   Renewable Energy Companies are Choosing Colorado
   With plenty of sunshine and wind, tons of biomass and world class research institutions, Colorado is an attractive option for renewable energy companies from all over the world.
   * According the Denver Metro Economic Development Council, direct employment in the renewable-energy sector in the metro area more than doubled to 13,940 in 2007 from 5,760 in 2004.
   * Colorado ranked 10th in the country in renewable-energy employment with 15,400 workers in 2007 employed in the renewable energy sector.
   * There were about 104 renewable-energy companies in the seven-county metro area in 2004. Last year, that number jumped to 1,010, (including Weld and Larimer counties).
   * Vestas, a world-leading Danish wind turbine manufacturer, opened its first North American manufacturing facility in Windsor, CO in March 2008. The plant will employ 600 people locally and will construct blades for wind turbines that will
   * ConocoPhillips recently announced plans to locate their new Global Technology and Corporate Learning centers in Louisville, CO. The center will be the company's hub for research and development of renewable energy and high-tech carbon fuels recovery.
   * Abengoa Solar, a world-leading Spanish concentrated solar power company, established its U.S. headquarters in Lakewood, CO in 2007. They currently employ 20 people but plan to triple its size in Colorado as it begins to work on utility-scale solar projects in the state and nationwide.
   * Camco International has based its U.S. headquarters in Douglas County. The company, which develops and aggregates carbon credits worldwide, plans to work on local projects and expand its staffing level in the coming months
   * Ascent Solar Technologies is headquartered in Jefferson County is a developer of thin-film photovoltaic modules. The company currently employs over 30 people and Hydro, a Fortune Global 500 based in Norway, owns a 23 percent stake in the company.
