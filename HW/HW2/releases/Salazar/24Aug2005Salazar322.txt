SEN. SALAZAR APPLAUDS FOREST SERVICE FOR STUDYING ALTERNATIVES TO TWIN LAKES BRIDGE
  Sen. Ken Salazar applauded the United States Forest Service (USFS) for its decision to protect the Twin Lakes panorama.  
 The Forest Service considered erecting a pedestrian bridge over the narrowest point of Twin Lakes. Sen. Salazar's office has been in contact with the USFS over the last several weeks after hearing from local residents about their concerns over the potentially unsightly bridge. The Forest Service is now studying alternatives to the bridge that will reroute the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail around the perimeter of Twin Lakes.
   "I applaud the citizens of the Twin Lakes area for voicing their concerns and fighting to protect one of Colorado's most treasured vistas," said Salazar. "I also applaud the USFS for listening to the concerns of Coloradans and seeking acceptable alternatives."
   The USFS is studying options to connect the Continental Divide Trail throughout Colorado. Twin Lakes, Colorado's largest glacial lake is nestled at the base of Colorado's highest peak, Mt. Elbert.
