SEN. SALAZAR OUTLINES AGENDA FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  Working to confront the reality of our dependence on foreign oil and soaring energy costs across the country, Sen. Ken Salazar articulated today a comprehensive approach to energy independence from the floor of the United States Senate. 
   "The time to get serious about growing our way to energy independence is long overdue," said Senator Salazar. "In Brazil, ethanol substitutes for over 40 percent of all gasoline sold nationally. If Brazil can do it, it is inexcusable for the United States of America, the strongest nation on earth, to do otherwise."
   Senator Salazar, a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a cosponsor of a congressional resolution aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy, outlined a two-pronged plan to put America on the on the path to sustainable energy independence: increasing renewable fuel production and passing the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act (S. 2025) so that American consumers can more effectively harness the potential of alternative fuels.
   "We need to build a new energy policy, one built on the promise of renewable energy, and Americans are eager to do this," Senator Salazar added. "In states across the country, people imagine a renewable energy future that harnesses the entrepreneurship and work ethic of Rural America, and which breathes new life into sagging rural economies. We have devoted a lot of time and a lot of talk in this session to short-term solutions. But when a system is breaking down, you have to address the cause as well as the symptoms."
