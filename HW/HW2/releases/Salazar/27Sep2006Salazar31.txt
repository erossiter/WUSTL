SEN. SALAZAR REQUESTS USDA TAKE STEPS TO BRING RELIEF TO COLORADO FARMERS SUFFERING FROM PROLONGED DROUGHT
  Sen. Ken Salazar requested that USDA issue a waiver to increase the cap on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres from 25 percent to the maximum 30 percent in Colorado's Weld, Morgan, and Adams counties in order to allow farmers in those counties to utilize the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). By allowing producers in these areas to access CREP funds, USDA would be giving these hard hit producers a much needed lifeline. In addition, local and State funds are currently available to provide a match requirement for CREP. 
   Farmers in Colorado's Weld, Morgan and Adams counties have suffered from several years of drought which was exacerbated by an irrigation water-well shutoff earlier this year.
   In his letter to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns, Senator Salazar wrote, "The development of CREP for this three county region is a vital step in ensuring the future agricultural viability for the area. Local and state funds are available to provide the match required for this program. In addition, CREPs have been extremely successful in the Republican River Basins of Colorado and Nebraska, and are desperately needed to provide the same opportunities to our farmers and ranchers along the South Platte River."
