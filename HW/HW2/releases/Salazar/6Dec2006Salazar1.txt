SEN. SALAZAR, ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES TO REVIEW SUPERMAX
Sen. Ken Salazar today announced he will tour the Supermax prison in Florence, CO with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on February 21st, 2007. 
 Senator Salazar said, "the security of the Supermax prison and the safety of the residents near the prison is paramount, and I am pleased that Attorney General Gonzales has agreed to tour the site early next year. His visit will bring added attention to the security issues at the prison."
 Attorney General Gonzales committed to touring the "Supermax" facility with Senator Salazar during a meeting between the two on November 17th, 2006. During that meeting the Attorney General also re-stated the Bureau of Prison's commitment to add 18 staff members to "Supermax" by the end of this month.
 The Nation's most dangerous federal prisoners are held at the "Supermax". Recently, the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General issued a report concluding that "the Bureau of Prisons has not ensured that mail for terrorist and other high-risk inmates . . . is consistently read and analyzed to detect terrorism, criminal activities, or other inappropriate behavior."
 Sen. Salazar also extended an invitation to Senator Allard to join on the tour with the Attorney General.
