SEN. SALAZAR REACTS TO INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS SHOWING LOOMING MASSIVE CUTS TO VETERANS' HEALTH CARE BENEFITS
  Sen. Ken Salazar, a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, released the following statement in response to media reports that the President's budget would move towards a balanced budget by choking off Veterans' health care spending: 
   "The President has faced serious questions about his budget since it was released. But this latest revelation is beyond disappointing.
   "Balancing the budget on the backs of our Veterans and with cynical budget shell games is simply unacceptable. The President needs to make right by our Veterans, our budget and the American people. I strongly urge the President to reconsider the deep cuts to Veterans' health care he seems to be taking into account. Our Veterans deserve better."
   According to media reports, internal White House budget documents indicate the White House assumes that the budget for Veterans' health care services would only increase by 11 percent next year and would then be cut for three years in a row after that. Many of these rising health care costs are attributed to troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, a cost increase that took the Department of Veterans' Affairs by surprise last year and resulted in them needing an emergency infusion of over $1 billion in funds to survive FY06.
