   A copy of Senator Salazar's letter is attached below:
   Dear Under Secretary Garman and Director Arvizu:
   Thank you for your communications yesterday concerning our successful efforts to restore funding for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. As we discussed, this is a step in the right direction and will restore the momentum to make NREL the keystone center for renewable energy for the Nation. Again, I thank both of you and Secretary Bodman for your collective leadership and efforts on renewable energy and new technologies related to energy independence.
   I look forward to President Bush's visit tomorrow. I will greet him later this afternoon here in Colorado, and then I will meet with him again in the morning to talk about the future of renewable energy efforts and to accompany him to NREL.
   I believe energy independence for America is an imperative for all of us and that we can and will find a way to transcend the partisan politics of Washington on this important agenda. I wholeheartedly welcome President Bush to Colorado and NREL and hope his visit helps begin a new chapter in America's energy future.
   Respectfully,
   Ken Salazar
  United States Senator.
