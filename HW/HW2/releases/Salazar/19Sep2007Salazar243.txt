SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON WEBB AMENDMENT
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement after Senator Jim Webb's amendment was not accepted by the Senate. Senator Webb's amendment would have provided much needed relief to our troops in the battlefield. Senator Salazar was a co-sponsor of the amendment.  
    "This war is one that has been fought on the backs of our military and their families and they have paid the highest price in this war. Our troops are overextended. They have been deployed, redeployed and deployed again and we need to address the stress that the war is placing on them. Senator Webb put forth a fair and bipartisan proposal that puts our troops and their families first. It ensures that our troops are adequately trained and equipped and that they have adequate time at home between deployments. I am disappointed that the amendment was not accepted and look forward to additional opportunities this week to forge a bipartisan compromise on finding a new way forward in Iraq."
