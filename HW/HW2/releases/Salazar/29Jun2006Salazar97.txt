SEN. SALAZAR STILL CONCERNED WITH VA SECURITY DESPITE RECOVERY OF STOLEN LAPTOP
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement in reaction to the news today that the Veterans' Administration recovered the laptop they announced stolen on May 22. 
   "The recovery of the laptop is certainly good news. However, my relief that this data is back in the VA's hands does not erase my grave concern about the underlying, unaddressed problems with the VA's data security. My request to Secretary Nicholson that he provide Congress with a long-term plan to secure the personal information of our nation's veterans still stands."
