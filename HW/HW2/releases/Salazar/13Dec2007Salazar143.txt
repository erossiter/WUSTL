SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON MITCHELL REPORT
  Today, United States Senator Ken Salazar issued the following statement in response to the Mitchell Report which linked several Major League Baseball players to steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. 
   "The Mitchell report is troubling. I have yet to review the entire report to evaluate the extent that the use of steroids and other banned substances has plagued Major League Baseball over the past two decades. However, I am disappointed by preliminary indications that the report provides specific information to support the fact that this epidemic was more widespread than previously thought. So many young people look up to professional athletes as role models, and it is disconcerting that a significant number of those athletes would set such a poor example."
