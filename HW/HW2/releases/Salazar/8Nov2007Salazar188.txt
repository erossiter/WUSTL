SEN. SALAZAR OPPOSES JUDGE MUKASEY NOMINATION
  Tonight, the United States Senate approved the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be United States Attorney General by a vote of 53-40. Senator Ken Salazar opposed Mukasey's nomination and issued the following statement after his vote:  
   "Tonight I voted to oppose Judge Mukasey's nomination. I did not support his nomination because I was deeply troubled that he has been unwilling to clearly and unambiguously state that he will uphold U.S. law barring the use of water-boarding. When I met with Judge Mukasey earlier this week, I was disappointed with his response when I asked him specifically about what he would do as Attorney General if he were asked whether an agent could use water-boarding in an interrogation setting. He said he did not know and that it depended on whether or not there was intent to cause pain. That answer, in my view, is unacceptable. 
   "I recognize the importance of compromise and collaboration in affirming nominations. However, there are some fundamental, core principles for which we must stand. These principles are tested, no doubt, in the face of violence and war, but it is in these moments when they are all the more important. The fact that we do not torture is fundamental to who we are and, in conflict after conflict, has helped ensure that American prisoners are treated with the same dignity that we afford our enemies. For me, this is not a complex issue. It is not open to interpretation or equivocation. Our laws are clear, and we need an Attorney General who will enforce them, no matter what."
