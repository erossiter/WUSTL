SEN. SALAZAR WELCOMES NEW CONGRESS, TO PRESIDE OVER SENATE
  As the 110th Congress came into session today, Sen. Ken Salazar welcomed it as a new day in Washington and the nation. Senator Salazar is also scheduled to preside over the Senate at 2:00PM EST/ 12:00PM MST today. 
   "Today the 110th Congress began on the right note - a note of bipartisanship - with a meeting of all the members of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats," said Sen. Salazar. "We must work together if we are to create a better life for the people of this nation and we must remember that the spirit of bipartisanship that is with us today must remain with us for the entire session if we are to accomplish our lofty goals.
   "Majority Leader Reid has an ambitious agenda for us in the first several weeks of this term. It will begin with ethics and lobbying reform, and will move on to increasing the minimum wage, reforming the Medicare Prescription Drug program, and acting on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations. These goals are critical for our nation and will require us to work together, as a Senate, to accomplish them."
   Now that Democrats are in the majority the task of presiding over the U.S. Senate will fall to members of that party. Today at 2:00PM EST/ 12:00PM MST, Senator Salazar will preside over the Senate for the first time. Senate proceedings can be watched on C-SPAN 2 in most markets.
