CONGRESS SUCCESSFULLY OVERRIDES PRESIDENT'S VETO OF WATER BILL; INCLUDES OVER $120 MILLION FOR CRITICAL WATER PROJECTS IN COLORADO
  Funding for water projects throughout Colorado will be restored despite President Bush's veto as the United States Senate today successfully voted to override the President's veto on the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) by 79-14. The House of Representatives earlier this week also successfully voted to override the President's veto by 362-54. WRDA contains over $120 million for critical water-related projects in Colorado included at the request of Senator Salazar. The report authorizes federal spending on water development, infrastructure, flood control and other projects conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. 
   "Today we were able to override the President's veto and will now be able to move forward on providing funding for urgent water projects that will have critical and long lasting impact in Colorado," said Senator Salazar. "Today the Congress stood up to the President and we stood up for the farmers, ranchers, and communities of Colorado that rely on the precious amount of water the projects in the bill help provide."
   At Senator Salazar's request, WRDA includes funding authorization for the following projects throughout Colorado:
   * $79 Million for Arkansas Valley Conduit: WRDA includes a $79 million authorization for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in Southeastern Colorado. The construction of this conduit will fulfill a long-standing promise to the people of the lower Arkansas Valley for fresh drinking water and is one of the keystones for the economic revitalization of Southeastern Colorado;
   * $10 Million for the Boulder County Pipeline: WRDA includes a $10 million authorization for construction of a water pipeline, which will protect drinking water quality and allow for year-round water delivery from Carter Lake to Boulder and other municipal area water providers;
   * Fountain Creek Watershed Study: WRDA includes specific instructions to the Secretary of the Army to speed up completion of the Fountain Creek Watershed Study, the first step towards the clean-up and protection of Fountain Creek for all the communities. The importance of this study was underscored earlier this year when the Creek flooded parts of Pueblo along Dillon Drive, damaging several homes and businesses.
   * $5 Million Authorization for a Statewide Selenium Study: WRDA includes a $5 million authorization for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct regional and watershed-wide studies to address selenium concentrations in Colorado, which in high doses can be fatal to humans, livestock and wildlife.
   * South Platte River, Colorado- WRDA includes a $13.06 million authorization for use in partnership with state and local entities to complete flood mitigation, habitat restoration, and improved recreation along the South Platte River in Denver, to be matched by more than $7 million in non-Federal funds.
   * $25 million for the Rio Grande Environmental Management Program in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, which provides for the ongoing restoration and management of the Rio Grande, which is headwatered in Colorado, and its tributaries such as the Alamosa and Conejos Rivers.
   * $1 million for water and wastewater infrastructure for the Ute Mountain Project in Montezuma and La Plata Counties.
