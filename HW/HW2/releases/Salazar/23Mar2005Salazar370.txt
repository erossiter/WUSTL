SEN. SALAZAR COMMENTS ON 2005 SOCIAL SECURITY TRUSTEES REPORT
  Sen. Ken Salazar today released the following statement on the 2005 Social Security Trustees Report: "The release today of the 2005 Social Security Report by the President's own handpicked Board of Trustees confirms what I and many of my colleagues have been saying for some time and what we were told by General David M. Walker, head of the non-partisan Government Accountability Office fewer than two weeks ago: Social Security is on sound financial footing for decades to come.  
 "I will continue to oppose the President's plan to privatize Social Security because it will only result in deep cuts to benefits for retirees, a massive increase in debt and would be insolvent 11 years earlier, in 2030. Even his Administration knows that privatizing part of Social Security does not add one day to the solvency of the Social Security program, which is what we need to be working on."
