SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON USDA ANNOUNCEMENT OF INCONCLUSIVE POSITIVE BSE TEST RESULT
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement:
   "American beef is the best in the world.  
 Tonight Secretary Johanns reported an inconclusive positive BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) test result, which conflicts with an earlier test on the same beef. Therefore, no one should jump to any conclusions concerning this inconclusive test result until the additional tests are completed.
   This news does nothing to change the fact that American beef is the best in the world. I will continue to follow closely the results from the tests being conducted in England as I work with my colleagues in the Senate, the Administration and with Colorado's ranchers."
