SEN. SALAZAR USES SENATE RULE TO SLOW-DOWN BLM DRILLING PLAN, PROTECT PRISTINE ROAN PLATEAU
  Sen. Ken Salazar announced today that he would place a Senate "hold" on the nomination of James Caswell, the President's nominee to replace Kathleen Clarke as Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Senator Salazar plans to initiate and continue the "hold" until Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne agrees to give Colorado Governor Bill Ritter the reasonable additional time he has requested to review the Roan Plateau Management Resource Plan. In addition, Senator Salazar requested that the BLM make a commitment to work more cooperatively with the State on energy issues important to Colorado. 
   "I plan to use the Senate rules available to me to send a strong and clear message to the BLM that their decision and action to ignore the requests of the Governor of Colorado and myself are unacceptable."
   "As I have said before, the top of the Roan Plateau is one of Colorado's special places, and I believe that this unique Colorado crown jewel should not be opened to drilling for oil and gas at this time.
   "Throughout this entire process, the BLM has never once shown a pressing need for such a rushed process and immediate development. At every opportunity, the BLM has insisted upon forging ahead in this process, limiting and disregarding public input.
   "Although this 'hold' can not directly stop the BLM from moving forward without public input, it does make the BLM aware that there are serious consequences for their blatant disregard of the opinions of the people of Colorado.
   "I will continue to examine all of my options to correct the BLM's misguided direction."
   Several weeks ago, Senator Salazar joined Governor Ritter in requesting an extension of 120 days to review the Roan Plateau Management Resource Plan.
