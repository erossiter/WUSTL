SEN. SALAZAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON CEASEFIRE AGREED TO IN ISRAEL, LEBANON
  Sen. Salazar's Statement on the Ceasefire Agreed to in Israel and Lebanon: 
   "I welcome the United Nations' actions leading to the ceasefire that took effect this morning in Israel and Lebanon. The past month of conflict has taken a terrible toll on civilians in the region, and I hope that the tide has turned definitively in the direction of peace. To sustain this positive momentum, it is critically important that the international community work quickly and effectively to deploy an international force capable of supplementing Lebanese security forces to bring stability to southern Lebanon. I continue to believe that intense U.S. diplomatic engagement is necessary both to protect our own security and to achieve a just and lasting resolution to the conflict."
