SEN. SALAZAR CONTINUES PUSH FOR ARMY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PINON CANYON PLAN
Sen. Ken Salazar sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of the Army Installations & Environment, Keith Eastin, asking him to provide Coloradans with information on the Army's plans for Pinon Canyon. Earlier this year, the Army was required by Section 2827 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 to provide Congress, including Senator Salazar, with a report by November 30, 2006 on the potential expansion of the proposed Pinon Canyon Maneuver site. That report has yet to be delivered. 
 In the letter Senator Salazar stated, "I cannot stress enough the importance of receiving this information and being able to provide it to the concerned citizens of Southeastern Colorado. To that end, I request you provide me with the date the report will be delivered, and a briefing from your office on this matter at your earliest convenience."
