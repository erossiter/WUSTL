SEN. SALAZAR URGES SENATE ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS HIS BILL TO PROTECT 250,000 ACRES IN ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK
  Sen. Ken Salazar urged the leadership of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold hearings and mark-up S.1510, the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act. That bill would add almost 250,000 acres within the park to the National Wilderness Preservation System. 
   "The natural beauty of the Rocky Mountain National Park must be preserved for future generations to enjoy," Salazar said. "I am pleased to have the support of the Colorado water community, as well as the local towns and counties. It is imperative that when changes such as these are proposed that local communities are consulted. Their input will guarantee the success of such efforts."
   Transferring land within the park to the National Wilderness Preservation System will mean no one will be permitted to develop any part of that land. Some lands in National Parks, such as Rocky Mountain National Park, can be developed at the park superintendent's discretion.
   Senator Salazar also submitted to the Committee leadership an amendment to S. 1510 that will allow for a buffer zone near the town of Grand Lake, a bike trail on the east shore of Lake Granby, and a slight increase in the size of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area. Before proposing the changes, Salazar consulted with local communities, interested parties and the bill's House sponsor to assure they were all supportive of the plan.
