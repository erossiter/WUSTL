SEN. SALAZAR: NOT PASSING FARM BILL PULLS RUG OUT FROM UNDER NATION'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS
  After crafting a strong, bipartisan bill in the Senate Agriculture committee and after 10 days of debate on the Senate floor, today Senate Republicans used their 53rd filibuster this year to block the 2007 Farm Bill. United States Senator Ken Salazar released the following statement expressing his extreme disappointment in not being able to move forward on debate of the bill. The Senate voted 55-42 to move forward on the bill. Sixty votes were required to move forward. 
   "Today, Republicans blocked the Senate from moving forward on the Farm Bill, which will revitalize rural America through smart investments in renewable energy, a stable and secure food supply, and responsible conservation of our land and water. We have worked hard through the committee process and on the floor to craft a robust, bipartisan, forward-thinking, and balanced package. I am extremely disappointed that Republicans have chosen to engage in political theatre rather than working to pass a Farm Bill that will directly impact our farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and families across America.
   "Unfortunately, for too long Washington has overlooked the opportunities that Rural America can provide, and, through a policy of neglect and disinterest, has allowed small towns and rural communities across the country to wither on the vine. I came here to be a voice for rural America. I will keep working to get this bill across the finish line and to the President's desk for his signature."
