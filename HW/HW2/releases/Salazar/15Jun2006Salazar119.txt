SEN. SALAZAR SUPPORTS LEGISLATION TO ENSURE ARMY PROVIDES INFORMATION ON PINON CANYON EXPANSION PROPOSAL
  Sen. Ken Salazar released the following statement on his co-sponsorship of legislation requiring the Army provide information to Congress, and therefore the public, on their expansion plans for the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. The legislation is an amendment to the DOD Authorization Bill (S. 2766) and is sponsored by Sen. Wayne Allard (R-CO). 
   "Last month I held a public meeting about the proposed Pinon Canyon expansion with concerned community members, the Army and Fort Carson officials; at the meeting I heard the frustrations of the local community and one of the biggest was a need for clear and concise information on the proposed expansion," said Senator Ken Salazar. "The Army and Fort Carson are committed to getting information as soon as possible to the local community. This amendment will ensure that we can continue a transparent dialogue, with clearly outlined proposals, between the Army, Fort Carson and local landowners."
