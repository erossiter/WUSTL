SEN. SALAZAR TO OFFER AMENDMENT TO REDUCE FOREST FIRE DANGER & BARK BEETLE BLIGHT
  Sen. Salazar will offer an amendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill's (HR 4939) to be considered later this week, with the intention to provide $30 million to effectively reduce the risk of fire danger and to mitigate the effects of the widespread insect infestation.  
   In the face of extended drought over much of the state and increased hazardous fuels such as beetle killed trees, Senator Salazar will introduce the Amendment to further the work the United States Forest Service is undertaking to address this dangerous situation. Senator Salazar has consistently expressed concern about fire danger this coming summer and is using this amendment as a vehicle to increase funding to the Forest Service as a first step. 35,000 acres in Colorado are expected to receive hazardous fuels treatments in 2006, but Colorado has 47,000 additional acres in need of, and approved for, treatments to reduce fire danger; however, the USFS lacks the funding to move these projects forward in 2006. The funds in this amendment would be directed to projects of this type across the country. 
   "Time and time again, residents around Colorado have expressed their concerns about bark beetles and the resulting fire danger near their communities. One of the fundamental issues that Congress must deal with is making the needed investments in our forests. This modest amendment represents a small boost in funding to help the USFS move important projects off the shelf and to completion during this fire season and beyond." 
   This amendment will provide funds to reduce hazardous fuels, promote forest health programs and mitigate the effects of bark beetles all of which have been creating extreme fire danger among America's National Forests.
