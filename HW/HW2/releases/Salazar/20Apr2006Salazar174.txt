SEN. SALAZAR PLEDGES TO CONTINUE FIGHT FOR ROCKY FLATS WORKERS' BENEFITS
  "Rocky Flats workers contributed greatly to our victory in the Cold War. Many have suffered from cancer and other illnesses as a result of their exposure to radiation and other substances in the course of their dedicated service. I will continue to fight for the payment of medical care and survivors' benefits for these American heroes and their families. NIOSH's assertion that it has the necessary information to calculate the radiation doses received by Rocky Flats workers is premature. There is an on-going review process which has raised very specific and far-reaching questions about the completeness, quality and integrity of the data being used by NIOSH to calculate these radiation exposures. Those questions need to be answered properly and as quickly as possible."
