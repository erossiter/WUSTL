SEN. SALAZAR JOINS NEW 'GANG' TO SET AMERICA FREE FROM FOREIGN OIL
  Ongoing political instability and uncertainty in the Middle East and recent skyrocketing fuel prices exacerbated by Hurricane Katrina have exposed the economic and national security consequences of America's dependence on foreign energy sources. Sen. Salazar is working with a bi-partisan group of Senate leaders to make America more energy independent. In a press conference today, Sen. Salazar announced the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act of 2005. 
   Senator Salazar was joined by Senators who he coined as the "Gang of Independence," referring to America's energy independence, including Senators Lieberman (D-CT), Graham (R-SC), Brownback (R-KS), Nelson (D-NE), Bayh (D-IN), Sessions (R-AL), and Coleman (R-MN). All seven Senators, including Senator Salazar, are original co-sponsors of the bill.
   "Our Nation's over-dependence on foreign energy is a threat to our economic and national security," said Senator Salazar. "The burden of high fuel costs is crushing our farmers, commuters and everyone who struggles day by day to make ends meet. Energy independence for America can no longer be just a goal; it is a necessity. America deserves better and this bill will deliver."
   Specifically the bi-partisan Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act of 2005 has the following provisions to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil:
   Renewable Fuels: 
   * Promotes development of biorefineries to help the United States grow and harvest more of its transportation fuels. 
   * Promotes development of cellulosic ethanol, and promotes the development of infrastructure for E85 (85% ethanol) 
   Vehicle Efficiency: 
   * By 2012, automakers must install 10 percent of their fleets with technology - such as flexible fuel (which means a car can use ethanol blends of up to 85% instead of the normal limit of 10%), clean diesel and electricity - that would result in a 25 percent increase in fuel efficiency over and above CAF? standards. 
   * The percentage of the fleet required to have these technologies would increase by 10 percent annually until it reaches 50 percent in 2016. 
   * Provides retooling tax credits for manufacturers and suppliers of advanced diesels and hybrids. 
   * Creates a tire efficiency program for tires used on light duty vehicles. 
   * Creates a fuel economy testing program and the implementation of efficiency standards for heavy duty vehicles (trucks, buses, etc). 
   * Creates an R&D program for electric drive transportation and light-weight materials. 
   * Lifts the per manufacturer cap on consumer tax credits for the purchase of hybrids and advanced diesels. 
   * Allows hybrids to qualify under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 alternative fuels fleet requirements. 
   * Provides a tax credit for large private fleets for purchasing more efficient vehicles for their fleets. 
   * Encourages local educational agencies to develop a policy to reduce the incidence of school bus idling. 
   * Closes the SUV tax loophole, which provides perverse incentives to small businesses to purchase SUVs over other vehicles. (This section incorporates Senator Salazar's Reduce Incentives to Guzzler Gas bill, S. 1852).
