SEN. VOINOVICH TEST DRIVES LATEST LOW- CARBON FUEL VEHICLE
  Today, U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) met with Ford Motor Company representatives on Capitol Hill to discuss the newest technology in low-carbon fuel vehicles and test drive one of these concept cars. The display featured three different types of low-carbon fuel vehicles: the Ford Escape Hybrid E85, a renewable fuel hybrid electric vehicle; the HySeries Edge, a low-carbon fuel plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; and the S-MAX, a common rail fuel injection clean diesel vehicle. Each vehicle represents the near future of low- carbon fuel technology, holding great potential to significantly reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and U.S. dependence on foreign oil. This is yet another great example of moving toward what Sen. Voinovich refers to as the "Second Declaration of Independence" - this time from foreign sources of energy.
