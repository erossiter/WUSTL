SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES OVER $3.1 MILLION FOR SENIOR HOUSING IN SOUTHEAST OHIO
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $3.13 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Section 202 Program for the Community of Christ "Supportive Housing for the Elderly" program in Barlow, Ohio.  
   "I'm pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Community of Christ. With these funds, a 30-unit apartment complex will be developed to help seniors live independently, while still receiving the care they need," said Voinovich. 
   The project involves the expansion of housing facilities through the addition of one-bedroom units, a security system, an on-site manager and other community amenities. In addition, funds will also be used in an outreach campaign to minority populations to make them aware of the available housing opportunities.
