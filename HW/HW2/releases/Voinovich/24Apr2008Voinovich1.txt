SEN. VOINOVICH HELPS SECURE EMERGENCY DECLARATION AFTER DEVASTATING SNOW STORM
  Today, President Bush declared an emergency for the state of Ohio, triggering the release of federal funds to help communities respond to the record snow fall that occurred March 7-9, 2008. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), Ohio's senior senator, led a letter to the president from the Ohio Delegation last month asking for the emergency declaration. 
   "Having personally seen the devastation caused by the recent snow storms, I can attest to the severity of the damage in the affected counties," Sen. Voinovich said. "I am pleased that the president recognized the need to provide federal assistance. This will hopefully bring some much-needed financial relief to communities that are still suffering."
   As a result of the declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will provide emergency assistance for any continuous 48-hour period during or approximate to the March storm. Ashtabula, Brown, Clermont, Clinton, Crawford, Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Geauga, Greene, Hardin, Huron, Lake, Morrow, Richland, Union and Wyandot Counties are eligible for this assistance.
   The letter from the Ohio Delegation supporting the emergency declaration is attached.
   If you have any questions or need additional information on this federal emergency declaration please call Tom Glen at (202) 646-4500.
