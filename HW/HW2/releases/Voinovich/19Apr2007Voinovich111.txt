SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S TRIP TO OHIO, REMARKS ON GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today released the following statement on President George W. Bush's visit to Tippecanoe High School in Tipp City, Ohio, to make remarks on the Global War on Terror: 
  "I regret that I cannot join the president in Ohio today because of votes, but am glad he chose our state to talk about this struggle between freedom and tyranny. I share his commitment to winning the Global War on Terror so that our children and grandchildren can live in a world free of terror. Today, we are engaged in a global war against religious radicals who wish to promote an extremist ideology aimed at destroying the United States and those who share our values. This is not a conventional war. Rogue states hide behind these terrorists and provide them with resources to wage war against the West. This is why we must continue to work with our allies and partners to defeat this enemy abroad and preserve our freedom here at home. By sharing our deep commitment to liberty, democracy, economic development and freedom of religion, we can help secure our own future and improve the lives of millions of people around the world.".
