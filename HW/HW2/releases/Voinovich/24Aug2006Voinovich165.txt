SENS. DEWINE, VOINOVICH APPLAUD GRANT TO HELP FUND BUCKEYE WATER IMPROVEMENTS IN COLUMBIANA COUNTY
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today applaud the announcement of a $500,000 U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to the Buckeye Water District to help improve water and sewer service in Columbiana County.  
   "This project will help improve the quality of water and sewer service for Columbiana County residents," said Senator DeWine. "The project is an integral part of the planned economic development in the region." 
   "I have worked hard to help this region meet its economic needs," Senator Voinovich said. "Improving water and sewer infrastructure will improve the quality of life in Columbiana County and further bolster the region's capabilities." 
   The Buckeye Water District Project includes the construction of a water treatment plant and raw water pump station in Columbiana County. It also includes the construction of a water line from Wellsville to the outlying rural areas including Lisbon and areas north. 
   In addition to the $500,000 grant, the Department of Agriculture's Office of Rural Development also approved a $1.3 million loan to assist in funding the project.
