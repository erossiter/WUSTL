SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES OVER $1.3 MILLION FOR AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) is pleased to announce that the Columbus Regional Airport Authority has secured a $1,316,706 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for improvements to be made to Port Columbus International Airport.  
   "This grant is great news for Port Columbus International Airport. The funds will play a vital role in helping the Columbus Regional Airport Authority make the airport even safer for those who use it," said Voinovich. "Columbus is a hub to many of Ohio's business, cultural and economic interests. Having safe, reliable transportation facilities in our state capital is crucial to its economic success." 
   The grant will be used to restore the structural integrity of taxiway pavement, which is vital for providing aircraft with safe taxiways. Over 6.5 million passengers annually pass through Port Columbus International Airport, which supports over 23,000 central Ohio jobs - bringing in $2.2 billion annually.
