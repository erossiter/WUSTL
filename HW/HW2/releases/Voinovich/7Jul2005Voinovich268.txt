SEN. VOINOVICH CONDEMS TERRORIST ATTACKS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R - OH) released the following statement today condemning this morning's terrorist attacks in London:  
   "My heart goes out to the victims and their family and friends on this tragic day. These barbaric terrorist attacks bring back memories of what we experienced four years ago. America is standing with the people of the United Kingdom on this tragic day and our support is strong. These attacks underscore that we are indeed in a war against terrorism with an enemy that does not fly under the flag of any country. An enemy that is bound and determined to wage war against us and any that share our values. America's vigilance and resolve must remain strong in the face of these enemies, and we will prevail," said Voinovich.
