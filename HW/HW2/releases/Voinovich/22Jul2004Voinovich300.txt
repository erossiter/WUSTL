SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) issued the following statement today in response to the final report from the 9/11 commission:  
   "One of the problems in our intelligence community is that we haven't had the right people in the right jobs at the right time. The report is an indictment of our intelligence agencies and also a case for why Congress needs more authority to do better, closer oversight of intelligence. I'm going to be looking seriously at these recommendations, especially the recommendations for a new national counterterrorism center and national intelligence director. 
   "One issue discussed in the report is how government should address health hazards in the wake of a disaster. Seventy-four first responders in Ohio Task Force were at Ground Zero within 24 hours and many developed respiratory problems as a result of bad air quality. Frankly, the Commission's recommendations for creating protocols for assessing air quality would be largely implemented by legislation I authored which passed the Senate last November. My bill would also create the authority to provide our first responders with the long term health monitoring they need after a disaster. I hope the report encourages my House colleagues to act quickly and send the bill to the President for his signature."
