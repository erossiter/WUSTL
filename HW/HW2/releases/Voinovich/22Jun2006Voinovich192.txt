SEN. VOINOVICH VOTES AGAINST TROOP WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today voted against two amendments to impose a deadline for withdrawing American troops from Iraq. His statement follows:  
   "The setting of an artificial timeline would hand the enemy our game plan and put our soldiers' lives at risk. We are at war with terrorists and insurgents who want to deny the Iraqi people the freedom that is the right of all mankind. American soldiers are putting their lives on the line to protect that freedom. We will indeed win this war if we continue to stand united in support of our troops and our values."
