SEN. VOINOVICH STATEMENT ON FOILED TERROR PLOT AND CHANGE OF THREAT LEVEL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and Homeland Security Committee, today released the following statement on the foiled terror plot and raised threat level for commercial flights:  
   "Today's arrests show that if we remain diligent we can and will keep Americans safe and win the War on Terror. This is exactly why we can never become complacent or let our guard down. While the raised threat level for commercial flights will cause some inconvenience, I urge all Americans to be patient and cooperative as our government takes the necessary steps to ensure our safety in flight."
