SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR COLUMBIANA LIBRARY
 Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved $1 million for The Lepper Library Association in Lisbon.  
   The funds came as a loan from USDA's Rural Development program, and will be used to help fund the construction of a 12,000 square foot addition to the existing 6,600 square foot library. The library was originally built to hold 3,000 books; however, it now boasts more than 15,000 books. The size of the library will nearly triple in size with the addition. "These funds will not only expand the library and make it more accessible to the public, but will also provide it more tools to continue to inspire the imaginations of our children and grandchildren," said Voinovich. "The construction project will also help aid in the region's economic recovery by creating new jobs and opportunities." 
   The Lepper Library was constructed in 1897 after a donation from Virginia Cornwell Lepper in memory of her husband, Charles W. Lepper.
