SEN. VOINOVICH LAUDS PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF HEALTH CARE EXECUTIVE ORDER
  Today, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, released the following statement lauding President Bush's signing of an Executive Order calling for transparency in the health care industry. He also announced that he and fellow Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) will be introducing legislation next month to address medical record transparency. His statement follows:  
   "I am very pleased that President Bush moved forward today with his call for transparency in the health care industry, including medical records transparency. Next to the economy, access to health care is the greatest domestic challenge facing our nation, and I believe that greater transparency will allow us to improve the quality of care and more wisely spend our health care dollars. I have long been a champion of streamlining processes and working harder and smarter while doing more with less. I have been working with Senator Carper on the Electronic Personal Health Records Act - bipartisan legislation we will introduce in September which provides for the establishment and maintenance of electronic personal health records for individuals and family members enrolled in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP). The widespread adoption of health information technology, such as electronic health records, will revolutionize the health care profession and help ensure that patients get the best and most timely care possible. In addition, electronic health records also have the potential to reduce the cost of the delivery of health care, which may make coverage affordable for more Americans."
