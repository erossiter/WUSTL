SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES ALMOST $300,000 FOR COLUMBUS AIRPORT
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $290,500 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for the Rickenbacker Intermodal Facility in Columbus, Ohio.  
 Rickenbacker International Airport is the largest public airport in the nation dedicated solely to cargo. The proposed facility would provide central Ohio with the dual benefits of high-speed airfreight and the low cost of rail. 
   "I'm pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Rickenbacker facility. With these funds, the facility will be able to expand their operations to continue to serve Ohio and the rest of the country," said Voinovich. 
   The grant, secured in the 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, will be used to provide support for project design and planning studies for the proposed intermodal facility.
