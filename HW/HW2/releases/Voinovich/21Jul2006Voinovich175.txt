  Sen. George V.

His appointment expires this fall when the Senate officially recesses. The hearing will take place on Thursday, July 27 at 9:30 a.m. in room 419 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Sen. George V. Voinovich, who announced his support of Ambassador Bolton yesterday, made the follow statement in response to the scheduling of the hearing:  
   "As the situation in the Middle East deteriorates by the day, we must let the terrorists know that the United States speaks with one voice. I applaud Chairman Lugar's decision to schedule this hearing. Ambassador Bolton has done a good job and has proven his willingness to work multilaterally. I again call on my Democrat colleagues to keep in mind the current situation in the Middle East and the rest of the world while considering Ambassador Bolton's nomination."
