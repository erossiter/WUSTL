Paul was one of the most conscientious public servants I've ever met and was tireless in his work to represent his constituents. Paul's leadership was also outstanding during his years in the Ohio General Assembly and we worked on many issues together over the years. Paul was a role model for all of us who serve in public office. His service to Ohio and our nation will be greatly missed."
