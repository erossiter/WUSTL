  Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement regarding the passing of former president of Slovenia Janez Drnovsek: 
   "Janet and I are saddened to learn of the passing of our friend President Janez Drnovsek. As the prime minister and president of Slovenia, Janez Drnovek contributed greatly to the stability and continuity of the Slovenian government, and he helped make Slovenia a greater nation. During my career in the Senate, I got to know President Drnovsek in his official capacity, and as a fellow Slovene and dear friend. I met with him on several occasions throughout his career.
   "I will never forget the warm hospitality he extended to my wife and me. One of my greatest memories is from my visit to Slovenia in May 2005, when President Drnovsek presented me with the Golden Order of Merit of the Republic of Slovenia . He held a wonderful reception and lunch for Janet and me, our Slovenia relatives and special guests at the presidential palace at Brdo. I considered Janez Drnovsek to be a dear friend and an important leader in Slovenia 's history. He will be remembered in Slovenian history as one of its early and influential leaders, and for his hard work in bringing the young country into NATO, the European Union and the transatlantic alliance. I would like to express my condolences to his family, the people of Slovenia and to Slovenians around the world as we mourn the passing of a great leader. President Drnovsek's legacy of service to his country and to the world will not be forgotten."
