SEN. VOINOVICH, REP. REGULA MEET WITH SECRETARY BODMAN TO DISCUSS FUTURE OF CLEAN COAL IN SOUTHEAST OHIO
  Yesterday, Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) met with U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, Reps. Ralph Regula (R-OH) and JoAnn Davidson, Facilitator of the Ohio FutureGen Task Force, to explain why the Department of Energy's (DOE) FutureGen clean-coal initiative should be located in Ohio. Ohio has the fuel source, atmosphere, geology and manpower needed to address regional environmental problems while protecting the economic and environmental health of one of the nation's largest industrial and manufacturing regions.  
   "For the past 20 years, Ohio has been in the forefront of coal research, development and deployment--much of it in partnership with DOE and its labs. If DOE chooses to locate their FutureGen project in our great state, it would mean big things for jobs and the future of clean coal technology. There is no question that Ohio is the best partner for this endeavor. FutureGen technology flourishes in the environment that the Ohio River Valley has to offer," said Voinovich. 
   The Future Gen Industrial Alliance has partnered with DOE to provide jobs while advancing clean coal technology. The goal is to facilitate the design, construction and operation of the world's first zero-emissions power plant. The project is critical to the continued and expanded use of coal and is anticipated to provide 100 permanent technical jobs, 2,000 construction jobs and hundreds of spin-off jobs in the broader regional research community over the years. 
   Why Ohio? 
   * Coal represents more than 90 percent of Ohio's generated electricity. The largest competitors for the program, Illinois and Texas, boast only 34 percent and 40 percent respectively. 
   * Ohio faces increasingly stringent environmental challenges. For this reason, Ohio strongly supports the proposed FutureGen project as a viable answer to our need for clean, affordable supplies of energy from our most abundant, secure domestic fuel source. 
   * Ohio has spent over $173 million since 1984 on clean coal, and for every dollar put in, the state have leverages $3 in private and federal funds (Total of $519 million). 
   * The Ohio Coal Development Office has indicated that there are eight counties in Ohio that have the appropriate geologic formations, as well as the access to infrastructure necessary for Ohio to successfully compete: Athens, Meigs, Carroll, Hamilton, Coshocton, Clermont, Stark and Tuscarawas. 
   The Ohio FutureGen Task Force anticipates that the Alliance will release the Request for Proposal just after the new year. The proposal will dictate how many locations the Ohio FutureGen Task Force can submit for consideration. 
   Senator Voinovich has a strong record of supporting clean coal technology. He worked hard this year on the passage of the energy bill, which calls for public-private clean coal Research and Development to be implemented by government-industry partnerships which will keep coal-fired electricity cost-effective and competitive while lowering emissions. This funding will demonstrate the commercial applicability of advanced coal-based projects and will support technology for the capture of carbon dioxide. 
   Additionally, the bill creates $2.9 billion in new Clean Coal Tax Incentives, which will offset the risks associated with early commercial applications of advanced clean. It will also assist in repowering and retrofitting existing coal-based generation facilities with clean coal technology.
