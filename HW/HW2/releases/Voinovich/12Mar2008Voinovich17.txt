SEN. VOINOVICH OFFERS BUDGET AMENDMENT TO INCREASE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today offered an amendment along with U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) to the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution to increase funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) by $477 million, for a total of $1.35 billion. This increase in funding would not increase total budget spending; it would simply set aside a greater portion of already existing funds to the Clean Water SRF. 
   "I think it is clear that we are facing an environmental and public health crisis in this country when it comes to water infrastructure," Sen. Voinovich said. "We cannot expect cities to spend millions of dollars for water infrastructure upgrades without help from the federal government. We have a ticking time bomb ready to blow up if we don't act now."
   The Clean Water SRF program provides funding to states for water and wastewater infrastructure projects. The EPA estimates our nation needs to invest $390 billion over the next 20 years to eliminate deficiencies in our wastewater infrastructure. The state of Ohio has one of the largest investment needs in the country at $11.7 billion.
   Senator Voinovich believes that the federal government is asking communities to do the impossible. If the federal government is going to impose these costly mandates on struggling state and local governments, then it should provide funding and flexibility for compliance with those mandates.
