SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION NOMINATIONS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement today on the passage of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission nominations of Dr. Dale Klein, Greg Jaczko and Pete Lyons out of the Environment and Public Works Committee.  
   "The NRC is at a critical juncture and needs strong and able leadership. I am very pleased that my colleagues on the EPW Committee understand this and voted today for the nominations of Dr. Dale Klein, Greg Jaczko and Pete Lyons. Putting in place a fully confirmed NRC is critical as the industry actively pursues the building of new nuclear power plants for the first time in decades. At the same time, the agency will have to deal with a wave of retirements as more than 30 percent of its workforce will be eligible to retire in the next few years. With the challenges facing the Commission, I urge the Senate to act quickly to confirm them. As chairman of Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change, and Nuclear Safety, I will continue to make sure the NRC is headed in the right direction with additional oversight hearings."
