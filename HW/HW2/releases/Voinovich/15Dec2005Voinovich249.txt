SEN. VOINOVICH VOTES AGAINST REPEAL OF TRADE PROVISION HELPFUL TO OHIO MANUFACTURERS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) voted against the repeal of the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) today, voting in favor of a motion to instruct conferees to omit language repealing CDSOA from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.  
 It passed by a vote of 72 to 19. Commonly known as the Byrd Amendment, CDSOA assists American companies who have been unfairly harmed by foreign competitors who illegally dump low-cost goods in the Unites States, making it more difficult for American companies to compete. The Act, which has diverted more than $1 billion to U.S. manufacturers who have been negatively affected by this practice, has helped numerous Ohio companies. 
   "In our fast-paced global marketplace, it is vital what we understand that American companies are no longer competing only against each other. They are competing against the world. The dumping of below-cost goods from abroad into the United States puts Ohio companies, especially Ohio's manufacturers, at an unfair disadvantage in the global marketplace. I commend Senator DeWine for his strong support of this important program and for leading the fight to keep it alive. If we are going to maintain America's edge in this global environment, we cannot shut the world out--but we also have to make sure that American manufacturers are competing on a level playing field with their competitors abroad," said Voinovich 
   The motion to instruct conferees was filed by U.S. Senator Mike DeWine (R-OH), a strong supporter of the Act and original co-sponsor in 1999. CDSOA, which has strong bi-partisan support, is a vital tool for protecting U.S. companies and their employees from being injured by unfair trade practices.
