SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT RULING IN CUNO CASE
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement today in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in the Cuno case:  
   "The Supreme Court's decision is a partial victory for states and their ability to utilize tax credits as a job creation tool because it reversed the lower court's Cuno decision. However, the court's decision left these tax incentives open to the potential for future challenges. Economic incentives are one of the key development utensils states have to create new jobs. Until businesses have certainty that they will not be the target of expensive and extensive litigation, I will continue to work toward passage of the Economic Development Act of 2005."
