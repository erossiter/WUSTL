  Sen. Voinovich Statement On Death Of President Reagan
   "Ronald Reagan was a class act who had a compassionate heart and really cared about the American people.  
 While mayor of Cleveland I was fortunate enough to work closely with him and grew to know him well. I admired him for his adherence to his principles and his ability to convey those principles to the American people. He inspired all of us and made us proud to be Americans. 
   "His candor about his Alzheimer's Disease not only helped raise awareness of the disease but it also lifted up Alzheimer's patients and their families in a way that hadn't happened before, enabling them then to also begin talking openly about the disease. His wife Nancy is an inspiration and role model to all who care for loved ones. My prayers and thoughts are with Nancy and the Reagan family."
