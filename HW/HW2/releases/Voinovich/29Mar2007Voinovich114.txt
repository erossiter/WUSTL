SEN. VOINOVICH BILL TO REAUTHORIZE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION PASSES COMMITTEE
  On Thursday, March 29, 2007, Sen. George V. Voinovich's (R-OH) vital legislation to reauthorize the Appalachian Regional Commission at $510.9 million over five years was passed out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Appalachian Regional Commission plays a key role in fostering economic development and improving quality of life for the 23 million people who live in Appalachia. It will next come before the full Senate for a vote. 
  "The reauthorization of ARC remains a top priority for me. I am very pleased that my colleagues understand the vital role ARC plays in helping the Appalachian region fully realize its economic potential," Sen. Voinovich said. " Ohio and the other 12 Appalachian states. I am particularly excited about my new initiative focused on enhancing the region's economic competitiveness through energy independence and alternative resource development." 
  The legislation creates the designation of economically "at risk" counties and provides an appropriate federal matching rate for ARC-funded projects in those counties. Since ARC's inception, the region's poverty rate has been cut in half (from 31 percent to 13 percent), the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds and the percentage of adults with high school education has increased by over 70 percent.
  "You would be hard pressed to find a recent piece of legislation that touches people's lives as directly as this does," Sen. Voinovich said. "I frequently visit Ohio's Appalachian region and have seen firsthand the miraculous results this funding has produced." 
  During his first term in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich authored the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 2002 (S. 1206), which was signed by the president on March 12, 2002. The bill reauthorized the economic development efforts of the ARC, providing $446 million over five years for these efforts, and enacted a new, Voinovich-created technology initiative to help improve the region's telecommunication infrastructure and help businesses and residents take better advantage of e-commerce opportunities.
  Key elements of the legislation include:
  * Renews the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years (2007 - 2011). The agency's current authorization expired on September 30, 2007.
   * Authorizes the Commission for five years. 
   - 2007: $95.2 million
   - 2008: $98.6 million
   - 2009: $102 million
   - 2010: $105.7 million
   - 2011: $109.4 million
   * Creates a separate authorization for an Economic and Energy Development Initiative for the region. The initiative would allow the ARC to provide technical assistance and grants to: 
   * Promote energy efficiency in the region to enhance its economic competitiveness; 
   * Increase the use of renewable energy resources, especially biomass, in the region to produce alternative transportation fuels, electricity and heat. 
   * Refines the Commission's approach to targeting its resources to the areas of greatest need. The bill directs the Commission annually to designate those counties that are "at risk" of becoming economically distressed. These are counties with fragile economies that are just on the cusp of meeting the criteria for being designated as distressed. They are themselves in need of additional special focus. The Commission itself recently adopted this targeting classification. The legislation would codify the Commission's existing practice. 
   * Permits ARC to fund projects in the "at risk" counties at up to 70 percent of the cost of the project. Under current law, these projects may be funded at only 50 percent (the match rate for most ARC counties), while projects in designated distressed counties can be funded at 80 percent of the project costs. This provision reflects the special needs of "at risk" counties. 
   * Maintains the requirement that at least 50 percent of the Commission's grant dollars go toward projects or activities benefiting distressed counties and areas. This provision was added in ARC's 2002 reauthorization. The Commission currently satisfies this requirement, and no change is proposed. 
   * Continues all existing programmatic authorities, including the special program in telecommunications and technology.
