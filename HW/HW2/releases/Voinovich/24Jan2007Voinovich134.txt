SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON BIDEN-HAGEL IRAQ RESOLUTION
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Wednesday, January 24, voted against the Biden-Hagel resolution on Iraq while saying he is even more skeptical about the so-called "surge" of troops into Baghdad than he was weeks ago. His statement follows: 
  "When some of my colleagues announced plans to introduce a resolution criticizing the president's plan I said I would not support anything that could be characterized as a political attack against our commander-in-chief. To me, the Biden-Hagel resolution could be viewed that way and could be misinterpreted by our enemies as abandoning Iraq and not supporting our troops. I am also concerned that it is meant to lay the groundwork for a precipitous withdrawal of troops from Iraq or funding from our troops.
  "Since the day the president announced his plans for a so-called surge of additional troops into Baghdad, I have been skeptical as to whether this would ultimately be successful. Or, rather, would it do more harm than good? Now, after a three-hour security briefing with senior intelligence officials, three meetings at the White House and a number of hearings, I'm even more skeptical now than I was before about how this would impact our national security and what it would mean for our men and women we'd be sending into Baghdad. 
  "I have been waiting for the administration to extend an olive branch in an attempt to forge a compromise - a compromise that clearly expresses our concerns while leaving no doubt in the minds of our troops as well as our enemies that we stand united as a nation. I obviously have been disappointed since that has not happened. However, I remain hopeful that there will be a compromise that puts Congress and the White House on the same page so that we can move forward united as a nation.".
