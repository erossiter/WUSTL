SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON RETIREMENT OF REP. REGULA
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today released the following statement regarding the retirement of Congressman Ralph Regula (R-Navarre) after 18 terms serving in the U.S. House of Representatives: 
  "Ralph and Mary Regula have been close friends for over 40 years and were instrumental in my first election to the Ohio House of Representatives. We have joined forces ever since, starting with our partnering to create the Ohio EPA when I was in the Ohio House and Ralph in the Senate. Ralph has amassed the most significant record of any Ohioan serving in Congress. He consistently delivered for his district, state and nation. He is truly an All-Ohio Congressman. His legacy will live on forever through the lives of people he has touched through the programs and projects he has spearheaded, particularly in the areas of recreation, the environment, health care and education. While Ralph will be greatly missed in Congress, Janet and I rejoice that he will have more time to spend with Mary and their wonderful family. Mary is, in her own right, an Ohio treasure as founder of the National First Ladies' Library in Canton, Ohio."
