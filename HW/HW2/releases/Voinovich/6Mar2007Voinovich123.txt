SENS. VOINOVICH, CARPER, CLINTON, COLEMAN INTRODUCE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT BILL
  Today, Sens. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), Thomas Carper (D-DE), Hillary R. Clinton (D-NY) and Norm Coleman (R-MN) introduced the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2007, legislation aimed at addressing the deteriorating condition of our nation's roads, bridges, drinking water systems, dams and other public works. If enacted, the bill will establish a National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States. The commission will be charged with aiding in the nation's economic growth and ensuring the nation's infrastructure meets current and future demands.
   "The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina made painfully clear the urgent need for improvements to our aging infrastructure," Sen. Voinovich said. "Our infrastructure is collapsing due to insufficient funding. And the deterioration of our nation's waterways and infrastructure systems are impacting our economy, our environment and the overall welfare of the American people. This legislation gets to the heart of the problem by establishing a commission that will provide concrete recommendations for future infrastructure needs. When enacted, this commission will lead the way in providing long-term solutions to the dire problems we currently face."  
   "The future health of our economy and safety of the American people requires proper maintenance of our infrastructure, whether flood control, transportation or water quality," said Sen. Carper. "No nation can be prosperous without these fundamental building blocks. As we look for the best way to address the needs of our country with tighter and tighter budgets, we need to ensure we protect communities by properly maintaining our current infrastructure and setting targeted priorities for future investments."
   "Throughout history our nation's economic strength has been inexorably linked to the investments made in our public infrastructure," said Sen. Clinton. "From the Transcontinental Railroad to the National Highway System, the public sector's investments in our roads, waterways, railways and aviation systems have built the bedrock strength of the American economy. It is time to make sure that we maintain that strong foundation. To ensure our nation's future prosperity, we need to ensure that we continue to make the right investments to rebuild and strengthen our aging infrastructure. This is a challenge we must meet head on in the greatest tradition of America." 
   "America's infrastructure is critical to both the development of our communities and the economic competitiveness of our domestic industries," said Sen. Coleman. "Basic infrastructure including roads, waterways, and community infrastructure are the life blood of our farmers, our businesses and our rural and urban communities. By creating a commission to address aging infrastructure, we can identify new ways to ensure the economic viability of America 's for years to come."
   This legislation is the first important step in revitalizing our nation's weakening infrastructure. Hurricane Katrina made evident the serious need for the repair and improvement of our nation's aging infrastructure and waterway systems. The backlog of unfunded Army Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance projects mandated by Congress is $1.2 billion. 
   The bill would mandate the: 
   * Establishment of the National Commission on the Infrastructure of the United States to ensure that the nation's infrastructure meets current and future demands and facilitates economic growth;
   * Completion of a study by February 2010 that will address all matters relating to the state of the nation's infrastructure, including: capacity of infrastructure improvements to sustain current and anticipated economic development; the age, condition and capacity of public infrastructure; repair and maintenance needs; financing methods; and investment requirements;
   * Development of recommendations for a federal plan outlining infrastructure priorities; and
   * Completion of a report to Congress by February 2010 that will detail infrastructure legislation deemed necessary for the next five, 15, 30 and 50 years.
   The National Infrastructure Improvement Act was first introduced in the 109th Congress. The legislation has gained broad support from numerous organizations, such as the American Society of Civil Engineers, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
