COMMITTEE APPROVES $300 MILLION FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
  On Friday, June 15, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $300 million for the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) program - funding that was requested by Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 
   The EMPG program is considered the backbone of the nation's all-hazards emergency management system and is the only source of federal assistance to state and local governments for emergency management capacity building. EMPG funds are used for personnel, planning, training and exercises at both the state and local levels. They support state and local emergency management personnel who are responsible for writing plans, conducting training, exercises, corrective action and educating the public on disaster readiness.
   "Since 9/11, the responsibilities of our first responders have greatly increased," Sen. Voinovich said. "They must now be prepared to respond to both natural disasters and acts of terrorism. With the enhanced responsibilities and the tight budget constraints currently facing our state and local governments, the flexibility provided by the EMPG program is vital. Not fully supporting our first responders and emergency managers is unconscionable."
   Last year the EMPG program was funded at $200 million. In his continued efforts to strengthen national preparedness and response capabilities, Sen. Voinovich this year submitted a letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security requesting $58 million in additional funding for the EMPG program. The letter was co-signed by 39 senators. Ultimately, Sen. Voinovich was able to secure an additional $100 million for the program over last year's allocation through continued lobbying efforts.
