SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES $130,000 GRANT FOR NEWARK FIRST RESPONDERS
  Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the Newark Division of Fire has received a $129,738 grant from the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Fire Administration.  
   In October 2004, Voinovich wrote a letter in support of the department's grant application to U.S. Fire Administrator R. David Paulison. 
   "I was glad to help secure these funds which will help the Newark Division of Fire purchase new equipment to better carry out its mission," said Voinovich. "Clearly our first responders need proper resources to protect the community. I've encouraged the Department of Homeland Security to do more to support our first responders and I'm glad to see it happening," Voinovich said. The Newark Division of Fire is a rural department that provides fire and EMS service to approximately 46,000 residents over 20-square miles. 
   Voinovich is a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee which oversees the Department of Homeland Security and he helped write the legislation creating the new agency in 2002. 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
