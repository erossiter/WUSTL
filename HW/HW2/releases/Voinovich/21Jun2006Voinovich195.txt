SEN. VOINOVICH SUPPORTS COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT MONITORING FOR AT-RISK VETERANS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today said he supports the announcement by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that they will provide one year of free credit monitoring to people whose sensitive personal information may have been stolen in the recent data theft that occurred at an employee's Maryland home.  
   Secretary of VA Jim Nicholson announced today that the VA will solicit bids from qualified companies to provide a comprehensive credit monitoring solution starting this week. VA will also solicit bids to hire a company that provides data-breach analysis, which will look for possible misuse of the stolen VA data. The analysis would help measure the risk of the data loss, identify suspicious misuse of identity information and expedite full assistance to affected people. 
   "I am glad to hear that the VA is doing what they can to protect veterans whose personal information has been put at risk," Sen. Voinovich said. "The recent data theft should not have happened and America's veterans do not deserve the stress of this situation. I support the full investigation into this incident and will work to ensure our veterans receive the comprehensive protection they deserve."
