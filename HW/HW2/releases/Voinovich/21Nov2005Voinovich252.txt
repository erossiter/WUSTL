SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES FUNDING FOR OHIO IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Senate passed the 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Conference Report Friday by Unanimous Consent. The bill provides $82.36 billion for Department of Defense (DoD) Military Construction projects and for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). $104.79 million was secured for military construction projects in Ohio. This amount is an increase from the amount passed in the Senate and includes additional projects requested by Sen. Voinovich in a letter to the Conferees.  
   "Our military is playing a critical role at home and abroad in defending our nation against terrorism. In this difficult time, the whole is only as strong as each individual part, and it is essential that we don't lose sight of that. The role of Ohio's National Guard in this fight has been inseparably intertwined with that of the Army and the Defense Department. I am so pleased we were able to secure these funds to support our state's brave soldiers, their families, and our veterans," said Voinovich. 
   Overall for military construction, the bill provides: $6.2 billion for military construction for active and reserve component accounts; $4.019 billion for family housing construction, operations and maintenance, and the Department's family housing improvement fund; and $1.2 billion for previous Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) activity and significant portions of the 2005 BRAC process. This appropriation is only the initial appropriation for the six-year BRAC timeline. DoD must continue the process of closures and environmental remediation and other procedures before there can be additional appropriations. 
   Overall for VA, the bill provides $70 billion. Of this amount, $36.995 billion is for mandatory programs, including benefits and compensation, and $31.818 for discretionary programs. There is an additional $1.225 billion in emergency funding for medical services. Highlights of the overall VA funding includes: 
   * $22.5 billion for medical services; 
   * $806 million for construction projects, including $687 million for the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Program (CARES); 
   * $412 million for medical and prosthetic research; 
   * $85 million for state extended care facilities; and 
   * $40 million for Veterans Benefits Administration operation expenses to prevent staff reduction in processing disability claim benefits.
