SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE BILL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) on Thursday, Feb. 1, released the following statement upon passage of H.R. 2, the Minimum Wage Act:  
  "Today I voted in favor of a fair increase to our nation's minimum wage that, while not perfect, is a good step in the right direction. Although I am pleased the final bill includes some tax relief for small businesses, I have long believed that we need fundamental tax reform, not just piecemeal cuts. While I cannot let the perfect get in the way of the good at this time, I will continue to fight for fundamental tax code and entitlement reform that includes permanent tax relief for small businesses, so we can encourage economic growth without growing the deficit. My legislation, the Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act forces Congress to reform our nation's tax code and entitlement systems and bring some fiscal sanity to our budgeting process. I look forward to working with both parties to finally do what's needed to ensure the long-term solvency of our entitlement programs and bring about fairness in our tax code. ".
