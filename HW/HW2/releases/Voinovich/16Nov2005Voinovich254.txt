SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES $1.1 MILLION FOR NASA GLENN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) helped secure $1.1 million for NASA Glenn research and technology programs in advanced aeronautics, including turbine engine research, in the 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Conference Report.  
 The bill, which passed today by a vote of 95-4, includes a total of $912.6 million in nationwide funding for Aeronautics Research. 
   "NASA Glenn provides is a vital component for both NASA and greater Northeast Ohio, and I am pleased that we were able to help secure an increase in funding for aeronautics. As I noted to Administrator Griffin, while this is an important intermediate step, we need to work to secure the vision for NASA Glenn's long-term growth, and I will continue to work with NASA to turn a vision into reality," said Voinovich. 
   The 2006 funding level is $60 million above the President's budget request for the Aeronautics Research program. 2005 funding for aeronautics is $906 million. 
   The conferees directed that within 60 days of enactment, NASA shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations and the legislative committees of jurisdiction in the House and Senate a plan for how it intends to allocate aeronautics research funds for fiscal year 2006. Included in this plan should be a definition of work that enhances United States competitiveness.
