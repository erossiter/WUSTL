SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES NEW VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINICS IN NEWARK, CAMBRIDGE
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has decided to build two new community-based outpatient clinics in Newark and Cambridge. Details of the timing and exact location of the clinics have yet to be determined.  
   "Ohio veterans deserve the best quality care available," Sen. Voinovich said. "Our veterans kept their promise to defend our nation and our nation must keep its promises to our veterans." 
   According to the VA, the new Cambridge and Newark facilities were among 25 new community clinics in 17 states being announced today. 
   In Ohio, the VA spent more than $2.8 billion last year to serve the state's one million veterans. The VA operates major medical centers in Chillicothe, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dayton, with 27 outpatient clinics around the state and nursing homes in Chillicothe, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dayton, and Vet Centers in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Parma. 
   In September of 2005, Sen. Voinovich joined VA Secretary Jim Nicholson at the groundbreaking of the Columbus VA Medical Center. That center is currently on time for a March 2008 opening. A new facility has also been approved to be built adjacent to the existing Wade Park VA Medical Center in the University District, where Brecksville (Cleveland area) will close its doors and relocate all services to the new center downtown. That facility will break ground in early 2007.
