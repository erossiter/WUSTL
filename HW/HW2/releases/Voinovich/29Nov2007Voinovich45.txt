MONTHLY REPORT FROM SEN. VOINOVICH, NOV. 29: HELPING EASE THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS
  In his continued effort to help ease Americans' suffering from the foreclosure crisis, Sen. Voinovich recently introduced his Expanding American Homeownership (EAH) Act of 2007 - legislation which will allow Americans facing foreclosure or resetting interest rates to refinance without the usual burdens associated with a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan.  
 The bill will also increase home ownership opportunities for millions of Americans looking to purchase their first home. The House version of this bill passed overwhelmingly last year by a vote of 415-7. The EAH Act will enable FHA to help those facing foreclosure to refinance for lower rates while helping millions of low- and moderate-income families to buy a first home. Many of these borrowers currently must pay subprime rates because FHA lacks the ability to offer an affordable financing option. The companion bill in the House has nearly 20 cosponsors including Ohio Reps. Steve LaTourette and Deborah Pryce. The late Rep. Paul Gillmor of Ohio was also a cosponsor. Sen. Voinovich believes the government should do everything it can to not only help ease the current foreclosure crisis but also break down the barriers that separate Americans from the dream of homeownership. In May, Sen. Voinovich introduced the Mortgage Relief Act - legislation which will relieve families of a tax burden when their lender forgives part of the mortgage on a principal residence. The Mortgage Relief Act passed the House in October by a vote of 386-27 but has yet to be voted on in the Senate.
