SEN. VOINOVICH'S SOUTHEAST OHIO OFFICE RELOCATES
  Sen. Voinovich has announced that he will be relocating his Southeast Ohio office in Gallipolis, providing his constituents a more centralized location with greater access.

   "I have really enjoyed having my office here in Gallipolis. I initially encountered Gallipolis as a Key Club member. One of the most outstanding clubs was the Gallipolis Key Club. I have really appreciated getting to know the wonderful people and community while operating my office here. I will continue to work hard for all of SE Ohio, including Gallia County and Gallipolis, and my staff will continue to reach out to Gallia County residents and officials to help that county move forward," said Senator Voinovich 
   The Senator has four other state offices in Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Toledo. To save costs, he opened his Columbus and Toledo offices with Senator DeWine, and they jointly share a space. He opened a fifth office in Appalachian Ohio to provide a place for people in our rural region to easily visit with his staff to seek information or assistance. 
   *At the end of their terms, Senators are able to reevaluate their office needs.
