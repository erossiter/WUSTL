SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS BY BUSH
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) made the following statement on Tuesday night following the State of the Union address by President George W. Bush: 
  "I was really pleased with the president's State of the Union address tonight. I particularly liked the fact that he mentioned and wants to do something about energy independence. His proposal to cut the use of gas in this country through the use of renewable and alternative gas and also to increase fuel efficiency is going to allow us to reduce our use of gasoline by 20 percent-which is about three quarters of the oil we currently import from the Middle East. 
  "I was also very pleased with the president talking about health care, which is the largest domestic problem that we face today in America and it's impacting on our competitive position in the global marketplace. The thing I really liked about it is he is going to work with the states, the laboratories of democracy, to empower them to provide health care to their citizens, to experiment with the best way we can provide a health care system to the American people.
  "Overall, I was very pleased with what he had to say about entitlement reform, balancing the budget and dealing with immigration in a very constructive way. I thought his speech this evening was quite good-it focused on several areas-and I am very pleased he understands that even though we have problems overseas dealing with the War on Terror, that we still have great domestic issues and it's important that all of us, on a bipartisan basis, get behind some of the ideas that he outlined for America tonight.".
