SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES OVER $5 MILLION FOR SENIOR HOUSING IN CLEVELAND
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $5.087 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Section 202 Program for the Eliza Bryant Center.  
   "I'm pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Eliza Bryant Center. With these funds, the Center will be able to expand their housing for inner-city, low-income seniors to allow them to live as independently as possible, while still receiving the care they need," said Voinovich. 
   The project involves the expansion of housing facilities through the addition of 48 units. These one-bedroom units would expand on the community atmosphere that seniors already enjoy at the Center. 
   The Eliza Bryant Center is committed to serving Cleveland's inner-city, low-income seniors by providing services such as adult day care, transportation, housing and skilled nursing care. 
   For additional information, please contact the Office of Congressional Affairs at (202) 708-0380 or Harvey Shankman, Executive Director of the Eliza Bryant Center, at (216) 361-6141 x219.
