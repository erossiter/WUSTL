SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES $200,000 FOR COMMUNITY PARK IN MORRISTOWN
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) is pleased to announce that a $200,000 Land and Water Conservation grant from the Department of Natural Resources Division of Real Estate and Land Management has been awarded to the village of Morristown. The grant monies will be used to develop a trail and splash park in the community park.  
   "This grant is great news for the village of Morristown. Community parks are wonderful gathering places for people of all ages. These funds will aid in the further development of the park into a unique recreation area," said Voinovich. 
   The Land and Water Conservation Fund grants-in-aid program provides matching grants to state and local governments for the acquisition and development of public outdoor recreation areas and facilities. Through this program, the village of Morristown will allocate $200,000 in funding, and the Department of Natural Resources will match it, bringing the total funding for this phase of development to $400,000. 
   The trail and splash park is the third phase of development in the 70-acre park. The first phase was also funded with a Land and Water Conservation grant, and the second phase has not yet been approved by the state.
