SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING ATTORNEY GENERAL'S 'NO CONFIDENCE' VOTE
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today released the following statement on the so-called "no confidence" vote regarding Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez:  
   "As I have previously said, if I were president, I would have asked Alberto Gonzalez to resign as attorney general. The nation's top cop ought to be spending his time on enforcing our laws, not explaining away the appearance of partisan political activities in his department. Today's vote does nothing to rectify the current problem or ensure it doesn't happen again. There are too many pressing issues we're ignoring to deal with non-binding, partisan votes. Therefore, I voted against the resolution."
