SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES OVER $500,000 FOR LOW-FLOOR BUSES IN AKRON
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $505,178 grant from the Federal Transit Administration for the Metro Regional Transit Authority in Akron. The grant monies will be used to purchase two replacement 40-foot low-floor buses.  
   "These new low-floor buses are a great advancement for public transportation, as they will ease the boarding process for everyone, especially for passengers with disabilities, who will no longer have to depend on a wheelchair lift to use the bus," said Voinovich. "Public transportation plays a vital role in the city's infrastructure. It allows those who cannot drive to conduct their daily business, and it gives everyone a transportation alternative, which plays a key role in easing the congestion of city traffic." 
   Low-floor buses have many advantages over regular buses, including faster boarding for the majority of passengers, as well as elimination of the traditional wheelchair lift which has posed a substantial maintenance burden for operators. Also, passengers who have difficulty climbing the stairs of a regular bus will find the low-floor buses, which can be lowered to within one foot of the road surface, much easier to board.
