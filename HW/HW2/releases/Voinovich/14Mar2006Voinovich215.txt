SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES OVER $72,000 FOR WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VEHICLES IN NEWARK
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $72,512 grant from the Federal Transit Administration for the city of Newark. The grant monies will be used to purchase two paratransit vehicles equipped with wheelchair lift equipment and seating for wheelchairs and ambulatory passengers.  
   "These paratransit vehicles are a great advancement for public transportation, as they will ease mobility for passengers with disabilities who are unable to use mass transportation options like the bus," said Voinovich. "Public transportation plays a vital role in the city's infrastructure. It allows those who cannot drive to conduct their daily business, and it gives everyone a transportation alternative." 
   Paratransit vehicles are used in curb-to-curb public transportation programs for people with disabilities who are unable to use public buses or trains. Paratransit is a shared-ride service operated with modern, accessible vehicles. Passengers who have difficulty climbing the stairs of a regular bus will also find the paratransit vehicles much easier to board.
