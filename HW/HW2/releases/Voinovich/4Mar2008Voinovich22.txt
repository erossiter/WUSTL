SEN. VOINOVICH RELEASES GAO REPORT ON SO-CALLED 'EMERGENCY' SPENDING
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "debt hawk," today released a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report he requested titled "Supplemental Appropriations: Opportunities Exist to Increase Transparency and Provide Additional Controls." As part of his effort to reign in wasteful spending and conduct meaningful oversight of government programs, Sen. Voinovich asked the GAO to review trends in so-called "emergency" spending over the decade stretching from 1997 through 2006, as well as propose reforms to ensure that emergency funding truly is for real emergencies and not simply a way to camouflage spending that is driving up the national debt. 
   "We all understand that on occasion we face natural disasters or unanticipated crises like Hurricane Katrina that require emergency resources," Sen. Voinovich said. "For this reason, we cannot estimate all of our emergency spending in the budget. But I am extremely concerned that the emergency designation has been abused in recent years to allow Congress to spend large sums of money outside the budget. It is time for us to be honest with the American people about the true state of our nation's fiscal house and stop relying on smoke, mirrors and lies."
   If spending is designated as "emergency," it is exempted from budget controls and spending limits. An example of the sort of emergency spending that concerns Sen. Voinovich is the designation of funding for the 2000 Census as emergency, even though the U.S. Constitution has required a census every 10 years since 1790.
   GAO analyzed the use of emergency and supplemental funding over the 10-year period from 1997-2006 and found that:
   * Over $31 billion did not fit the definition of an "emergency", suggesting that the "emergency" label is used to exempt non-emergencies from budget controls; 
   * 35 spending accounts received emergency funding in at least six out of 10 years, suggesting that such funding is regular and not an unexpected event; and 
   * Over one-third of emergency spending has no time limit on when agencies can spend the money, suggesting that much "emergency" spending occurs long after the emergency has passed.
   GAO also indicated goals that budget process reform proposals addressing emergency funding should achieve:
  "If the use of supplemental appropriations is to be limited to addressing unforeseen needs that arise suddenly after annual appropriations have been enacted, additional controls and increased transparency are needed. To increase transparency and provide additional controls over the use of supplementals, Congress should consider establishing procedures and mechanisms to ensure that: (1) emergency-designated provisions meet established criteria, (2) emergency supplementals do not become the vehicle for items that do not require the rapid enactment demanded to respond to an emergency event, (3) supplementals are not used where the regular budget and appropriations process should suffice, and (4) a balance exists between flexibility and oversight with regard to the time availability of funds."
