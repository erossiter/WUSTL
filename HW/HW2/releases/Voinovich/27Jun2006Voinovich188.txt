The senator's statement follows (also, please see below statement for a release on Sen. Voinovich's bill addressing performance appraisal):  
   "As I have consistently stated, I support the Department of Homeland Security and its efforts to develop and implement a performance-driven, flexible and contemporary personnel system. I also continue to advocate for an ongoing, open dialogue between the department and its employee representatives. In light of today's ruling by the court, I encourage the department to renew discussions with its employees over sections of the regulations enjoined by the court."
