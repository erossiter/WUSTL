SEN. VOINOVICH SUPPORTS RESOLUTION AFFIRMING U.S. SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL
  On Tuesday, July 18, the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 534, condemning Hezbollah and Hamas and their state sponsors and supporting Israel's right to self-defense. Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), an original co-sponsor of the resolution, released the following statement on the passage.  
   "The Senate has spoken loudly and clearly; terrorism against Israel will not be tolerated," Sen. Voinovich said. "Americans must understand that Israel is under constant attack by the terrorist organizations Hezbollah and Hamas, which are being supported by Iran and Syria. We must stand with Israel during this critical time. The United States, along with the rest of the free world, must defend Israel and the democratic government in Lebanon, while working to bring stability to the entire Middle East."
