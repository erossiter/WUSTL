SEN. VOINOVICH HELPS SECURE VITAL TANK FUNDING
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) helped secure $503 million for the Army's M1 tank program in the final Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. The M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) tanks, which are produced and tested at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (formerly the Lima Tank Plant), received $300 million in the final conference report. Funding for the M1A1 Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) Program was restored to $103 million and the M1A1 Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK) Program received $100 million in funding. The conference report passed the Senate today and now will be sent to the president for his signature.  
   Pressure to reduce spending led the Department of Defense to reduce its original funding request for the tanks. As a result, the request was below the requirement and below the amount needed to sustain operations at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (JSMC) in Lima. Senator Voinovich worked actively with his colleagues to urge the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) and the Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) to restore the funding and address the military's true requirements. 
   "There is nothing more important than ensuring American soldiers fighting the War on Terror have the right weapons and protection," Sen. Voinovich said. "The M1A2 SEP tanks are critical to our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tanks and armor provide vital protection and weaponry to our men and women in the field. The restoration of this funding will help to ensure that our brave warfighters will have what they need to accomplish their mission and come home safely. It will also ensure that Lima has the funding needed to sustain production at the plant, secure important jobs, and continue its contribution to the safety and success of our military."
