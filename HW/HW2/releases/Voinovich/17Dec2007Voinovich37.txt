SENS. VOINOVICH, BROWN BILL TO NAME OHIO POST OFFICE AFTER FORMER REP. GILLMOR TO BE SIGNED BY PRESIDENT
  Legislation sponsored by U.S. Senators George V. Voinovich (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) to name the U.S. Post Office in Tiffin, Ohio, after late-U.S. Representative Paul E. Gillmor of Ohio's 5th District passed the U.S. House of Representatives today having already passed the Senate back in November. The bill is now on its way to the president's desk to be signed into law.  
   "I will always cherish the close relationship I had with Paul and have utmost respect for his service to the people of Ohio," Sen. Voinovich said. "Paul had a wonderful knack for being able to work with people to get things done. He led by example and his enthusiasm and dedication always made you want to be on his team. He left an indelible mark on the people he worked with which is a part of his wonderful, lasting legacy. While this small token will never truly show how much we appreciate him, I hope his family will have a sense of how much he was admired and will be missed by so many people."
  "It was my pleasure working with Paul Gillmor for many years in the House," Sen. Brown said. "It is only fitting that the post office in Tiffin should bear his name. Congressman Gillmor was a true public servant, and he will be sorely missed in Northwestern Ohio." 
   Because of Rep. Gillmor's diligent and devoted service to his country, he truly deserves the honor of having the post office in Tiffin, Ohio, bear his name. Not far from his small home town of Old Fort, Tiffin was chosen in concurrence with the wishes of his wife, Karen Gillmor.
