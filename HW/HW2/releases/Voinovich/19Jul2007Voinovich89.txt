SEN. VOINOVICH HELPS SECURE MORE THAN $45 MILLION FROM HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM
  Today, U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, announced that Ohio has received $45.35 million from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through their 2007 Homeland Security Grant Program. Each year, Sen. Voinovich diligently advocates the funding for DHS grants through the appropriations process. 
   "I am pleased that DHS continues to make progress in allocating federal homeland security grant funding based upon actual risk," Sen. Voinovich said. "I have consistently advocated using risk management as the most effective national strategy for allocating our limited federal homeland security resources. I applaud the department's efforts to increase collaboration with state and local stakeholders, encourage regional planning and security coordination and give applicants more time to complete their funding applications."
   For Fiscal Year 2007, Ohio will receive $16.8 million in State Homeland Security Grant program funds, a $2.2 million increase from the FY 2006 allocation. Ohio will receive $12 million in Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program grants, approximately $3 million more than FY 2006. The Metropolitan Medical Response Systems grant program will receive $1.55 million, an increase from the $1.4 million received in 2006.
   Ohio will also receive more than $15 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative Program, which provides funding for securing high-risk metropolitan areas. Areas receiving funding are: 
   * Cincinnati : $5.2 million 
   * Cleveland : $5.5 million 
   * Columbus : $4.7 million 
   DHS's grants program plays a key role in augmenting current state funding levels aimed at preparedness and response efforts to human and man-made disasters in Ohio.
   The grants award system has undergone major evolution since 2006, with states and urban areas now being awarded grant money based on a simplified and strengthened system of risk and the threat of terrorism.
