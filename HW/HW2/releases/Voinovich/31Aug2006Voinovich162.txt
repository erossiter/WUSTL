LORAIN CITY SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE NEARLY $3.3 MILLION UNDER EARLY READING FIRST PROGRAM
  Today, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced that Lorain City Schools will be awarded a three-year grant totaling $3,265,856 under the Early Reading First program. This program supports local efforts to enhance the oral language, cognitive and early reading skills of preschool-age children - especially those from low-income families - through strategies, materials and professional development that are grounded in scientifically based reading research.  
   "I'm very pleased the Lorain City Schools will receive this funding," Sen. Voinovich said. "I have long recognized the importance of strong reading skills to a child's future academic success. Early Reading First plays a vital role in ensuring that preschool-age children receive quality reading instruction. By setting them up for success now, we will put them in the best position to fully develop their God-given talents." 
   Early Reading First is part of the president's "Good Start, Grow Smart" initiative. The overall purpose of Early Reading First is to prepare young children to enter kindergarten with the necessary skills to prevent reading difficulties and ensure school success.
