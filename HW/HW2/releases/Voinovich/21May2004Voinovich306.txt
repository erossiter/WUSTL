SEN. VOINOVICH NAMED TO HIGHWAY BILL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
  Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) has been appointed to the conference committee on the highway bill-the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2004 (SAFETEA). The joint House-Senate conference committee will iron out differences between the versions of the bill passed by each chamber so a single compromise version can go to the President for his signature. The bill funds the nation's highway construction and maintenance efforts through 2009. 
   Voinovich is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, which wrote the Senate version of the highway bill. 
   "The delays we've seen so far with the highway bill can't continue. This legislation will create more than 70,000 much-needed jobs in Ohio so it's important to get the funding worked out now. I've pushed hard for Ohio to get its fair share of federal highway funds and to increase the rate of return on our gas tax money. I'm going to continue push hard for that in conference negotiations," said Voinovich. 
   The 1998 Highway Bill expired last October and has been extended twice by Congress. The current extension expires June 30. 
   The Senate-passed Highway Bill would provide Ohio: 
   * $8.928 billion over six years, $3.148 billion more than the previous highway bill, a 54.47 percent increase; 
   * More than 70,000 jobs over the six-year life of the bill; 
   * A Voinovich-sponsored provision that increased Ohio's rate of return from 90.5 to 95 cents of every gas tax dollar collected in Ohio and sent to Washington. 
   * A Voinovich-sponsored update to 40-year-old highway construction rules to better balance development and historic preservation needs. The amendment was supported by highway development and historic preservation groups. 
   Congressional leaders hope to send a final bill to the President for his signature by the end of June.
