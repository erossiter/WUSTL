SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FROM APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION
  Today, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced that over $1 million from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has been approved for vital infrastructure improvements projects in Appalachian Ohio. 
   "I have and will continue to work hard to help this region meet its economic needs," Sen. Voinovich said. "The projects funded by these grants will provide potable water to residents, enhance access to quality medical care, support new jobs and the retention of existing jobs and construct new sewer and wastewater systems. This funding will improve the quality of life and further bolster the region's infrastructure."  
   The funds will be distributed as follows: 
   * $250,000 to Vinton County, Ohio, to install two miles of water line and provide potable water service to 40 households in Harrison Township. 
   * $139,000 to Ohio University for the development of an Electronic Medical Records program that will use computer technology to improve health care delivery for up to 1,100 diabetic patients. 
   * $250,000 to the Ohio Department of Development for the Appalachian Training Investment Partnership program, which will support the creation of 200 new jobs and the retention of 300 existing jobs. 
   * $200,000 to Highland Village, Ohio, for construction of 2.5 miles of sewer lines to serve 113 customers and five businesses in Highland Village and a portion of Fairfield Township in Highland County. 
   * $250,000 to Amesville, Ohio, to construct a decentralized wastewater system to serve its community, including 70 households and 13 businesses and community facilities. 
   In addition to the ARC funds, state, local and other federal funds will contribute $3,228,462 to these projects. 
   In July 2006, the U.S. Senate passed by unanimous consent S. 2832 - vital legislation to reauthorize the ARC at $510.9 million over five years. Sen. Voinovich, a member of the EPW Committee, introduced the bill in May. In April, Sen. Voinovich held a field hearing in Marietta, Ohio, to hear testimony on the impact of the last reauthorization of the ARC and to examine how ARC has made a difference in people's lives. After the hearing, he spent two days traveling around Appalachian Ohio and was extremely impressed with the wonderful strides being made in the region as a result of ARC investments in technology, workforce training and economic development. 
   ARC plays a key role in fostering economic development and improving quality of life for the 23 million people who live and work in Appalachia. The proposed legislation creates the designation of economically "at risk" counties and provides an appropriate federal matching rate for ARC-funded projects in those counties. Since ARC's inception, the region's poverty rate has been cut in half (from 31 percent to 13 percent), the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds and the percentage of adults with high school education has increased by over 70 percent. 
   During his first term in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich authored the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 2002 (S. 1206), which was signed by the president on March 12, 2002. The bill reauthorized the economic development efforts of the Appalachian Regional Commission, providing $446 million over five years for these efforts, and enacted a new, Voinovich-created technology initiative to help improve the region's telecommunication infrastructure and help businesses and residents take better advantage of e-commerce opportunities.
