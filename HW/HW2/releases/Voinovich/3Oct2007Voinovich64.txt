SEN. VOINOVICH: FENCE AMENDMENT FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE
  Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "Debt Hawk," today voted against a fiscally irresponsible amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill providing billions of dollars more in funding for a border fence than President Bush even requested. Sen. Voinovich voted against this reckless spending because of his concern that it would further burden our children and grandchildren with even more debt. The amendment passed 95-1. 
   Sen. Voinovich:  
   * Agrees with his colleagues that we must secure our borders and provide the resources to do it; 
   * Agrees that we must secure our borders now - but actually do the fiscally responsible thing and find a way to pay for it; 
   * Believes the "emergency spending" designation is being used as a budget gimmick so that Congress can spend this money without having to pay for it; 
   * Believes every dime of this spending will be passed off to our children and grandchildren to pay for; 
   * Has watched, over his eight years in the Senate, the national debt skyrocket 60 percent - from $5.6 trillion in 1999, to 9 trillion today; 
   * Believes that running the credit card for today's needs and leaving the bill for future generations should not be the policy of the U.S. Congress; 
   * Points out that this is well above what even the president said he needs to fund the Department of Homeland Security; 
   * Knows the American people will see through this charade and realize Congress is trying to pull the wool over their eyes.

   Statement of Senator George V. Voinovich 
   Amendment No. 3117 to H.R. 3222, the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill 
   October 3, 2007 
   "Mr. President - as a senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I rise today to speak in opposition to the Graham amendment to provide an additional $3 billion in emergency spending for the Department of Homeland Security. 
  "I want to make clear that I agree with my colleagues that we must secure our borders and provide the resources to do it. Let me remind my colleagues that the Department's overall budget has grown more than 150 percent since its creation. Of that total, border security and immigration enforcement represents approximately one-third of the Department's annual spending. 
  "In 2007, Congress provided $12.1 billion in funding for border security. For 2008, the President budget requested $13.5 billion for border security, a 12 percent increase over the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2007. The $13.5 billion that Secretary Chertoff requested from Congress was what he felt was needed to continue the Department's efforts to secure our borders. The Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee provided a total of $14.9 billion for border security in its mark of the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, a 23 percent increase over the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2007 and a 10 percent increase over the President's budget request for fiscal year 2008.
  "Earlier this year, the Senate voted in favor of a similar amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill. The Senate provided a total of $17.9 billion in funding for border security and immigration enforcement, a 48 percent increase over the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2007. Because Congress failed to complete action on any of the appropriations bills, this funding remains in limbo.
  "The federal government continues to spend more than it brings in and this amendment continues that practice. If we decide we absolutely need to spend $3 billion on something - and I support adequately funding border security - then we need to either raise more revenue or cut other spending to pay for it. 
  "Thus, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Graham amendment."
