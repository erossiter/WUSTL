SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement tonight in response to President Bush's State of the Union address to Congress:  
   "I am pleased that the President laid out a vision for the next several years and addressed the concerns on the hearts and minds of the American people. 
   "There is a lot of anxiety in the country about the war in Iraq and our ability to compete in the global marketplace. I am pleased that the President reminded the American people about the importance of winning the war on terror so that our children and grandchildren can live in a world where they do not fear terror. I am glad the President did not retreat from his aggressive effort to promote freedom in the world. It is the best way to secure our country and win the war on terror. 
   "The President also recognized that we need to build an infrastructure of competitiveness and I applaud his American Competitiveness Initiative. I am pleased that he embraced most of the recommendations in the National Academy of Sciences study, 'Rising Above the Gathering Storm,' which calls on the federal government to make a commitment to math and science education to ensure we maintain our intellectual edge. 
   "The President also made a commitment to making America energy independent - what I like to call our 2nd Declaration of Independence from foreign sources of energy. The key to making America less dependent is technology and alternative energy sources. I applaud him for addressing an issue that knows no party lines. 
   "I'm also glad that the President recognizes that the health care crisis is our biggest domestic problem. While I believe we need to plow new ground, the President's proposals are a step in the right direction. They will help individuals deal with rising health care costs and change the way they think about their health care."
