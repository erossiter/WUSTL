SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES ASSISTANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS IN FORECLOSURE COMPROMISE BILL
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured additional assistance for Ohio homeowners in the bipartisan legislative plan to help ease the housing crisis. The tentative compromise, which steers clear of the sort of irresponsible provisions included in previous bills which would have raised interest rates on hard-working Americans, works to provide immediate relief through Sen. Voinovich-authored provisions. Sen. Voinovich originally introduced these provisions in previous legislation and fought for them with committee leadership. They include: 
   * Simplifying mortgage documents to ensure Ohioans understand clearly the terms of their mortgage before signing them; 
   * Tackling reform of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which could allow Americans facing foreclosure or resetting interest rates to refinance without the usual burdens associated with a FHA loan by increasing and simplifying FHA's loan limits; 
   * Providing funding for financial counseling programs; and 
   * Increasing Community Development Block Grant funding targeted towards revitalizing residential areas. 
   "Americans are looking to Congress to take real action to help protect homeowners," Sen. Voinovich said. "This bipartisan compromise is a solid step in the right direction. I am hopeful that Congress will take quick action on passage and will remain vigilant in our search for additional ways to address the foreclosure crisis and ensure the American dream of homeownership remains alive."
   Sen. Voinovich has authored three pieces of legislation focused on helping to ease the current crisis and on providing additional tools for neighborhoods to revitalize and restore abandoned properties. 
   Sen. Voinovich originally proposed improved disclosure for mortgage documents and additional resources for rehabilitating foreclosed properties and for housing counseling in his Protecting American Homeowners Act of 2008, which was introduced earlier this week. The reform of FHA was originally proposed by Sen. Voinovich in his FHA Modernization Act, which has been passed by both chambers. The differences between the House and Senate FHA reform bills are currently being worked out in conference. 
   Additionally, Sen. Voinovich's Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act was passed by the Senate and the House and has been signed into law by the president. Sen. Voinovich was moved to draft this bill after hearing stories about how homeowners were working out deals with their lenders, and the lenders were forgiving part of the mortgages to make payments more affordable. He was then shocked to learn the IRS was taxing that loan forgiveness as income. 
   This additional tax liability actually penalizes those who are trying to work out their financial problems in a responsible manner. Altering this tax penalty encourages homeowners and lenders to work together voluntarily so that payments are manageable and foreclosure can be avoided. So far, this is the only bill to become law that directly attempts to ease the foreclosure crisis. Sen. Voinovich is working on extending it for two additional years.
