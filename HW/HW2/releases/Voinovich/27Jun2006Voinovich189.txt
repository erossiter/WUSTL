SEN. VOINOVICH VOTES TO PROTECT AMERICAN FLAG
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today voted in favor of S.J. Res. 12, the Flag Protection Act, of which he is a co-sponsor. The amendment would have given Congress the power to prohibit the physical destruction of the flag of the United States. It failed by a vote of 66 to 34. Sen. Voinovich's statement follows:  
   "When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled prior flag protection laws unconstitutional, it required that Congress pass a Constitutional amendment to protect the flag. This amendment will require approval by two-thirds of the Senate and three-fourths of the states. Desecrating the American flag is not free speech - it is the destruction of property owned and honored by all Americans. The American flag represents freedom not only in our country but around the world. These rights and freedoms have not been free. Many have fought to preserve and protect this country and have lost lives in selfless service to their fellow man. I have co-sponsored each amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of the American flag since I came to the Senate and I will continue to work hard to ensure the protection of the flag becomes law."
