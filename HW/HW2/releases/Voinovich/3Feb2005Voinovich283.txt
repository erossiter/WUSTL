SEN. VOINOVICH MEETS WITH OHIO CORN GROWERS IN WASHINGTON
  Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) met with members of the Ohio Corn Growers Board of Directors on Wednesday in his Washington office, including newly-elected President Keith Houts of Celina. During the meeting they discussed the senator's efforts to increase the use of ethanol nationally, and his efforts to pass a comprehensive energy package which would increase domestic energy sources. In 2003, Voinovich was presented with the National Corn Growers Association President's Award for his commitment to corn farmers.
