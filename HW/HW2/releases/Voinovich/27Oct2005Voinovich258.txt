SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON LIFE OF ROSA PARKS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has released the following statement on the passing of Rosa Parks:  
   "As the mother of the civil rights movement, Rosa Parks courageously fought inequality and the status quo. December 1st will mark the 50th anniversary of her refusal to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus. This refusal sparked the bus boycott that brought her and Martin Luther King Jr. to national prominence. For her personal sacrifice and unfaltering belief in equality, she earned the 1999 Congressional Gold Medal, as well as the respect and gratitude of her fellow Americans. She will always have a special place in our hearts and in the history of our nation. Janet and I extend our deepest sympathies to her family, and our thoughts and prayers are with them as our nation mourns the loss of this inspirational woman," said Voinovich.
