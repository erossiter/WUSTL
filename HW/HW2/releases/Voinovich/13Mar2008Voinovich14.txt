SEN. VOINOVICH OFFERS SPENDING TRANSPARENCY AMENDMENT
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "debt hawk," today offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution that would require that Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimates of legislation include interest costs, forcing transparency and shedding light on the real effects of spending and tax cuts on the budget. 
   Sen. Voinovich also offered this amendment as part of the last year's Budget Resolution and it was accepted by unanimous consent. Unfortunately it was dropped during conference and was not included in the final Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Resolution 
   "I hope my colleagues will agree to finally fix this loophole," Sen. Voinovich said. "Experts say the most important step you can take is to first admit you have a problem. Well, we've got a big problem. Let's finally admit it and fix it." 
   Currently, every time new entitlement spending or tax cuts are enacted - and are financed through additional borrowing - the level of interest payments the government has to make on its debt increases. Those new interest costs represent additional government spending. Yet, CBO cost estimates ignore the effect of these interest payments on spending and the national debt, yet Congress still accepts those inaccurate figures.
