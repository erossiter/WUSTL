SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES $1.8 MILLION FOR HEALTH CARE FOR CLEVELAND'S HOMELESS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $1,808,408 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Care Alliance, a Cleveland non-profit health care organization. The grant will provide health and dental services to those in the Cleveland area who are homeless or living in public housing.  
   "I'm pleased that we were able to secure funding for the work that Care Alliance does. With these funds, Care Alliance will be able to continue their efforts to improve the lives of Cleveland's less fortunate," said Voinovich. "Care Alliance is a vital resource to the city of Cleveland and has a major impact on the health and welfare of thousands of people each year. Continued funding will improve the health status of underserved and vulnerable citizens who depend greatly on the services it provides." 
   The grant will be used to provide support for Care Alliance programs, including providing primary health care, regardless of age; health screenings and short-term counseling; HIV and AIDS counseling and treatment; immunizations; comprehensive dental care; and a special program for those affected by diabetes, which currently has more than 195 enrollees. 
   Established in 1993, Care Alliance (formerly Cleveland Health Care for the Homeless) was founded as one of the nation's original Health Care for the Homeless projects. It has grown into a non-profit community health center whose mission is to provide high-quality health care and related services to people who need it most--regardless of their ability to pay--in a manner that is cost-effective and that empowers people to improve their quality of life. There is no other organization in the Cleveland area specifically dedicated to providing health care to this population.
