SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement today in response to President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "During the confirmation process for Chief Justice John Roberts, I had several conversations with Ms. Miers and I found her to be a very impressive yet unassuming person. I was pleased that the President again consulted with members of the Senate before making this nomination and hope that will make for a smooth confirmation process. Although I like Ms. Miers very much personally, I know nothing about her legal background and I am looking forward to finding out more information about her. I hope her confirmation hearings will be conducted with the same speed and fairness as the hearings for now Chief Justice Roberts were conducted."
