HIGHWAY BILL PROVIDING $6.2 BILLION FOR OHIO ROADS PASSES COMMITTEE
  Legislation that would provide $6.2 billion to Ohio over the next five years in federal highway funds passed the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee today. Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the EPW Committee, helped write the bill known as the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005.  
   "A good highway system is critical for good jobs across our country and is one of the best ways to ensure our nation's economic security. This bill would help make our roads safer and improve our infrastructure, which are both critical to our just-in-time-delivery manufacturers," said Voinovich. "This bill is long overdue, and I'm hopeful that the Senate will act on it soon. And as we move forward, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that Ohio's infrastructure needs are met." 
   The current extension of the highway bill (TEA-21) will expire May 31, 2005. Senate passage of the bill, expected in April, would send it to a Joint House-Senate Conference Committee where the differences between the two bills would be reconciled. 
   For Ohio, the bill provides: 
   * $6.2 billion over five years, a 28.98 percent increase over the 1998 highway authorization bill, known as TEA-21.
   * Increases Ohio's rate of return from 90.5 to 92 cents of every gas tax dollar collected in Ohio and sent to Washington. 
   * When Voinovich took office as governor in 1991, Ohio received back 79 cents. 
   * He lobbied Congress hard and helped win changes in the 1991 highway bill, increasing this to 87 cents. 
   * He worked again to increase this amount to 90.5 percent in the 1998 highway bill. 
   Ohio Highway Facts: 
   * The nation's 10th largest highway network 
   * The 5th highest volume of traffic 
   * The 4th largest interstate highway network 
   * The 2nd largest inventory of bridges.
