SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. WARNER'S RESOLUTION LETTER
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Thursday, Feb. 8, made the following statement regarding his signing a letter to Senate leadership calling for timely consideration of America's Iraq policy: 
  "I have said from the beginning that I would not support any resolution that could be characterized as a political attack against our commander in chief. As the letter indicates, 'Monday's procedural vote should not be interpreted as any lessening' of my resolve to go forward with a full and fair debate of America's Iraq policy. Even Sen. Warner, the author of the underlying resolution, joined me in this procedural vote. 
  "After much research, thought and prayer, I have decided I will support the Warner resolution. It's about time the American people get to hear an honest and open debate about the future of Iraq and its impact on the stability of the Middle East, peace in the world, our national security and our economic competitiveness.".
