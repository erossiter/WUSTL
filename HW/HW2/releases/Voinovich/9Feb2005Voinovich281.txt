SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES $84,000 GRANT FOR TOLEDO FIRST RESPONDERS
  Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the Toledo Fire and Rescue Department has received an $84,000 grant from the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Fire Administration.  
   In April 2004, Voinovich wrote a letter in support of the department's grant application to U.S. Fire Administrator R. David Paulison. 
   "I was glad to help secure these funds which will be used by the Toledo Fire and Rescue Department - partnered with Owens Community College - to conduct training activities throughout Northwest Ohio in fire safety," said Voinovich. "Clearly our first responders need proper resources to protect the community. I've encouraged the Department of Homeland Security to do more to support our first responders and I'm glad to see it happening," Voinovich said. Voinovich is a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee which oversees the Department of Homeland Security and he helped write the legislation creating the new agency in 2002. 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
