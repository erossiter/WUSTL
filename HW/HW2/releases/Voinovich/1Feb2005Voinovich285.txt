SEN. VOINOVICH MEETS WITH MACEDONIAN AMBASSADOR, WIDOW OF LATE MACEDONIAN PRESIDENT TRAJKOVSKI IN WASHINGTON
  Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) met with Macedonia's Ambassador to the United States, Nikola Dimitrov, and Mrs.  
 Vilma Trajkovski, the wife of the late Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski, who was tragically killed when a plane carrying him and eight others crashed in southern Bosnia on February 26, 2004. In March 2004, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by Voinovich honoring the life and accomplishments of the President Trajkovski, who helped Macedonia move forward with reforms necessary to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. Voinovich, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of Serbian and Slovenian descent, pays special attention to Southeast Europe. He considered President Trajkovski a personal friend since they first met during a visit to Stankovic refugee camp in Macedonia in 1999.
