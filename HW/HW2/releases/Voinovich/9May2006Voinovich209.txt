SENS. VOINOVICH, BINGAMAN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION AIMED AT INSURING UNINSURED
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) and Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) have introduced the Health Partnership Act of 2006. This legislation is aimed at extending health care to the uninsured and providing the highest quality health care for all Americans. The bill puts in place a system under which state and local governments can apply for federal grants in order to experiment with health care reform. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-HI).  
   For too many years, I have listened to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk about the rising cost of health care and the growing number of uninsured Americans without much progress here at the federal level. The bill Senator Bingaman and I introduced today aims to break the logjam here in Washington and allow states to experiment with health care reform options. Our hope is the bill will provide a platform from which we can have a thoughtful conversation about comprehensive health care reform here in Washington," said Voinovich. 
   "This bill doesn't prescribe a one-size-fits all solution to our nation's uninsured problem. Rather, it provides federal funding and the leeway states need to determine how best to provide health care coverage to those who currently can't afford it. Massachusetts has taken a bold step toward drastically reducing its uninsured population. Our bill would help other states take the bold action that is right for them," said Bingaman. 
   The legislation will establish a Health Care Expansion and Improvement Commission at the Department of Health and Human Services. The Commission will be tasked with approving a variety of reform options including: tax credit approaches; expansion of Medicaid or SCHIIP; creation of pooling arrangements like the FEHBP; single payer systems; health savings accounts; or a combination of these or other options. 
   States desiring to implement a state health care expansion and improvement program would submit an application to the Commission. After reviewing the state proposals, the Commission would submit to Congress a list of recommended state applications. The Commission would also recommend the amount of federal grant money each state should receive to carry out the actions described in their plan. Both the Commission and states would be responsible for meeting reporting requirements on program progress. Should a state decline to apply or if a unique need exists, local governments would be also be authorized to apply for a federal grant for such purposes. Government entities wishing to apply for the grants would be required to: 
   * Describe the manner in which the state would ensure that an increased number of individuals gain access to health care coverage with a specific five-year target; 
   * Provide a plan to improve overall health delivery quality, including safety and medical errors; 
   * Provide a plan to reduce administrative costs (including paperwork burdens); and/or 
   * Provide methodology for the use of health IT to improve infrastructure.
