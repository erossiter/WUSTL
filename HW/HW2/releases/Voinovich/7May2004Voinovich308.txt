SEN. VOINOVICH LEGISLATION TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM PASSES SENATE
  The Senate today unanimously passed legislation authored by Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) to combat anti-Semitism by increasing awareness of incidents of violence and persecution against Jewish people in nations around the world.  
   Voinovich's bill would require the State Department to submit a major review of anti-Semitism globally by Nov. 15 and also include reports of anti-Semitism in two existing annual surveys the agency conducts-the International Religious Freedom Report and the Human Rights Report. 
   Specifically, the reports will include: 
   Descriptions of physical violence against, or harassment of, Jewish people, and acts of violence against, or vandalism of, Jewish community institutions, such as schools, synagogues, or cemeteries, that have occurred in each country; The response of the government of that country to such attacks; Actions by the government of that country to enact and enforce laws relating to the protection of the right to religious freedom with respect to Jewish people; and Efforts by that government to promote anti-bias and tolerance education. 
   "If we can get a good survey of the scope of anti-Semitism around the world with annual, thorough and public reporting we'll know better how to mobilize to fight it. Education, strong protections for religious freedom, and an appreciation for the importance of tolerance are all necessary if we are to move forward and stamp out this evil," said Voinovich. 
   Voinovich is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has worked to help raise awareness of the disturbing rise of anti-Semitism in Europe. He was instrumental in securing U.S. support for an international conference on anti-Semitism, which took place in Vienna in June 2003. 
   Voinovich's bill, which is cosponsored by 24 senators, now goes to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.
