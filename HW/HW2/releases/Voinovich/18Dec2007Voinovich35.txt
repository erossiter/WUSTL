NEW GOVERNMENT WEBSITE SHEDS LIGHT ON FEDERAL SPENDING
  A new website has been launched by the Office of Management and Budget that shows Americans where their money is being spent. The site - http://usaspending.gov - was mandated by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 - legislation that U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) co-sponsored along with Sens. Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Barack Obama (D-IL). 
  "I am a firm believer in shining light on the federal spending process," Sen. Voinovich said. "Ohioans deserve to know how their money is being spent. This website brings us one step closer to being fully transparent and more accountable to the taxpayers."
  The site provides a searchable database detailing how federal money is spent, whether on contracts, grants, loans, payments, or earmark. It also shows where the money is spent, broken down by state or Congressional district. The site is free to use. 
  Specifically, the site provides the following information:
   * The name of the entity receiving the award; 
   * The amount of the award; 
   * Information on the award including transaction type, funding agency, etc; 
   * The location of the entity receiving the award; 
   * A unique identifier of the entity receiving the award.
