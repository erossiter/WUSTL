SENATE PASSES 2006 ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Senate passed the 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill Thursday night with a vote of 92-3. The bill provides $31.25 billion for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), most of the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies including the Appalachian Regional Commission.  
   "It is of the utmost importance that Ohio has full funding for its water infrastructure projects. I am pleased that we were able to pass this important piece of legislation in order to ensure that Ohio is able to fulfill its environmental and research and development needs. I'm hopeful my colleagues will work quickly to finalize Congress's funding recommendation and get a bill to the President," said Senator Voinovich. 
   Overall, the bill provides almost $4.75 billion to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, $414 million more than the President's budget request and $294 less than the appropriation for 2005. It also provides $ 24.2 billion for the Department of Energy, $104 million more than the President's request and $102 million less than the appropriation for 2005. It provides $65.5 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the same level as the President's request and $10,000 more than the 2005 funding level. 
   The bill includes the following items of importance to Ohio: 
   * Athens: $1,100,000 for the OU Ohio Distributed Hydrogen Project. This Ohio University research will provide science and engineering of producing hydrogen, electricity, and heat on demand by using domestic energy feed stocks such as coal, biomass, and ammonia. The work focuses on producing the hydrogen on-demand from these sources in an inexpensive and reliable manner. This project would help create an energy infrastructure that could eliminate our need for foreign energy supplies. 
   * Cuyahoga: $100,000 for the Euclid Lakefront. The Euclid Lakefront Marina-Harbor Town Project is a comprehensive public/private mixed-use development along the Lake Erie shoreline that will include a breakwaters and marina facility with over 200 slips, a public boardwalk, new commercial development anchored by a lakefront restaurant, and a new lakefront residential neighborhood of approximately 144 town homes and condominiums. This project will generate $740,000 in tax revenue for the city of Euclid and Cuyahoga County. The project will also provide an economically beneficial linkage between the downtown Euclid business district and the Lake Erie shoreline. 
   * Hamilton: $327.6 million for cleanup activities at Fernald. DOE is continuing to cleanup the former nuclear weapons facility at Fernald, which is contaminated with radiological and hazardous materials resulting from DOE's past operations. Expediting this cleanup will allow the plant to close by 2006, saving the federal government significant long-term management and operations costs. 
   * Hamilton, Montgomery, and Pike: $1 million for medical screening at DOE's Fernald facility; $1 million for medical screening at DOE's Mound facility; $465,000 for medical screening at DOE's Portsmouth facility. DOE provides workers at former weapons facilities with medical screening. This project has been in operation at Portsmouth since 1998. 2006 will be the first year at both the Fernald and Mound facility. 
   * Lake: $528,000 for Arcola Creek Ecosystem restoration. In order to address the problem of low summer flows within Arcola Creek, Madison Township, Lake County Stormwater Management Department, and Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District have proposed the construction of regional storm water detention basins in strategic locations throughout the watershed. These detention basins would collect spring runoff and stormwater via manually operated gates that would divert high flows from the Creek. Based on a minimum flow requirement, the basins would be designed to release stored water via re-infiltration that would augment base flow conditions during periods of low precipitation. This increase in baseflow would provide flow conditions and dissolved oxygen conditions within the stream necessary to support fish and benthic populations that may otherwise be lost during periods of insufficient flows. The plan also calls for creation of riparian corridors and the installation of new culverts for increased fish passage to necessary spawning grounds. 
   * Montgomery: $75.5 million for cleanup at Mound. DOE is continuing to cleanup the former nuclear weapons facility at Mound, which is contaminated with radiological and hazardous materials resulting from DOE's past operations. Expediting this cleanup will allow the plant to close by 2006, saving the federal government significant long-term management and operations costs. 
   * Stark: $1.5 million for fuel processors for fuel cell systems at stationary power generation. This funding benefits Ohio with increased knowledge related to fuel processing for fuel cell systems and a supply-chain expansion of support local manufacturing. This will also be a vital contribution to the commercialization of cost effective fuel cell systems benefiting Ohio energy users. 
   * ARC: $65.4 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission.
