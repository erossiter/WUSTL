SEN. VOINOVICH VOTES TO PROTECT TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today reaffirmed his support of traditional marriage and voted to move forward on the Marriage Protection Amendment. The vote failed 49-48.  
   "I have always believed that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman," Sen. Voinovich said. "It is the cornerstone of our society and is critical for the future of our children and families." 
   Nine states currently face lawsuits attempting to overturn their marriage laws. In addition, a federal judge in Nebraska has struck down the state's marriage amendment - a ruling which is on appeal in the 8th Circuit Court. Future lawsuits and rulings are inevitable. 
   "The time will come when the majority of Congress will understand the seriousness of this issue to the foundation and future of our nation and will support a Constitutional amendment," Sen. Voinovich said.
