SEN. VOINOVICH INTRODUCES LANDMARK BIENNIAL BUDGET BILL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "deficit hawk," today introduced landmark legislation aimed at converting the annual budget cycle into a biennial - or two year - cycle. This would save Congress valuable time eaten up every year debating appropriations matters and allow it to focus on oversight of the programs being funded. 
   "In 25 of the past 30 years, Congress has failed to enact all the appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year," Sen. Voinovich said. "This year, instead of dealing with finishing our appropriations work, my colleagues continued to pass the buck on real budgeting and settled for a continuing resolution. This irresponsible fiscal policy affects our ability to fight the War on Terror, interferes with our ability to maintain and improve our infrastructure and impedes efforts to enhance our education system. By failing to do our job, we are starving federal agencies and preventing them from doing their job. This is irresponsible management and it has to stop." 
   Under biennial budgeting, the annual budget, appropriations and authorizing processes would be converted into a two-year cycle: the first year would be reserved for the budget and appropriations process, and the second year would be for conducting oversight and passing authorizing legislation. This would leave Congress with more time to examine programs to determine which are wasteful, which should receive more funding and which should be terminated altogether. 
  Sen. Voinovich's legislation also establishes:
   * A discretionary spending cap; 
   * Pay-as-you-go rules requiring Congress to offset the costs of any new entitlement spending or tax cuts; 
   * A "rainy day" fund for emergency spending; 
   * A requirement to fully account for the increased interest costs that would result from proposed legislation; 
   * A long-term (50-year) spending increase point of order; and 
   * A budget concepts commission. 
   "The task is daunting, but now is the time to act," Sen. Voinovich said. "I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy - or burden - we will leave them."
