MONTHLY REPORT FROM SEN. VOINOVICH, NOV. 29: SUPPORTING LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS
  Recently, Sen. Voinovich hosted a roundtable discussion with Butler County Commissioners who have launched a health care program similar to Sen. Voinovich's Health Partnership Act (HPA) legislation. Butler County's program, HealthShare, could help thousands of workers and become a model for other Ohio counties. It is exactly the kind of effort HPA would encourage. HealthShare, which opened enrollment on September 1, 2007, is a two-year pilot project offering basic health benefits for people who are working in Butler County without health insurance, targeting families earning $55,000 or less and individuals earning $30,000 or less. The plan will offer limited medical coverage for services such as hospital care, doctor visits, physicals, X-rays and immunization shots. With the number of uninsured Americans now numbering more than 47 million, providing access to quality health care is one of the greatest domestic challenges facing the nation. Sen. Voinovich's bipartisan HPA legislation is aimed at breaking the political logjam in Washington by allowing states like Ohio to experiment with health care reform options and reward them when they lower health care costs and make health insurance more affordable in their state.
