MONTHLY REPORT FROM SEN. VOINOVICH, NOV. 29: TAKING A STAND AGAINST HUMAN-ANIMAL HYBRID CREATION
  Sen. Voinovich recently joined Sen. Sam Brownback and 13 other colleagues to introduce the Human-Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act. The ever-increasing rate and breadth of technology has led some scientists to experiment with the creation of human-animal hybrids. Sen. Voinovich's bill bans the creation of organisms that truly blur the line between humans and animals. The legislation is fair in that it does not view all human-animal mixes as "hybrids" because some procedures do not blur the line between species. For example, a human with a replacement pig heart valve is not considered a hybrid under the bill. Additionally, mixes that do not blur the line between human and animal such as a mouse created with a human immune-system to test drugs used for AIDS patients would not be banned. This common-sense bipartisan legislation will work to ensure that legitimate scientific research is not infringed upon, while helping ensure some scientists are not playing God with human life. The bill currently has a total of 18 cosponsors and is supported by organizations such as the Concerned Women for America, Family Research Council, Friends of the Earth, International Center for Technology Assessment and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
