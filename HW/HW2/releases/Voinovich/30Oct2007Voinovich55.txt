SEN. VOINOVICH'S DAM REHABILITATION LEGISLATION PASSES HOUSE
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), along with U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka (D-HI), last week introduced the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2007 -legislation to establish a program within FEMA to fund dam rehabilitation and repairs. The House version of the bill - which has nearly 20 cosponsors - passed overwhelmingly late yesterday and now awaits Senate action. 
   The fund would award grants to states to repair, rehabilitate or remove publicly-owned deficient dams. Deficient dams are defined as dams that, as determined by a state, fail to meet minimum state dam safety standards and pose an unacceptable risk to the public.
   "I have long been concerned with our nation's infrastructure and for years have lauded the accuracy of experts who warned that the infrastructure supporting our economy and quality of life is crumbling," Sen. Voinovich said. "Yet, we have continually failed to invest in the improvements necessary to keep pace with our growing population and increasing demands. As a former governor of Ohio I believe that the federal government should bear some responsibility in rehabilitating public infrastructure, including dams. This legislation is truly a step in the right direction."
   Currently, Ohio has 825 deficient dams - the most deficient dams in the country - including 170 high-hazard dams (dams whose failure can cause loss of life and significant property destruction). The state has failed to inspect about 100 high-hazard dams that could kill residents or cause significant property damage if they burst, due to lack of funds.
   This legislation would authorize a total of $200 million to help rehabilitate deficient dams. The federal share of the grants cannot exceed 65 percent of the total cost of the rehabilitation or repair.
   The funding would be broken down by year as follows:
   * $10 million for Fiscal Year 2008
   * $15 million for Fiscal Year 2009
   * $25 million for Fiscal Year 2010
   * 50 million for Fiscal Year 2011
   * $100 million for Fiscal Year 2012
   * $400,000 for each of Fiscal Years 2008 to 2010 for additional FEMA staff
   Examples of Ohio High-Risk Dams that Would Be Eligible for Funding:
   * Lower Girard Lake Dam (City of Girard in Trumbull County)
   * Ballville Dam (City of Fremont in Sandusky County)
   * Swift Run Lake Dam (City of Piqua in Miami County)
   * Forest Hill Park Dam No. 2 (City of East Cleveland in Cuyahoga County)
   * Somerset Reservoir Dam (Village of Somerset in Perry County)
   * Lower Shaker Lake Dam (City of Cleveland in Cuyahoga County)
   * Roosevelt Lake Dam (Scioto County)
   * Buckeye Lake Dam (Fairfield and Licking Counties)
   * East Reservoir Dam (Summit County)
   * Lake Milton Dam (Mahoning County).
