SEN. VOINOVICH CO-SPONSORS BILL AIMED AT ADVANCING AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) is an original co-sponsor of legislation introduced today aimed at improving our nation's competitiveness through advancements in and emphasis on science and math education and our nation's research infrastructure. The Protecting America's Competitive Edge Act of 2006 reflects the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences Report "Rising Above the Gathering Storm." The report has gained considerable attention since its release in fall 2005 because of its innovative look at ways to advance American competitiveness.  
   "The decisions and investments we make today will determine the competitiveness of the United States for future generations. As I travel throughout Ohio, it is clear that the economic framework of our nation needs to be renewed. It is government's responsibility to provide the best infrastructure so that the American economy can compete in the global marketplace. Reinvestment in science and math education is the key to building a highly knowledgeable workforce of young Americans," said Voinovich. "In addition, it is critical that we focus our research dollars toward innovations that will grow our economy. Of all our challenges, none is more pressing today and in the near future than energy. I have called for a Second Declaration of Independence - independence from foreign sources of energy. However, our ability to achieve greater energy independence will be impossible without a highly educated and motivated workforce." 
   The legislation--which is sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD)-works to advance American competitiveness through advancements in energy, education, research, immigration and trade, and tax incentives. The proposals include: 
   * The creation of a Director of Mathematics, Science and Engineering Education Programs at the Department of Energy (DOE) to coordinate all mathematics, science and engineering education; 
   * The establishment of a new office within the DOE modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Authority (DARPA) to support ground breaking energy research; 
   * Two new education grants by the Department of Education aimed at students in institutes of higher education and Advanced Placement programs; 
   * The creation of a standing subcommittee in the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology to develop national goals for education in mathematics, science and engineering across the various federal agencies that conduct such programs; 
   * The creation of a National Coordination Office for Advanced Research Instrumentation and Facilities; 
   * An increase in the overall authorization funding levels for basic research in the physical sciences by 10 percent annually from 2006 through 2013; 
   * Making the entire Research & Development tax credit permanent; 
   * Requiring the Treasury Department, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, to analyze the U.S. tax system and its effect on the United States. 
   * Providing for a tax credit of up to $500,000 annually to employers who provide qualified education to maintain or improve employees' knowledge in science or engineering.
