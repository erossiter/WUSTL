SEN. VOINOVICH COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and conferee on the bill, today released the following statement regarding the president's veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) Conference Report, which was passed by the U.S. Senate in September by a vote of 81 to 12. It is the first WRDA bill passed by the Senate since 2000, when Sen. Voinovich was Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee: 
   "I am disappointed that President Bush chose to veto this critical legislation. The passage of this bill was a major step forward toward addressing the challenges we face as a nation and in many of Ohio's communities with water quality. We are facing a water infrastructure crisis and our national investment in water resources has not kept pace with our level of economic expansion. If the steep decline in federal investment persists then our continued economic expansion and environmental improvements will be threatened. Cleaning up our lakes and streams is critical to improving our nation's water quality. I am sure my colleagues share my sentiment on this issue and we will work together to do what we can to get these vital projects funded by overriding this veto."
