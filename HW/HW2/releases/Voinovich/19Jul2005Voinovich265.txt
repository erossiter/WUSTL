SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement tonight in response to the President Bush's nomination of Judge John G. Roberts, Jr. to the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "I look forward to a timely confirmation process and the confirmation of a fair and well-qualified judge. I hope the confirmation process for this nominee follows the example set during the confirmation of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, where the Senate focused on her professional competence and personal qualities when considering her nomination. As for myself, I will examine the nominee's professional experience, prior government experience, and judicial temperament, especially their humility. 
   I believe we are already off to a good start. The White House has done an excellent job in reaching out to Senators to learn the qualities we believe are important in a nominee. I had a very productive conversation with White House Counsel Harriet Miers, who just sent me a very kind hand-written note regarding our conversation. I hope the rest of the confirmation process can continue to proceed as smoothly. We have plenty of time for all Senators to review the record of the nominee, so that we can have the nominee confirmed prior to the start of the Supreme Court's next term in October."
