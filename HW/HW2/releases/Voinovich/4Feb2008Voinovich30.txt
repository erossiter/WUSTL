SEN. VOINOVICH COMMENTS ON FISCAL YEAR 2009 BUDGET REQUEST
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement today regarding the president's Fiscal Year 2009 Budget request: 
   "Although I was pleased to see the president's budget address the unsustainable growth of entitlement spending and health care costs, it did not go far enough. This budget only looks fiscally responsible because it ignores hundreds of billions of dollars in costs that the administration itself supports - the war in Iraq, physician payments reform and AMT relief.
   "I believe that after waging the Global War on Terror since 2001 we can be safe in thinking we need to budget for it each year. An annual budget should include war costs for the entire year, not just for the first few months.
   "I am also disappointed that the budget includes only a one-year AMT patch instead of a permanent solution. The president has made clear - and Congress agrees - that we cannot keep extending this relief on a year-by-year basis without fundamental reform. Yet, he takes credit for AMT revenues in his deficit projection just as he includes spending cuts to physician payments. Elsewhere in the budget the president states that he actually supports restoring higher payments to physicians. He is simply kicking the can down the road on both of these issues to Congress and the next administration."
