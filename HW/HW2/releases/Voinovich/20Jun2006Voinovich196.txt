SEN. VOINOVICH VOTES TO COMMEND IRAQI GOVERNMENT FOR STANCE AGAINST AMNESTY
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today voted in favor of an amendment commending the government of Iraq for affirming its policy against granting amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers. His statement follows:  
   "We are at war with terrorists and insurgents who want to deny the Iraqi people the freedom that is the right of all mankind. American soldiers are putting their lives on the line to help the people of Iraq. 
   "Granting amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers would make a mockery of our joint efforts in the Global War on Terror. I commend the Iraqi government for reaffirming its policy against amnesty and making it clear that Iraq and America are fighting the same war and will stand united. We will win this war if we continue to stand united in support of our troops and our values.".
