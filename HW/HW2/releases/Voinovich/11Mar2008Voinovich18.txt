SEN. VOINOVICH INTRODUCES BILL AIMED AT JOB DEVELOPMENT, KEEPING AMERICA COMPETITIVE
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today introduced legislation aimed at creating new jobs by making it easier for states to implement regional workforce and economic development programs that meet the needs of the workers and employers. The Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development Act of 2008, or the WIRED Act, will assist states in attracting and retaining businesses and jobs by helping to ensure that a state can leverage federal workforce dollars towards the development of a well-trained workforce.
   "My legislation works to ensure that America's workforce includes the right people with the right skills in the right place at the right time," Sen. Voinovich said. "Global competition is often seen as a national challenge, but the regional level is where solutions must be developed to meet that challenge. Local economies are where companies, workers, educators, researchers, entrepreneurs, philanthropies and governments come together to create competitive advantages and where new ideas and knowledge are transformed into advanced, high-quality products and services." 
   Sen. Voinovich's bill will allow regions to effectively align education, workforce and economic development systems toward meeting regional economic needs. It provides a framework through which regions can:
   * Identify assets, opportunities and risks;
   * Establish regional economic goals; and 
   * Develop workforce and economic development strategies that will help achieve those goals.
   The WIRED Act amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), which was passed by Congress to authorize service and training for youths, adults and laid-off or dislocated workers to give states and regions greater flexibility in their use of federal workforce development dollars. It also allows states to focus on developing more regional and demand-driven workforce programs and increases the ability for economic and workforce development funds to be used to leverage scarce federal dollars. Currently, WIA program funds cannot easily be used across program areas. As a result, the existing workforce training system is not fully meeting workers and employers' needs.
   Despite Ohio's relatively high unemployment rate (5.5 percent compared to the national average of 4.9 percent in January 2008) and many economic challenges, Ohio will return roughly $20 million in unspent WIA dollars from prior years as part of a federal rescission of these funds. This is happening, in part, because reallocating these funds to address other workforce development needs is too cumbersome. At the same time, recent press reports indicate that Ohio's employers are having a difficult time finding the highly-skilled workers they need to compete.
   "When Ohio's vital workforce development dollars are being returned to the federal government, new tools must be developed to ensure the state's workforce and economic development needs are met," Sen. Voinovich said. "The opportunities are there, but employers cannot find the highly-skilled workers they need. When this happens, there is a disconnect between the needs of our nation's workers, the needs of our nation's employers and the design of the workforce development system. The WIRED Act will help states like Ohio by giving them greater flexibility to tailor workforce and economic development programs to address the needs of the 21st century global marketplace."
   Sen. Voinovich's bill would authorize three new voluntary programs within the existing WIA framework that would allow states and regions to develop and implement strategies to strengthen or revitalize regional economies by giving states and regions greater flexibility to tailor workforce programs to meet local needs. The bill: 
   * Authorizes states and regions to work with a governor (or governors in the case of multi-state regions) to submit WIRED plans for approval by the Secretary of Labor. The plans must be aimed at crafting targeted workforce development programs that provide enhanced job training and related employment activities in the region. They may include complementary economic development activities. If approved, the plans could allow states to combine a number of different federal workforce and economic development funds;
   * Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to award supplementary grants to assist in implementing a WIRED plan or to carry out other regionally-focused workforce development activities; and
   * Authorizes the use of formula funds available to states and local areas under WIA to carry out regionally-focused workforce development activities without going through the entire WIRED approval process. As stated earlier, some of this vital funding is currently going unused because of the inflexibility of the WIA program.
   By making these three voluntary options broadly available, the bill is intended to empower states and local communities to address the workforce challenges posed by global competition and economic change. The WIRED Act builds and expands upon the principles underlying the WIRED Initiative that was begun by the Department of Labor in 2006 and currently provides assistance to 39 regions across the country, including a WIRED region in southeast Ohio.
