SEN. VOINOVICH OPENS NEW SOUTHEAST OHIO OFFICE
  Sen. Voinovich has announced the opening of his new southeast Ohio office at 78 West Washington Street in Nelsonville.  
 This new office will provide his southeast Ohio constituents a more centralized location with greater access. 
   "I originally opened my office in Appalachian Ohio to ensure that citizens in the region could easily visit with my staff and seek information or assistance. I have really appreciated getting to know the wonderful people and communities, and I know that the new, centralized location will serve them even better. I will continue to work hard for all of southeast Ohio, and my staff will continue to reach out to residents and officials to help your counties move forward," said Senator Voinovich. 
   The office staff keeps the Senator apprised of issues of regional concern and input from constituents. The office facilitates casework assistance to constituents, assists communities seeking federal appropriations, and works with community leaders to help Senator Voinovich continue to be a strong and responsive federal partner. 
   The Nelsonville office staff will also participate in Nelsonville's Final Fridays, a community reception occurring the last Friday of every month except December. This will be a way for the Senator to be available for people during non-business hours also. 
   The Senator has four other state offices in Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Toledo. To save costs, he opened his Columbus and Toledo offices with Senator DeWine, and they jointly share the space.
