MONTHLY REPORT FROM SEN. VOINOVICH, NOV. 29
  Thank you for your interest in my e-newsletter. Communicating with my constituents has always been a top priority for me, and I look forward to regularly updating you on the work I'm doing to help Ohio and the nation. As this year comes to a close, I have been working tirelessly in Washington to represent the needs and interests of Ohioans on a variety of issues. I have also taken every opportunity I can to return to the state and personally visit with constituents. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to visit my Web Site at http://voinovich.senate.gov. And please share this e-newsletter with your friends and family by forwarding it to their email!
