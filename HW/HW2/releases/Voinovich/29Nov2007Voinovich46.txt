MONTHLY REPORT FROM SEN. VOINOVICH, NOV. 29: LEADING THE NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE
  As Ranking Member of the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, Sen. Voinovich is committed to the safe and secure growth of nuclear power to help meet our nation's need for a clean, reliable, cost-effective and diverse energy supply. Recently, the senator chaired a roundtable to discuss America's nuclear renaissance and the associated workforce challenges and opportunities. Each new nuclear plant constructed will employ between 1,400 and 1,800 people during construction with peak employment of up to 2,800. These jobs will include skilled trades such as welders, pipefitters, masons, carpenters, millwrights, sheet metal workers, electricians, ironworkers, heavy equipment operators, insulators, engineers, project managers and construction supervisors. The roundtable brought together the leaders from organized labor - including John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO - as well as leaders from the nuclear industry, academia, professional society and federal agencies to discuss the impending skilled labor shortage and its potential impact on the energy sector. The expansion of nuclear energy would create good-paying jobs in Ohio while helping the environment.
