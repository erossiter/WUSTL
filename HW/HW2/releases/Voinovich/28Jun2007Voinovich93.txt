  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today released the following statement after voting against cloture on the Senate immigration bill. The voted failed 46 to 53:  
  "I want an immigration bill that secures our borders, revises and updates our current laws to respond to our economic needs and brings the 12 million illegal aliens in our country out of the shadows. I am not convinced that this legislation meets those criteria. As ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia, I have concerns regarding how all the provisions in this bill could practically be implemented by the Department of Homeland Security. I also think it's important that we respond to concerns raised about the bill by the American public.".
