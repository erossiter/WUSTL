SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES OVER $170,000 FOR JOB ACCESS SERVICES IN MAHONING AND TRUMBULL COUNTIES
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) is pleased to announce that a $170,859 grant from the Federal Transit Administration has been awarded to the Western Reserve Transit Authority (WRTA). The grant monies will be used for job access services for the needy in Mahoning and Trumbull Counties.  
   "I am a firm believer that everyone who wants to work should be able to work. Transportation needs should not be an impediment to the financial security and satisfaction of holding a job," said Voinovich. "These funds will play a key role in ensuring that individuals are aware of the job access services available to them." 
   The grant will provide Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) funding to WRTA to continue job access activities, which include continued peak service to selected routes so buses will run every 30 minutes, as well as continued extended hours of five routes until 12 midnight. In addition, the grant provides funding for marketing to raise awareness about coordinated transportation services available to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families participants, low-income persons, and agencies that provide training, job development, and support services to those individuals.
