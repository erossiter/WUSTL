SEN. VOINOVICH PRAISES REP. PORTMAN'S NOMINATION TO BE U.S. TRADE REPRESENATIVE
  Today, Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement regarding the nomination of Rep.  
 Rob Portman (R-OH) by the President to be United States Trade Representative. 
   "Rob Portman is an excellent pick for the job of Trade Representative (USTR) but I am going to miss him because we have collaborated on so many legislative matters going back to my days as Governor of Ohio. He has been a good friend and colleague for many years and I have complete faith that he will serve our nation with the intelligence, enthusiasm, and strength that mark his time in Congress. 
   "The role of USTR is strategic to the economy of the state of Ohio and we face some tough challenges right now on the trade front, particularly China's rampant theft of our intellectual property and unfair currency manipulation. Rob's experience as a former trade attorney and his understanding as an Ohioan of the manufacturing sector will allow him to tackle these problems head on. 
   "I'm proud that Rob's been selected for this job and I anticipate a speedy confirmation. I look forward to working with him to help level the playing field and open new markets for American products and workers."
