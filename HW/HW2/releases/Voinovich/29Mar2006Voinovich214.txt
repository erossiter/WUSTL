SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF LOBBYING REFORM BILL
  Today the United States Senate overwhelming passed S. 2349, The Lobbying Reform Bill, with a vote of 90 to 8. The bipartisan legislation makes a number of important reforms to how business is conducted in Washington and works to enhance public confidence in Congress by providing a number of strong reforms and enhancements to existing rules. As chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), voted in favor of the bill and is very pleased with the passage of this vital piece of legislation. He released the following statement:  
   "I applaud the hard work of my colleagues on this important issue and am very pleased we were able to pass lobbying reforms that protect the integrity of our legislative process, close loopholes, promote moral and ethical behavior, and enforce our Senate Rules. I am particularly pleased that this bill requires the completion of an ethics training program conducted by the Ethics Committee within 120 days of enactment for current members of the United States Senate and staff, as well as requires training for in-coming members and staff. I am also pleased that this bill requires members and staff to provide advance itineraries of any third-party travel to the Ethics Committee for review. Currently, the Ethics Committee already encourages members and staff to submit to such pre-travel review, but this is done on a voluntary basis. This new consultation process will help to ensure that members and staff meet their obligations under the Senate's rules. 
   "During this process, I was particularly concerned about the bipartisan independence of the Senate Ethics Committee, and I applaud the changes that make mandatory items that the Ethics Committee has previously encouraged as best practices. I am grateful that the lobbying bill will allow the Ethics Committee to report on our work to members of the Senate and the public at the end of each year. I am hopeful that this increased disclosure will shed some light on the efforts of the Ethics Committee and help illustrate that we are enforcing the Senate's rules, as well as helping to keep members and staff from violating the rules of the Senate." The Lobbying Reform Bill includes the following provisions: 
   * Requires the Senate and House Ethics Committees to issue annual reports describing the activities of each committee so that the public will know that their members of Congress take allegations of misconduct seriously, and investigate such allegations rather than ignoring them. These reports will include: 
   - The number of alleged violations of Senate or House rules; 
   - A list of the number of alleged violations that were dismissed; 
   - The number of complaints about which the non-partisan committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry; 
   - The number of complaints that staff presented to the committee with recommendation that the complaint be dismissed; 
   - The number of complaints that the staff presented to the committee with recommendation that the investigation proceed; 
   - The number of ongoing inquiries; 
   - The number of complaints that the committee dismissed for lack of substantial merit; 
   - The number of private letters of admonition or public letters of admonition issued; and 
   - The number of matters resulting in a disciplinary sanction. 
   * Requires current and future members and staff to participate in mandatory ethics training. 
   * Requires the Senate Ethics Committee to review all third-party travel, which will assist members and staff in staying in compliance with the Senate's travel rules. The Senate Ethics Committee's staff already works with members and their staff on a voluntary basis on ethics training and reviewing third-party travel, but these enhancements will require a number of the processes that the Senate Ethics Committee considers best practices. 
   * Strengthen disclosure requirements by lobbyists to quarterly, mandates that the disclosures be made available to the public on the internet, and doubles applicable non-disclosure penalties to $100,000; 
   * Provides for auditing of the Lobbyist Disclosure Act reports by the GAO to ensure that lobbyists are meeting their obligations under the law; 
   * Prohibits lobbyists from offering gifts to members and staff, including meals; and 
   * Requires the disclose of the number of referrals from Congress to the Justice Department for enforcement, and the Justice Department to disclose the number of enforcement actions undertaken on those referrals, so that the Congress and public will know that these reforms are being vigorously enforced.
