  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement today in response to Harriet Miers' withdraw from U.S. Supreme Court nomination: 
   "I am disappointed that Ms. Miers did not have the opportunity to discuss her qualifications to serve as a Supreme Court justice with the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as a whole. I am hopeful that the President's next nominee will be treated with the respect that he or she deserves."
