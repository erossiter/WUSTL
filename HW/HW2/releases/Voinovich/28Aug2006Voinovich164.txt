CUYAHOGA COUNTY NATIONAL PARK TO RECEIVE NEARLY $900,000 FOR RAILROAD UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE
  Today, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) applauded the announcement that Cuyahoga County National Park will receive nearly $900,000 from the U.S. Departments of the Interior and Transportation under the Alternative Transportation In the Parks and Public Lands program (ATTPL). The funds will be used for upgrades and maintenance to the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.  
   "I'm very pleased the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad will receive this funding," Sen. Voinovich said. "The railroad moves thousands of visitors through the park each year. This grant will ensure that park officials can continue to improve accessibility to the park, particularly for visitors with limited mobility, so that all can enjoy its natural beauty." 
   The new ATTPL program was established under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act - A Legacy of Users of 2005 (SAFETEA-LU). The funds for Cuyahoga County National Park will be allocated as follows: 
   * $170,000 to prepare design documents to allow for upgrade of railroad signals at grade crossings of Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad; 
   * $185,000 to develop plans to rehabilitate the existing rail in Cuyahoga National Park; 
   * $170,000 to purchase a railroad maintenance vehicle to maintain 51 miles of railroad track; and 
   * $373,000 to purchase an additional ADA accessible railcar.
