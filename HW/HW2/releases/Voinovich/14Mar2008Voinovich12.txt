SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON EPA'S ANALYSIS OF LIEBERMAN-WARNER
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), Ranking Member of the Environment & Public Works Committee's Subcommittee on Clean Air, issued the following statement on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) analysis of the Lieberman-Warner America's Climate Security Act (S2191.): 
  "EPA's analysis confirms that S. 2191 has the potential to seriously disrupt the U.S. economy, while doing little to address global climate change. The analysis predicts that by 2030, losses in gross domestic product (GDP) could be as high as $983 billion. By 2050, those losses could grow as high as $2.8 trillion. What is not explicit in the analysis, however, is that it assumes aggressive growth in nuclear power and other forms of clean energy, including clean coal, at rates that are widely regarded as unachievable for both practical and political reasons.
  "As EPA's analysis demonstrates, under more constrained assumptions associated with the expansion of these clean energy technologies, the economic costs could be devastating - rising as high as $2.5 trillion by 2030 and $5 trillion by 2050, with electricity rates doubling over the same time period. 
  "If we want to solve this global problem without seriously disrupting our economy and moving jobs overseas, we've got to get serious about moving forward with clean energy technologies, including clean coal and nuclear power."
  EPA's Key Findings: 
  * EPA's analysis revealed the Lieberman-Warner bill could potentially cost $191 billion in lost GDP within the next 6 and half years. 
  * EPA's modeling shows a potential 44 percent increase in electricity prices by 2030 caused by the bill. 
  * The U.S. economy will take nearly a trillion dollar hit by 2030.
