SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES $44,580 GRANT FOR KIRTLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the Kirtland Fire Department has received a $44,580 Fire Prevention and Safety Grant from the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP).  
   "I am pleased that the Kirtland Fire Department has received this grant. These funds will help the department to better carry out its mission," said Voinovich. "Our firefighters need the proper resources to protect the community, and I've encouraged the Department of Homeland Security to do more to support them." 
   The AFGP awards grants directly to local fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   Voinovich is a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security, and he helped write the legislation creating the new agency in 2002.
