   The President
  The White House
  Washington, D.C. 
  Dear Mr. President:
   We are writing in support of Governor Ted Strickland declaring a state of emergency across nine counties in Ohio . Record rainfall and severe flooding in Allen, Crawford, Hancock, Hardin, Putnam, Richland, Seneca, Van Wert and Wyandot Counties have left scores of Ohioans without homes and has even tragically led to fatalities. Currently, U.S. Coast Guard and state assets are assisting in disaster response operations. 
   Governor Strickland's current state of emergency declaration makes disaster assistance available to flooding victims across Ohio . Should Ohio 's own assets be insufficient however, it is our hope that your office will not hesitate to provide federal assistance to help blunt the extraordinary costs and damages related to this disaster. 
   We encourage your support of Governor Strickland and hope any request for emergency assistance will be met promptly. Thank you for your attention to this matter of great importance to the people of these counties. 
   Sincerely,
   George V. Voinovich
   Sherrod Brown
   John Boehner
   Marcy Kaptur
   Paul E. Gillmor
   Jim Jordan
