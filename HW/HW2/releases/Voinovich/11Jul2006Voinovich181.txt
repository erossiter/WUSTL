SEN. VOINOVICH CONDEMNS TRAIN BOMBINGS IN INDIA
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement condemning today's train bombings in India:  
   "My heart goes out to the victims and their families on this tragic day. America is standing with the people of India today and our support is steadfast. Following 9/11, India was one of the first countries to offer assistance to our nation. Its people and government expressed genuine sympathy for our loss while they mourned losses of their own at the World Trade Center. September 11 quickened the pace for a stronger relationship by underscoring the commonalities between our democracies and cementing our mutual commitment to work more closely together. I will work to continue that close relationship as we move forward toward a safer world free from terror.".
