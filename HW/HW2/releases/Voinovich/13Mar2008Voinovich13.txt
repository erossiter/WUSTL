SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON EPA OZONE STANDARDS
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's decision on National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone: 
   "I'm disappointed with EPA's decision to mandate more restrictive standards. The state of Ohio and local communities are making great progress towards improved air quality and compliance with the current standards. By moving the goal-post back without giving nonattainment areas sufficient time to comply, these areas will likely remain in noncompliance for the foreseeable future - further impacting their ability to attract and retain jobs. Ohio EPA estimates that 32 counties will not be able to comply with the new standard."
