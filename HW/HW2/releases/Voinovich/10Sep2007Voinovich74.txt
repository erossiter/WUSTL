SEN. VOINOVICH: GREECE NOMINATED TO ENTER VISA WAIVER PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, today announced Greece has been nominated to enter the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). The nomination was made by the State Department to the Department of Homeland Security. Sen. Voinovich recently saw his reform of the VWP - the Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007 - signed into law by President Bush as part of the 9/11 bill. His statement follows: 
   "I am delighted to announce that Greece has been nominated to participate in the Visa Waiver Program following the recent enactment of my Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007. The selection of Greece for this program reflects the close security cooperation our two nations share. This will have a positive impact upon American tourism, business and overall economic competitiveness and will further strengthen cultural ties between our two nations. I look forward to Greece's formal admittance into the VWP and to learning of additional nominations of our allies as they meet the necessary security criteria for participation. I am pleased the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State are exercising the new flexibilities provided by my legislation. Our nation can benefit both in terms of national security and economic stability when we work with our friends around the world."
