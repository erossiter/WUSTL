SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE ELECTORAL VOTE DEBATE
  "John Kerry is to be congratulated for understanding something that his party's most extreme elements have yet to comprehend-Ohioans know how to count.  
   "As a Republican from Cleveland who has been elected to federal, state, county and municipal offices, I am living proof that Ohioans know how to count ballots and, more importantly, that we count fairly. 
   "After two statewide canvasses, our state's independent, county-based, bipartisan elections officers have come to the same conclusion-that President Bush is, in fact, the President. 
   "Editorial boards from Ohio newspapers, many of which endorsed Kerry, agree as well: the so-called recount effort is a circus that needs to pack up and leave town. 
   "To say that the vote fraud conspiracy theorists are tilting at windmills is an understatement. They're using a legitimate public process to pursue an agenda that is, at best, grasping at straws and, at worse, partisan. 
   "The country deserves to be able to put an undisputed election to rest. We need to stop wasting time and move on to the serious issues facing our nation."
