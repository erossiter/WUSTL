SEN. VOINOVICH LAUDS TSA AGREEMENT ON ENHANCED WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today praised the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) announcement of an agreement to provide enhanced whistleblower protection for transportation security officers (TSOs). The memorandum of agreement was signed by the TSA and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). 
   "I congratulate TSA and MSPB on their efforts to strengthen whistleblower protection rights for the people who work every day to protect our airlines and transportation infrastructure," Sen. Voinovich said. "I fully support TSOs filing claims with MSPB, which is why I joined with my colleagues in co-sponsoring an amendment to the Improving America's Security Act that would have done just that. But even without the statutory requirement, I applaud TSA and MSPB for taking the initiative to extend this important protection to screeners."
   Sen. Voinovich has long called on reforms to TSA's personnel authority and for TSOs to be included in some basic workforce protections. In March 2007, the senator called on TSA to extend to TSOs the ability to file a complaint with the MSPB for an adverse action. 
   While he has applauded TSA for developing and implementing a robust, internal process including an ombudsman office, disciplinary review board and peer review board, Sen. Voinovich believes the value of the independent review of MSPB that could follow the internal process is important to build further confidence in TSA's system and reassure to those being hired and on the job.
