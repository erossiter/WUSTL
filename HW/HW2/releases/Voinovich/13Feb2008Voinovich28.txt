SEN. VOINOVICH INTRODUCES LANDMARK BIENNIAL BUDGET BILL
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "debt hawk," today joined other Republican colleagues in introducing landmark legislation, the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act, aimed at converting the annual budget cycle into a biennial - or two year - cycle. This would save Congress valuable time eaten up every year debating appropriations matters and allow it to focus on oversight of the programs being funded which are currently neglected in the one year budget cycle. 
  "In 25 of the past 30 years, Congress has failed to enact all the appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year," Sen. Voinovich said. "This irresponsible fiscal policy affects our ability to fight the War on Terror, interferes with our ability to maintain and improve our infrastructure and impedes efforts to enhance our education system. By failing to do our job, we are starving federal agencies and preventing them from doing their job. This is irresponsible management and it has to stop."  
   Under biennial budgeting, the annual budget, appropriations and authorizing processes would be converted into a two-year cycle: the first year would be reserved for the budget and appropriations process and the second year would be for conducting oversight and passing authorizing legislation. This would leave Congress with more time to examine programs to determine which are wasteful, which should receive more funding and which should be terminated altogether. 
   "The task is daunting, but now is the time to act," Sen. Voinovich said. "I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy - or burden - we will leave them."
   The bill is co-sponsored by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Conference Chairman Lamar Alexander, Policy Committee Chairman Kay Bailey Hutchison, Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Pete Domenici, Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss as well as Senators Johnny Isakson, Jeff Sessions and Bob Corker.
