LEGISLATION TO HELP RESTORE, PROTECT GREAT LAKES PASSES COMMITTEE
  Today, legislation sponsored by Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) to better coordinate Great Lakes restoration efforts and protect the Lakes against invasive species passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Voinovich is a member.  
   The provisions were included as amendments to the 2004 Water Resources and Development Act (WRDA) which now goes to the full Senate for its consideration. 
   "Restoring the Great Lakes could be the greatest legacy any of us leave on this earth. These are not just beautiful bodies of water but are critical economic, recreation, environmental and transportation resources and we need to be doing all we can to protect the clean-up progress we've made and take it further," said Voinovich. 
   Specifically, Voinovich's legislation would make permanent the President's recently-created task force to coordinate environmental restoration and management activities in the Great Lakes basin among federal, state, and local governments. 
   The legislation would also help fund the completion of an electric barrier and add a second one in the Illinois River near Chicago to prevent Asian Carp in the Mississippi River basin from entering Lake Michigan. The carp is an aggressive species which would displace native fish and upset the Lakes' ecological balance by quickly consuming large quantities of phytoplankton, which is critical to the stability of the ecosystem. According to reports, the carp made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River more than 10 years ago. They can grow to four feet and 60 pounds and can consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton per day.
