SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN RULING
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today released the following statement in response to the United States Supreme Court ruling upholding the ban on partial birth abortions: 
  "Today's ruling is one of the most significant of our time. I applaud this decision and hope it leads the way to a renewed respect for human life in our nation. When I was governor, Ohio passed the nation's first partial birth abortion ban. I was disappointed when a federal court struck down that ban. But I was very pleased to continue the fight for life when I came to the Senate. I worked with Senator DeWine to help craft legislation we believed would pass constitutional muster. Thank God we got the job done and the Supreme Court finally agreed. We've now eliminated for good a gruesome practice that is nothing less than infanticide. However, we cannot stop here. Those of us who consider ourselves pro-life need to understand that we also must create an environment that causes expecting mother to choose life and support them once they make that critical decision."
