SEN. VOINOVICH CO-SPONSORS BILL TO ELIMINATE TAX CODE BY 2010
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "deficit hawk," today co-sponsored the Tax Code Termination Act - legislation that would repeal the U.S. Tax Code by 2010 and force Congress to reauthorize it or replace it with a new system that's fair and easy to understand.  
  "Washington has become too accustomed to its current culture - a culture that's destroying our competitiveness in the global marketplace," Sen. Voinovich said. "Drastic measures are needed if we want to create better jobs and a higher quality of life for our kids and grandkids."
  The Tax Code Termination Act, written by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), also creates a bipartisan commission that would be required to examine and to recommend to Congress plausible replacements for the tax code. 
   The commission would also be required to report on the potential impact of any new tax system on the U.S. economy and on the government's ability to collect revenue. And the bill will create a National Commission on Tax Reform within the legislative branch, consisting of 19 members. Four of the members will be required to come from businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The commission will be appointed by the president, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the House and the House Minority Leader.
  "Congress needs a serious overhaul of its tax code if we're going to get this country back on the right track," Sen. Voinovich said. "While it won't be easy to pass this legislation, it will at least help us bring attention to this problem, and force this Congress and administration to deal with these looming issues instead of passing the buck to future generations."
  Also, in January, Sen. Voinovich re-introduced legislation aimed at a comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act also establishes a national commission to examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with budget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States and recommend reforms. The Commission may consider all policy options, including:
  * Limiting the growth of entitlement spending to ensure that the programs are fiscally sustainable;
   * Strengthening the safety net functions of entitlement programs to provide assistance to the neediest;
   * Making the tax code more efficient and more conducive to economic growth; and
   * Providing incentives to increase private savings.
