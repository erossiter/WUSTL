MONTHLY REPORT FROM SEN. VOINOVICH, NOV. 29: HONORING THE LEGACY OF REP. GILLMOR
  After the untimely passing of U.S. Representative Paul E. Gillmor in September, Sen. Voinovich wanted to find a way to honor the legacy of his friend - the committed and hard-working legislator for Ohio's 5th district. In October, Sen. Voinovich introduced legislation to name the U.S. Post Office in Tiffin, Ohio, after Rep. Gillmor. Most recently, the bill was unanimously passed by the Senate. The bill must next be passed by the House and it will then go to the president for his signature. Not far from his small home town of Old Fort, Tiffin was chosen in concurrence with the wishes of Rep. Gillmor's wife, Karen. Also, in his commitment to serve all of Ohio's citizens, Sen. Voinovich invited service academy applicants from Ohio's 5th district to contact his office for nominations until Rep. Gillmor's seat is filled. As a long-time friend and colleague of Rep. Gillmor, the senator committed to ensuring his constituency was not deprived of the opportunity to attend a service academy and further serve our country while the office is vacant.
