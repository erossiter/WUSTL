SEN. VOINOVICH TO INTRODUCE COMPROMISE MINIMUM WAGE BILL
  On Monday, January 22, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) will introduce a fiscally responsible compromise bill that raises the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour and includes targeted business tax relief and corresponding budget offsets. Sen. George Voinovich joins a number of his Senate colleagues and President Bush in advocating that the minimum wage should be increased, so long as there is sensible and targeted tax relief for the small businesses that will bear the burden of this wage increase and that such relief is offset against other spending.  
  Sen. Voinovich's bill is consistent with what the voters of Ohio determined in November when - by nearly 60 percent - they approved a state constitutional amendment approving an increase in Ohio's minimum wage.
  "I have heeded the call of my constituents and believe it is time for a fair increase to our nation's minimum wage," Sen. Voinovich said. "But it cannot be done on the backs of our small businesses. Individual entrepreneurship is critical to America's competitiveness in the global marketplace. An increase without tax relief for employers would throw a wrench into the engines of growth for our economy and ultimately harm those workers the increase is meant to help."
  Many previous tax relief proposals tied to the minimum wage have generally benefited "small business," but these proposals have been poorly targeted in that: (1) Many small businesses that would benefit from the tax relief do not suffer from minimum wage increases; and (2) Many employers who suffer from minimum wage increases would not benefit from such tax relief proposals. Sen. Voinovich's bill represents an improvement in efforts to properly target tax benefits to small businesses most likely to pay the minimum wage.
  Specifically, Sen. Voinovich's minimum wage bill:
   * Expands the work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) to apply to teenagers who work in restaurants where tipping is not customary and who earn at least the minimum wage;
   * Includes tax relief designed to assist small businesses such as restaurants for building improvements; and
   * Codifies the current regulatory option for small businesses to use cash accounting.
