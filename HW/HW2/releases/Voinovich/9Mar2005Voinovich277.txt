   109TH CONGRESS 1ST SESSION 
   Designating March 25, 2005, as ''Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy''. 
   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
   RESOLUTION 
   Designating March 25, 2005, as ''Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy''. 
   * Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people; 
   * Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy; 
   * Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of the United States in 1821, ''it is in your land that liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we succeed in resembling you''; 
   * Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete that presented the Axis land war with its first major setback, setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the outcome of World War II; 
   * Whereas the price for Greece in holding our common values in their region was high, as hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed in Greece during the World War II period; 
   * Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only 3 nations in the world, beyond the former British Empire, that was allied with the United States in every major international conflict; 
   * Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek Independence Day, said, "Greece and America have been firm allies in the great struggles for liberty. Americans will always remember Greek heroism and Greek sacrifice for the sake of freedom . . . [and] as the 21st Century dawns, Greece and America once again stand united; this time in the fight against terrorism. The United States deeply appreciates the role Greece is playing in the war against terror. . . . America and Greece are strong allies, and we're strategic partners."; 
   * Whereas Greece is a stabilizing force by virtue of its political and economic power in the volatile Balkan region and is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe; 
   * Whereas Greece, through excellent work and cooperation with United States and international law enforcement agencies, arrested and convicted key members of the November 17 terrorist organization; 
   * Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful "law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is making to the global war on terrorism"; 
   * Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to United States requests during the war with Iraq, as Greece immediately granted unlimited access to its airspace and the base in Souda Bay, and many United States ships delivering troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were refueled in Greece; 
   * Whereas the Olympic Games came home in August 2004 to Athens, Greece, the land of their ancient birthplace 2,500 years ago and the city of their modern revival in 1896; Whereas Greece received world-wide praise for its extraordinary handling of over 14,000 athletes from 202 countries and over 2,000,000 spectators and journalists and did so efficiently, securely, and with its famous Greek hospitality; 
   * Whereas the unprecedented Olympic security effort in Greece for the first post-9/11 Olympics included a record-setting expenditure of over $1,390,000,000 and assignment of over 70,000 security personnel, as well as the utilization of an 8-country Olympic Security Advisory Group which included the United States; 
   * Whereas Greece, geographically located in a region where Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with Muslim nations and Israel; 
   * Whereas Greece has had extraordinary success in recent years in furthering cross-cultural understanding and reducing tensions between Greece and Turkey; 
   * Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and human rights; 
   * Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond between our 2 nations and their peoples; 
   * Whereas March 25, 2005, marks the 184th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire; and * Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from which our 2 great nations were born: 
   Now, therefore, be it resolved that the United States Senate: 
   * Designates March 25, 2005, as ''Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy''; and 
   * Requests that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
