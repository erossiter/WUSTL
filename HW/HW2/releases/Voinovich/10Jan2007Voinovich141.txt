SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Wednesday, January 10, released the following statement regarding the new direction in Iraq and the call for a surge in troops. Sen. George Voinovich met with President Bush in the White House on Friday to discuss the current situation. Also in attendance were Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rice, National Security Advisor Hadley, Gen. Peter Pace and top White House officials. He also attended a three-hour classified intelligence briefing yesterday. Sen. George Voinovich's statement follows: 
  "At this point I am skeptical that a surge in troops alone will bring an end to sectarian violence and the insurgency that is fomenting instability in Iraq. The generals who have served there do not believe additional troops alone will help. And my faith in Prime Minister al-Maliki's political will to make the hard choices necessary to bring about a political solution is fragile at best. What we need first is a political solution between Sunni Arabs and Shia militias that are adding to the violence.
  "Over the next month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, will hold three hearings a week on Iraq. During that time I hope to receive from the administration the level of detail necessary to make a decision of this magnitude. And I want real evidence that a potential surge in troops will do more good than harm and will not exacerbate the existing violence in Iraq. This move may have enormous national security implications for our nation. I want answers to many critical questions and to hear straight from the generals about why this would be in the best interest of the United States.".
