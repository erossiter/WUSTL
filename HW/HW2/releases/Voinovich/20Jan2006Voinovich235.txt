SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES OVER $300,000 FOR CENTRAL OHIO TRANSIT AUTHORITY
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $300,766 grant from the Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration.  
 This money, secured in the 2005 Transportation Omnibus Appropriations Bill, will be awarded to the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA). 
   "I'm pleased that we were able to secure funding for COTA. With these funds, they will be able to continue to maintain the highest level of safety and customer service for their riders," said Voinovich. "As the Central Ohio area continues to expand, it is important that public transportation maintain the highest level of quality and safety." 
   The grant will be used to continue the work that is being done on the McKinley bus garage. COTA has served Central Ohioan's transportation needs for over 35 years. Their 56 routes across three counties provide for 55,534 weekday bus rides, covering more than 935 miles.
