SEN. VOINOVICH TO INTRODUCE VISA WAIVER LEGISLATION FOR NATIONS COOPERATING WITH WAR ON TERROR
Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, today announced that he plans to introduce legislation next week which would extend visa-free travel privileges to our allies in the Global War on Terror. The legislation would improve cooperation on counterterrorism and advance United States national security interests.  
 Yesterday, in Estonia, President Bush called on Congress to extend the Visa Waiver Program to include countries who are our allies in the War on Terror. 
 "There are many countries helping us thwart terrorism around the world and they should be rewarded for their continued cooperation," Sen. Voinovich said. "This legislation would improve both our national security and economic interests. I have been working on this for months and am pleased to see the president shares my goals. I will work closely with the administration and my colleagues in the Senate as we move forward to show our allies that we appreciate their help in this historic fight."
