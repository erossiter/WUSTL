SEN. VOINOVICH SUPPORTS REQUEST FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IN ASHTABULA, GEAUGA, LAKE COUNTIES
  Yesterday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that Lake, Geauga and Ashtabula Counties were granted Public Assistance from the federal government, which will allow state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations to receive funding for critical infrastructure repairs, such as to damaged roadways and bridges. Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) wrote a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Paulison supporting the request made by Gov. Bob Taft for Public Assistance.  
   "Having personally visited the disaster area, I can attest to the severity of the infrastructure damage in the affected counties," Sen. Voinovich said. "I strongly believe these counties are in need of federal assistance to aid in infrastructure repairs and restoration, and I am pleased with FEMA's decision to grant Public Assistance." 
   These counties have already been granted Individual Assistance, a request also made by Governor Taft and supported by Senator Voinovich. Individual Assistance includes grants for temporary housing, repairs to damaged homes, and other serious disaster-related expenses, as well as low-interest loans to businesses not fully compensated by insurance. The state has also been granted funding for hazard mitigation projects to prevent or reduce long-term risk to life and property from future natural or technological disasters. 
   The letters Senator Voinovich wrote supporting Individual and Public Assistance are attached.
