SEN. VOINOVICH HELPS SECURE NEARLY $300 MILLION FOR OHIO MILITARY PROJECTS
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today voted in favor of the 2008 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which passed the full Senate by a vote of 92 to 1. The bill includes $298.7 million in funding the senator requested for Ohio military construction and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)-related projects, fully funding Ohio's 2008 BRAC military construction requirements. It must now go to a conference committee where the differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill will be rectified.
   "Our military is playing a critical role at home and abroad in defending our nation against terrorism. With the new challenges to our national security it's more important than ever that our Armed Forces are ready, equipped and well-trained," Sen. Voinovich said. "Fundamental to that is making sure we provide our troops with the resources they need, including quality facilities in which to work. These funds also help ensure that we keep our promise to our veterans and that they receive the care they deserve after returning from duty." 
   Overall, the bill provides $109.2 billion in new budget authority for the U.S. Department of Defense - a nearly 12 percent increase over 2007 levels. For military construction, the bill provides: $21.56 billion for military construction for active and reserve component accounts; and $8.17 billion for BRAC activity. It also includes $89.91 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
