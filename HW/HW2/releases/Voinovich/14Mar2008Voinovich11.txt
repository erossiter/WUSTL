SEN. VOINOVICH VOTES AGAINST BUDGET RESOLUTION, FOR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "debt hawk," voted early this morning against passage of S. Con. Res. 70, the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution. His vote represents his opposition to Congress continuing to ignore America's dire fiscal problems by using smoke and mirrors to mask long-term challenges.
   "Neither Republicans nor Democrats have offered a budget that even comes close to re-establishing our fiscal sanity," Sen. Voinovich said. "The Democrats actually increase the national debt by $2 trillion over five years, which increases the debt owed by every American child by $27,000. We must stop this charade once and for all. Both sides of the aisle have a clear, moral obligation to improve the fiscal health of our nation. And it starts with formulating a fair and honest budget." 
   The Budget Resolution voted on in the Senate today uses egregious tricks to give the appearance of a responsible budget by:
   * Allowing for unlimited emergency spending, although a great deal of the spending that is currently designated as "emergency" is actually quite regular and predictable; 
   * Allowing for a dramatic increase in entitlement spending through the use of more than 37 reserve funds that are not included in the overall budget totals; 
   * Hiding increases in discretionary spending through the use of seven Cap Adjustments - appropriations for seven favored programs and agencies will not count toward the budget limit as if they don't even exist; 
   * Claiming that at least $300 billion in revenue will be collected from "closing the tax gap," or collecting more of the taxes that are currently owed but not paid. The fact is, this is much more difficult than they make it sound. These taxes should be collected, but if it was as easy as the Democrats make it sound, we would have found the money to fix the AMT years ago; 
   * Settling, yet again, for no entitlement reform and instead growing entitlement spending by $488 billion over five years; and 
   * After a decade of Democrats calling for 10-year budgets because five-year budgets hide our long-term problems, Democrats are now settling for a five-year budget that continues to cover up the gathering fiscal storm looming on our horizon. 
   "Experts say the most important step you can take is to first admit you have a problem. Well, we've got a big problem. Let's finally admit it and fix it," Sen. Voinovich said. "The question now is, do we have the moral courage to fix it - or, are we too interested in protecting our political hides to do anything?" 
   Fiscal Reality Check-Startling Statistics:
   * As Baby Boomers begin to retire just over nine months from now, we face a long-term fiscal imbalance of $53 trillion. That translates into $456,000 of future government debt for every American household - or $175,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. 
   * Forty years ago, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid accounted for 3.5 percent of GDP. Today, they're up to 9 percent. In another 40 years, they'll be up to 18 percent - equal to total federal revenues and crowding out all other spending. 
   * Since 1999, the national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $9.4 trillion today - an increase of more than 68 percent in just eight years. This amounts to $31,000 of debt for every American. 53 percent of the privately owned national debt is held by foreign creditors, including the Chinese government. That is up from 40 percent just five years ago. 
   * These numbers - which represent our past behavior - pale in comparison with the budget problems looming in our future as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire this year.
