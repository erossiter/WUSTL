SEN. VOINOVICH TO INTRODUCE LANDMARK TAX, ENTITLEMENT REFORM BILL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top "deficit hawk", on Tuesday, Jan. 16, will introduced landmark legislation aimed at a comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. 
  The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act establishes a national commission to examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced a similar bill in the House. 
  "Last week I voted against the fiscally irresponsible repeal of the estate tax and called on Congress to heed Americans' demand for fundamental tax and entitlement reform. This legislation shows that I'm serious about that call," Sen. Voinovich said. 
  The reported deficit for FY2005 was $318 billion - and that's not taking into account the funds borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund, which brings the total to nearly $500 billion. Even more, when utilizing the Department of Treasury's accrual accounting method, the deficit is a disturbing $760 billion. Also, the national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 1999 to $8.4 trillion today - an increase of 50 percent. Full repeal of the estate tax beginning in 2007 through 2016 would cost $368 billion according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
  "As a fiscal conservative, I believe we must focus on simplifying the tax code and ensuring the solvency of our entitlement programs," Sen. Voinovich said.
  The Commission will be comprised of 15 voting members, three of which will be appointed by the president, three by the Senate Majority Leader, three by the Senate Minority Leader, three by the Speaker of the House and three by the House Minority Leader. The director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General of the United States will be appointed as non?voting ex?officio members of the Commission to lend their expertise. The president will have the ability to appoint the chair from among the 15 voting members. 
  The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with budget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States and recommend reforms. A minimum of six public town hall meetings will be held throughout the country within one year to determine the scope of the problem and consider solutions. The Commission may consider all policy options, including:
  * Limiting the growth of entitlement spending to ensure that the programs are fiscally sustainable;
   * Strengthening the safety net functions of entitlement programs to provide assistance to the neediest;
   * Making the tax code more efficient and encouraging economic growth; and
   * Looking at ways to increase private savings. 
  "America's fiscal situation is dire. Nothing is off the table when it comes to ensuring our long-term prosperity and increasing our competitiveness in the global marketplace," Sen. Voinovich said. "Especially important is the tackling of fundamental tax reform. It could, by some estimates, save taxpayers over $265 billion just in costs associated with preparing their taxes alone. That would be a real tax reduction and it would not cost the Treasury a dime. It would be a tax cut that would guarantee people are paying no more than their fair share and would bring more money into the Federal Treasury."
  At the conclusion of the town meetings, the Commission will present a report to Congress detailing the fiscal problems facing future generations as well as a framework of long-term solutions.
  Within 60 days of the presentation of their report to Congress, the Commission will transmit to Congress a legislative proposal designed to: 
   * Address the imbalance between long-term federal spending commitments and projected revenues; 
   * Increase net national savings to spur domestic investment and economic growth; and 
   * Improve the budget process to place greater emphasis on long?term fiscal issues.
  The administration and Congress will each have 60 days to review the proposal and develop equivalent proposals if they deem necessary. Any alternative from the administration or Congress would be considered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute. Congress will be required to vote on the proposals within a specified time period. The proposal with the greatest number of votes would be the Congressional body's preference going into conference.
  "The task is daunting, but now is the time to act," Sen. Voinovich said. "I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy - or burden - we will leave them.".
