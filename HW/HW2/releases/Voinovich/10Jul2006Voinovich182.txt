SEN. VOINOVICH PRAISES CITIGROUP'S NEW INVESTMENT IN OHIO
  Citigroup Inc. today announced plans for a national Information Technology (IT) center in Blue Ash. The center, which will provide IT services for Citigroup's North American Consumer Business, could eventually bring more than 1,000 new jobs for software developers, project managers, systems analysts and other IT professionals to the Cincinnati area. It is expected to open in the fourth quarter of this year. Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today said that this is wonderful economic news for the region. His statement follows:  
   "This is great economic news for the Cincinnati area and the entire state. The 1,000 new jobs will have a significant economic impact and the quality of the IT workforce in Cincinnati will help keep the United States competitive in the global marketplace. It is clear that the economic framework of our state and our nation must be renewed. That is why I have co-sponsored the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act of 2006 - legislation aimed at improving our nation's competitiveness through advancements in science and math education. Reinvestment in science and math is a key element to building a highly knowledgeable workforce of young Americans. We must commit ourselves to improving our human capital so that our nation may continue to compete with the world's best and brightest."
