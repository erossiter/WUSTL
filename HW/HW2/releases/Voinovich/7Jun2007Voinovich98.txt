SEN. VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES $543,000 FOR CUYAHOGA, LAKE COUNTIES' FLOOD DAMAGE REDUCTION STUDIES
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that $543,000 from the Army Corps of Engineers has been approved for Cuyahoga and Lake Counties Flood Damage Reduction Projects. The funds will be used to conduct feasibility flood damage reduction studies to identify measures to reduce impacts of the flooding which damaged local homes and businesses in June and July of 2006. 
   "These communities suffered greatly due to heavy flooding," Sen. Voinovich said. "Rightly, they were declared eligible to receive disaster assistance. This funding will allow the Army Corps to do flood damage reduction studies which will identify measures that could reduce the impacts of future flooding events. We must realize that flooding will occur again and do everything we can to lessen the damage by preparing for the future."
   Project areas receiving funding include: Brooklyn Heights , the Chagrin River in Eastlake, the Cuyahoga River in Independence, the Cuyahoga River in Valley View, Walton Hills and the Baldwin Creek in North Royalton. 
   Last summer, Northeastern Ohio experienced significant flooding and the area was declared a National Disaster Area by the president. In the recent Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) passed by the Senate, the senator included a provision authorizing the Corps to conduct flood control studies for Cuyahoga and Lake Counties.
