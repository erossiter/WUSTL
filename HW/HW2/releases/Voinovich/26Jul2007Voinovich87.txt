SENATE PASSES SENS. BROWN, VOINOVICH PROVISIONS AS PART OF HIGHER EDUCATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT
  The Higher Education Reauthorization Act, which passed the full Senate Tuesday by a vote of 95 to 0, includes two key provisions sponsored by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH). The Early Childhood Education Professional Development and Career System Grants Act authorizes federal grants to help states attract, train and retain high-quality early childhood educators. The Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program continues a competitive grant program to research, display, interpret and collect artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad.  
   "Early education has a significant impact on a child's overall educational experience, and this bill would help highly qualified educators teach children during their crucial developmental years," Senator Brown, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) Committee, said. "The reauthorization of the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural program will ensure that a major part of our nation's history is preserved for future generations."
   "Supporting America's teachers is not only an investment in the future of our children but also an investment in the future of our great nation," Sen. Voinovich said. "This legislation will bolster the quality of education at one of the most important times in our children's lives - their youngest years. Additionally, the Underground Railroad and the brave Americans who stood up in the face of slavery must never be forgotten."
   A 2004 Economic Policy Institute study found that 42 percent of early childhood educators did not have any college-level education, and less than one in three educators had a bachelor's degree. According to the Center for Childcare and the Workforce, child care providers earn an average wage of less than $20,000 a year. 
   To address this issue, Sens. Brown and Voinovich introduced the Early Childhood Education Professional Development and Career System Grants Act in May to authorize the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to states in need of early education assistance. States that receive a grant would be required to form a task force and develop strategies to attract, train and retain high-quality early childhood professionals.
   The task force would be required to look at all aspects of the early childhood profession including:
   * Core competencies, career ladders and compensation; 
   * Credit transfer policies between educational institutions within the state; 
   * Mentoring and coaching of new teachers and directors; 
   * Improving the higher education degree programs for early childhood education teachers; and 
   * Setting a standard of quality to evaluate early education programs. 
   The senators also introduced the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program to provide competitive grants to non-profit organizations around the U.S. to help shed light on the important social movement, while preserving artifacts from the era. The grant program will assist both the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati and the Underground Railroad Tour in Lorain.
