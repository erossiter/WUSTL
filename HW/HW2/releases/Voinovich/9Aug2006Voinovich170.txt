SEN. VOINOVICH SECURES OVER $400,000 FOR TOLEDO EXPRESS AIRPORT
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the Toledo Express Airport has received $400,000 from the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish nonstop service to New York and to foster growth within the community. The senator helped secure the funds as part of the Small Community Air Service Development Program.  
   "This grant is wonderful news for Toledo," Sen. Voinovich said. "The funds will give residents greater access to transportation that meets their needs and will provide opportunities for economic growth, tourism and employment. This grant will enable the Toledo Express Airport to attract and retain the level of air service the community deserves." 
   Toledo Express Airport serves the air transportation needs of a tri-state region, including Northwest Ohio, Northern Indiana and Southwest Michigan. Toledo's economy is composed of a diverse mix of industry including glass, plastic, primary metal and fabricated metal products, as well as automotive assembly and parts production. The location makes Toledo one of the most important transportation and distribution centers in the Midwest. 
   With many Fortune 500 companies such as Owens Corning, Dana Corporation and Owens Illinois headquartered in the Toledo region, access to the nation's financial capital is important to the region's growth. Nonstop service to an international hub such as John F. Kennedy International Airport will provide valuable links to the Northeast, Southeast and Europe. 
   Complete community proposals and the DOT's final order are available on the Internet at http://dms.dot.gov, docket number OST-2005-23671. A list of recipient communities and funding totals is available on www.dot.gov/affairs/chart06.htm.
