SEN. VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON WRDA VETO OVERRIDE VOTE
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and a conferee on the bill, today released the following statement regarding his vote to override the president's veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) Conference Report. The override vote - the final vote was 79 to 14 - was successful and the bill is now law. It is the first WRDA bill passed by Congress since 2000, when Sen. Voinovich was Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee: 
  "This bill now becoming law is a major step forward in bolstering Ohio's water quality. We are facing a water infrastructure crisis and our national investment in water resources has not kept pace with our level of economic expansion. If the steep decline in federal investment persists then our continued economic expansion and environmental improvements will be threatened. Cleaning up our lakes and streams is critical to improving our nation's water quality and today we advanced this issue in the right direction."
