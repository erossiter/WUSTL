SEN. VOINOVICH HONORS GAINS MADE BY REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
  Last night, a resolution introduced Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) commending the Republic of Croatia for its progress on cooperation with the International Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and in other areas such as human rights, democracy, and defense reform passed by Unanimous Consent.  
 The resolution calls for the integration of the Republic of Croatia into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) upon Croatia's completion of NATO's requirements. 
   "I am pleased that the resolution passed by Unanimous Consent. It is a sign of our country's support for our friends in the Republic of Croatia. It has long been my dream to see Croatia and its neighbors integrated into the European Union and NATO. I believe this is the key to bringing stability, prosperity, and peace to that part of the world," said Voinovich. 
   Voinovich traveled to Croatia in May 2005, where he met with Croatia's President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and several other officials to discuss Croatia's future and its progress in the areas of democracy, defense reform, human rights, and protection for minorities. 
   Voinovich stated, "It is clear that Croatia is making real progress on reforms. Prime Minister Sanader has also shown a great deal of leadership by working with Croatia's Serb-minority to establish a more tolerant, multi-ethnic society in Croatia. There is a lot of work to do, but Croatia deserves recognition for its accomplishments." 
   Senator Voinovich and Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), an original co-sponsor of the legislation, are working to expedite the resolution so that it can be passed by unanimous consent prior to adjournment of the Congress.
