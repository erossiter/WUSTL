SEN. VOINOVICH INTRODUCES BILL TO REAUTHORIZE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION
  On Tuesday, Feb. 6, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) introduced vital legislation reauthorizing the Appalachian Regional Commission at $510.9 million over five years. Appalachian Regional Commission plays a key role in fostering economic development and improving quality of life for the 23 million people who live and work in Appalachia. 
  The proposed legislation creates the designation of economically "at risk" counties and provides an appropriate federal matching rate for ARC-funded projects in those counties. The bill is co-sponsored by Senator Brown (D-OH), Senator Warner (R-VA), Senator Byrd (D-WV), Senator Lott (R-MS), Senator Clinton (D-NY), Senator Burr (R-NC), Senator Schumer (D-NY), Senator Cochran (R-MS), Senator Mikulski (D-MD), Senator Dole (R-NC), Senator Cardin (D-MD) and Senator Alexander (R-TN). The Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, on which Sen. Voinovich serves, will consider the bill.  
  Marietta to hear testimony on the impact of the last reauthorization of the ARC and to examine how it has made a difference in people's lives," Sen. Voinovich said. "I also spent two days traveling around Appalachian Ohio and was extremely impressed with the wonderful strides being made in the region. The reauthorization of ARC is necessary for the region to fully realize its economic potential and to build upon its already tremendous successes. I am particularly excited about my new initiative focused on enhancing the region's economic competitiveness through energy independence and alternative resource development." 
  Since ARC's inception, the region's poverty rate has been cut in half (from 31 percent to 13 percent), the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds and the percentage of adults with high school education has increased by over 70 percent. 
  Key elements of the legislation include:
  * Renews the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years (2007 - 2011). The agency's current authorization expired on September 30, 2006. The proposed legislation is the same length as the bipartisan authorization Congress approved in 2002.
  * Authorizes the Commission for five years. 
   2007: $95.2 million
   2008: $98.6 million
   2009: $102.0 million
   2010: $105.7 million
   2011: $109.4 million
   * Creates a separate authorization for an Economic and Energy Development Initiative for the region. The initiative would allow the ARC to provide technical assistance and grants to:
   - Promote energy efficiency in the region to enhance its economic competitiveness; 
   - Increase the use of renewable energy resources, especially biomass, in the region to produce alternative transportation fuels, electricity and heat; and 
   - Support the development of conventional energy resources, especially advanced clean coal, in the region to produce alternative transportation fuels, electricity and heat. 
  * Refines the Commission's approach to targeting its resources to the areas of greatest need. The bill directs the Commission annually to designate those counties that are "at risk" of becoming economically distressed. These are counties with fragile economies that are just on the cusp of meeting the criteria for being designated as distressed. They are themselves in need of additional special focus. The Commission itself recently adopted this targeting classification. The legislation would codify the Commission's existing practice.
  * Permits ARC to fund projects in the "at risk" counties at up to 70 percent of the cost of the project. Under current law, these projects may only be funded at 50 percent (the match rate for most ARC counties), while projects in designated distressed counties can be funded at 80 percent of the project costs. This provision reflects the special needs of "at risk" counties.
  * Maintains the requirement that at least 50 percent of the Commission's grant dollars go for projects or activities benefiting distressed counties and areas. This provision was added in ARC's 2002 reauthorization. The Commission currently satisfies this requirement, and no change is proposed.
  * Continues all existing programmatic authorities, including the special program in telecommunications and technology. 
  * Advances the goals of the agency's strategic plan. The Commission unanimously adopted a new strategic plan in 2004. The reauthorization legislation is fully consistent with the plan and the performance measurement targets articulated in that plan.
  During his first term in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich authored the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 2002 (S.1206), which was signed by the president on March 12, 2002. The bill reauthorized the economic development efforts of the ARC, providing $446 million over five years for these efforts, and enacted a new, Voinovich-created technology initiative to help improve the region's telecommunication infrastructure and help businesses and residents take better advantage of e-commerce opportunities.
