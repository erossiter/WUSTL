IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 18  2005 Amidst Urgent HIV Crisis  Schumer Blasts Feds For Shortchanging HIV Funding    New Fed Budget Cuts For HIV Prevention Couldn  t Come At A Worse Time

doctors In response to the urgent HIV crisis brewing in New York City  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today outlined a new four point plan to bolster the New York City AIDS program  and called on the federal government to fully fund critical HIV AIDS initiatives that have been woefully underfunded  Schumer  s call comes on the heels of last week  s report of potentially new and untreatable strain of HIV in New York City        The public health of New Yorkers is in imminent danger  A new  untreatable HIV strain must be fought with a public education campaign  prevention  and improved AIDS tracking  Without substantial new funds  the City cannot adequately fight this potential public health disaster     said Schumer    If doctors don  t have the tools or ability they need to monitor the disease  and the public doesn  t understand potential implications  we  ll be living in the 80 s again          Last week a possibly new and untreatable strain of HIV was detected in a New York City man in his mid 40 s  The superstrain was dubbed  3 DCR HIV  because it s resistant to three of the four HIV drug classes that are currently in use  and thereby renders 19 of 20 treatment drugs  useless  While most cases of HIV take as long as ten years to progress to AIDS  this man  s case is believed to have taken only two months  After they learned of his condition  the New York Health Department started searching for the man s partners  many of whom are unknown because he reportedly engaged in unprotected sex with possibly hundreds of partners while under the influence of the drug crystal methamphetamine       New York City is the epicenter of the HIV AIDS epidemic nationally  with only 3  of the country  s population but almost 16  of the country  s AIDS patients  According to the New York City Department of Health  almost 89 000 New Yorkers diagnosed and known to be living with HIV  including 57 316 diagnosed with AIDS and at least an estimated 25 000 additional people living with HIV but not yet diagnosed  In 2003 alone the number of reported new HIV AIDS cases was 4 086  which surpasses the total number of people living with AIDS in many U S  cities  New York had the highest rate of new AIDS cases in both 2001 and 2002  and the number of people living with AIDS has doubled in the last nine years       To address the dangerous scenario Schumer today called on the CDC to fund a new and multi year demonstration program in New York City which would            Increase Federal Funding 2005 federal funding shortchanged the following 6 crucial domestic HIV AIDS programs by  2 4 billion  according to the needs of the HIV population as identified by the New York AIDS Coalition  The Minority HIV AIDS initiative by  211 1 million  CDC HIV prevention by  386 6 million  six of the Ryan White CARE Act programs by  502 2 million  NIH Office of AIDS Research by  200 million  SAMHSA by  982 4M  Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS  HOPWA  by  103 3M       Of these programs  the three that provide the most significant direct benefit to NYC  CDC HIV prevention  Title I of the Ryan White CARE Act  and HOPWA  are underfunded by  55 8 million for New York City s needs       Last week President Bush made matters even worse by proposing further cuts for the coming year  FY06   The CDC HIV Prevention program  was cut  4 5 million from  662 5 million to  658M  CDC prevention program has never seen an adequate investment and in the past three years its funding levels have actually decreased   President Bush has ignored the challenge of preventing HIV by proposing in February of this year a further reduction of  4 6 million in the program s budget  moving in entirely the wrong direction  Additionally  HOPWA was cut 14 million dollars from  282 million to  268 million       In sharp contrast to the President s cuts to key programs intended to directly educate people about and prevent the spread of HIV AIDS  he has increased funding for abstinence only education by 19   New York receives a significant proportion of all AIDS funding because of the high percentage of Americans living with HIV AIDS here  and therefore suffers the greatest from these twisted priorities       Schumer urged his colleagues in Senate to reverse the poor choices made by President in his budget and increase funding for existing HIV AIDS programs that  if adequately funded  are designed to combat crises like the one currently brewing in NYC            Improve HIV AIDS Tracking  New York does not have adequate systems in place to fully understand how the HIV AIDS epidemic is evolving  The city needs federal funding to expand existing tracking systems to identify potential new strains of the virus and to better understand emerging patterns of resistance to existing drug treatments  To do this  Schumer said  the CDC should recommend that doctors do resistance testing for new diagnoses of HIV  a practice that is not universally implemented  and provide funding to New York to develop systems to track and analyze this information        In addition  Schumer said  New York must develop comprehensive systems for tracking the relative success of different treatments by measuring the amount of the virus present in the bloodstream  Such tracking    based on viral load testing    would assist public health officials in identifying whether patients are receiving adequate and effective treatments in different areas of the city and even at the individual physician level  With this information  officials could better direct resources to doctors and patients to ensure that patients are receiving the most effective treatments and better control the spread of the epidemic in the city           Implement Public Health Detailing  Schumer said that the CDC program should institute a public health detailing program for doctors  comprehensive education and training to ensure doctors have the most up to date tools at their disposal for diagnosing  tracking and reporting the disease  Training will also focus on prevention counseling  partner counseling and meth education and treatment options for patients            Establish Public Awareness Campaign  Schumer said that in light of the new development in the war on AIDS a new  reinvigorated AIDS education program is necessary and called on the CDC to launch a new comprehensive public awareness campaign  The program would use advertising and media outlets as well as community groups and schools to distribute educational information to New Yorkers on the new and persistent dangers of AIDS and risky behaviors
