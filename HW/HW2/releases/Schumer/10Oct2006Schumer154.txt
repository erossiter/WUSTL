IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 10  2006 Schumer Urges Feds To Conduct A Safety Assessment After Unilateral Decision By Norfolk Southern To Increase Speed Of Trains Traveling Through Elmira                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             As Norfolk Southern Increases Freight Rail Speeds From 30 To 50 MPH  Schumer Says  The Old And Decaying Infrastructure Must Be Inspected Immediately    Freight Trains Through Elmira Can Contain Hazardous Materials That Could Pose Safety Risks At Higher Speeds U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the Federal Railroad Administration  FRA  to conduct a safety assessment of the railroad infrastructure after a unilateral decision by Norfolk Southern Corporation to permit their freight trains to increase their travel speed from 30 to 50 mph through Elmira   Elmira officials and citizens are concerned that several viaducts and overpasses are too old and decayed to accommodate this speed increase   The community is worried that the higher speed and the hazardous materials on some of the trains contain could pose safety risks in Elmira  especially if the infrastructure cannot support these changes         There is a big fat question mark on Elmira  s train viaducts when it comes to their ability to handle freight trains barreling through the city at nearly twice the speed as before  The FRA must step up to the plate and answer these questions to the full satisfaction of the people of Elmira  and they need to do it fast     said Senator Schumer     Some of these trains are carrying hazardous materials and we cannot risk the possibility of an accident if these old overpasses and viaducts can  t support this high of speed   Obviously  increasing the speed these trains travel will increase the risk of accidents   The FRA has a responsibility to conduct a comprehensive safety inspection  and if deemed unsafe  Norfolk Southern must reverse their current policy         Elmirans tell me they are concerned about the increased speed of trains traveling through downtown and residential neighborhoods  but Norfolk Southern has offered precious little to allay their fears  If the tracks and viaducts can safely accommodate 50 miles per hour trains  we certainly have not received any information to support that assertion  In fact  we ve received virtually no information  That s why we are asking FRA to inspect the viaducts  and why I have asked Sen  Schumer and others to help encourage Norfolk Southern to hear our concerns and respond     said John Tonello  Mayor of Elmira       The infrastructure of Norfolk Southern in the Elmira community is old and decaying   The viaducts are 75 years old with little or no maintenance done to the underside and there is spalled concrete  exposed reinforcing and failed drainage systems all along the system   Norfolk Southern operates freight only elevated route through the Elmira community  which sometimes carries hazardous materials   In September  Norfolk Southern announced that it would increase the speed of its trains traveling through Elmira  from 30 mph to 50 mph  in order to remain competitive  In light of these infrastructural dangers  city officials have expressed concern about the possible risks associated with these higher speeds to rail cars carrying hazardous waste through Elmira   Last month  Schumer urged Charles W  Moorman  Chairman  President and CEO of Norfolk Southern Corporation  to send a representative to Elmira to meet with city officials  hear their concerns regarding freight train speed and work with community leaders to find an equitable solution to this situation       In a personal letter today to Joseph H  Boardman  Administrator of the FRA  Schumer wrote    Beyond the obvious safety concerns  Elmira officials and citizens are concerned about the condition of several viaducts and overpasses used by Norfolk Southern  s trains when they pass through the city  Therefore  I urge the Federal Railroad Administration  FRA  to investigate these viaducts and overpasses to determine the impact to the infrastructure as a result of an increase in speed  and to further articulate what short and long term infrastructure impacts could result from this increase in speed           Freight trains traveling throughout New York State could pose many safety risks  In 2001  a CSX train crashed in Rochester  derailing 23 cars  three of which spilled thousands of toxic chemicals into the Genesee River  However  this accident could have been far more tragic had the chemicals spilled in to a neighborhood or a crowded community area   In 2004  a CSX freight train derailed in Rockland County  resulting in four cars spilling nearly 200 tons of silicon metal  Last year  a CSX train traveling through the Capital Region went through the gates and ran into a car        Schumer is the author of The Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act which would set tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology   The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and require the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents
