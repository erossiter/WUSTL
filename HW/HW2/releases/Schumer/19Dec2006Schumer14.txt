Chautauqua  Cortland  Dutchess  Jefferson  Livingston  Niagara  Oneida  Orange  Richmond  Rockland  and Ulster Counties         This was a busy year  but by far my most important and enjoyable accomplishment is visiting every county in New York yet again     Schumer said    What I am able to achieve in Washington is directly related to my county visits  Meeting the people and seeing firsthand what they re going through is a vital part of how I go about working to solve problems in their communities   With our new clout and power in Washington  I  m already looking forward to next year  s tour          In addition to significant legislative and political accomplishments in 2006  Schumer has also delivered for the people of New York  with many of his accomplishments and efforts the direct result of visits to New York communities  upstate and down  large and small       In February  with educational  business  and government leaders all citing a decline in math and science proficiency  Schumer visited Rochester and called for the creation of a national math and science center of excellence in Rochester  The goal of the center is to recruit  train and retain outstanding math and science educators  encourage more young people to study math and science  and collaborate with local employers seeking personnel with extensive math or science training   Schumer is fighting for federal funding for the center  now based at Nazareth College       Over the last several months and after an April meeting with Ralph Wilson in Buffalo  Schumer has actively advocated for the Buffalo Bills to the NFL leadership  Schumer worked closely with Commissioner Tagliabue and is now working with Commissioner Goodell to communicate the small market team  s point of view throughout negotiations around the Collective Bargaining Agreement to ensure that measures are put in place that protect the health of small market teams   Earlier this year  Schumer lobbied outgoing NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to ensure the league  s Qualifier Committee includes representatives from small market franchises  On April 21  after a meeting organized by Schumer with Tagliabue and Buffalo native Tim Russert  Tagliabue announced that Bills owner Ralph Wilson would serve on the eight team committee that is now determining how league revenues will be split       On April 12 in Gloversville  NY  Schumer kicked off his statewide grass roots campaign to restore funding cuts made to the federal FIRE grant program   At Schumer s urging  fire departments across New York have taken advantage of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  and used funds for hiring additional firefighting personnel  specialized emergency response training  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  new fire trucks  and fire prevention programs   Schumer led the fight to fund the FIRE grant program at  547 million  far exceeding the  293 million proposed by the Administration   Because of its dramatic success in improving fire safety  Congress has raised the amount of money authorized for the program from  100 million for FY2001 to  950 million in FY 2006 and  1 billion in FY 2007       This June  Schumer immediately visited the devastated counties and promised to deliver as much aid as humanly possible to help families and businesses recover   In the months after the flooding  Schumer successfully prodded state and federal government to expedite disaster declarations and ensure outlying counties were included in relief packages  In July  after extensive lobbying by Schumer  FEMA announced it was sending temporary living trailers to areas damaged by the flooding  Schumer sent a personal letter David Paulison  head of FEMA asking him to move the trailers to New York swiftly   The counties FEMA approved to receive the trailers were Broome  Delaware  Chenango  Herkimer  Montgomery  Oneida  Orange  Otsego  Schoharie  Sullivan  Tioga  and Ulster       Schumer  who stood with fisherman during a July event  worked closely with the recreational and commercial fishing community to build leniency into the fishing quotas  In December  the Senate approved a new deadline to restore the fluke  The deadline  pushed back to 2013  had originally been 2010  placing an enormous burden on the fishing economy and the overly stringent rules were decimating fishing businesses  commercial fishing and recreational fishing which are the lifeblood of Long Island in the summer  The passage of the legislation means the National Marine Fisheries Service now has the ability to rework the quota for the coming summers       On October 25  Schumer  joined by JetBlue CEO David Neeleman during a visit to the airport  announced that the airline would start new low fare service from the Hudson Valley airport   The new service will provide two daily roundtrips to Ft  Lauderdale and Orlando  and one daily roundtrip to West Palm Beach  Since Schumer was first elected to the Senate in 1998  he has worked hard to improve low cost air service from Stewart and all of upstate New York  In 2001  Schumer first introduced JetBlue to Stewart  and since then has pushed Neeleman to locate JetBlue  s cheap fares and first rate service at Stewart   Since first being elected to the Senate  Schumer has visited the airport more than half a dozen times to advocate for increased service and improved access to the airport       During a November visit to Fort Drum  Schumer announced a commitment from Freddie Mac to buy up to  100 million of loans originated by HSBC  In addition  they designed initiatives to provide families with the information they need to learn about the homeownership process  better manage their finances  and provided mortgage products for individuals with limited credit or down payment savings  Earlier in October  Schumer visited the area and made a similar announcement with Fannie Mae   Schumer secured a series of financial  service and product commitments from Fannie Mae for soldiers  their families and the community of Fort Drum       In December  the Senate passed a two year extension of the Schumer authored College Tuition Tax Deduction  which saves middle class families across the country thousands of dollars every year by allowing them to deduct up to  4 000 in college tuition expenses from their taxes   On an October conference call with reporters and during visits to colleges in Buffalo and Rochester  Schumer said that the credit was needed now more than ever as the cost of going to college in upstate New York was up more than 35 percent since 2001
