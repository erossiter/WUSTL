IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 1  2005 Schumer    The Myth Of The Ginsburg Precedent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Schumer Says that the   Ginsburg Precedent   is Neither Ginsburg nor Precedent    Sitting Justice Answered Many Questions  as Did Other Supreme Court Nominees  Senator Delivers Speech to the American Constitution Society Five Days before Roberts   Confirmation Hearing U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer delivered a speech to the American Constitution Society today to talk about the   Myth of the Ginsburg Precedent    Schumer  the ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  will be highlighting the many questions that Justice Ginsburg and other Supreme Court nominees have answered at past hearings        The text of the prepared speech follows       I want to thank the American Constitution Society for hosting this event       The Senate is only five days away from the first Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 11 years       Five days away from discharging one of the most solemn duties we have       Five days away from gaining insight into the judicial views of someone who  if confirmed  will serve for a lifetime and will have the power to affect the life of every single American       I continue to have an open mind about John Roberts and look forward to the hearings  I believe my fellow Democrats also have an open mind  To my knowledge  no one in the Senate Democratic Caucus has yet stated his or her opposition to Judge Roberts       This is not a coy or political posture   we simply don t know who Judge Roberts is  judicially speaking       And yet  while we approach the hearings with open minds  some are seeking to close the door on meaningful questioning that would help Senators and citizens alike learn something about a man who could have so much power over people s lives and livelihoods       As we approach the hearings  rather than feel confident that we will hear candid answers to critical questions about judicial philosophy  I am concerned that the stage is being set for Judge Roberts to refuse to answer       At the center of this coordinated stage setting is a colossally misleading soundbite       It is repeated like a mantra by the nominee s supporters  featured in new television advertisements  echoed by conservative talking heads  and even intoned by Judge Roberts himself       It is the so called  Ginsburg Precedent        To judge by the self serving descriptions of certain talking heads and right wing interest groups  Ruth Bader Ginsburg sat mute at the hearing table  issued the occasional platitude  and refused to answer questions on any issue  while a panel of Senators sat there frustrated and in the dark about Judge Ginsburg s views on important legal and Constitutional questions       They would have you believe that Judge Ginsburg   who testified for four days   categorically declined to answer any questions about an issue  policy  or decided case       They would have you believe that Judge Ginsburg   who had written over 300 opinions over 13 years as a federal judge   kept her jurisprudence a secret from Senators and the public       They would have you believe that Judge Ginsburg   who had authored scores of articles and speeches on substantive legal matters   remained a riddle wrapped inside an enigma at the conclusion of her hearing       This  Ginsburg Precedent  is  plain and simple  propaganda  It is a ploy  It is a ruse       The very term  Ginsburg Precedent  is an oxymoron  It is neither Ginsburg nor precedent  It is a myth       What do I mean by that  First  when people invoke the  Ginsburg Precedent  to suggest that Judge Ginbsurg was not forthcoming  they do not accurately reflect what happened at Justice Ginsburg s confirmation hearing in 1993       Second  it is not precedent  When one thinks of precedent  one imagines a line of cases that judges have regularly followed  Here  there has been only one person to follow Justice Ginsburg   Stephen Breyer   and eh answered many  many questions about specific cases  recurring issues  and policy matters       My greatest worry is that the myth of the  Ginsburg Precedent  is simply a way to provide cover to a nominee because his supporters would prefer that he not discuss his legal views with any specificity       Without any legal  ethical  or common sense basis for declining to answer standard questions about decided cases and Constitutional questions  these myth purveyors are hoping to rely on a false precedent to excuse Judge Roberts from answering questions that the majority of Americans want him to address       If Judge Roberts repeatedly resorts to the so called  Ginsburg Precedent   it will sound less like a principled refusal to answer and more like a variation on the Fifth Amendment        I refuse to answer that question  on the ground that it may incriminate me  Answering may reveal my actual views about Constitutional law and cause me to lose votes        The myth of the  Ginsburg Precedent  is best debunked by looking at the transcript of her hearing  Although there were places where she said she did not want to answer  she nevertheless gave lengthy and poignant answers to scores of questions about Constitutional law and decided cases       She spoke about dozens of Supreme Court cases and often gave her unvarnished impressions  suggesting that some were problematic in their reasoning while others were eloquent in their vindication of important Constitutional principles       Furthermore  she answered hypothetical questions about a variety of subjects and gave gave her personal views on a number of issues       In fact  Senator Hatch   who has joined the chorus of people now invoking the so called  Ginsburg Precedent  and who applauded Judge Roberts for doing so in 2003   while pressing her to be more specific in answering a question about the death penalty  said         Y ou were very specific in talking about abortion  equal rights  and a number of other issues    Hearing  263       Senator Hatch s comment shows that not only did Ginsburg answer questions forthrightly  but that Senator Hatch   and many others   firmly believed that nominees ought to answer questions with specificity       PRIVACY  Indeed  nominee Ginsburg answered candidly and at length questions about specific cases and issues involving personal autonomy and the right to privacy       Senator Hatch  for example  asked Judge Ginsburg about the line of cases involving the right of privacy  She answered by making reference to a Supreme Court case        I have said to this committee that the finest expression of that idea of individual autonomy and personhood  and of the obligation of the State to leave people alone to make basic decisions about their personal life  is  Justice Harlan s dissenting opinion in Poe v  Ullman  1961         Judge Ginsburg went on to talk about another decided case  in which Justice Powell wrote the majority opinion  Moore v  City of East Cleveland  1977   involving a grandmother who wanted to live with her grandson  She candidly recognized that the opinion  has difficulties  but that it was an eloquent expression of the right to be left alone       Further  when pressed to distinguish the Supreme Court s line of privacy cases from the much discredited decisions in Dred Scott and Lochner  she responded with characteristic eloquence and specificity        In one case the Court was affirming the right of one man to hold another man in bondage  In the other line of cases  the Court is affirming the right of the individual to be free  So I do see a sharp distinction between the two lines        ABORTION  Judge Ginsburg spoke directly about another case   Struck v  Secretary of Defense  1972    which involved a woman s decision to choose birth rather than abortion while serving in the military  In answering  she gave a clear answer stating where she stood on the issue of personal autonomy        The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman s life  to her well being and dignity  It is a decision she must make for herself  When Government controls that decision for her  she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices    Hearing  206 07       Most notably  when talking about Roe v  Wade itself  Judge Ginsburg did not retreat behind a platitude about settled law  She actually leveled some criticism at the scope of the case  though she agreed with the result        My view is that if Roe had been less sweeping  people would have accepted it more readily  would have expressed themselves in the political arena in an enduring way on this question    Hearing  149       In fact  the Judiciary Committee s report on the Ginsburg nomination concluded that  the committee knows far more about Judge Ginsburg s views on reproductive rights than it has known about any previous nominee s        We hear very little about these answers about specific cases and issues when people spread the myth of the  Ginsburg Precedent        CHURCH AND STATE  On the leading case setting forth the standard under which the Court reviews Government intrusion into religion   laid out in Lemon v  Kurtzman   Judge Ginsburg was asked by Senator Simon   You have no difficulty with the Lemon test now        Judge Ginsburg responded   I think that is an accurate description  It is also accurate to say I appreciate the United States is a country of many religions        FREE SPEECH  Judge Ginsburg also answered pointed questions about speech and Government funding       For example  she was pressed by Senator Hatch about a hypothetical   could the Government fund anti smoking campaigns under the Constitution  Again  Judge Ginsburg answered forthrightly        I may get myself into difficulty with the Senators from tobacco States  and I am a reformed sinner in that respect myself        I think the Government can fund antismoking campaigns and is not required equally to fund people who want to put their health and the health of others at risk  So my answer to that question is  yes   the Government can fund stop smoking campaigns          Hearing  268       RACIAL DISCRIMINATION  Judge Ginsburg also did not hesitate to explain her personal feelings about certain legal issues  For example  she spoke poignantly about how growing up during World War II in a Jewish family had made her  alert to discrimination    Hearing  139       WOMEN S RIGHTS  Judge Ginsburg candidly admitted that she still supported an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution  And she was forthright in saying that the Supreme Court in Hoyt v  Florida  1961   wrongly decided the women s jury service issue        CRIMINAL LAW  Judge Ginsburg also spoke in a straightforward way about her views on the Miranda warning  required for the first time in Miranda v  Arizona  In response to questions from Senator DeConcini  she gave her opinion on that still controversial Supreme Court decision       This practical approach  the Miranda warnings  has become familiar to all  thanks to television  I think it has worked         T hese are salutary rules that have safeguarded the constitutional right  Frankly  from my point of view  it makes the system run better              In addition  she expressed her suspicion about the wisdom of mandatory minimum sentences in criminal cases   Hearing  315 16       So  the truth is that Judge Ginsburg    while a nominee    discussed  parsed  and commented on numerous cases       In addition to the cases I ve already mentioned  she also criticized Korematsu as a  tragic decision   Hearing  210  and stated that Dred Scott was Aan entirely wrong decision when it was rendered    Hearing  270        Meanwhile         She applauded Marbury v  Madison  Hearing  289         Agreed that Brandenburg v  Ohio  1969  was one of  the great milestones in the Court s history   Hearing  313          Praised Justice Learned Hand s First Amendment decision in Masses  1917   Hearing  313           Said that  on the issue of overturning precedent   I associate myself with what was said in Casey about settled expectations    Hearing  317         Testified that she had Ano question about the authority of Congress to override the Supreme Court decision in Duro v  Reina  1990    a case involving criminal jurisdiction over American Indians   Hearing  333        The bottom line is that  as a nominee to the High Court  Judge Ginsburg talked about specific cases  she addressed hypotheticals  she discussed public policy  and she revealed her own views about issues like individual autonomy  discrimination  and gender equality       Did she speak more about some issues than others  Of course  She spoke at greater length on issues with which she had greater familiarity       Could she have been even more forthcoming in certain areas  Perhaps       But it is a rank distortion for people to claim that she did not answer questions meaningfully  More importantly  it misses two vitally important distinctions       1  Justice Ginsburg had spent 13 years on the D C  Court of Appeals  written 305 opinions  and penned at least 65 substantive articles  These were enough to provide any Senator with patience and a pair of reading glass ample evidence of her legal thinking  Because she had a long record  it was somewhat less critical for her to answer every question       In Judge Roberts  case  on the other hand  he has only spent two years on the bench and authored a small fraction as many opinions as Justice Ginsburg had at the time of her nomination       2  And of course  Justice Ginsburg was a consensus nominee  whom President Clinton vetted with then Ranking Member Senator Orrin Hatch  Most Senators knew they were going to vote for her  and so the questioning was naturally a bit lighter and more forgiving       That is why the first part of the so called  Ginsburg Precedent  is misleading  It just doesn t accurately describe what Ginsburg said and what Senators knew about her       The second part of the term is equally misleading B the  precedent  part       As I said earlier  Judge Ginsburg s testimony does not constitute a binding case or a legal precedent  Moreover  the conservative ad campaign and talking heads completely and conveniently ignore three things       They blithely ignore  1  the examples set by countless other nominees to the High Court   2  an intervening Supreme Court precedent  and  3  Judge Roberts s own precedent       First  and most astonishingly  they ignore the examples of other nominees to the High Court       Last time I checked  Justice Ginsburg was not the only nominee ever to have come before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a confirmation hearing  What of these other precedents  conveniently overlooked       To pick selected refusals from a single nominee and enshrine that into a stonewalling soundbite is the height of disingenuousness         What about the Breyer Precedent         Nominee Stephen Breyer came before the Committee more recently than Justice Ginsburg  but we hear much less about the  Breyer Precedent   He was very forthcoming about all manner of issues and cases         Senator Specter was so pleased by how forthcoming Stephen Breyer was at his confirmation hearing that he coined a phrase        It has been my conclusion that nominees answer about as many questions as they think they have to        We may have the  Breyer rule  coming out of these proceedings  that more questions are being answered than a nominee would have to answer        I think we may have the  Breyer rule  coming out of this proceeding  which would be very good          What about the Thomas Precedent         Judge Thomas  too  answered many questions about decided cases and specific issues  What about that precedent         When asked whether he agreed with the decision in Bolling v  Sharpe  nominee Clarence Thomas told Senator DeConcini   I have no quarrels  with it         Senator Grassley also asked Judge Thomas if he Ahad any objections to  the test established in Bowers v  Hardwick  as a method of determining the extent of protectable private interests  Judge Thomas said that the methodology was one Acertainly f ou nd agreeable          Despite a clear expression of his views on this case  Justice Thomas wrote a strongly worded dissent in defense of Bowers when it was overruled by the Supreme Court in 2003  No one asked Justice Thomas to recuse himself based on his prior testimony         Senator Leahy asked Judge Thomas if the standard for libel established in New York Times v  Sullivan  provide s  sufficient protection for public figures in your mind   and if Judge Thomas saw  any need to change that standard   Judge Thomas also answered that question         So why aren t we talking about the Thomas Precedent         What about the Powell Precedent         In 1971  Senator Mathias asked nominee Lewis Powell about two cases   Miranda and Escobido   and asked   I am wondering if       you think these cases should be overruled   Powell responded by giving his candid view   I just happened to have the view that the minority opinion was the sounder one  in Miranda           What about the Souter precedent         Even David Souter  who has been derided by some as a stealth nominee to the Supreme Court  gave his views on specific cases and was prepared to go farther than Roberts s supporters NOW say is appropriate         In response to a question from Senator Grassley about whether Miranda  improperly created rights   for example  Judge Souter said        I personally have looked at Miranda as a pragmatic decision intended to protect a right  and the only sense in which I think probably you can say there was an extension of a right was  Justice Harlan s comment that Miranda merely extended the fifth amendment from the courtroom to the police station       Other examples abound  But not only have Supreme Court nominees answered questions at their confirmation hearings  but once confirmed  they have continued to speak and write candidly about Constitutional questions and cases       Of course  every sitting Justice of the Supreme Court has DISSENTED numerous times in cases       If a statement critical of a majority opinion in a case were by itself cause for disqualification from future cases on a similar issue  our system would collapse       Justice Blackmun famously wrote in dissent in Callins v  Collins that  From this day forward  I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death   Death penalty litigants appearing before Justices Blackmun  Brennan  and Marshall knew quite a bit about how these Justices thought about the issue       Similarly  on cases involving not only the death penalty  but also affirmative action  reproductive rights  and other issues  litigants appearing before Justices Scalia  Thomas  and Rehnquist are unlikely to be surprised  based on their vigorous dissents in a number of cases       Justices also have a tradition of giving their legal opinions about matters in books  articles  and speeches  None of this disqualifies them from hearing future cases       Second  in addition to Judge Roberts s own precedent  the propagators of the myth of the  Ginsburg Precedent  also overlook a very real legal precedent  which came into being in 2002  nine years after Judge Ginsburg testified  That is the case of Minnesota Republican Party v  White       In White  the Supreme Court to which Judge Roberts aspires made clear that when judicial candidates state their views on legal matters and decided cases  their impartiality in future cases is not undermined       Listen to Justice Scalia in 2002 quoting Justice Rehnquist in 1972        Proof that a Justice s mind at the time he joined the Court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification  not lack of bias        As 12 leading legal ethicists wrote in a letter to me in July  the White case makes absolutely clear that there is no ethical concern for a nominee to talk about decided cases and judicial philosophy at a confirmation hearing        It is hardly possible that a person could achieve nomination for appointment to the United States Supreme Court and yet have no opinions about the significant constitutional issues and cases of our day  And the fact that the nominee does have such opinions and voices them will not undermine impartiality or the appearance of impartiality        So  the purveyors of the myth of the  Ginsburg Precedent  not only ignore Judge Roberts s own precedent in talking about legal issues  they sidestep an actual Supreme Court precedent  written by one of the Court s most conservative members       Finally  there is Judge Roberts s own precedent  On multiple occasions B as a White House advisor  as a political appointee in the Solicitor General s office  as a legal commentator  and even as a judge B Judge Roberts has himself addressed legal issues  criticized court cases  and called for decisions to be overturned       Judge Roberts appropriately advanced his views on specific cases and issues in virtually every capacity B government lawyer  private attorney  and judge  In doing so  he has certainly opened the door to such questioning         In 1981  for example  Roberts drafted a speech in which he quoted approvingly from the dissent in Griswold v  Connecticut  the 1965 case holding that it was unconstitutional to criminalize the sale of birth control to married couples         In 1985  Roberts wrote a memo addressing Wallace v  Jaffree  which involved issues relating to the separation of church and state  He not only wrote approvingly of Rehnquist s attempt to  revolutionize  a well settled area of law  he also took a shot at the opinion of Lewis Powell in the same case  criticizing it as a  lame concurring opinion focusing on stare decisis          In 1990  Judge Roberts s signed a brief in Rust v  Sullivan called for the overturning of settled law   We continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled          In 1993  as a private lawyer  Judge Roberts authored a law review article in which he endorsed the Supreme Court s standing decision in Lujan v  Defenders of Wildlife  1992   as a Asound and straightforward decision applying the Article III injury requirement          In 1999  while a guest on National Public Radio  Judge Roberts described three recently decided federalism cases that dramatically limited citizens  ability to sue the states for violating their rights as a  healthy reminder that we re in a country that was formed by the states          Most recently  as an appeals judge  Judge Roberts has several times criticized the majority opinions in cases on issues ranging from the scope of the Commerce Clause to the discretionary authority of the Secretary of Labor       Does anyone believes that these expressions of opinion about decided cases mean he must disqualify himself  if confirmed  from considering cases involving similar issues  Of course not       Did they show a prejudgment about future cases  Of course not       But I worry that Judge Roberts   with frequent resort to the myth of the  Ginsburg Precedent    may flatly refuse to address  critique  or meaningfully discuss his views even of decided Supreme Court cases       Does it make any sense that as soon as he becomes a nominee to the highest court in the land  as soon as his views are more relevant than they have ever been  as soon as 280 million Americans need to trust him to protect their rights under the Constitution      he should suddenly be gagged       Judge Roberts has sought to reassure us about his judicial philosophy by repeatedly saying that he holds dear the values of judicial modesty and stability       Those are perfectly nice sentiments  but how are we to learn what that means in practice  How are we to learn whether those are meaningful checks on an activist judicial agenda  rather than hollow words  unless he answers specific questions       If Judge Roberts answers important questions forthrightly and convinces me that he is a jurist in the broad mainstream  most Democrats will be able to vote for him       If  on the other hand  he chooses evasion over candor  if he uses the mythical  Ginsburg Precedent  as some kind of game show lifeline  I will find it very  very hard to vote for him       The key is for Judge Roberts to answer questions forthrightly and fully and to avoid relying on any false precedent to avoid informing the American people of his views  as he seeks to ascend to the most important court in the land       I sincerely hope that Judge Roberts decides to share his views with B rather than hide them from B the American people       We are only five days away from finding out if he will
