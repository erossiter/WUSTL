And Protect Cross Border Commerce At The Same Time                                                                                                                                                                                       U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today continued his fight to demand that the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  takes the time to come up with the right passport alternatives to protect both security and Northern Border commerce by lobbing the House Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Conferees to ensure that the final appropriations bill contains a later implementation date for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI     The rule is supposed to go into effect in January 2008  a mere 15 months away and yet DHS still lacks a plan that would improve border security while the minimizing the impact of changes in border security documentation requirements on border communities         We need both security and commerce on our Northern Border     Schumer said     The passport proposal was poorly thought out and did not take into account how the border works in New York    where people cross it all the time for work  shopping and leisure  I am concerned that the passport requirement as proposed would deflate cross border commerce and tourism  We need to focus on creative solutions that better achieves both security and efficient commerce along the US Canada border  and this delay would give us the time to do this            The Administration still has not provided details as to the specific documents that will be needed to cross the border  nor has it released a plan for implementing new requirements so as to minimize the impact on cross border commerce and the way of life for border communities  In the spring  the Administration indicated it would issue a new   PASS    card  However  the implementation date is drawing closer and many details are still lacking  including  how the government would administer the new card  how it would ensure an efficient flow of transportation at border crossings  and what provisions will be made for law abiding citizens who approach the border without the newly required documents  In addition  it remains unclear which Canadian documents will be accepted and to what extent the Administration is coordinating with Ottawa so that Canadians can continue to visit and do business in New York      The Homeland Security Appropriations Bill  passed by the Senate in July  is currently being negotiated in a joint House Senate Conference Committee  which is expected to conclude by the end of the month   Schumer requested that the conferees extend the implementation date for the WHTI to June 1  2009 in order to ensure that new border security measures have a minimal impact on border commerce  Under the measure  the program could be implemented earlier if DHS and State meet certification requirements that include collaboration with Canada and Mexico  technology  infrastructure  border agent training and the treatment of children seeking to cross the border  If Congress certifies that these requirements have been met  WHTI could be implemented earlier than that date         In a personal letter to the conferees  Schumer wrote     I respectfully request the Conferees retain the Senate language that would extend the implementation for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   The Senate language states that WHTI   shall be implemented not later than 3 months after the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security make the certifications required in subsection  B   or June 1  2009  whichever is earlier     While improving border security must remain the primary goal of this program  it is critical that any changes to documentation requirements for border crossings must be done so as to minimize the impact on cross border commerce and the way of life for border communities  WHTI must be done right  and I believe the Senate language will give DHS and the Department of State time it needs  It is critical that DHS and State meet the certifications outlined in the Senate language  which address collaboration with Canada and Mexico  technology  infrastructure  border agent training and the treatment of children seeking to cross the border before moving forward on a plan so that border security is improved and border commerce is protected          Schumer emphasized that national security is always his top priority  but that the federal government must protect the homeland without crippling cross border commerce or the travel and tourism industry  A final plan must address the concerns of businesses leaders and the law enforcement community where the economy is dependent upon Canadian trade and commerce  According to the Canadian Consulate  Canada is New York  s largest trading partner and Canada trade is related to 348 000 jobs in New York State        The Departments of State and Homeland Security have proposed a Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative that would require all travelers  including U S  citizens  to and from the Americas  the Caribbean  and Bermuda to have a passport or other accepted document that establishes the bearer  s identity and nationality to enter or re enter the United States   If implemented  this proposal would require anyone crossing the U S  Canada border to show a passport or other accepted documentation  including SENTRI  NEXUS and FAST program cards
