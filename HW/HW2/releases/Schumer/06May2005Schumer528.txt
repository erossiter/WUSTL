IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 6  2005 Schumer Reveals Massive MTBE Spill Has Devastated Queens Drinking Water Supply                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Only Southeast Queens gets Drinking Water from Ground Sources    Special Interest Sneak Attack in Washington Would Let Big Oil Companies Get Away With Contaminating Water but Make NYC Tax Payers Foot  300 Million Clean Up Bill    Schumer Vows to Block Energy Bill Passed By House If MTBE Giveaway to Large Oil Corporations Is Not Removed Standing at the site of an enormous and potentially cancer causing MTBE spill that contaminated drinking water wells in Southeast Queens  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released new data showing that if a special interest provision lets polluters get away without paying for the costs of MTBE cleanup New York City residents will have to foot the bill for  300 million of clean up  Schumer also announced his intention to filibuster the Energy Bill now headed to the senate if the MTBE provision is not removed  Unlike the rest of NYC  large areas of East and Southeast Queens receive drinking water from groundwater        It is shocking that Queens drinking water is threatened by spills that haven t been cleaned up for years and  adding insult to injury  NYC taxpayers will have to foot the bill  This underscores why the Energy Bill has no business being passed if these provisions are included   said Schumer   The idea that we should let the companies whose product literally poisoned our groundwater get away free    and instead force innocent Queens families to pay for the cleanup    is so audacious that words fail to describe it  When my kids were four years old they knew that if you make a mess  you clean it up  If the people who introduced poison into our wells and aquifers think that they can getaway without a fight  they have another thing coming        Schumer stood at the former Citgo on Hempstead Avenue  which is directly adjacent to two public water supply wells  2 3 inches of gasoline were found at the northwest corner of the Citgo site and between 6 and 7 inches at the northwest corner of the monitoring facility  The MTBE levels in that gasoline are 26 000 times the amount needed to mandate a clean up  and yet the site remains contaminated  The oil companies responsible for the mess refuse to foot the bill and if the energy bill that passed the House two weeks ago becomes law  they won  t be held accountable       The so called  Safe Harbor  provision in the Energy bill would make taxpayers in New York City  and those all over the country pay the entire cost to clean up the methyl tertiary butyl ether  which is better known as MTBE  MTBE is a potentially cancer causing chemical that was first added to gasoline in the 1970 s and has been in widespread use since the 1990 s  When gasoline containing MTBE was spilled or leaked out of underground storage tanks  it poisoned underground water systems  including those that service Southeast Queens       The  Safe Harbor  provision would prevent petroleum companies from having to pay a cent to clean up the damage their toxic product created by making a blanket declaration that no chemical that gets added to gasoline as part of the energy bill s ethanol mandate  or MTBE can ever be considered a  defective product  in a court of law  even if the chemical is a possible carcinogen        This may be the single worst special interest giveaway to polluters that I have ever seen in more than 20 years in Washington   Schumer said       MTBE became widespread after changes to the Clean Air Act in 1990 required that reformulated gasoline containing an oxygenate be sold in areas like New York with poor air quality  When MTBE leaks out of an underground storage tanks and into an underground drinking water system like those that service Southeast Queens  the poison does not break down  instead it moves through the water quickly  and makes the water smell and taste like turpentine  While the nonpartisan US General Accounting Office has detected MTBE in groundwater and drinking water in every state in the US  the problem is acute in Southeast Queens  the only part of New York City  where residents rely on ground water       Oil and gas lobbyists got the so called  Safe Harbor  provision added into the US House version of the Energy bill expressly to prevent court decisions that would hold oil companies liable for MTBE poisoning  In 2002  a Lake Tahoe  California jury found  clear and convincing evidence  that three major oil companies acted  with malice  and were liable for polluting ground water with MTBE  During the case  plaintiffs uncovered internal industry documents showing companies had known for years about the dangers of MTBE while they still were promoting its use   Two weeks ago the House of Representatives passed its version of the Energy Bill  which included the  safe harbor  provision        Tom Delay and his cronies could also sneak language into a huge bill declaring that the sky is green or that up is really down  but that doesn t make it true   Schumer said   MTBE is a poison that threatens the water we use on Long Island to drink  cook  and bathe in  No two paragraph statement in a piece of legislation is going to change that truth  and I m not going to let Big Oil push these cleanup costs onto New York City residents without a fight        The New York City Department of Environmental Protection  DEP  filed a case against the nation s largest petroleum refiners  including ExxonMobil  Shell  Chevron and others  on Thursday  February 26  2004 to recover the more than  300 million in damages to its Jamaica  Queens based groundwater well system  The MTBE action contends that damages to the groundwater well system in Queens were caused by the gasoline additive MTBE that petroleum refiners have used in their product  In October 2004 Judge Shira Scheindlin of the U S  District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered that the case be designated as a leading case for the over 115 lawsuits that comprise this multi district litigation action  This designation  called a  focus case  means that the City s suit will be fast tracked and could serve as a model for the other MTBE lawsuits
