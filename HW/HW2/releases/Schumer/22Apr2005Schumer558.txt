IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 22  2005 Schumer Warns  Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile Nearly Empty    Millions Of New York Kids   Health At Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Stockpile of Vaccines for Common Sicknesses like Diphtheria  Whooping Cough  Mumps  Measles  and Chicken Pox Dangerously Low Because of Federal Bookkeeping Rule    Schumer  A Stand off Between Government and Drug Companies Shouldn  t put our Children  s Health at Risk With news that the Federal government  s stockpile of vaccines for common children  s sicknesses is dwindling to an all time low  with drug makers unwilling to make more to fill the stockpile because of a grudge match over federal bookkeeping rule  today Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Securities Exchange Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with an exemption for vaccine makers when it comes to counting revenue  The stockpile  which is supposed to contain over 40 million vaccinations for common childhood sicknesses ranging from Chicken Pox to Diphtheria  has around 13 million doses at the ready  with no vaccines for some of the most common childhood ailments         A stand off between government and drug companies shouldn  t endanger our children     Schumer said    Doctors should not have to hold off on immunizing kids because they don  t have the tools they need  Research shows that a vaccine delayed is a vaccine denied  and when kids are young we should never take that gamble         Last summer the CDC asked four companies to make new sales to the stockpile and three said no  The companies can  t treat the money they get as revenue when they sell millions of doses of vaccine to the stockpile    the shots are not considered   sold    until they are delivered when the government calls for them in emergencies  Instead  the vials are held in the manufacturers  warehouses and considered unsold in the eyes of investors and auditors until they are actually used       The problem lies in a rule that was put forth by the SEC in December 1999 seeking to clear up confusion about revenue recognition because booking phony  theoretical or incomplete sales is the most common way companies make themselves look more profitable than they are  As a result the vaccines aren  t   sold    until they are actually delivered    after they are sold  which wreaks havoc on accounting       The stockpile currently has 13 2 million doses with a goal of 41 millions doses         Without a fix  the stockpile is only going to get smaller and the gaping hole in our public health system  even bigger     Schumer said       According to the CDC  of the 8 vaccines they stockpile for 11 diseases  the quantities of what they need versus what they follows      Vaccine Target Quantities Doses Purchased    Delivered  Diptheria Tetanus  Pertussis  DTaP  10 000 000 0  Polio  EIPV   8 000 000 3 655 000  Hepatitis A  HEPA  4 000 000 1 000 000  Hepatitis B  HEPB  6 000 000 2 000 000  Haemophilus Influenza B  Hib  8 000 000 1 000 000  Measles  Mumps  Rubella  MMR  4 000 000 4 000 000  Pneumococcal  PCV  8 000 000 0  Varicella  VAR  2 000 000 2 000 000      In addition  this January  the CDC approved a vaccine against Neisseria Meningitidis which causes nearly 3000 infections per year in the United States  10  of those infected die and 20  are permanently disabled  Next month it will be added to the list of shots all American children should get  meaning that it should also be stockpiled  But  with the current situation  it is unlikely that it will happen       In its near depleted state  the stockpile could potentially put New York children at risk  Just 3 years ago  the country didn  t have adequate supply of five vaccines that protect against eight diseases  physicians and clinics were required to ration vaccines and change the schedule of routine shots  The halving of last year  s flu vaccine supply also served as a wake up call         Last year  s flu vaccine debacle should serve as lesson to the Feds  The entire country was nearly hysterical when the supply was cut in half     said Schumer    The reality is there are very few remaining vaccine makers in the US  and we need to make it easier for them to add to the supply  this SEC rule is making it much  much harder          If there were to be an outbreak of Whooping Cough or Pertussis  New York children could potentially face a major disaster  Between July 2003 and December 2004 in Westchester  just north of New York City  health officials recorded 151 cases of whooping cough  In a normal year there are only 6 or 8 cases  What started in effect as a single infection made its way into 40 cities and towns       Statewide the story is worse  New York was the state with the third highest number of Whooping Cough outbreaks in 2003  If there were to be a serious  uncontrollable outbreak of disease  New York could have to turn to the Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile for back up  there might not be any to go around and the outbreak would be impossible to stop       In an effort to combat this looming and potentially deadly problem  today Senator Schumer called on the SEC to create an exemption for vaccine makers that would allow for companies to   recognize revenue    for sales to the stockpile or work with HHS to quickly come up with another solution        He also wrote to HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt urging him to work with the SEC to resolve this  Schumer noted that  in the Omnibus spending bill passed by Congress last year  the Secretary was requested to work with the SEC and report back with a solution or a suggestion for a legislative remedy by March 21st of this year  However  the report has yet to be issued  and although there are reports that at least one company notified HHS of this problem over two years ago  action has yet to be taken to ensure adequate stockpiles        Our history with vaccine shortages has seriously undermined the public s confidence in immunization programs    a confidence that public health officials have worked long and hard to earn  For every day the government stands idle on this issue  we risk losing not inches or feet  but miles of the ground we have gained in recent years        The pediatric vaccine stockpile was created in 1983 and is supposed to hold enough vaccine to supply the nation for six months  The 11 diseases that it holds vaccines for are Diphtheria  Haemophilus influenzae type B  Hib  Hepatitis A  Hepatitis B  Measles  Mumps  Whooping Cough  Pneumococcal disease  Polio  Rubella  German measles  Tetanus  lockjaw  and Chicken Pox       The stockpile has been dipped into nine times for either a vaccine supply disruption or disease outbreak  The first withdrawal of vaccine from the pediatric vaccine stockpile was made in 1984  The most recent instance of a withdrawal of vaccine from the stockpile was in August and September 2003 when CDC withdrew 46 000 doses of MMR vaccine to be used to control a measles outbreak in the Marshall Islands  The most recent instance of a withdrawal of vaccine from the stockpile before that was a withdrawal of 700 000 doses of MMR vaccine from the stockpile in January 2002 to address a manufacturing disruption at Merck       In New York City  only 80  of children ages 19 35 months receive an adequate schedule of vaccines  though only 69  receive the full coverage recommended by the CDC  If there were to be an outbreak of disease  a supply disruption and no Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile  those numbers could drop and New York City could be facing an epidemic  In fact the last major measles epidemic was in the early 1990s       The nation last faced a measles outbreak in the 1990s  Over 55 000 were infected and 166 died  The outbreak began in Houston  which has a low immunization rate  That  s why these gaping holes in the nation  s public health system are so dangerous  Disease spreads very quickly  which is why every child needs to be immunized       By 18 months of age  it is recommended that each of the 11 000 babies born each day in the United States receive up to 20 doses of vaccine to protect against 11 diseases       To date  49 state immunization programs reported rationing one or more vaccines  Shortages have also prompted the majority of states to waive or change immunization requirements for school and day care programs so that children who had received fewer than the mandatory immunizations could enroll  States reported that vaccine shortages and missed make up vaccinations may reduce coverage and increase the potential for disease to spread  however  data are not currently available to measure these effects       Today  Schumer was joined by Dr  Arthur Fierman  MD  Associate Professor of Pediatrics of the NYU School of Medicine and Co Chair of the NYC Coalition of Immunization Initiatives  Standing with them were Stephanie Zinn  her 7 month old son  Cody and Anel Soriano and her 3 year old daughter   Muffin    Massanet
