IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 25  2005 New Schumer Survey Reveals Scores Of Previously Undisclosed MTBE Leaks Located Throughout Long Island Pose Grave Danger To Public Water Supply                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Senator   New Survey Underscores Need to Block MTBE Giveaway to Oil Companies That Has Just Passed House    3 Million Long Island Residents Rely on Groundwater for Drinking Water    Average LI Ratepayer will Spend an extra  260 per Year to Clean up Spills    a 67  Increase over Last Year Standing at the site of a potentially cancer causing MTBE spill like the ones that threaten dozens of drinking water wells on Long Island  today  US Senator Charles E  Schumer released a new list of MTBE hotspots that are adjacent to or on top of public drinking water supply wells  The previously undisclosed list of MTBE spills that have taken place near Long Island has been made available to the state but not to the public  And  if specific special interest provisions are included in the Energy Bill that passed the House last week and will soon be considered by the Senate  the enormous clean up costs will be incurred by Long Island  s already overburdened taxpayers  Schumer also announced his intention to filibuster the Energy bill if the MTBE provision is not removed        It is shocking that Long Island s drinking water is threatened by leaks and spills that haven t been cleaned up for more than 20 years and  adding insult to injury  consumers will have to foot the bill  This underscores why the Energy Bill has no business being passed if these provisions are included   said Schumer   The idea that we should let the companies whose product literally poisoned our groundwater get away free    and instead force innocent Long Island families to pay for the cleanup    is so audacious that words fail to describe it  When my kids were four years old they knew that if you make a mess  you clean it up  If the people who introduced poison into our wells and aquifers think that they can getaway without a fight  they have another thing coming        The list exposed by Schumer today are some of the most potentially dangerous  and until now undisclosed  MTBE hotspots because they are located on top of or next to the public drinking water supply wells  Schumer described a spill that was found at a Mobil Station on Swamp Road that tested positive for soil contamination  The spill investigation was closed in 2002 and the spill has still not been cleaned  MTBE was also detected at a Mobil on Old Country Road  A list of the other MTBE hotspots is attached       The so called  Safe Harbor  provision in the Energy bill    which has already passed the U S  House of Representatives    would make taxpayers on Long Island  and those all over the country pay the entire cost to clean up the methyl tertiary butyl ether  which is better known as MTBE  MTBE is a potentially cancer causing chemical that was first added to gasoline in the 1970 s and has been in widespread use since the 1990 s  When gasoline containing MTBE was spilled or leaked out of underground storage tanks  it poisoned underground water systems  including 130 well sites on Long Island       The  Safe Harbor  provision would prevent petroleum companies from having to pay a cent to clean up the damage their toxic product created by making a blanket declaration that no chemical that gets added to gasoline as part of the energy bill s ethanol mandate  or MTBE can ever be considered a  defective product  in a court of law  even if the chemical is a possible carcinogen        This may be the single worst special interest giveaway to polluters that I have ever seen in more than 20 years in Washington   Schumer said       MTBE became widespread after changes to the Clean Air Act in 1990 required that reformulated gasoline containing an oxygenate be sold in areas like New York with poor air quality  When MTBE leaks out of an underground storage tanks and into an underground drinking water system like the one under the surface of Long Island  the poison does not break down  instead it moves through the water quickly  and makes the water smell and taste like turpentine  While the nonpartisan US General Accounting Office has detected MTBE in groundwater and drinking water in every state in the US  the problem is particularly acute in Long Island  where residents rely on groundwater for almost all of their drinking water  In New York State alone there are 2 727 MTBE spills  In Nassua County there are 288 verified MTBE spills and in Suffolk County there are 369  In addition  there are hundreds of other gasoline spills that pose a serious MTBE hazard       Oil and gas lobbyists got the so called  Safe Harbor  provision added into the US House version of the Energy bill expressly to prevent court decisions that would hold oil companies liable for MTBE poisoning  In 2002  a Lake Tahoe  California jury found  clear and convincing evidence  that three major oil companies acted  with malice  and were liable for polluting ground water with MTBE  During the case  plaintiffs uncovered internal industry documents showing companies had known for years about the dangers of MTBE while they still were promoting its use   On Thursday the House of Representatives passed its version of the Energy Bill  which included the  safe harbor  provision       Schumer noted that because residents for the Plainview Water District pay part of their water bills through property taxes and part through water rates  homeowners faces increases in both areas  Overall  Schumer said that the cost for cleaning up MTBE on Long Island would cost around 700 million for all 130 public water supplier wells affected       Schumer also released new data today showing that the average Long Island family will face an overall water bill increase of 67 percent   and annual increase of  260    to cover the costs of MTBE cleanup if the  Safe Harbor  provisions are passed into law  The Plainview Water District s demographics and operation are typical of most long Island water suppliers  In addition  Plainview s water costs are squarely in the middle of water suppliers across Long Island  according to the Long Island Water Conference  the group that represents water suppliers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties        Tom Delay and his cronies could also sneak language into a huge bill declaring that the sky is green or that up is really down  but that doesn t make it true   Schumer said   MTBE is a poison that threatens the water we use on Long Island to drink  cook  and bathe in  No two paragraph statement in a piece of legislation is going to change that truth  and I m not going to let Big Oil push these cleanup costs onto Long Island homeowners without a fight        Senator Schumer was joined by Paul Granger  Superintendent of the Plainview Water District  Walter Hang  President of the Environmental Montoring Firm Toxics Targeting  Ginger Lieberman  Joseph DiGregorio  Sr   Jay Nathan and Irene Lane
