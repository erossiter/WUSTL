IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 31  2006 Schumer Reveals  Nearly 7 000 Staten Island Seniors Threatened By Medicare Drug Plan   Donut Hole       Increasing Their Costs 300 Percent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           At Least 6 971 Staten Island Medicare Part D Recipients Have Reached or Will Reach Gap in Coverage  Shell Out Full Price for Prescriptions and Still Have to Pay Drug Plan Premiums   Senator to Push Legislation to Eliminate Premiums for Seniors Who Lose Coverage and Eliminate the Donut Hole Altogether     With 2007 Enrollment Period Approaching  Schumer Urges Seniors to Find out H U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that at least 6 971 Staten Island seniors could see or already have seen their out of pocket drug costs suddenly skyrocket by 300 percent because of a coverage gap in the Medicare drug plan   Unlike most other types of health insurance  the Medicare drug benefit was designed with a coverage gap  or   donut hole      Seniors enter the donut hole once their total drug costs have exceeded  2 250  and while in the donut hole they must pay for all of their drugs out of pocket  as well as continuing to pay the full monthly premium   Schumer announced legislation to fill the gap in coverage  eliminate premiums for seniors while they are in the donut hole  and urged seniors to read the fine print on their plans for 2007         This donut hole is hitting Staten Island seniors like a ton of bricks     Schumer said    Seniors should not have the rug pulled out from under them when they are struggling to pay for the rising cost of prescription drugs  We need to do everything we can to ensure that all Staten Island seniors have access to affordable prescription drugs and never have to choose between getting their medication and putting food on the table   This plan is not just a donut hole  it  s a black hole          The Medicare drug benefit s donut hole is one of many features of the new law that members of Congress including Senator Schumer opposed from the outset  Under the current system  drug plans pay 75 percent of patients  drug costs between  250 and  2 250  but zero percent of the total costs between  2 250 and  5 100  with beneficiaries paying 100  of costs in the   donut hole      Coverage does not resume until the beneficiary s costs reach  5 100  leaving New York seniors to pay  2 850 in direct costs while in the donut hole       Once seniors fall in the donut hole  beneficiaries who had been paying  20 or  30 per month in co pays for their prescription medications will be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more  In addition  Schumer said that seniors in the donut hole get hit twice because they are forced to continue to pay their monthly premiums despite the interruption of coverage       Schumer also warned that the donut hole occurs every year  and will likely expand each year   It is estimated that the size of the donut hole will grow from  2 850 in 2006 to  5 066 in 2013   In addition  rising prescription drug prices have compounded the issue of the donut hole  causing seniors to reach the  2 250 spending cap sooner  According to Families USA  a leading heath care consumer advocacy group  the median price increase for the 20 most prescribed drugs was 3 7 percent between November 2005 and April 2006       In a study done by the Kaiser Family Foundation  a non profit health care research organization  one in four Medicare drug plan beneficiaries will reach the donut hole this year  meaning that their total drug costs will be greater than  2 250 this year   Seniors across the country have already entered the donut hole this year  with the average senior who ends up reaching the donut hole having hit it in September        In addition  Schumer revealed that with the 2007 open enrollment period rapidly approaching  the landscape of drug plans has changed   Some seniors are enrolled in plans that have changed their features such as cost sharing requirements or the list of drugs that are covered by the plan   In other cases  new alternatives are available   Earlier this year  Schumer called on America  s Health Insurance Providers  AHIP  to offer more enhanced coverage drug plans for Medicare beneficiaries in 2007 so that seniors could affordably opt to avoid the donut hole   When the 2007 plan offerings were announced earlier this month  there were 29 plans that will have some type of enhanced coverage  whether they provide coverage in the donut hole or have little or no deductible   Seniors need to carefully examine their new options to determine if a change in plan would benefit them       To protect seniors and close the donut hole  Schumer announced the following three point plan            No Premiums While In The Donut Hole   Schumer announced he was pushing The Prescription for Fairness Act of 2006  S 3647    The bill would waive the drug plan premium for seniors during any month that a beneficiary falls into the donut hole   The provision would last through Fiscal Year 2008 and would provide short term relief to seniors suddenly forced to pay more for their drugs            Eliminate the Donut Hole Altogether   Schumer announced a new push for the Meeting Our Responsibility to Medicare Beneficiaries Act  S 18  which would  among other things  phase out the donut hole over time   By freezing the current catastrophic threshold   5 100   the donut hole would gradually close            Encourage Seniors to Switch to Plans with Coverage in the Donut Hole  After Schumer  s call to health insurance companies to offer more plans under which seniors would not be affected by falling into the donut hole  there are new plan offerings that may be beneficial to seniors   Medicare beneficiaries and their families should contact a counselor at New York  s State Health Insurance Assistance Program at 1 800 701 0501 to determine if there is a better plan option out there
