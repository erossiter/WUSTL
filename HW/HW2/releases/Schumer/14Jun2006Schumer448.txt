Expand Parent and Teen Drug Awareness Programs   Schumer To Release Estimated Number of Upstate NY Teenagers In Each County Who Have Abused Prescription Drugs  In Capital Region 19 000 Teenagers  Central New York 18 000  Hudson Valley 45 000 In light of new reports of rampant prescription drug abuse by teenagers  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a new three point plan to crack down on illegal online pharmacies and combat the growing epidemic of teenagers using prescription drugs to get high  While overall drug use is down  abuse of prescription drugs among kids between the ages of 12 and 19 remains more common than regular use of cocaine  methamphetamine  or ecstasy  Schumer released a  today estimating that more than 150 000 upstate New York teenagers have abused prescription drugs         Today we shine the light on a problem that has lived in the shadows for far too long     Schumer said    We used to only focus on the liquor cabinet  but we can  t forget about the medicine cabinet  These drugs are just as dangerous as illegal drugs but we aren  t doing nearly enough to keep them out of our children  s hands  A stitch in time saves nine and  if we don  t act now  this problem is going to get worse and devastate more families          According to the Partnership for a Drug Free America  one in five teenagers between the ages of 12 and 19 have used prescription drugs to get high  The prescription drugs most frequently abused by teenagers include stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall  and painkillers like Vicodin and OxyContin  Vicodin use in particular is up  with 10 percent of 12th graders reporting they had used the drug within the last year  While prescription drugs can be very helpful under the care and monitoring of a doctor  non medical use of these substances can lead to serious health risks  addiction  or death       Schumer said one of the most disturbing facts at the root of this epidemic is the staggering number of teenagers who think that prescription drugs are safe and easy to get  Two in five teens  or 40 percent of those surveyed  said that prescription medications  even if they are not prescribed by a doctor  are   much safer    to use than illegal drugs and half said they see no great risk in abusing prescription medicine  In the same study  62 percent of the teenagers studied said prescription drugs were easy to take from their parents   medicine cabinet       Schumer today released a  estimating that of the 825 914 kids between the ages of 12 and 19 living in Upstate New York  156 294 have used prescription drugs to get high  Specifically             Of the 101 141 teens living in the Capital Region  an estimated 19 217 have used prescription drugs to get high            Of the 92 982 teens living in Central New York  an estimated 17 667 have used prescription drugs to get high            Of the 124 799 teens living in the Rochester    Finger Lakes Region  an estimated 23 712 have used prescription drugs to get high            Of the 236 172 teens living in the Hudson Valley  an estimated 44 873 have used prescription drugs to get high            Of the 55 784 teens living in the North Country  an estimated 10 599 have used prescription drugs to get high            Of the 64 596 teens living in the Southern Tier  an estimated 12 273 have used prescription drugs to get high            Of the 150 440 teens living in Western New York  an estimated 28 584 have used prescription drugs to get high       One of the most common ways for teenagers to get these prescription drugs are through online pharmacies that do not check for a valid prescription before selling medication  32 percent of teenagers said that the fact that these drugs are easy to get over the Internet is one of the main reasons why they choose to abuse them  Tens of thousands of drugs are dispensed each year through such Internet pharmacies  none of which require medical records  examinations  lab tests or follow ups        A report by Columbia University estimated that there are at least 400 existing online pharmacies  The report said that these numbers are low primarily because it is impossible to determine is they have examined every site on the Internet       Schumer also pointed to the emergence of so called   Pharm Parties    as a sign that the abuse of these drugs among teenagers is spreading  At these parties  teenagers bring pills they took from their home medicine cabinets or that they bought online  pool them in a fish bowl  and the participants pick at random which pills to take  The pills most often used are Vicodin and Oxycontin       In response to this growing epidemic  Schumer announced a three point plan to crack down on these online pharmacies and improve government drug awareness programs            Schumer announced he was co sponsoring and pushing the The Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act  S 399  which counters the growing sale of prescription drugs over the Internet without a valid prescription by  1  providing new disclosure standards for Internet pharmacies to reveal information including the doctors and pharmacists that are affiliated with their sites   2  barring Internet sites from selling or dispensing prescription drugs to consumers who are provided a prescription without being examined by a doctor  and  3  allowing state attorneys general to go to federal court to shut down rogue sites across the country  The bill is geared to domestic Internet pharmacies that sell drugs without a valid prescription  not international pharmacies that sell drugs at a low cost to individuals who have a valid prescription from their U S  doctors            Schumer urged the Office of National Drug Control Policy  ONDCP  to launch a new media campaign that would be specifically targeted toward informing teens and adults about the dangers of prescription drug abuse  In a personal letter to John Walters  Director of the ONDCP  Schumer identified the National Youth Anti Drug Media Campaign as an important program that targets youth  their parents  and other involved adults through aggressive advertising campaigns to fight against youth addiction to drugs  Such a program would provide an idea structure for raising awareness about the dangers of abusing prescription drugs            In addition  Schumer called for  50 million in additional funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA   Schumer wrote to the Chairman and Ranking Member of a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee to request increased funding in the upcoming federal budget for an existing program that provides services for drug treatment and prevention  The Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Formula provides funding to states to spend on their particular local prevention and treatment needs  President Bush requested  1 8 billion for this program for the upcoming fiscal year  but in his letter  Schumer urged Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin to fund the program at  1 85 billion       Click here to view
