To Renew and Expand the Critical Program   Senator Reveals New Analysis Showing Program Has Protected Wary Dairy Farmers Despite 12 Percent Drop in Milk Prices This Year   Schumer Details Price Declines and MILC Program P Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that so far this year upstate New York dairy farmers have received nearly  38 million in payments received under the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program  despite a 12 percent drop in milk prices across upstate New York   Last year  Schumer successfully lobbied to extend the program until August of 2007   However  as negotiations on the 2007 Farm Bill begin to heat up  the program is in danger of being cut again   The MILC program provides subsidies to dairy farmers when the price of milk drops below  16 94   Since November 2005  the average price of milk in upstate New York has plummeted from  17 81 to  15 68   As part of his campaign  Schumer is pushing language to double the annual production cap  which could mean millions more for upstate New York dairy farmers         The MILC program is the lifeline for thousands of upstate New York dairy farmers     Schumer said     For many  it is the difference between staying afloat or sinking because of sudden drops in milk prices   The good news is we can help farmers endure the financial risks caused by unstable prices  Year after year  I am proud to lead the fight to protect this vital program and I am proud to lead that charge yet again          Introduced in the 2002 Farm Bill  the MILC program has helped dairy farms to survive artificially low prices by providing over  180 million in benefits to New York farmers  The current MILC program provides payments to eligible dairy farmers when the price of Boston Class I milk falls below  16 94 per hundredweight  cwt   Payments are issued for up to a maximum of 2 4 million pounds of milk per dairy operation per year       However  over the last year  the price of milk has dropped to unsustainable levels all across upstate New York   Since November of last year  when the price of milk reached  17 81 per hundredweight  the price has dropped 12 percent to  15 68 per hundredweight   Thankfully  the MILC program has been available to provide upstate New York dairy farmers critical funding to weather these cuts       According to the Department of Agriculture and Markets  the state s dairy farmers 6 700 dairy farmers are weathering one of the toughest years on record   Schumer said a combination of record low dairy prices and rising energy costs are the primary culprits   Every year  200 to 300 farms across the state go under       Schumer today released county by county  detailing how much money farmers in each county have received from the MILC program since prices began
