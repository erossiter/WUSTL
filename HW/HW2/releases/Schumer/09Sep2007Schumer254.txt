Still Far too Little Accomplished on Protecting Highly Vulnerable Mass Transit and Trucking Systems   High Threat Grant Program Still in Disarray Report Thoroughly Analyzes Major Security Areas Inclu Six years after the 9 11 attacks  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released his annual comprehensive homeland security report revealing that despite a national focus on homeland security in the wake of the attacks  the Bush Administration and the Department of Homeland Security have left America dangerously vulnerable  Schumers report evaluates and gives grades for major critical security areas  including port  transit  truck  border and nuclear security  rating the governments overall effort a C  a slight improvement from last years C   Schumer said that new legislation implementing the 9 11 Commission Recommendations and the FY2008 DHS funding bill  which the President is currently threatening to veto  would improve security dramatically and for the first time represent real progress in improving security   Six years later  the progress DHS and this Administration have made in securing our country is shameful  Schumer said  We are years behind where we need to be in so many areas  Despite new threats materializing every day  DHS has remained remarkably stagnant  leaving gaping holes open for years  However  there is now light at the end of the tunnel  With the passage of the 9 11 Recommendations Bill  Congress has charted a clear and aggressive course for DHS to follow  Hopefully  this legislation has put DHS on a path to progress   Schumers comprehensive report reveals major security failings in all areas of homeland security  with some of the gaping holes left untouched by DHS for several years  Though Schumers report found some progress made in the last year with respect to port security  the vast majority of the grades remained the same as the previous year  Schumer downgraded aviation security given the stunning lack of progress on and DHSs reluctance to impose tough security and screening requirements for air cargo  and the continuing problem that the terror watch list  used to ensure a terrorist does not board a commercial flight  is rife with errors and newly discovered omissions   In addition  Schumers report gave DHS an F for efforts to improve emergency preparedness and response  Schumer said this is one of the areas where DHS should have made significant progress  given the communication failures on 9 11 and the bungled response to 9 11  According to a comprehensive GAO report released this week  DHS has not met the five specific performance goals related to interoperability including increasing the development and adoption of interoperability communications standards and providing guidance and technical assistance to first responders in developing and implementing interoperable communications capabilities    Schumers report also examined how the Administration has let the National Guard deteriorate to a crisis level with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau reporting that his forces have less than 34 percent of the equipment they should have in the event of an attack   Other grades given by Schumer are  a D  for First Responder Grant Funding  a C  for Aviation Security  a B  for Nuclear  Chemical and Biological Security  a D  for mass transit and truck security  a C  for port security  and a C for Border Security   Schumers report also detailed significant failings at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with respect to how they track nuclear materials and regulate those who seek to purchase them  According to a Council on Foreign Relations report  The threat of a nuclear attack by terrorists has never been greater and the United States has yet to make prevention a true priority  Covert investigations by the GAO have repeatedly found dangerous weaknesses in how the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  licenses companies to purchase nuclear materials  with one recent report revealing that investigators used publicly available information to obtain a license for radioactive materials in the name of a shell company created to be a false front to purchase the materials   Gut feelings and non specific warnings dont make us any safer  Time and again  DHS has failed to take concrete steps to enhance security and with new terror threats emerging every day  there is no question that we are dangerously vulnerable  Schumer added   Today  Schumer said that despite years of stagnation and massive mismanagement  Congressional action this year had made great strides to close these many year old security holes and charted a path for DHS to follow  Schumer said that 9 11 Recommendations Bill passed by Congress and signed into law by the President in early August  and the Fiscal Year 2008 DHS Appropriations Bill passed by the Senate  which the President has indicated he would veto in its current form  finally contain the regulations  deadlines  mandates  and most importantly the funding DHS and the Administration desperately need to secure the country   These two pieces of legislation will generate more progress in one year than DHS made in four  Schumer added   Specifically  Schumer report detailed the following areas where the two pieces of Congressional legislation will close gaping security holes   o The new Congress has taken steps to restore funding cuts made by the administration to state and local programs in the Department of Homeland Security  In July  the Senate approved an FY2008 DHS appropriation of  4 136 million for state and local programs  which is  749 million more than the FY2007 total appropriation of  3 387 million   o To address the gaping hole in air cargo screening on passenger flights  this legislation requires the TSA to establish a system for screening 100  of cargo within three years  with an interim requirement of screening 50  of such cargo within 18 months of enactment  Congress will be watching TSA and the airline industry very closely to ensure that neither party attempts to circumvent the 100  screening requirement by allowing sealed boxes sent by approved shippers to be loaded on to passenger planes  thus reviving parts of the known shipper program    o The new Congress passed the Schumer Amendment that requires TSA to establish and implement a program to track trucks carrying hazardous material  Trucks carrying high hazard materials  materials that are toxic  radioactive  etc   pose a threat to our national security if they fall into the hands of terrorists  Schumers amendment to the 9 11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007  which became law in August  requires the DOT and the TSA to develop a system to track freight trucks carrying high hazardous materials  In addition  DOT and TSA would evaluate technology that includes the installation of devices on these trucks to safely disable the vehicle if it strays from a predetermined route  and report back to the Congress in one year    o Under the SAFE Port Act  all cargo containers entering the United States from overseas must be screened to identify high risk containers  Cargo containers identified as high risk must be scanned for radiation or searched before leaving the seaport  As of August 31  2007  DNDO reports that it has installed 1 019 radiation portal monitors at 86 ports of entry  resulting in 92  of the incoming container cargo being screened before it leaves the seaport of arrival
