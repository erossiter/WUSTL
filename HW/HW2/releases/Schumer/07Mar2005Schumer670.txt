IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 7  2005 New Schumer Analysis Of LIRR Stations Reveals Security Measures Are Painfully Inadequate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         LIRR fails to implement DHS recommendations to make stations more secure against terrorism    With last week  s shocking news that Grand Central Station may have been targeted by Madrid bombers  rail security must be top priority On the heels of last week  s news that Grand Central Station was a potential target for a terrorist attack  today Senator Charles E  Schumer released details of a study that shows that Long Island Railroad stations lack the critical security infrastructure to keep their riders safe  A survey done twice in the last year shows that even after the Department of Homeland Security issued directives to enhance physical security at LIRR stations  the MTA has not taken the necessary steps  In an effort to combat this scenario  today Schumer sent a  to James Dermody  the President of the LIRR asking for an update on the status of the security upgrades and asking the LIRR to be more proactive in following the DHS guidelines         DHS has set up guidelines to make rail commuters safer  and it seems that the Long Island Rail Road is ignoring them     said Schumer    Over 280 000 New Yorkers use the Long Island Rail Road daily and according to this data  they are no safer today than they were on September 10th          DHS security directives issued in May 2004 call on transit operators to enhance physical security by  installing bomb resistant trashcans  erecting vehicle and pedestrian barricades  and installing closed circuit security cameras  According to the Schumer Analysis  the DHS security directives issued almost one year ago have not been followed by the MTA       The mandatory measures cover a broad range of security issues and provide flexibility to meet the specific needs of rail operators  They substantiate existing best practices in the rail industry and were created ensure enhanced security across the nation  s passenger rail systems  In addition to the physical security guidelines included in the study  DHS also recommended that  rail operators designate coordinators to enhance security related communications with the TSA  canine explosive teams are used when needed  and that facility inspections should be conducted by rail operators for suspicious or unattended items       The Long Island Railroad services over 280 000 passengers every day on 730 daily trains and is part of the largest mass transit system in the country  which transports 8 million people every day  At Penn Station  the Manhattan terminus of all 11 LIRR lines  400 000 passengers pass through every day on LIRR  Amtrak  NJ Transit  and NYC subway system       In a survey done twice in the last year of 30 of the most heavily trafficked of the 124 LIRR stations in Nassau  and Suffolk none had blast resistant and transparent garbage cans  only 10  were equipped with vehicle barriers  and only 10  were found to have closed circuit security cameras       Schumer said that the MTA is not fully to blame and the DHS needs to provide the resources necessary to implement the security measures it recommends         Last year  s Madrid bombings were the first wake up call  the fires in Penn Station  s tunnels in October were the second  and last week we learned that a Madrid bomber suspect had designs on Grand Central Station  How many warnings does Washington needs before it takes decisive action to really protect our rail system  both in word and in deed     said Schumer         DHS and the Administration have issued a vital security directive and have not backed up their demands with the necessary funding  The federal government needs to devote the resources so transit systems across the country  especially the MTA  can upgrade security as dictated by DHS     Schumer added   Today Schumer said that the federal government needs to dedicate the kind of energy and resources to rail safety that it devotes to air safety  According to U S  Customs Officials  every passenger who goes through an airport terminal now passes a radiation detector that can sense chemical  biological  or explosive material on their bodies  Schumer called for the federal government to accelerate the development of similar detectors for rail stations       In his  to Dermody  Schumer wrote    In the wake of the Madrid train bombings last year and the recent revelation that the terrorists involved in the attacks possessed sketches and notes about Grand Central Station  I urge you to work to better secure the 124 LIRR station across Long Island that serve almost 300 000 New Yorkers every day     I respectfully request you provide a report on any progress the LIRR and the MTA have made toward better securing LIRR stations in Nassau and Suffolk  In addition  I ask that you include any future plans you may have to better secure both stations and trains  and to protect the millions of New Yorkers who use your service every week          Schumer also announced today that he would again support The Rail Security Act  bipartisan rail security legislation that will soon be introduced in the Senate  A similar bill stalled in the House of Representatives last year  Had it passed  it would have  allotted  1 2 billion over five years for improvements to passenger and freight rail systems throughout the country  directed the Homeland Security Department to assess security risks to freight and passenger rail and develop recommendations for securing them  require DHS to study the cost and feasibility of screening all passengers  baggage and mail that travels on Amtrak trains  and would require the department to conduct a pilot program to randomly screen passengers and baggage at as many as 10 rail stations    I ve said it before and I ll say it again    you have a much greater chance of getting hurt riding in a car than during a terror attack  and we have to continue to live our lives as normal  I ve ridden trains my entire life  and my family and I will continue to ride the rails  Despite all the steps we need to take  there s no reason to stay off the trains   Schumer said       Click here to see
