IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 9  2005 Schumer Calls For Modernization Of Northport  Port Jefferson Power Plants  Long Island Among Worst In Nation For Smog And Ozone Levels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           New Design of Power Plants Could Lead to Lower Electricity Costs For Consumers While Reducing Pollutants From Each Plant on Long Island by 90   Schumer  Repowering is Doable now  Asks LIPA and Keyspan to Sit Down  Map Out a Plan by New Year  Asthma  Other Respiratory Problems Have Greatly Increased in Region as a Reusult of Dirty Power Plants As Long Island is ranked among the worst in the northeast for ozone and smog levels  and asthma and other respiratory problems have greatly increased in the region  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called for the modernization of the Northport  Barrett and Port Jefferson Power Plants  These plants are among the oldest and largest individual sources of polluting gases in the nation  Schumer also called for a meeting between LIPA and Keyspan to come up with an approach to the modernization plan by the New Year       This is a triple win for Long Island  less air pollution  a boost in energy capacity and lower rates  There is no good reason to delay this project  Instead of allowing LIPA and Keyspan to dance around each other  they need to sit down together and create solutions for both the long and short term energy problems here on Long Island     Schumer said       The modernization of Long Island  s antiquated power plants is not only necessary  but also long overdue  A repowering of the plants will lead to a major reduction in air pollution and a significant boost in energy capacity for Long Islanders  I applaud Senator Schumer for calling on LIPA and Keyspan to get moving on implementing a real plan for action     said Gordian Raacke  Executive Director of Renewable Energy Long Island    The Barrett  Northport  and Port Jefferson plants cause some of the most harmful emissions  as they are not meeting the same Clean Air Act emissions standards that newly constructed plants are held to  The plants were grandfathered in when the law was passed because most experts didn  t believe that the plants would stay open because of their age  Now however  they don  t meet federal standards  and are some of the dirtiest power plants in the Northeast  Modernizing the facilities would bring them up to the federal standard  Northport is the largest oil fired electric generating station on the East coast  It was built  designed and operated with equipment and technology of the 1960s and 1970s     With demand for a long term energy plan growing on Long Island  repowering antiquated existing power plants translates into increased efficiency and reduced emissions potential  Modernizing or repowering  is the process whereby old  highly inefficient and dirty oil burning power plants are temporarily shut down and replaced with cleaner  state of the art efficient combined cycle generation technologies  The process can significantly reduce emissions and double the amount of power produced     If the power plants were repowered and operated at their current level of generation  the Northport plant would experience a 90  reduction in NOx emissions  95  reduction in SO2 emissions  86  reduction in CO2 emissions  and 85  reduction in particulate emissions  Port Jefferson would experience an 80  reduction in NOx emissions  98  reduction in SO2  84  reduction in CO2  and 83  reduction in particulates      Experts say that repowering could add as many as 4 700 megawatts to the on Island capacity  and repowering the old plants is far less costly than building a new plant  There would be a  200  400 per kilowatt cost savings for repowering over building a new combined cycle plant due to the many components and systems that are already in place and can be utilized at existing sites such as land  electric and gas transmission systems  and most importantly  the steam generator     Schumer today called on LIPA and Keyspan to come together to create a repowering plan by 2006 that is part of the next long term purchasing agreement and can be used as a starting point to come up with a long term solution to energy needs  Repowering increases efficiencies and air quality  decreases fuel usage increases capacity  increases tax benefits  creates jobs  reduces global warming and other harm to environment  benefits public health  improves reliability of on island generation and decreases medical and health costs       The bottom line is  we need to modernize our plants and use technology that is more efficient and burns cleaner  and we need Keyspan and LIPA to sign on and work together     Schumer said     Last week  on August 3  was the second highest day on record for power consumption with use of 5 527 megawatts of electricity  just 12 megawatts short of the high  One megawatt is enough electricity to supply about 1 000 homes  The grid currently has an 800 megawatt margin of safety  but this shows Long Islander  s voracious appetite for energy is only growing  Long Island will continue to need more energy from additional sources       Several years ago I stood here on Long Island with LIPA  Keyspan  and NRDC to call for the construction of the Spagnoli Road power plant  The equipment  designs  and plans are all in place  yet the plant has yet to be built  Instead of having more  cleaner energy and having saved almost  40 million no progress has been made As part of its plan to move forward on repowering  LIPA and Keyspan should figure out how to get this plant built     Schumer said     Senator Schumer was joined today by Matthew C  Cordaro  Associate Dean  College of Management Director Center for Management Analysis at Long Island University  Jason Babbie of NYPIRG and Mark Serotoff  Coordinator  Sustainable Energy Alliance of LI
