IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 30  2006 With Severe Shortage Of Top Notch Math And Science Grads Affecting Cap Region Businesses  Schumer Unveils Groundbreaking Initiative To Promote Math And Science Education

Albany NanoTech  Schumer Announces   Math For America   Program To Recruit Best And Brightest To Become Math And Science Teachers   Schumer  Math And Science Skills Are Key To Upstate New York To Fully Benefit From The Emergenc With a severe shortage of top notch math and science graduates affecting Capital Region businesses  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a groundbreaking initiative to promote math and science education in the region and nationally   Schumer brought together Tech Valley business leaders and local educators who cited the need to address the decline in math and science proficiency  According to the National Science Board  the United States is falling behind other nations in math and science  Schumer unveiled his sweeping   Math for America   Program that will recruit the best and brightest graduates of math and science programs to become teachers  and improve their retention through better training and financial incentives          Too few students are entering careers in math and science     Schumer said    The future of the entire Tech Valley region  from Westchester to Glens Falls  is rooted in a high technology economy  Honing our students   math and science skills is the key to maximizing the impact that this regional renaissance will have on native Upstaters  as well as to New York and America  s continued prosperity in our global economy  Unfortunately  math and science teachers who have expertise in their subject area are offered lucrative positions in the private sector  and are forced to make personal sacrifices in order to be in the classroom  This legislation will help make sure we stay at the cutting edge of technology and remain the global leader in math and science           With the Capital Region growing as the prime destination for high tech jobs  it is critical that the workforce excel in math and science  The number one factor a business looks for when considering moving to an area is available skilled labor  The Capital Region and the entire country need more scientists and engineers in order to compete in a global economy  Schumer today stressed that math and science proficiency begin in the schools  and that teachers need tools and resources to fully prepare students  Data from the New York State Department of Education shows that in 2006  nearly 24 percent of fourth grade students in Albany  Rensselaer and Schenectady Counties did not meet the state standards for achievement in mathematics   Even more troubling  nearly 40 percent of eighth grade students did not meet the state standards       The U S  National Science Foundation cites that high tech industry employment grew by 50 percent between 1990 and 2002  and the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that U S  demand for science and engineering workers will grow at least three times as fast as the overall economy in the next ten years  Nowhere is that more evident than right here in the Hudson Valley and Capital Region where there are already over 50 000 high tech jobs  including IBM in Poughkeepsie and GE Global Research Labs in Niskayuna  The Nanotechnology sector alone has created 4 000 jobs and  8 billion in public and private investment to date  and in just the last four years  Albany NanoTech has grown from 100 employees to almost 1 400  Estimates of job growth in the region vary from study to study  but it is certainly possible that in the next 20 years  Tech Valley could gain tens of thousands of new high tech jobs         For the first time in generations  a young person in the Upstate New York doesn  t have to look elsewhere to start a career  There will be opportunities right here in the region  But the question is  Will they have the skill sets necessary to take full advantage of this new economy  Right now our children are lagging behind  and we must address this at once     Schumer said        Schumer today unveiled the Mathematics and Science Teaching Corps Act of 2006  MSTC  pronounced   mystic     S  2248 and H R  4705  sponsored in the House by Congressman Jim Saxton  R NJ   This bipartisan legislation creates a federal fellowship program to recruit  train and retain outstanding math and science teachers  The program will recruit aspiring and current teachers with strong content knowledge to represent approximately 20 percent of the nation  s math and science teachers  and will provide them with the support  professional development  and financial incentives needed to retain them as essential assets in their school communities        Prospective teachers with strong math and science backgrounds  as well as working teachers  are often lured away from teaching by more lucrative and prestigious opportunities in the private sector  In exchange for a four year teaching commitment  MSTC will provide teaching certification in a one year master  s program for individuals who are highly skilled in math and science  Retention strategies will include district level mentoring  professional development  and federal financial incentives  Under MSTC  current teachers will commit to teaching for five years and serve as leaders in their school  mentor new teachers and participate in professional development  They will also receive federal financial incentives to keep them from leaving the classroom for the private sector        Schumer  s legislation is based on three unique tenets        1  National Standards for Participation  All applicants  whether aspiring or working teachers  must pass a National Academy of Science approved standardized test of subject knowledge  In addition to strong knowledge of subject matter  candidates must demonstrate strong verbal skills and other attributes that are linked to effective teaching        2  Financial Incentives  During their years in the program  all Corps members will receive stipends from the federal government in addition to their regular salaries  New teachers   stipends will begin at  11 000 and scale up to  20 000 during their four year teaching period  while working teachers   stipends will be set at  20 000 per year  Corps members teaching in hard to staff schools may receive further enhanced stipends        3  Building Prestige and Respect Through a National Program  As members of a Teacher Corps  participants will experience a high level of enthusiasm and solidarity  In addition  the highly visible teacher corps will build prestige and respect for the field of math and science teaching        MSTC is based on a successful program in New York City called the Newton Fellowship Program  which is operated by a non profit organization called Math for America
