IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 5  2005 Schumer  Western New Yorkers Will Pay  163 Million More To Heat Their Homes This Winter    Senator Proposes Steps To Bring Down Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator Announces New York Could Lose  60 Million In Heating Assistance Funding If Key Provision in Budget Bill Not Preserved    With Natural Gas Prices Up 40  and Home Heating Oil Prices Up 28   People in Erie County Can Expect to Pay  466 More Than Last Year   LIHEAP Recipient Joins Schumer To Share Personal Experience On Importance of Federal Funding In light of an  163 million projected increase in Western New York home heating costs this winter  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the Administration to tap the government s emergency heating oil stockpile as soon as possible to help bring down high heating fuel prices  The 2 million barrels in the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve would give consumers in the region supplies for about 10 days  the time needed for ships to carry heating fuel from Gulf of Mexico refiners to New York Harbor  Several weeks ago  the Department of Energy threshold for releasing fuel from the stockpile was met  but the Administration declined to tap the reserve          With energy prices out of control  we have to help people pay for soaring heating costs this winter     Schumer said    More people then ever are likely to qualify for LIHEAP assistance  and we need to make sure the money will be there for them  If we secure these additional funds  hopefully everyone who needs help during this frigid winter will be able to receive assistance  Nobody should have to choose between putting food on the table and heating their homes          The New York State Public Service Commission recently reported that gas prices will be 35  45  higher than last year  and that the average consumer in New York uses approximately 90 000 cubic ft of natural gas this winter  While last year  s the New York average for natural gas price between October and March was  13 15  this year  s could be  18 42       According to the Energy Information Administration  Northeast consumers used 641 gallons of home heating oil last year  This week  home heating prices in Western New York were  2 52  up 25  from  2 02 exactly 12 months ago  Schumer estimated that this winter s price would be 28  higher than last year or an average of  2 60  between November and April  per EIA estimates  There are over 343 000 natural gas users in Erie County and only 7 841 home heating oil users  Since each Erie County natural gas consumer could pay  1638 this year  up from  1170 last year  and the Erie County New York home heating oil user would pay  1667  up from  1301 last year   the weighted average increase for the Erie consumer is  466 this winter       Schumer today also called for the preservation of a  1 billion allocation for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program  LIHEAP  which helps eligible low income households meet their home heating needs  Last year  over 62 000 people in Erie County received LIHEAP Assistance  but because of higher energy costs fewer families could receive funding this year or families will receive a lower percentage of their heating bills  Currently  under the FY05 federal allocation for LIHEAP of  1 885 billion  New York is slated to receive  235 6 million  If the  1 billion is approved in the final version of the Budget Reconciliation bill  New York would get an additional  60 million  These funds would help LIHEAP recipients cover the gap between their existing LIHEAP benefit and their projected high heating bills        At today  s event Schumer also called for expanding the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP  by  500 million  which reduces household energy use and costs by improving the energy efficiency of a participant s home  WAP has been proven to reduce heating bills by 31  and overall energy bills by  274 per year  Weatherization technologies address the whole spectrum of energy consuming systems in low income homes including insulation  blower doors  air sealing  windows  heating  water heaters  air conditioning and warm climate weatherization measures  and electrical appliances and weatherization base load measures       Schumer today also called on the President to tap the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve at the next possible opportunity  Under a complicated Energy Department formula  the heating oil reserve could have been tapped last week when wholesale heating oil and crude oil prices were at certain high levels  But the administration said there was no shortage of heating oil and refused to release any supplies from the stockpile  When Congress created the heating oil reserve in 2000  it said the president may release fuel from the stockpile if the difference between the price of Northeast heating oil and crude oil is increasing and is 60 percent greater than its five year rolling average for that month for two consecutive weeks       Currently  the threshold for tapping the oil reserve is not met  but Schumer today said as soon as the formula is triggered  Bush should initiate a swap into the reserve to help lower energy bills for New Yorkers        Schumer was joined by Josephine Calandra  Buffalo homeowner who relies on LIHEAP to pay for natural gas to heat her home
