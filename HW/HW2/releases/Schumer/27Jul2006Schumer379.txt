York  Specifically  the legislation includes  10 07 billion in highway funds and  6 5 billion for New York State  s transit systems  a 19 percent increase in annual average highway spending and a 30 percent increase in public transit funding compared to the previous six year transportation authorization bill  The bill also contains funding for research  safety  environment  transportation planning and security that will benefit all New Yorkers        Senator Clinton served as a member of the Conference between the House and Senate due to her role as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee Senator Schumer is a member of the Banking and Finance Committees  which control the transit funding and tax portions of the bill  Both Senators fought hard to ensure that provisions important to New York were retained in the Conference Report          This is great news for Buffalo and Western New York  These transportation funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state     Schumer said    Buffalo has waited for years to get things moving at the Peace Bridge and Outer Harbor  and these federal dollars will go a long way towards getting these projects done  Funds for the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and putting Cars back on Main Street will be a huge shot in the arm for bringing jobs and new like to downtown Buffalo          After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to Western New York  These funds will go a long way towards helping communities make the infrastructure improvements needed to keep their economies moving     said Senator Clinton  who served as a Senate conferee in negotiations on the bill    I am proud that our efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the ever increasing transportation demands on our state  We have made a substantial contribution to the future of Western New York by investing in these critical road and transit projects  I am especially pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Peace Bridge  The people of Buffalo have been waiting a long time for this and I am pleased that we are finally on the path to getting this bridge built  I am also pleased that we secured these funds to expand and improve Route 219  the gateway from Toronto to Buffalo and beyond and I am pleased that we secured these funds for the Outer Harbor Project which I believe will help energize Buffalo and the entire region  Finally  I am thrilled that we were able to secure language that will officially designate Interstate Highway 86 in the Southern Tier  as the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway  It is a most fitting tribute to his work  that this highway bear his name

transportation network as well as ways to reduce our vulnerability from earthquakes  In addition  the Senators provided an additional  3 million to support ongoing research activities  The funding will also help improve earthquake simulation facilities  This is an important economic generator in Western New York and will keep the University of Buffalo at the forefront of this important research  Senator Clinton promised to fight hard to include the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  in this version of the bill  MCEER is a national center of excellence in advanced technology applications dedicated to the reduction of earthquake losses nationwide  MCEER is headquartered at the State University of New York at Buffalo  The Center was originally

Route 17 Upgrades for Broome  Delaware  Chemung  Orange  Sullivan  and Cattaraugus Counties and  1 million for I 86 Route 17 Upgrades for Tioga County  The upgrade and designation of NYS Route 17 as

creating a sustainable urban environment and improve access to medical services  The total cost of this project is  16 million and is critical to downtown Buffalo s downtown strategic plan  These enhancements will link multi modal facilities together  In particular  increased transit access and ridership on the Metrorail will be completed and links between Allen Hospital Station will increase access to the campus        2 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for road improvements that will help with the restoration of vehicle traffic to Main Street in downtown Buffalo in

provisions  including   Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured language in this bill renaming all of I 86 after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  a fitting tribute to a man who once chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee and who fought hard in previous transportation reauthorization bills for the needs of New York  Senator Clinton introduced an Amendment last year that was accepted by the Senate during consideration of the surface transportation reauthorization bill  The provision was retained in this year  s bill and will now become law       Amo Houghton Bypass    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured approval to rename a portion of Route 86 near Corning  NY  after former Congressman Amo Houghton who was primarily responsible for securing the funding that made construction of this bypass possible  Senator Clinton offered an Amendment  and it was accepted  during the Environment and Public Works Committee  s markup of the surface transportation reauthorization bill  This provision was also included in the House bill sponsored by Rep  Randy Kuhl        High Priority Corridor Amendment   Clinton and Schumer worked to secure approval for Route 219 in Western New York  I 86 I 99  I 87 from the Quebec border to New York City  the East West Corridor from Watertown to Vermont  and I 95 from New York to Connecticut to be designated as high priority corridors  making them eligible for specific high priority corridor funding  These roads are important routes within the State of New York and this amendment makes single and two corridors eligible for federal funding to assure long term stability  Senator Clinton proposed this amendment during the Environment and Public Works Committee  s markup  Both roads were originally designated as High Priority Corridors in 1991  but language in this bill originally removed two state or single state corridors  The Clinton amendment makes all single state and two state corridors eligible because they can be just as vital as multi state corridors        National System Study Commission   The Conference Report contains a provision creating the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that Senator Clinton authored as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  This Commission will determine the future transportation needs of New York and the nation  This Commission will combine the National Transportation System Study and the Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission  Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward  The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing provides a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future  A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York  It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network       CargoWatch Technology    the Senators secured  3 5 million for PAR Technology  s CargoWatch Transportation Management Program  This funding is in addition to funds added in the House  These funds will be used to identify  track  and manage cargo within containers along with associated over the road assets from point origin until destination  Tracking container shipping supply chains will provide essential national security and efficient transportation management  The tracking system is being developed by PAR Technologies  based in New Hartford  NY       The Conference Report is now scheduled to be considered by both the Senate and the House sometime later this week  After passing each house  the approved Report will then go to the President  s desk to be signed  The bill originally passed the House on March 10 and the Senate on May 17  The new project funding is in addition to any money already approved by the House
