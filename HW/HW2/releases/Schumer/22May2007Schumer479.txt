Schumer  The Big Railroad Companies Keep Hitting the Snooze Button when It Comes to Safety   It s Time to Wake Them Up   Senator Authored Comprehensive Rail Safety and Security Legislation to Overhaul Nation s Decre Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer testified before the Senate Commerce Committee s Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure  Safety  and Security

Materials Transport Act of 2007  A copy of the Senator s testimony is included below        Millions of Americans who live in communities and neighborhood that lie near freight rail tracks live life

Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  which sets tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology  The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and require the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents      Below is the Senator s Testimony from today s hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee  Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure  Safety  and Security    Thank you  Mr  Chairman  First  I d like to thank the committee for holding this hearing on an issue that affects the entire nation  This country s rail system is a vital lifeline for many of America s towns and cities  However  I believe that in New York and across the country  we are on the brink of disaster  We can no longer afford to our tracks and trains it in such a dismal state of disrepair   We must make sure it is as safe as possible and that rail companies who refuse to make even the most basic repairs are held accountable for their actions       Millions of Americans who live in communities and neighborhood that lie near freight rail tracks live life in the crosshairs  fearing that the next derailment or accident could be a terrible disaster        Thankfully  many of these accidents are minor  but each one should have been a wake up call to overhaul our system in order to prevent the next serious crash   Unfortunately  the industry has continued to hit the snooze button   It is now up to Congress to wake the industry up and that is what this hearing and my legislation will hopefully do       I have said it before and I will say it again  The railroad industry has turned a blind eye to safety and allowed our nation s rails to degrade year after year  In 2004  the railroad industry made over  42 billion in revenues by shipping goods 1 66 trillion miles over America s rail system  However  despite record business and profits  the industry s safety record has grown deplorably worse  This record must improve immediately   The number of derailments that have occurred in the first quarter of this year is 8  higher than for the same period ten years ago  jumping from 280 derailments to over 300        The current crisis lies in the decrepit state of our nation s rail lines  No state has seen the effects of this more than my home state of New York  For two centuries now  New York has relied on rail lines to transport its goods within the state and all over the country  More than 3 500 miles of track crisscross New York  from Buffalo to Albany  Plattsburgh to New York City  with 36 railroads operating in the state  In the period between 2000 2006  there were 572 rail accidents in New York  causing  34 million in damages  Every year  2 95 million tons of hazardous materials travel through my state by rail  This year has seen a rash of dangerous derailments across the state that could have caused serious harm        In March  a CSX freight train hauling derailed in Oneida  NY  Several of the cars were carrying dangerous chemicals  and they ignited  sending a fireball into the sky seen from miles away  Thousands were evacuated  and the FRA was sent in to investigate the crash  Of course  the reason for the derailment was a crack in the rail  This is just another chapter in the long story of railroad negligence when it comes to safety        The FRA report of the Oneida derailment faulted CSX with 79 different problems with their tracks across New York  And it is not just the Oneida crash that has shaken the residents of New York   There are many other examples of rail companies asleep at the switch in my state  On January 16  thirteen cars on a CSX train left the tracks in the village of East Rochester  landing within a few feet of nearby homes  No one was injured  but at least two motorists were nearly hit by falling trailers that were dislodged from their train cars  The week before  20 000 gallons of methanol caught fire at the CSX Selkirk rail yard  the same destination as the train that derailed on Monday   On December 10  a CSX train carrying canned goods derailed on an overpass in Cheektowaga  leaving one boxcar teetering on the edge of a railroad bridge and sending a second onto Union Road       It is because of situations like this that I ve reintroduced the Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  Congress cannot allow rail companies like CSX to continue to sit idly by and let their tracks fail apart while they collect checks  We must hold their feet to the fire  and send them a clear message that we mean business and won t allow this behavior to continue             My bill would dramatically increase the fines for violating the FRA rules  and it will also update FRA standards regarding hazardous materials and increase fines  making sure that we    the federal government    are doing our part   But we can t be the only ones stepping up to the plate   Rail companies must haul their share of the burden in ensuring that our rail system is as safe as possible  for the physical safety of our passengers  motorists  rail workers  and pedestrians  and for our own economic security         Congress  the Department of Transportation  state and local agencies  and the rail companies must all work together to minimize dangerous spills like what happened in Oneida  Of course  train derailments are not a phenomenon limited to my state  We should not wait until a fatality to act   We must act now   We must crack down on sleeping companies  while at the same time help improve the rail infrastructure of our nation         My legislation would do just that  It attacks this problem of rail safety head on and holds violators accountable for their actions   or lack thereof   It also would help state and local governments who are trying improve rail infrastructure by providing  50 million in grants   Additionally  my bill will provide financial assistance to areas such as Long Island and Westchester to close very dangerous platform gaps that exist   We cannot wait any longer         I look forward to working with this Committee and hope that as the committee moves forward with a rail safety bill  it will consider my legislation  and the positive effect it could have on our nation s rail network   I thank the committee for holding this hearing  and will be submitted a more extensive written statement for the record  Rail companies must be held accountable for dropping the ball when it comes to rail safety  but we must do out best to compensate for their shortcomings   Thank you
