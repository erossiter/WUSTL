IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 15  2007 Schumer Fights for New Plan to Install Broadband Over Power Lines To   Deliver High Speed Internet Throughout Central New York  Entire National Grid Service Area                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Schumer Calls on Public Service Commission to Green Light New Pilot Project that Could Deliver Affordable High Speed Internet to Underserved and Rural Communities   Broadband Installed Over Power Lines Can Deliver New Connections Without the Huge Cost of New Infrastructure   With New York State Ranked 31st in Percentage of Households with an Internet Connection  High Speed Intern With many communities in Central New York and across upstate still without affordable and reliable connections to high speed internet  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the New York Public Service Commission  PSC  to grant approval for an innovative project in Central New York to install broadband capabilities via existing power lines   The joint project between Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation  NIMO  and New Visions Power lines Communications Inc   NVPC  would utilize new technology that could bring broadband service to the most remote communities without enormous cost           Arts  culture  news  entertainment  politics and more   in a world that is increasingly reliant on high speed  easily accessible Internet  not having high speed Internet access is like not having air to breathe   said Schumer   To rebuild upstate s economy we simply must have a first class information infrastructure that includes universal high speed internet access  The problem is that it is still very expensive to deliver this vital service to remote and underserved communities   The pilot project offers enormous hope to families and businesses which need to connect to the information superhighway  Central New York is the ideal place to host this pilot program and I look forward to working with state  local  and community leaders to ensure this project is a success and can be spread throughout the state        Schumer said that broadband and high speed internet is the lifeblood of the new economy and it is more important than ever that every community has access to this important technology   However  laying broadband fiber optic cables the so called  last mile  can be prohibitively expensive and as a result many communities are without such service  With too many parts of New York State  particularly upstate  facing such obstacles  installing broadband capability over existing power lines reduces such costs dramatically       The pending agreement between NIMO and NVPC holds particular promise for many people living is rural or even small to mid size communities that currently lack broadband service   Broadband over powerlines  BPL  is an exciting new option that has the capability of bringing broadband to virtually any place that has electrical power   said Schumer        BPL works by sending encoded micro voltages of electrical energy that represent information content that is transmitted over power lines  Small transformers hung from utility poles would reduce the strength of transmission and connect the signal directly to a group of homes and or businesses  A home or business would only need to plug a small device into an outlet to receive the transmissions        Schumer said that  if the Public Service Commission green lights the project  municipalities could work with NVCP so both consumer and local governments could have full access their services  BPL also has the capacity to be used in several homeland security and public safety applications along the NIMO grid  such as real time closed circuit TV monitoring       Schumer also noted that as this leasing agreement could represent the most widescale deployment BPL in New York State  the Public Service Commission  PSC  would need to closely monitor the technologies phased implementation and ensure that National Grid and their rate payers are not subsidizing this service  Furthermore  he asked that NIMO and NVPC put a premium on protecting the safety of workers who install these systems         BPL received approval from the Federal Communications Commission in 2004 and since then many states  from Virginia to California  have begun to approve its deployment         In his letter to the Commissioners  Schumer wrote   given BOP s potential to enhance economic development and homeland security  as well as to offer greater choice to consumers  I believe the Public Service Commission should approve the current application
