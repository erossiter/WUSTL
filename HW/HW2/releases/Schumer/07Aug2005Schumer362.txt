IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 7  2005 Schumer Reveals  Millions Of NY  ers At Risk As Gaping Holes In Rx Regulations Allow Criminals To Introduce Counterfeits Into Drug Supply Chain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Those Most at Risk Including  Elderly  Cancer Patients  Transplantees  are Targeted  Schumer Stands with Tim Fagan  a Victim of Counterfeit Drug Treatment Following His Liver Transplant and Parents  Counterfeit Drugs Can be Harmful  but even Those that are Harmless can Cause Severe Injury Because Patients Aren  t Getting Real Drugs that they Need As cases of counterfeit drugs have nearly doubled in the past year  endangering anyone who takes prescription medication  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer detailed how these counterfeits can enter the drug supply and cause further illness and even death to patients  Schumer  standing with Tim Fagan  a victim of drug fraud  and his parents  announced legislation in the United States Senate to combat this deadly scourge         These criminals have found a loophole to exploit and now can go around the safety mechanisms trusted by trained doctors and pharmacists and endanger the lives of Americans  It s time for the Federal government to step up the effort to shut them down  Schumer said    We shouldn  t have to play Russian roulette with our prescription medication          A new gray market of pharmaceutical drugs allows criminals to introduce counterfeits into the drug supply  contaminating it and endangering patients  especially the most vulnerable  Prescription medications  before getting stocked in a pharmacy can follow a long and winding path that leads them through wholesalers and repackagers  Most wholesalers are honest brokers  but the occasional criminal can taint the entire system by introducing counterfeits  When repackagers and wholesalers get their medicine from anywhere other than the manufacturer it becomes easier to counterfeit  Once outside the normal distribution system the rules aren  t as stringent  For example  at times  low priced drugs that are distributed to health clinics or Medicaid programs are taken from those places and sold at a higher price       Though there are various mechanisms of counterfeiting a drug the most common way is to interfere with the active ingredient either by  changing it  watering it down  using too much  or switching it altogether  Results can be very harmful and even deadly  In most cases the most infirmed are targeted as medicines to treat HIV  cancer and transplant recipients are the most expensive       According to the Food and Drug Administration  cases of counterfeit drugs are up nearly 100  nationwide in the past year  According to National Association of Chain Drug Stores  in 2004 in New York there were over 220 million prescriptions for a cost of over  16 billion  For New York City that translates to over 92 million prescriptions for a cost of almost 7 billion dollars  New Yorkers could be buying over 93 000 counterfeit prescriptions a year at a counterfeit cost of almost 7 million dollars       In 2002  Procrit  a drug used to treat Cancer and HIV patients to combat fatigue and other symptoms was counterfeited  Counterfeiters diluted the medicine with tap water that was non sterile  making the medicine a fraction of the strength of what it was supposed to be  The tap water increased the risk of infection in these patients exponentially  Other drugs such as Lipitor  Viagra  and Epogen have also been recently counterfeited       Schumer today stood with his consitituent Tim Fagan and his family  In 2002 after Fagan had a liver transplant he was prescribed the prescription drug Epogen   which he was to be injected with to increase his red blood cell count which was depleted after his surgery  The Fagan  s purchased the drug from a major pharmacy  Each time Tim was injected with the drug he would suffer from terrible  crippling muscle spasms that would make him scream in agony  His doctors were bafffled  and after looking further into Tim  s reaction  the Fagan  s discovered that Tim was being treated with counterfeit drugs         The bottom line is  we shouldn  t be concerned that medicine we take to make us better will actually make us sicker     Schumer said    We should not have to worry that our medicines have been tampered with  contaminated  relabeled and counterfeited         In an effort to combat this dangerous scenario  today Senator Schumer announced legislation to improve the tracking of drugs as they make their way from the manufacturer to the hands of patients       Schumer  s legislation will        Beef up criminal penalties for people who make counterfeit drugs or knowingly sell them        Phase in over five years a mandate for drug manufacturers and distributors to keep a record of where the drug has been between the time it left the manufacturer and arrived at the pharmacy        Allow more resources for the FDA to conduct random inspections of drugs        Give the FDA the authority to recall prescription drugs if they are expected to cause serious harm to consumers      Congressman Israel is working on a different bill in the House aimed at solving the same problem   Schumer today was joined by Tim Fagan and his parents Kevin and Jeanne        For additional information on counterfeit drugs
