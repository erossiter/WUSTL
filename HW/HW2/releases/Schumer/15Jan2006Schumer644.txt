                                     Millions of NY Cell Phone Users would be Entitled to Average of  50 each from the Feds    Recent Court Decisions Have Voided Federal Tax Paid by Over 5 Million Cell Phone Users in New York City  Senator Calls for Immediate End to Century Old Tax   Schumer Urges IRS Commissioner to Issue Orders to Cell Phone Companies to Stop Collecting Fed Tax and then Fully Refund Taxpayers Who Have Paid the Tax U S  Senator Charles Schumer is  the Internal Revenue Service to immediately stop collecting a recently voided tax on cell phone users in New York and issue refunds to taxpayers as soon as possible  The federal tax on cell phone bills has cost New York City  s over 5 million cell phone users  275 million over the last three years and has been voided by several federal appeals courts around the country  Schumer will send a  to IRS Commissioner Everson on Monday morning urging him to heed the multiple federal court rulings  stop collecting the federal tax through cell phone companies  and implement a program to refund whatever cell phone users have unfairly paid over the last three years to the federal treasury  Schumer announced the recent revelations and released a  to the IRS today        Schumer said    When federal courts rule that a federal tax should not be paid by consumers in multiple states  the IRS should not continue to collect that tax in New York or anywhere else  The bottom line is that this century old tax doesn  t make sense and unfairly taxes New York  s cell phone users  even though it has been voided in many other states  Cell phone users in New York City already suffer from shoddy reception and high state taxes    this voided federal tax adds insult to injury           Cell phone customers in New York City are due  275 million in tax refunds according to a series of federal court decisions  The Internal Revenue Service is still collecting the tax through cell phone companies and has announced that it will not process refund requests from taxpayers while other cases are pending        Last month a third federal appeals court in Washington  D C  voided the tax  Two other federal appeals courts  with jurisdiction over seven states  have voided the tax as well  States covered by the three federal circuit courts include Kentucky  Michigan  Ohio and Tennessee  Alabama  Florida  Georgia  and DC       The Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association  CTIA  estimates that Americans spend just over  100 billion a year on cell phone service  meaning that the cell phone tax is costing U S  consumers just over  3 billion a year  New Yorkers would end up saving over  130 million each year if this tax stopped being collected by the IRS  New Yorkers would also be entitled to over  275 million in refunds from the IRS       The average consumer pays an average  50 for his or her monthly cell phone bill    but the rates for cell phone users are based on the time of the call  not the distance the call travels  In other words  the courts have said that the previously mandated tax on   long distance    phone calls does NOT apply to cell phone calls        In his  to Commissioner Everson  Schumer wrote    Despite the holdings of several federal appeals courts that the excise tax does not apply to calls with a time based rate  the IRS continues to require that the phone companies collect the tax  This is bad for business and it is bad for consumers  Because the courts must deal with these cases circuit by circuit  the result is that customers in Ohio are exempt from the tax while customers in New York are not  We should eliminate this disparity and treat all consumers the same  regardless of the federal circuit in which they live          The federal excise tax on communications was imposed in 1898 to help pay for the Spanish American War  The tax was extended again in 1965 to cover long distance phone calls  at a time when only one telephone company existed  That is why courts addressing the issue have repeatedly held the tax does not apply to calls for which the rate varies by the time of the call  The IRS should bring its practices in line with the court rulings       Schumer is calling on the IRS to immediately        1  Issue a formal letter to telephone service providers instructing them to immediately stop collection of the tax on calls for which the rate varies by the time of the call       2  Refund customers for taxes paid over the last three years        To make this work smoothly  telephone service providers should notify their customers as to how much tax they have paid over the past three years  and then the customers should apply directly to the federal government to receive their refunds  The application process for these refunds must also be as simple and efficient as possible         New Yorkers should be treated the same as taxpayers in states like Ohio and Alabama where this wrong headed federal tax has been voided by federal appeals courts  If the IRS is not willing to fix this unfair tax that costs New York  s cell phone users millions of dollars  I will do everything I can to make sure the federal excise tax is taken off the books permanently     Schumer concluded       Click here to view
