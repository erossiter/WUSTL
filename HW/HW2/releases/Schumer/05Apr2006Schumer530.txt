IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 5  2006 Schumer Announces Senate Passes Sex Offender Legislation With New Federal Tracking System That Would End State To State Disparity In Registration And Notification Procedures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Schumer  Member of Judiciary Committee  Champions Bill Through Senate U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today that the Senate late last night unanimously passed the   Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act     S  1086   comprehensive national legislation specifically designed to protect children from sexual predators  Once enacted into law  the bill will create a national database and require convicted sex offenders to register their whereabouts regularly in person  Failure to comply would be a felony  Existing sex offender sites are managed from state to state  and do not correspond with each other  Under current law  convicts are required to register usually only once per year  by mail  and failure to comply is only a misdemeanor  The bill also authorizes funding for tracking devices on sex offenders       Convicted sex offenders shouldn  t be able to escape the letter of the law just by moving across state lines     Schumer said    Having access to information about sexual predators in your community is a right  not a privilege  and parents should not have to go through a bureaucratic morass just to assess whether their neighborhoods are safe        Under current laws  sex offender registration requirements differ widely from state to state and as a result  many get lost in the shuffle  fall off the sex offender list  and are no longer tracked  Nationwide there are over 550 000 sex offenders  according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  Parents for Megan   s law estimates that 24  or between 100 000 and 150 000 aren  t even registered  meaning over 100 000 sex offenders are roaming the streets unknown to local law enforcement      Schumer  a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee joined Senators Joseph Biden  D DE  and Orrin Hatch  R UT  in pushing for the bill  Specifically  the bipartisan legislation would          Create A National Sex Offender Registry  a new federally maintained sex offender DNA database will be used by law enforcement and prosecutors           Create Stronger Registration Standards for Offenders  convicted offenders will have to register prior to release from prison or supervised release  Current law does not require registration before release from prison and sex offenders generally only have to register once a year  Under the new law  the duration to register for a first time sex offender increases from 10 years to 20 years and for second offenders and sexually violent offenders for their lifetime  Additionally if there is a change in status  job  address  etc  offenders are required to register that change immediately          Create A Searchable Statewide Sex Offender Registry  Requires the states  not local governments  to maintain a multi field  searchable sex offender registry           Establishes Strict Penalties For Failure To Register  Makes failing to register or to update registry information a federal felony           Links State Registries so that an offense committed in one state does not go unrecognized in another     Thousands of sex offenders are unaccounted for because of varying state laws  In fact  in the National Sex Offender Registry  NSOR   the database used by the FBI  there are only 385 343 names listed  This means that out of the 550 000 sex offenders registered with states  the government can not identify 165 000 of them  The burden of registration falls to the states to register with the FBI and not all states have the technology  training and resources to do so     For example if a sex offender moves from New Jersey to New York State and fails to register  the only way to find them is through the FBI database  While some states do a good job keeping their numbers up to date for the national database  others  like Utah have 8 names in the NSOR database  but over 8 000 sex offenders  California only has 49 000 in the NSOR database  but over 100 000 registered sex offenders  If a sex offender moved to NY and wasn  t on the NSOR no one would know his whereabouts  unless he committed another crime  In New York  there are 21 000 registered sex offenders with an estimated 5 000 to 7 000 who aren  t registered     According to the Department Of Justice  released sex offenders are four times more likely to be rearrested for crime and  on average  child molesters only served 43  of sentences       The bottom line is each state has different laws  different standards  and different ways of keeping track of people  and without a standardized federal procedure  dangerous criminals are falling through the cracks     Schumer said
