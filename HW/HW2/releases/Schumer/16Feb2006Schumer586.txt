IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 16  2006 Lawmakers Begin Push For New Thorough Federal Review Of United Arab Emirates Owned Company Taking Control Of Major U S  Ports In NY  NJ And East Coast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Schumer  Coburn  Lautenberg  Dodd  Shays  Fossella  and Foley Urge Treasury Dept  to Completely Review New Foreign Ownership of Major Ports Immediately   Federal Panel Gave Go Ahead on Deal Too Fast  No Need to Fast Track Business Deals with Such Sensitive Security Issues On Monday a  6 8 billion dollar deal put the operation and control of the major New York and New Jersey ports in the control of a firm in the United Arab Emirates and owned by the Government of Dubai  Dubai Ports World  Today  Senators Chuck Schumer  Tom Coburn  Frank Lautenberg  and Chris Dodd are being joined by Reps  Chris Shays  Vito Fossella and Mark Foley in sending a letter to Treasury Secretary John Snow urging him to review the deal immediately  The deal allows the UAE company to take control of most operations at six ports on the East Coast  including  New York  New Jersey  Baltimore  New Orleans  Miami and Philadelphia  Except for cargo screening functions performed by the Department of Homeland Security  the Port operator is responsible for securing cargo coming in and out of the port  the port facility itself  and the hiring of security personnel  In light of these critical functions being transferred from a private company based in Britain to a United Arab Emirates government owned company based in Dubai  the bipartisan group of lawmakers today called for the Treasury Department to carefully review the new arrangement and scrutinize all security issues before control is turned over completely         Outsourcing the operations of our largest ports to a country with a dubious record on terrorism is a homeland security and commerce accident waiting to happen     Schumer said    This United Arab Emirates government owned and operated company could be perfectly qualified to operate ports around the world  but the question that needs to be answered is whether or not they can be trusted to operate our ports in this post 9 11 world  The Administration needs to take another look at this deal          Coburn said    Handing the keys to U S  strategic ports to a regime that recognized the Taliban is not a sound next step in our war against terror  I urge Secretary Snow to investigate this agreement that could seriously undermine our national security            Dubai has allowed terrorists to pass freely through their own country  Why in the world should we let this rogue government control ports in the United States     said Lautenberg    The Administration must conduct a serious investigation before any deal is signed          Shays stated   Our ports are a welcome mat for terrorists trying to bring weapons of mass destruction into the United States  It is critical those in charge of our ports have our best interest as their interest  I am eager to understand why the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States approved the sale  handing over several key ports to a company based in the United Arab Emirates  and ensure it is thoroughly inspected and investigated        Fossella said    At a time when America is leading the world in the War on Terrorism and spending billions of dollars to secure our homeland  we cannot cede control of strategic assets to foreign nations with spotty records on terrorism  This decision seems inconsistent with American efforts to enhance our national security  The lack of transparency has left many questions unanswered as to why the UAE would be granted control of United States strategic assets           I  m extremely concerned with this development     Dodd said    Our ports are major potential terrorist targets and frankly this Administration hasn  t done enough to commit greater resources for their protection  I strongly urge the Administration to thoroughly investigate this acquisition    Foley said   Six of our largest commercial ports are being handed over to a country that is seeking to be Iran s free trade partner and has been linked to the funding and planning of 9 11  If our ports are the most vulnerable targets for terrorism and if we are at war  as the President says  we should be overly critical of handing over management of our ports to any foreign countries  post 9 11  Instead  this was done in the dead of night        The Port of New York and New Jersey were controlled by a London based company  Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co   the world  s 4th largest port operator with operations in over 85 ports in 19 countries  including P subsidiary P Ports North America  which has operations in over 20 U S  ports from Portland  Maine to Corpus Christi  Texas as well as Vancouver  Canada on the West Coast  But last week  the government of Dubai  United Arab Emirates won a bidding war too buy the venerable British firm  DP World  s bid to buy the company was quietly cleared by a government panel without public scrutiny  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  cleared the deal  without a public report or evaluation        On Monday  Schumer sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff asking him to conduct a thorough evaluation of the security ramifications of the take over and present his to report to Congress within one month        Ports have long been considered the most vulnerable targets for a terrorist attack and experts agree that shipping containers are the best way to smuggle a Weapon of Mass Destruction  WMD  in to the United States  Only 5 percent of containers entering our ports are actually inspected  with the rest in under the control of the port operator  Nuclear  Chemical  or Biological materials could easily be delivered directly to a U S  port  many of which are located within or adjacent to major population centers  NY NJ  Philadelphia  Baltimore  Norfolk  Miami  New Orleans  Houston        The Port of New York and New Jersey has seen a significant boost in sea cargo over the last few years with a substantial rise in Asian trade helping to boost growth by more than 10 percent during the first six months of 2005  Overall  the port offloaded 1 654 483 cargo containers during the first six month of 2005       The bipartisan letter to Snow follows      February 16  2006      Secretary John W  Snow  Department of Treasury  1500 Pennsylvania Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20220      Dear Secretary Snow        We are writing to express our concerns with the impending acquisition of Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Navigation Co   P  by DP World  a company owned and controlled by the Government of Dubai  United Arab Emirates  UAE   This transaction will result in foreign government control of P Ports  North America  P subsidiary   the largest port operator on both the Eastern U S  Coast and U S  Gulf Coast  We are concerned that the Administration is not giving this case the appropriate level of scrutiny required by law and ask that you direct the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  to conduct a full 45 day investigation       Federal law requires the President or his designee investigate the impact on national security of a foreign acquisition if the acquisition   could result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect the national security of the United States      50 USC App      2170   The President has delegated this investigative authority to CFIUS of which you are Chairman  We understand that CFIUS has chosen not to conduct a formal investigation       The law further mandates one of several factors be considered in determining a threat to national security    The control of domestic industries and commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the United States to meet the requirements of national security     Our country  s maritime ports are critical to our national security  vital to our military capability  and essential to our economy  Some 95 percent of all goods imported to the U S  arrive through our ports       Most importantly  our ports are our most vulnerable targets for terrorist attack  Despite efforts to improve port security by the Administration  only one in 20 shipping containers entering the U S  is physically inspected  A single terrorist incident could shut down our system of container transportation  affecting our entire economy  as well as facilities relied on by the Department of Defense as military load out ports       Dubai  which owns and controls the acquiring company in this case  has been named as a key transfer point for shipments of nuclear components that were shipped to Iran  North Korea  and Libya  which were sold by Pakistan  s nuclear scientist A Q  Khan  In addition  the UAE was one of only 3 countries  including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia  that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan        According to the Congressional Research Service  many U S  officials believed that al Qaeda activists have spent time in the UAE  In fact  two of the 9 11 hijackers were UAE nationals  Fayez Banihammad and Marwan al Shehhi   and the Federal Bureau of Investigation claimed the money used for the attacks was transferred to the 9 11 hijackers primarily through the UAE  s banking system  Furthermore  after the 9 11 attacks  your department complained of a lack of cooperation by the UAE and other Arab countries as the U S  was trying to track down Osama bin Laden  s bank accounts       In light of these considerations  we expect CFIUS  as the President  s designee  to undertake a complete and thorough investigation of this acquisition in accordance with Federal law  The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States  a k a     the 9 11 Commission     found that on September 11  2001  the   most important failure was one of imagination
