teach anti gang curriculum        Nasty street gangs have worked their way into Nassau County communities  preying on impressible teenagers and working overtime to foster a violent culture     said Senator Schumer    To stymie gang activity  we must inoculate our innocent teenagers from the tentacles of these ruthless gangs by educating them on gang culture           By training officers to not only deal with gang problems  but to also help prevent them  we are taking a proactive role in crime prevention   said Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi   Teaching children about the dangers of gang life is an important step in eradicating the gangs themselves throughout Nassau County        To counter the rise of youth gang violence  GREAT uses a violence prevention curriculum to help students develop values and practice behaviors that will assist them in staying away from joining gangs and participating in criminal acts  In addition  GREAT trains law enforcement officers to visit schools
