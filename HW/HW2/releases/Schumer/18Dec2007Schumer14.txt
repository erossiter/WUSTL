                                        National Do Not Call List Allows Upstate New Yorkers to Restrict Telemarketers from Calling Homes and Businesses to Solicit Call List Registration Expires After Five Years  First Wave of Expirations to Occur in 2008  Thousands of Upstate New Yorkers in the Dark Late Last Night Full Senate Passes Schumer s Legislation to Prevent Phone Numbers from Expiring Once they ve Been Placed on List With millions of New Yorkers at risk of receiving annoying and burdensome telemarketing phone calls  despite having added their phone numbers to the National Do Not Call Registry  today Schumer announced that the full Senate passed the bill that he co sponsored which prevents phone numbers from expiring once theyve been placed on the registry   The Do Not Call Registry  created in 2003  is a database of phone numbers managed by the Federal Trade Commission  FTC    When a person adds his or her phone number to the list via the toll free hotline or FTC website  telemarketers are prohibited from calling that number      However  names on the list expire after 5 years  with the first wave set to expire in early 2008  Furthermore  the FTC does not send any form of notification to individuals on the Do Not Call Registry alerting them to their upcoming expiration or explaining that an individual is responsible for his own re registration      Schumers bill  sponsored by Senator Byron Dorgan  D ND   passed the Senate late last night by unanimous consent  will amend the original law and prevent phone numbers from expiring once they are placed on the Do Not Call Registry      With millions of New Yorkers set to be dropped from the Do Not Call list  opening them up to a fresh wave of irritating and unprovoked calls from telemarketers  this bill fixes a major flaw in the program by ensuring that New Yorkers will permanently protected from these calls  said Senator Schumer This bill will make the Do Not Call Registry permanent  so New Yorkers wont be forced to repeatedly register just to eat dinner in peace and keep intrusive telemarketers off their personal phone lines    The Do Not Call list  created in 2003  is a database of phone numbers managed by the Federal Trade Commission  FTC    When a person adds his or her phone number to the list via the toll free hotline or FTC website  telemarketers have 31 days to remove that phone number from their call lists   In accordance with the 2003 law that created the Do Not Call Registry  consumers may file a complaint with the FTC if they receive any calls after the 31 day period  and telemarketers face fines of up to  11 000      However  most Do Not Call registrants are completely unaware that their registration expires five years to the day their phone number was registered   Because the list was created in 2003  beginning early 2008 many phone numbers currently on the list will expire  thus leaving thousands of people vulnerable to telemarketers    Nationwide  over 55 million telephone numbers have been registered with the Do Not Call Registry   Over 57  of U S  adults say that they have submitted their numbers to the registry   Of those people who have signed up  92  say that they have received dramatically fewer telemarketing calls  and 25  of those registered say that they have not received any telemarketing calls since registering   When compared to other large and populated states  New York saw among the fewest complaints during the initial three month period during which the registry was deployed   While over 22 000 complaints were filed by consumers in California  nearly 18 000 in Florida  and over 10 000 in Texas  only 4 300 complaints were filed by New York consumers in the same period       Area code 315 serves most of Central New York  the Finger Lakes and parts of the North Country  including Cayuga  Fulton  Hamilton  Herkimer  Jefferson  Lewis  Madison  Oneida  Onondaga  Ontario  Oswego  St  Lawrence  Seneca  Wayne  and Yates counties   It also serves parts of Chenango  Cortland and Otsego counties   676 186 phone numbers in the 315 area code are registered with the Do Not Call Registry      Area code 518 serves the Capital Region and most of the North Country  including Albany  Clinton  Columbia  Essex  Franklin  Greene  Montgomery  Rensselaer  Saratoga  Schenectady  Schoharie  Warren and Washington counties   702 721 phone numbers in the 518 area code are registered with the Do Not Call Registry      Area code 585 serves the Rochester Area  including Allegany  Genesee  Livingston  Monroe  Orleans and Wyoming counties

Hudson Valley including Dutchess  Orange  Putnam  Rockland  Sullivan and Ulster counties   It also serves parts of Columbia  Greene and Delaware counties   614 598 phone numbers in the 845 area code are registered with the Do Not Call Registry      Area code 914 also serves the Hudson Valley  but only serves Westchester County   598 998 phone numbers in the 914 area code are registered with the Do Not Call Registry     Today Schumer announced the Senate passed this legislation that will eliminate the automatic removal of telephone numbers registered on the federal Do Not Call Registry   This legislation will prohibit any date of expiration for telephone numbers on the list and prevent the FTC from setting any determined time limitation for telephone numbers to remain on the registry   Although the FTC has raised concerns that the 5 year registration term protects the integrity of the list  the FTC will still conduct their monthly purge of disconnected numbers remaining on the list to keep it accurate      Schumers co sponsored legislation will remove the burden that the FTC has placed on the individual to re register by ensuring that numbers placed on the Do Not Call Registry are not subject to automatic expiration
