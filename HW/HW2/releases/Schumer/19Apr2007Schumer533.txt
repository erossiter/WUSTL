IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 19  2007 With Senior Housing Shortage Growing In The Rochester Area  Schumer Blasts Administration Cuts To Vital Housing Programs For Elderly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             New Administration Budget Guts Housing Grant Programs for Low Income Seniors and Disabled Persons by  275 Million This Year   Could Leave Thousands of Rochester Seniors Unable To Meet Rising Housing Costs   Critical Programs Have Sent the Rochester Area Nearly  6 Million in the Last Three Years   Schumer  We Cannot Leave Our Seniors Out In The Cold Without Affordable Housing      Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer blasted an Administration proposal to gut vital housing programs for low income seniors and disabled persons in the Rochester area and across the country   Schumer said that the current budget slashes more than  275 million  Schumer today called on the Subcommittee on Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  HUD  to restore funding to housing programs for seniors which have provided Rochester seniors  6 2 million in assistance since 2004   These programs provide grants to non profits and community organizations for the development of supportive housing and rental assistance for low income seniors and those with disabilities           It is inexcusable to leave our nation s seniors without the housing programs that ensure that they can afford to have a roof over their head   said Schumer    Particularly for low income seniors and disabled persons  supportive housing and rental assistance programs are an essential component to affordable housing   I will continue to fight tooth and nail to restore funding to these vital programs so that our seniors are not left out in the cold         The elderly population in the Rochester area has been rapidly growing from 5 700 people older than 85 in Monroe County in 1970 to over 13 600 in the last census   As life expectancy grows  so does the elderly population  contributing to the housing crunch faced by seniors in Rochester   According to the American Association of Home and Services for the Aging  there are 10 people on waiting lists for every occupied unit of senior housing supported by HUD       This shortage is reflected in the Rochester area  particularly in the suburbs where 80  of Monroe County s 95 000 senior citizens reside   At many housing communities the waitlists are over 200 names long for a limited number of available units   The housing shortage is exacerbated by the high cost of living facing seniors  especially those whose rely solely on their social security pension   In Monroe County  12 percent of people age 65 and older live on less than  10 000 a year and more than 40 percent of those 65 and older have less than  25 000 in annual income         The Section 202 and 811 programs provide capital grants to non profits and community organizations for the development of supportive housing and rental assistance for very low income seniors and those with disabilities   Both programs provide supportive services coupled with housing to create a safe community and promote an independent life style   Many of those who currently live in Section 202 and 811 housing units are on fixed incomes and would not be able to bear the rising costs of health care  and housing on their own         With an estimated 8 4 million seniors struggling to survive on an annual income of less than  10 000  both of these programs are vital to the quality of living for our nation s seniors  The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program is the only HUD program that provides housing and supportive services exclusively for the low income elderly  The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program produces affordable and accessible housing exclusively for low income disabled individuals         The current Administration budget slashes funding for the Section 811 program by 50 percent and for the Section 202 program by about 22 percent  These cuts would significantly limit the number of new units that can be created and exacerbate difficulties for elderly and disabled Americans seeking affordable housing as development costs continue to rise   Specifically  in the FY08 budget proposal  the President recommended a cut to the Section 202 program by  160 million and the Section 811 program by  115 million under the FY07 levels         If these cuts were enacted  only 2 700 new units of section 202 housing and only about 1 100 new vouchers in the Section 811 program would be created nationally   This stands in stark contrast to the findings of the congressionally mandated Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century  which estimated that approximately 730 000 additional senior housing units will be needed by 2020 to address the housing needs of low income seniors       Schumer will call on Chairwoman Sen  Patty Murray and Ranking Member Sen  Christopher Bond to restore funding for these important programs  Schumer and his colleagues will declare that   Congress should act now to plan appropriately for the increased demand that will exist for housing in the coming years and ensure that seniors and those with disabilities can find safe  affordable housing  at a cost they can afford on fixed incomes
