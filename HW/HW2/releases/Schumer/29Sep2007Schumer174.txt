IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 29  2007 Schumer Announces He Will Hold First Ever Meeting Aimed at Reducing Helicopter Noise Plaguing Long Island Communities on Monday in His Office                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator Brings Together FAA Brass  Major LI Helicopter Operators  and Airport Managers to Craft a Plan to Reduce Noise from Low Flying Helicopters Plaguing Communities in Nassau and Suffolk Schumer  Outraged Residents from LI Neighborhoods Will Finally be Heard Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced he will convene the first ever meeting with officials from the Federal Aviation Administration  major Long Island and New York City helicopter operators  and airport managers from Nassau and Suffolk in order to craft solutions designed to reduce helicopter noise plaguing countless communities across Nassau and Suffolk counties  This summer was one of the worst summers ever with thousands of private helicopters buzzing over neighborhoods and schools  most of them originating from New York City on their way to the East End  Schumer  who has authored federal legislation requiring the FAA to study the problem and make recommendations aimed at reducing the noise  said the concerns of Long Island families will finally be heard   Noise from low flying helicopters has been left to roar unabated for far too long  Now is the time to act  I am not holding this meeting to point fingers  but instead finally put our noses to the grindstone and get something done  Long Island residents have put up with annoying and disruptive helicopter noise for long enough   Schumer said that for nearly a decade the number of helicopters that fly over Long Island hamlets and villages has skyrocketed causing concern among many neighborhoods for their families safety and livelihood  Most residents didnt know when they purchased their homes that these helicopters would fly so close to their communities   Many of these flights are from New York City out to the East End of the Island and are for recreational or commercial purposes during the summer months  While these helicopters have become an unfortunate irritant during the summer  they are also a constant presence throughout the entire year  Although most operators use voluntary routes designed to reduce the noise impact by avoiding noise sensitive areas  many helicopters are still flying over residential neighborhoods These flights impact communities in countless ways  not the least of which is disruption of daily life  forcing people to stay inside during the summer  and reducing property values in impacted areas    Helicopters have no minimum altitude requirements when en route  although they must maintain safe clearance from obstructions on the ground  In areas where airspace is congested  especially near commercial airports  the FAA does have some specified routes and altitude requirements designed to keep larger aircraft and helicopters at a safe distance  Helicopter pilots must comply with these prescribed routes or altitudes in certain areas directed by air traffic controllers    Helicopter noise has become more than a nuisance to Long Islanders in the summer when traffic to and from the Hamptons is markedly higher than during other seasons  Affecting residents in all parts of Long Island  the North Shore bears the brunt of it  This is particularly true in Smithtown and a number of other areas in Suffolk County spanning from Greenlawn in the west to Port Jefferson  Rocky Point  Mount Sinai  Centereach  and East End communities like Southampton  North Haven  East Hampton  and Mattituck  Nassau County is also afflicted with a high volume of helicopter traffic in areas such as Floral Park  New Hyde Park  Elmont  and Manhasset   This summer  May August   Gabreski Airport saw 1 948 helicopter operations compared to 1 416 during the same period last year  an increase of 35 7   East Hampton saw helicopter flights increase 15 percent this summer   Schumers office has received at least 75 calls this year from constituents as well as call from elected officials reporting hundreds of calls their offices have received  Last year  East Hampton Airport received 4 000 complaint calls  of which  3000 were for helicopter noise  Gabreski has sent out 79 letters to helicopter companies asking their cooperation with the airports voluntary noise abatement procedures   The meeting will be held Monday at 11 00am at Schumers Long Island regional office in Mellville  The following are the expected attendees    Hon  Charles E  Schumer  U S  Senator  Terry Dennison  US Helicopter  Patrick Day  Liberty Helicopter  Robert Grotell and David Nuss  Eastern Region Helicopter Association  David York  Helicopter
