                               Schumer and Graham Send USTR Nominee Schwab Letter with Questions on Financial Services Reciprocity and China  s WTO Commitments   After Schwab  s Disappointing Responses at Committee Hearing  Schumer Wants Questions Answered Before Allowing Nominee to Move Forward Today  U S  Senator Chuck Schumer was joined by Sen  Lindsey Graham in writing a letter to President Bush  s nominee to be the U S  Trade Representative  Ambassador Susan Schwab  Schumer objected to the unanimous consent request to approve her nomination without a vote or debate  In particular  the senators are concerned with the Administration  s willingness to press for reciprocity for financial firms that want to invest in China        Senator Schumer has said that he is reluctant to allow the nominee to move forward until he receives answers to the questions in the Schumer Graham letter  Below are both letters to Ambassador Schwab      May 26  2006      Ambassador Susan C  Schwab  Deputy U S  Trade Representative  600 17th Street  NW  Washington  DC 20508      Dear Ambassador Schwab       As you know  China currently places limitations on how much foreign ownership is allowed in various industries operating within its borders        It is our ardent belief that American financial services firms should have the same access to China  s financial markets that Chinese firms enjoy in the United States  Unfortunately  all signs point to the contrary  Today  the Chinese government erects significant barriers aimed at restricting the ability of American financial services firms to compete in an open and fair manner in China  For example  U S  securities firms are limited to establishing minority owned joint ventures  with ownership capped at 33 percent       Aside from the seemingly arbitrary and onerous ownership requirements  U S  firms also face a number of other troubling impediments in China  including limitations on the scope of business  the inability to trade in derivative markets  and uneven procedures for regulatory transparency such as a process for public notice and comment       Market access and national treatment for U S  financial services in accessing China  s markets is not merely a matter of fairness  it will ultimately create new opportunities for U S  firms and increase global economic growth  Given the competitive advantage we enjoy in research  product development  and regulatory structure  a freer market in China would bolster the U S  economy       While China has promised to eliminate quantitative restrictions on foreign ownership in financial services by the end of this year  their true commitment to openness and reciprocity is still open to question  In fact  according to publications by the U S  China Business Council  several Chinese banking officials have hinted that they are looking for ways to slow the entry of foreign banks to the sector without violating China  s WTO commitments  Specifically  the mainland press has reported that China was considering restricting foreign banks to the less prosperous central and western regions  and capping at two the number of Chinese banks in which foreign banks could take a stake  We are very concerned about this  because we have seen before how China can make promises but then find creative ways not to keep them       In your written responses to questions from your May 16 confirmation hearing before the Committee on Finance  you indicated that USTR has been working diligently to ensure that China keep its WTO commitments to eliminate these restrictions on financial services  However  you also said that the Administration has been   reminding       stressing     and   emphasizing    the importance of these commitments  Yet it is only rhetoric to verbally push China to do what they have already promised to do       We have seen first hand on the currency manipulation issue how limited the rhetorical strategy can be  China has promised time and time again to allow market forces to gradually appreciate its currency  yet the yuan has appreciated by only 1 1 percent since last July  We do not regard this as significant progress  and we do not want the same thing to happen with financial services liberalization       We would like to learn from you how USTR plans to work with Treasury to ensure that China keeps its commitments in the area of financial services    and what is USTR prepared to do if they fail to do so       Specifically  we would like answers to the following questions at your earliest convenience      1  What is your understanding of all of the current quantitative and qualitative restrictions that exist for U S  financial services firms trying to do business in China  in terms of joint ventures  the ability to operate independently  i e   to just go into China and start a company or open a branch   and the ability to purchase Chinese companies outright       2  What is your understanding of the commitments China has made in all of these areas  in terms of restrictions that are due to be liberalized    or lifted entirely    by the end of 2006       3  What specific initiatives  if any  does USTR have underway to push China to permit U S  financial services firms to establish wholly owned securities or banking companies in China       4  What is the office of the United States Trade Representative doing to lay the groundwork for China  s promise to eliminate quantitative restrictions in financial services by the end of 2006  What procedures does your office have in place to monitor their actions and determine if they have kept their promise       5  Have you or Treasury already had discussions with Chinese officials about how the landscape will look when the restrictions are lifted  in terms of  a  the process for license applications and the length of time before applications will be approved   b  any restrictions on the number of branches a bank or securities firm may open   c  any geographic limitations that may be imposed  or other issues  If so  what has been agreed to       6  Finally  what specific actions does USTR plan to take if it becomes plainly apparent in early 2007 that China is not meeting its commitments    We appreciate your patience and willingness to respond to these questions  and we look forward to your prompt reply       Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer Lindsey O  Graham         May 26  2006  Ambassador Susan C  Schwab  Deputy U S  Trade Representative  600 17th Street  N W   Washington  DC 20508      Dear Ambassador Schwab       As you know  I have taken action to prevent the Senate from unanimously approving your nomination to replace Ambassador Rob Portman as United States Trade Representative       I want to emphasize that my reluctance to allow your nomination to be approved expeditiously and unanimously  without floor debate or a roll call vote  is not related in any way to your qualifications or experience  I know that most Senators support your nomination  and it is very possible that I will as well  I simply believe that this is a very critical time for U S  trade relations  and I felt that your responses to several of my questions at your nomination hearing  particularly as they related to China and financial services  were unnecessarily evasive and unhelpful       Senator Lindsey Graham and I have submitted to you a list of simple  straightforward follow up questions on the issue of financial services liberalization in China  Please forward your answers    which I will share with my colleagues    as soon as possible  so we may proceed on your nomination with greater understanding of your views and goals       Sincerely       Charles  E  Schumer
