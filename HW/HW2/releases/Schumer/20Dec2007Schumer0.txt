IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 20  2007 Schumer Tours Port Of Oswego For A First Hand Look At The Perilously Shallow Channels That Obstruct Ships From Entering Rapidly Growing Port                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Schumer Reveals that Recently Passed Omnibus Budget Bill Gives Army Corps Authority to Reprogram Funding so it can Dredge Fast Growing Port of Oswego for the First Time Since 2004M With Silt Build Up Putting Portions of the Port Complex Several Feet Under the Recommended Water Level  Navigating Waterways  is Becoming Increasingly Difficult for Ships  Several Major CNY Businesses Could Lose Key Import Export Facility Schumer Tours Port of Oswego with Port Director   Pushes Army Corps to Quickly Dredge the Port so it Can Continue to Fuel Economic Growth Across Central NY   Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer toured the Port of Oswego to get a first hand look at the ports increasingly shallow and dangerous waterways  impeding navigation for cargo ships  Schumer  who has taken the lead in pressuring the Army Corps of Engineers  ACOE  to immediately dredge the entire port  revealed that the recently passed Congressional Omnibus bill gives the Army Corp the ability to reprogram funding to do this crucial work     While the port has recently undergone a remarkable revitalization fueling economic growth across Central New York  it is now threatened by undredged  shallow waterways that constrict access forshipsnavigatingthe port    Over the past several years  the Port of Oswego has undergone a remarkable rebirth  but today its future growth could be sunk by undredged and perilous waterways that restrict ships from navigating through the port  said Senator Schumer  Today  I witnessed firsthand the dangerous and shallow channels that are increasingly plaguing the Port of Oswego  and it only reinforces my belief that its vital for the Army Corps to immediately sweep in and dredge these waterways  said Senator Schumer  The good news is that the Army Corps will soon have the ability to find the funding for the project so they can get in there and get the job done  and protect an economic juggernaut that is fueling business across Central New  York    Schumer toured today the Port of Oswego with Port Director Jonathan Danielsto get a closer look at how the absence ofroutine maintenancedredging at the portin the lastthree yearshas left it suffering from shallow waterways that are increasingly treacherous for ships to navigate In some portions of Oswego Harbor  the water level is3 to 4 feetbelowthe recommended depth    After consistently losing money for years and seeing minimal activity  the Port of Oswego has undergone a startling rebound in recent years  adding capacity and providing an economic boost across the region So far in 2007  over 150 ships have utilized the Port  many enticed by its standing asthe only deep water port on the U S  shores of Lake Ontario The bulk commodities that pass through Oswego Harbor generate approximately  5 9 million annually in direct revenue and support over 78 jobs     Over the past three years  the ports popularity with the shipping industry has exploded due to its status as the only deep water port on the U S  shores of Lake Ontario The Port has transformed into a critical asset for retaining existing businesses reliant on shipments and for attracting new growth opportunities to Central New York  Commodities shipped out of the port include soybeans  windmill components  cement  chemicals  ores and minerals  particularly road salt   Some of the major businesses taking advantage of the port throughout Central NY include NRG Energy  Sprague Energy  Cargill  LaFarge Cement and Essroc cement    In October  Schumer revealed that the Port has gone without dredging since 2004  despitesiltand sediment accumulationat nearly 5 times the recommendedlevel The Army Corp smaintenance dredging plans call forapproximately 33 000 cubic yards  cy  of material be dredged from the Port area every 2 4 years  The dredging is essential to ensuring that navigable channel depths are maintained so ships can smoothly sail through points of entrance and into the port  Today  there is currently an estimated backlog of 159 000 cy of sediment whichhas decreased the depths of shipping berths and channelsbetween 6 inches and several feet     The absence of dredging has left the Port with increasingly shallow areas  especially around key access point for ships  Datacollected by the ACOE in May of this yearshows that the main access pointto the port    thealready narrow Lake Approach Channel  has shrunk to half its size because of silt accumulation In addition  thewater directly in front of the Port s East and West Dockshas grown dramatically shallow  Inan areawhere the recommended water level is 21 feet  the Army Corp s own survey from May  2007found thatseveralareas havedepths between 16 and 17feet    This decrease inwater level has meant that ships hull must carry lighter loads to remain morebuoyant  ThePortofOswego has notedseveral instances where companies hadto add another ship because cargohad tospread out among several vessels     Today  Schumer announced that a provision in the omnibus bill that passed the Senate and House this weeklifts a previous restriction andnowallows the Army Corp to transfer unused funds from other projects and use them to perform the emergency dredging at the port  Specifically  language in the omnibus bill will give the Army Corps authority to reprogram funding  The omnibus bill will soon move to the President for his signature     Schumer has emphasized that the longer the Port  of Oswego goes without dredging  the more expensive the project becomes  Every year that dredging is not performed more sediment accumulates and the cost of the project rises  The cost was estimated at  635 000 in FY 07  but will rise to  715 000 in FY09 As the water level plummets at the Port of Oswego  the cost for dredging simultaneously skyrockets  added Schumer  Each cubicyard costs between  4 12to remove
