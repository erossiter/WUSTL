IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 24  2007 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approves 1 5 Million To Address The Colony Collapse Disorder Threatening The Bee Population                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           New and Unexplained Condition Known As Colony Collapse Disorder Is Decimating Bee Colonies in New York State and Across the Country     Farmers Rely Heavily on Bees to Pollinate Their Fruit and Vegetable Plants and Worry Declining Bee Population Could Affect Crop Yield    Senators Worked Closely With Committee to Include Funding In Spending Bill                                      U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration  and Related Agencies FY08 Appropriations Bill  which includes a  1 500 000 for the Pollinator Recovery project to address Colony Collapse Disorder  CCD  and other threats to bee colonies nationwide  The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process  Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include the project in this years spending bill   Some desperately needed help is on the way for New York bee keepers  and all farmers who rely on bees to pollinate their crops  said Schumer  Colony Collapse Disorder has the potential to decimate crop yields causing billions of dollars in losses for upstate farmers  As one of the top honey producing and apple growing states in the country  New York has much at stake when it comes to protecting our bee colonies from this unexplained crisis  This funding is a huge step toward eradicating this disorder and I will continue to fight for this critical funding   This funding is an important step in helping to address the dramatic decline in the pollinator population  The honey industry and other specialty crop producers who depend on bees for pollination in New York and across the nation are struggling with the harmful effects caused by this rapid decline and we must take whatever action is needed to help our beekeepers and prevent this situation from becoming even worse  said Senator Clinton   Colony Collapse Disorder  CCD  is a new and unexplained condition that is decimating bee colonies throughout the United States  CCD is causing some beekeepers to lose upwards of 90 percent of their bee colonies  and is causing serious reductions in the supplies of bees for essential commercial pollination   The effects of CCD are as prevalent in the state of New York as they are throughout the nation  In New York  which is the nations tenth largest honey producing state  Western New York and the Finger Lakes region are the largest producers of amber honey in Upstate New York  collectively yielding over 871 000 lbs of honey from 170 farms The Adirondacks  another major upstate producer  is known for its high grade white honey  typically yielding over 794 000 lbs of honey from 74 farms   However  last year producers in both these regions suffered significant losses due to adverse weather and what many beekeepers believe to be the effects of the Colony Collapse Disorder  According to local producers  there have been reports of severe losses in colonies  with many losses being reported of close to fifty percent  and some beekeepers reporting losses of nearly eighty percent  Critical to New York s apple production  there are concerns that the loss of bee colonies here in New York will not be able to be remediated in time for apple pollination  Some estimates have shown that nearly all the major beekeepers in the state of New York have lost more than 30 percent of their colonies to CCD   Already in 2007  over 100 000 colonies have disappeared throughout the country  Some estimates have shown that nearly all major beekeepers in New York state have lost more than 30   of their colonies  with some local farmers reporting losses as high as 80   According to the USDA  New Yorks honey production dropped last year to 3 84 million pounds of honey  12  less than the 4 38 million pounds it produced in 2005  New Yorks bee colonies themselves are also producing less  with their honey yield per colony plummeting 12  from 2005 to 64 pounds in 2006   These severe losses are in addition to other problems such as higher production costs  mite infestations and unfairly traded imports that have been making it very difficult for beekeepers to operate profitably  If these alarming trends are allowed to continue  they will place at risk in excess of  14 billion in annual United States farm output that depends on bee pollination  Ultimately  the shortage of pollination services could impact the supply of healthful and affordable food for U S  consumers   America s beekeepers and their bees are an indispensable pillar of U S  agriculture  Our nation s beekeepers provide essential pollination services for over 90 different food  seed and fiber crops  contributing over  14 billion of added agricultural value as documented by a Cornell University study in 2000  Crops that depend upon or benefit from honey bee pollination include alfalfa  almonds  apples  avocados  blueberries  cantaloupes  carrots  cherries  citrus  cotton  cranberries  kiwis  plums  pumpkins  seed crops  soybeans  squash  sunflowers and watermelons   Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee  it will be sent to the Senate floor  Following approval by the Senate  the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature
