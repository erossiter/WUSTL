IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 3  2005 Schumer Graham Announce Bipartisan Bill To Level Playing Field On China Trade                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    New Tough Approach to Force China to Stop Currency Manipulation or Risk Being Slapped with Large Tariffs on its Exports As China continues to peg its currency and the US trade deficit with China reaches record levels  a bipartisan group of lawmakers comprised of US Senators Charles Schumer  D NY  and Lindsey Graham  R SC  today unveiled new legislation  to impose an across the board tariff on Chinese imports in an effort to reduce China s unfairly undervalued currency advantage  The Senators said the Chinese undervaluation of its Yuan has played a major role in the loss of 3 million US manufacturing jobs over the last five years and is contributing to the migration of service and engineering jobs to China        The Chinese want to have it both ways  On one hand they want free trade and want membership in the WTO and other international trade organizations  But on the other hand  they don t want to play by the rules of those organizations  The Chinese actions endanger American and world commitment to free trade and weaken the support in Congress for free trade   Schumer said   This legislation is a tough love effort to get the Chinese to stop playing games with their currency in order to level the playing field for American companies trying to compete with goods and service coming from China        Specifically  the bill allows for a 180 day negotiation period between the US and China to revalue its currency  if the negotiations are not successful  a temporary across the board tariff of 27 5  will be applied to all Chinese products entering the United States   a penalty that corresponds to their estimated currency advantage  Since economists estimate that China undervalues its currency between 15 percent and 40 percent  27 5  represents the midpoint range  Furthermore  if the President determines that at the end of the negotiation period that China has developed and started actual implementation of a plan to revalue its currency  he may delay imposition of the tariff for another 12 months       The Yuan    sometimes known as renminbi    has been tightly pegged to the U S  dollar since 1994  approximately 8 28 Yuan to the dollar   During that period of time  China  s economy has grown dramatically  averaging over 8  per year  If China  s currency freely floated in the market  as is the case with virtually all major world currencies  it would have appreciated substantially reflecting China s underlying economic strength  However  it has remained at the same pegged value  and the result is that many economists estimate that the yuan is now undervalued by between 15 and 40 percent       China  s currency  the Yuan or renminbi  has been tightly pegged to the U S  dollar since 1994 at a rate of approximately 8 28 Yuan to the dollar  During the past ten years  China  s economy has grown dramatically  In 2004  China  s GDP growth was approximately 9 5   and has averaged over 8  per annually for the past two decades        Because China continues to peg its currency  in 2004 we saw record trade deficits with China  Last November it was reported that our trade deficit with China grew by 25 percent  This number represents one quarter of our national trade deficit  Today  China  s foreign reserves are estimated to be over  609 billion  The trade deficit numbers will be released on Monday  February 7th and are expected to be closer to  650 billion       As the United States largest export industry  manufacturing has felt the impact of the Yuan  s undervaluation most dramatically  The United States has lost close to 3 million manufacturing jobs   90 percent of all the jobs lost in the last five years  New York alone has lost approximately 100 000 manufacturing jobs        In order to hold the value of the Yuan within its tight and artificial trading band  the Chinese government has intervened in its foreign exchange markets  The practice of   currency manipulation    to gain a trade or competitive advantage violates World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund agreements  of which China is now party  China  s emergence as a manufacturing powerhouse at the expense of the United States raises significant economic security concerns and the question of whether a country that loses its ability to produce tangible products will long remain an economic power
