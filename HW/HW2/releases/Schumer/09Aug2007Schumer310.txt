IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 9  2007 Under Pressure From Schumer  NYISO Finally Takes First Step In Clearing Chautauqua County Energy Project That Could Lower Local Property Taxes And Spur Local Economic Development                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In Response to Senator s Letter  NYISO   After Failing to Take Action for Over 3 Months   Approves Application for Chautauqua Project that Will Harness 6 4  Mega Watts of Methane Fueled Power from Landfill and Connect it to the Electrical Grid    The County Plans to Use the Estimated  2 Million in Annual Profits to Reduce Property Taxes and the Excess Energy to Lure New Businesses     Schume Afterpressuring the New York Independent System Operator  NYISO  to speed up the approval process for Chautauqua Countys long standing application to connect a new 6 4 Mega Watt methane to energy generating facility to the electrical grid  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced in response to his efforts thelog jam has been broken and theapplication has cleared a key hurdle  Forthreemonths the NYISO had dragged its heels in approving theproject s feasibility study The project  based out of a landfill in Chautauqua County is focused on building a renewable energy plant that willgenerate revenueto lowerlocal property taxes andalso provideeconomic developmentopportunitiesin the region   Today  Schumer announced that the project had mounted a major hurdle  freeing it to move forwardonto thenext steps of the application   Im thrilled that the NYISO heard our voice and realized the tremendous economic benefits the project will deliver to Chautauqua County residents  said Senator Schumer  This project will usher in lower property taxes for residents and attract new businesses to the region  This facility is exemplary of the kind of creative solution New York needs at a time when our state is crunched for energy    The Senator s efforts have once again been instrumental in helping our County move forward on our landfill gas to electric project  said Chautauqua County Greg Edwards  I look forward to his support in seeing this project through to completion   The new generation facility proposed by Chautauqua County seeks to harness methane discharge from the local landfill and establish an interconnection node that will put this power into grids administered by both New York State Electric and Gas and National Grid  This project has the dual benefit of harnessing a potentially harmful emission and increasing the power supply in Western New York  while providing a potential benefit to businesses and consumers   NYISO isresponsible for coordinating the interconnection of generatingfacilities tothe electrical grid  Althoughtheygenerally perform apreliminary review within 30 days  no action hadbeen taken nearly 11 weeks after the application was submitted The agency sfailure to actthreatened to jeopardize a potential economic juggernaut for the region that that will bringinan estimated  8 000 a day in profits or 2 million in profitsa year which the county will use to reduce local property taxes  The facility will also generate excess steam and heat which the county plans on using to lure new businesses to the region  However  NYISO had failed to act onthe first part ofChautauqua Countys application  leading to onerous delays preventing the County from reaping the benefits of this project  NYISOs preliminary review of the application is just the first of a several step process before the Chautauqua County is able to have a fully operational facility In a scoping meeting on Tuesday of this week  officials from NYISO  National Grid and the Chautauqua Methane project assessedthe feasibility study and forged an agreement for the System Impact Study  Under NYISO rules the agency has 5 business days to issue an agreement that lays out their next step  theSystem Impact Study Agreement laying   After Tuesday  following the sign off by participating parties  there are 3 more steps before the projects completion  First the signing of the System Impact Study Agreementstarts a 45business dayperiodduring which the System Impact Study isundertaken After this is completed another scoping meeting is heldwhere all the partiesdiscuss andsign off on the results The completion of this step triggers a Facility Studywhich mustalso be completed within 45 business days Once all the parties sign off onthis finalstudy  construction of the plantcan commence    Make no mistake about it there are still a number of hurdles to clear and I ll be staying on top of this project to make sure there are no more delays  added Schumer
