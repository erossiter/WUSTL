                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Lacking Access to Nutritious Food  Over 50  of Adult NYers are Overweight and 1 3rd of NYC Children are Expected to Develop Type 2 Diabetes   Federal Funds Will Be Used By the Council on the Environment of New York City to Evaluate Whether Food Stamp Recipients Shop at the City  s Farmers Markets                                                                                                U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced that the Council on the Environment of New York City will receive  66 000 to encourage New York food stamp recipients to purchase nutritious vegetables and produce from the city  s farmers markets  Over the past two years  food stamp recipients have been able to pay for goods at the city  s farmer markets using their Electronic Benefits Transfer  EBT  cards  Payments are made through handheld devices called wireless EBT processing terminals which directly transfer money from the customer  s Food Stamp account to the farmer  s account  The United States Department of Agricultural  USDA  grant will go towards evaluating the performance of the recently installed payment processing technology and gage its effectiveness on encouraging food stamp recipients to shop at the city  s farmers markets          The recent rise of affordable and nutritious farmers markets across the city is a ray of hope     said Senator Schumer    This money will go towards examining the best way those with limited means can take advantage of their local farmers markets            After printed food stamps were replaced with Electronic Benefits Transfer  EBT  cards in 2004  food stamp recipients were unable to use their EBT cards to shop at the city  s farmers markets which lacked the necessary technology for EBT card processing  As a result  food stamp recipients were denied access to a valuable source for fresh and affordable produce        The introduction of wireless EBT terminals lets food stamp recipients use their cards to purchase fresh produce at farmers markets that lack standard EBT equipment  Markets without the standard EBT equipment now use handheld  battery operated units which transfer money from the customer  s Food Stamp account directly to the farmer  s bank account  This recently incorporated technology lets New York  s working class families once again take advantage of the city  s farmers markets   affordable and healthy produce  In addition  food stamp recipients give local farmers a larger customer base        According to a 2005 report issued by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  DOHMH   approximately one million New Yorkers are obese and more than half of the city  s adults  53   are overweight or obese  The report documents a direct correlation between neighborhoods that eat the least amount of produce and neighborhoods with the highest rates of obesity  The city  s high rate of obesity is cited for the sharp increase in the number of city children developing Type 2 diabetes  According to DOHMH  24  of all children between the ages of six and eleven are considered obese and one in three is expected to develop diabetes in his or her lifetime       New York City  s children are not evenly affected by diabetes  with the most commonly afflicted children being poor  obese and from ethnic groups that carry the potential to develop diabetes at lower weights  Low income neighborhoods offer easy access to unhealthy snacks and beverages while too often forcing parents to travel great distances to supply their families with fresh produce         The mounting diabetes epidemic is a financial and health care nightmare for all New Yorkers     said Senator Schumer    Every year  more and more of our health care services are donated to fighting this insidious disease  Fighting diabetes while supporting our local farms is a no brainer     added Schumer        The Council on the Environment of New York City  CENYC   a privately funded citizens  organization in the Office of the Mayor  manages the Greenmarket program which is devoted to starting the city  s farmers markets  Greenmarket assists farmers and preserves farmland by offering regional family farmers the option to sell produce to New Yorkers  Greenmarket operates 45 markets locations in the five boroughs       The grant falls under the USDA  s Farmers Market Promotion Program  FMPP  and is designed to increase the consumption of fresh fruits  vegetables and other agricultural products while supporting local farmers
