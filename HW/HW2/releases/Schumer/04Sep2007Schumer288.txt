IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 4  2007 Schumer Grills DOT Over Airspace Redesign Plan   Demands Sufficient Answers To Westchester And Rockland Concerns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Schumer Issues 7 Questions to the DOT Concerning New Flight Patterns over Rockland and Westchester Counties   Including How Routes were Selected and Whether Alternative Routes Were Given Short Shrift Airspace Redesign Plan Set to go into Effect As Early As September will Bring an Increase in Air Traffic Over Sections of Westchester and Rockland Counties Schumer  It s Essential that the FAA Properly Address Local Concerns before Implementing Final Redesign Plan Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer demanded that the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  adequately address concerns raised by Rockland and Westchester county residents on how the new Airspace Redesign Plan will affect the regions quality of life  While the plan is designed to reduce plane congestion in the Tri state area  it creates new flight paths for aircrafts over Rockland and Westchester counties which are expected to usher in a spike in noise and pollution over residential neighborhoods    Schumer today called the FAAs plan premature and issued 7 questions to the agency that he said would address issues and concerns raised by local residents  In addition  Schumer  in his letter to Transportation Secretary Mary Peters  blasted the FAA for failing to hold additional meetings despite repeated requests by local residents and leaders    Plain and simple  this plan is premature because it fails to properly address valid concerns raised by Westchester and Rockland county residents  said Senator Schumer  I expect the DOT to answer the questions I issued today in a timely and sufficient manner so local residents can have more confidence that the agency is taking their concerns into consideration   The FAA Final Environmental Impact Statement  FEIS  for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area is the first airspace redesign project for the region in nearly 50 years  The FAAs goal is to achieve the highest levels of safety and the most efficient airspace design for customer operations by reviewing and reworking domestic and oceanic airspace  The final version of this study has been delivered to the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  and was officially published in the Federal Register Friday  August 3    Upon this publication NEPA requires that a 30 day comment period be held for those affected by the plan to voice all remaining concerns  As the final step in the NEPA process  the FAA will release a Record of Decision  ROD  which includes issues raised during the comment period  Implementation of the redesign plan may begin once the ROD is released    Limited analysis by Westchester County indicates there will be significant noise increases throughout Westchester  particularly in Yonkers  Hawthorne  Thornwood  Peekskill  North Salem  Pound Ridge and Chappaqua  Though the county was able to submit comments on two separate occasions  it has repeatedly asked for additional data to continue its analysis only to receive it at the eleventh hour  or not at all    The FAAs plan includes a new flight path over Rockland County to handle Newark Liberty International Airport arrivals  potentially leading to an average of 600 flights flying over the county each day  The majority of the flights would travel in a corridor which runs between Suffern and Hillcrest and includes Wesley Hills  Montebello  Kaser  Monsey  Chestnut Ridge and Pearl River  Local residents are concerned that with planes flying as low as 6 000 8 000 feet above the ground  communities in Ramapo and Orangetown will experience a significant rise in noise levels  Many people believe that having so many planes flying overhead could lead to an overall reduction in the quality of life    Schumer today wrote to Transportation Secretary Mary Peters expressing serious concern about the impacts that the Airspace Redesign Plan will have on Westchester and Rockland Counties  While Schumer has long called for the FAA to alleviate airport congestion with a congestion mitigation plan and through the recruitment of additional air traffic controllers  today he wrote  I am seriously concerned  however  with some of the recommendations found in the FAAs Final Environmental Impact Statement  FEIS     Schumer believes that the FAA has not adequately taken into account the concerns of residents in Westchester and Rockland Counties regarding the effects that the proposed changes will have on their overall quality of life and the areas natural environment  Schumer demanded that the concerns be addressed prior to the implementation of the Airspace Redesign Plan  and issued the following 7 questions   1  Did planners consider raising the altitude ceiling over Rockland and Westchester Counties to mitigate increased noise   2  How is the FAA incorporating continuous descent approach patterns into the requirements over Rockland and Westchester Counties as a way to decrease noise pollution for local residents   3  When exploring options for the flight path over Rockland County  why didnt the planners develop a flight pattern to the west in order to minimize the impact to local communities  How did planners decide that the current Rockland flight path provides the minimal negative impact on the environment and quality of life for local residents  What are the relative costs and benefits of a more westerly flight pattern    4  What direct outreach was done to residents in Westchester and Rockland Counties to make them aware of the increase in noise  pollution  and planes flying overhead  Were notices mailed directly to residents clearly explaining how the Airspace Redesign would affect them Were public notices posted in local newspapers and with local municipal governments  If not  why   5  How did planners study the option of routing flights over the Long Island Sound  Given the obvious lower impacts on various communities  why wasnt this chosen as the best alternative   6  How was the allocation of additional resources to hire more air traffic controllers considered as a way to alleviate air congestion  Why wasnt this used as an alternative   7  What did planners conclude regarding the option of flight patterns along the Hudson River     After multiple requests to the FAA  the agency has repeatedly failed to acknowledge the concerns of residents in communities adversely affected by the Airspace Redesign Plan It is my hope  on behalf of the residents of Rockland and Westchester counties  that these questions are answered before any implementation  added Schumer   Schumer has repeatedly called on the FAA to ensure that local concerns are adequately expressed and considered in the Airspace Redesign Project  In early July  he sent a letter to FAA Administrator Marion Blakey to schedule additional meetings in the New York metropolitan area in order to hear the concerns of local residents  In his letter he expressed that he understood that the priority of the redesign project was efficiency  but that the FAA could not overlook the fact that increased efficiency and increased traffic would mean an increase in air traffic noise and pollution for many communities in Rockland Counties   In July of this year  Schumer called for Blakey s resignation due to her inability to effectively lead the FAA  Today  Schumer wrote to Secretary Peters in an attempt to secure firm leadership and hard answers on this aviation related issue
