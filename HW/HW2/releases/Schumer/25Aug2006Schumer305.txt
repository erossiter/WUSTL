IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 25  2006 Schumer Visits Maybrook Fire Department To Launch Effort To Save Federal Fire Grant Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Grant Program Has Sent Orange County Fire Departments Over  2 Million Since 2001    But Program Now Slated To Be Gutted   Assistance To Firefighters Grants Fund Life Saving Equipment And Training     Schumer To Detail Plan To Restore Full Funding   Senator Joined By Maybrook Fire Chief Charles Woznick  Deputy Chair of Fire Commission Matt Thorp  Montgomery Town Supervisor Susan Coc New York fire departments could lose out on  31 million for equipment  training  and vehicles under a new federal budget proposal  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today  Schumer unveiled his grassroots plan to restore full funding for Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  also known as FIRE grants  that has provided fire departments throughout New York  102 million since it began in 2001 but is now slated for severe cuts   Since 2001  Orange County fire departments have received over  2 million from the critical program   The Maybrook Fire Department has received  91 200 which it used to purchase equipment         New York  s firefighters risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe and sound     Schumer said    We must do everything we can to give them the tools they need to protect us and keep our communities safe  We funded this bill because it can cost over  4 000 just to outfit a firefighter and up to  500 000 for a modern fire truck  People in small towns and big towns deserve the most modern firefighting equipment  We need to restore funding to this program and I m going to fight to make sure we do just that            Schumer is touring fire houses across the state and meeting with fire chiefs to drum up support for the FIRE grants program and highlight the specific needs of Upstate New York fire departments   At Schumer s urging  fire departments across New York have taken advantage of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  and used funds for specialized emergency response training  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  new fire trucks  and fire prevention programs  These grants are distributed through the Department of Homeland Security  s Office of Domestic Preparedness and are a main component of the federal government  s efforts to aid local first responders        For Fiscal Year 2007  Congress has authorized  1 billion for the program   707 million more than the  293 million included in the Administration  s budget proposal  The Administration  s proposal of only  293 million is 46  less than last year  s appropriation of  542 million  Schumer said that if the federal government fails to fully fund the authorization  the impact on already crunched local fire department budgets in New York will be exacerbated dramatically next year  If these cuts are approved  Orange County fire departments could lose  550 000 next year       Because of its dramatic success in improving fire safety  Congress has raised the amount of money authorized for the program from  100 million for FY2001 to  950 million in FY 2006 and  1 billion in FY 2007  The program has been consistently underfunded  getting only  542 million in FY 2006   This is the third year in a row that the Administration has proposed cutting the program  Last year the Administration proposed cutting the program to  500 million from  650 million in FY 2005  Congress restored funding to  542 million  but this still fell short of the  950 million authorized for FY2006        In response  Schumer is launching a grassroots campaign  sending petitions to every fire department in the state  asking firefighters to join his call to restore funding   Schumer said since this is a program that puts life saving equipment in the hands of first responders  mobilizing firefighters across the state could be an effective way to show how critical these grants are to localities that need them         Schumer also joined with Senate colleagues in supporting an amendment to the Budget that would increase funding for the FIRE grants program  Senator Schumer and some of his colleagues sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee asking for full funding of the Assistance to Firefighter Grant program   Both the House and Senate Homeland Security Appropriations committees increased funding for the program to  655 million for FY07 up from the President  s Budget request of  293 450 000  The bill is expected to go to the House Senate Conference Committee in the next few months  where Schumer will fight for full funding to the authorized level       Schumer helped create the original Grants to Firefighters Program  co sponsoring legislation in 2001 that led to its establishment  This program was passed with bi partisan support including Senator Chris Dodd  D CT   Senator John McCain  R AZ   Senator Susan Collins  R ME   and many others   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program was established to provide funding to career and volunteer fire departments and non affiliated emergency medical services providers to help with the rising costs of equipment  vehicles and training  However  soon after the program  s establishment  Schumer played a central role in preventing the Bush Administration from eliminating funding for the program from the 2001 budget  Schumer also co sponsored the 2004 re authorization  which set full funding levels for the program at  1 billion in FY 2007
