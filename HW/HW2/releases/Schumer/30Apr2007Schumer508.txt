IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 30  2007 Schumer Reveals  Prostate Cancer A Growing Epidemic For Thousands Of African American Male New Yorkers    126  More Likely To Die From Cancer Than City s Caucasian Men                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Combination of Costly Examinations and a Lack of Access to Screenings Leaves NYC African American Men 82  More Likely to Develop Prostate Cancer and 126   More Likely to Die from it than City s Caucasian Population   Schumer to Stand with Prostate Cancer Survivor to Push Bill to Thwart this Eminently Treatable Cancer by Funding Free Screenings and Treatment for All Men Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that prostate cancer  a highly treatable disease  is a growing and lethal epidemic for thousands of New York City African American men  leaving them 126  more likely to die from the cancer than the city s Caucasian male population  Concerned that a lack of affordable screenings and treatment for African American males is largely to blame for their unnecessarily high prostate cancer fatality rate  Senator Schumer  visiting the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention in Harlem  announced that he will introduce the Thomas J  Manton Prostate Cancer Treatment bill to fund affordable treatment and free screenings for uninsured men  Schumer also released a new analysis detailing the alarming prevalence of prostate cancer throughout the city s African American neighborhoods         It is wholly unacceptable that our city s uninsured African American men lack access to free prostate cancer screening and treatment  and are left to shoulder a disproportionate number of fatalities from it   said Senator Schumer   It s high time that every man  regardless of their race  receives the quality health care he needs to catch cancer early on and have every chance to beat it         No one should die of prostate cancer just because they are poor and uninsured   said Dr  Harold Freeman  President and Medical Director of the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention        According to American Cancer Society projections  234 460 men were expected to develop prostate cancer in 2006  and each year approximately 30 000 American men die of prostate cancer  The national annual incidence rate for prostate cancer from 2000 to 2003 was 170 3   meaning that for every 100 000 American males  slightly more than 170 were diagnosed with the cancer       The incidence rate for African American males  however  is an astonishing 258 3    meaning that for every 100 000 African American males  slightly more than 258 were diagnosed with the cancer  Between 1999 and 2003  the national annual death rate from prostate cancer per 100 000 individuals was 65 1 for blacks and 26 7 for whites  Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for the nation s African American male population and will cause an estimated 4 240 fatalities in 2007        In New York City between 1999 and 2003  the New York State Department of Health estimates that an average of 5 000 new diagnoses and 790 deaths are attributable to prostate cancer each year  One in four African American men in New York City will develop prostate cancer in his lifetime  a rate that is 60  higher than the general population  Schumer revealed that the city s African American population is 82  more likely to develop the cancer and 126  more likely to die from it than the city s Caucasian population         Even though annual testing for prostate cancer is recommended for all African American men over the age of forty  in New York City thousands of men fail to receive the annual examinations  A lack of access coupled with the high cost of screening and treatment prevent many African American men from receiving crucial services  leaving them vulnerable to a cancer that  if untreated  can quickly evolve into lethal  advanced stages        Schumer today revealed neighborhood specific incidence and mortality data provided by the New York State Department of Health  The neighborhoods with the highest incidence and mortality tend to have the city s largest African American populations  Brooklyn has the highest number of incidence and mortality case in the city with 1 550 new cases of prostate cancer and 239 deaths  East Flatbush   Flatbush neighborhoods  which are 80  African American  have the borough s highest average number of cases a year with 290  Bedford Stuyvesant   Crown Heights neighborhoods  which are 77  African American  have the borough s highest annual incidence rate and mortality rate per 100 000 with 280 and 56  The neighborhood also has the highest number of annual deaths from prostate cancer with 41       The Bronx has the highest annual incidence and mortality rates of any borough  189 men were diagnosed per 100 000 residents  and 37 men died of prostate cancer per 100 000 residents  Northeast Bronx  neighborhood  which is 58  African American  has the borough s second highest number of annual cases with 170 and highest number of fatalities with 29  Queens has 1 350 annual prostate cancer cases and 193 fatalities a year  It has incidence and mortality rates of 143 and 23 per 100 000 residents The Jamaica  Queens neighborhood  which is 60  African American  has the borough s highest annual number of cases and fatalities per year with 227 and 35 The Southeast Queens neighborhood  which is 55  African American  has highest annual incidence and mortality rates per 100 000 residents with 266 and 43   Manhattan  Borough wide it has 1 043 annual prostate cases and 180 fatalities per year  It has incidence and mortality rates of 160 and 33 per 100 000 residents  Central Harlem   Morningside Heights neighborhood has the borough s highest incidence and mortality rates per 100 000 residents with 205 and 54     In an effort to inoculate and arm all New York City s African American men against prostate cancer  Senator Schumer today announced that he will introduce the Thomas J  Manton Prostate Cancer Early Detection and Treatment Act of 2007  The bill  named in honor of Queens native and former U S  Representative Thomas Manton  who succumbed to prostate cancer earlier this year  will provide federal funding for both prostate cancer screening and treatment for low and moderate income men         Modeled after the successful National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program  NBCCEDP   the Thomas Manton bill will            Provide grants to states to fund prostate cancer screenings  The average cost of a prostate cancer screening is currently  26          Provide an enhanced Medicaid matching rate to any state that elects to add Medicaid coverage for prostate cancer treatment for men who have been screened through the Thomas Manton program         Authorize funding for additional grant programs that would allow low and moderate income men to be screened for other health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease       Senator Schumer noted that his bill will create a brand new program for prostate cancer screening and will not dilute the funding available for the already successful breast and cervical programs  The Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 authorized the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  to create a national program ensuring that under  or uninsured women between the ages of 40 and 64 receive regular screening tests for breast and cervical cancer in addition to any necessary follow up treatment  Since its inception in 1991  the NBCCEDP has provided over 4 6 million screening exams which have lead to over 18 000 cancer diagnoses  In New York  in addition to the actual screening  follow up  and case management  the NBCCEDP includes professional education for health professionals  public education and outreach promoting breast and cervical cancer screening  and media campaigns        Over the past several years  Senator Schumer has actively advocated for increased funding for prostate cancer research within the Department of Defense s  DOD  Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program   Prostate cancer research within this program currently receives  85 million a year        The screening process for prostate cancer consists of two complementary procedures  both of which are very simple and can be easily administered in the comfort of a physician s office   The first involves a routine blood test for prostate specific antigen  PSA   a protein whose presence  in elevated levels  is indicative of a malfunctioning prostate   In the second test  known as the digital rectal exam  DRE   the prostate is physically probed for abnormalities suggestive of cancer   Experts recommend men over 50 should have both a PSA and a DRE yearly  though those at high risk should begin being tested as early as 45        Senator Schumer was joined by Dr  Harold Freeman  President and Medical Director of the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention in Harlem  Darryl Mitteldorf  Chairperson of the New York State Prostate Cancer Coalition and Executive Director of the leading national nonprofit prostate cancer support group organization  Malecare  and Winston Dyer  a longtime advocate for prostate cancer screening and a representative for Men s Health Network
