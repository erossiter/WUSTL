                                           Senator Explains How Confusing Drug Plan Demonstrates Need For Complete Overhaul of Medicare Drug Plan     Plans Are So Complicated  Even Albert Einstein Couldn  t Figure Them Out      Schumer To Release Number of Medicare Recipients In Each County Eligible for Drug Plan  Medicare Enrollees in Capital Region 162 000  153 000 in Central New York  339 000 Hudson Valley  90 000 North County  189 000 in Rochester Across upstate New York  1 3 million seniors are eligible for the new Medicare prescription drug plan  but because it is so complicated  many are unable to make an informed decision  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer said today  With enrollment set to begin this week  Schumer will call on Congress to pass legislation to give seniors an additional six months to make an informed decision  Without any changes to current law  seniors will face a stiff late enrollment penalty if they enroll in a plan after May 15  2006  The Medicare Informed Choice Act of 2005 will extend the enrollment period until the end of 2006 so seniors who need more time will not be penalized         These plans are so complicated  and the options so varied  that Albert Einstein couldn  t understand them     Schumer said    Instead of giving seniors easy options for low cost drugs  the Administration has created a Wild West of drug plans  and seniors who make the wrong choice in plans will be robbed          Schumer said today that for seniors with multiple drugs  trying to understand which plans cover all of their drugs  and the different kinds of cost sharing that will be required for drugs that are placed on different tiers within a plan  will be nearly impossible            In the Capital Region there are 162 000 Medicare enrollees eligible for the prescription drug benefit  An estimated 74 000 don  t even know there are penalties for late enrollment  59 000 don  t plan on enrolling at all  and only 22 000 have called or visited Medicare on the web            In Central New York there are 153 000 Medicare enrollees eligible for the prescription drug benefit  An estimated 70 000 don  t even know there are penalties for late enrollment  56 000 don  t plan on enrolling at all  and only 21 000 have called or visited Medicare on the web             In the Hudson Valley  there are 339 000 Medicare enrollees eligible for the prescription drug benefit  An estimated 156 000 don  t even know there are penalties for late enrollment  125 000 don  t plan on enrolling at all  and only 47 000 have called or visited Medicare on the web            In the North Country  there are 90 000 Medicare enrollees eligible for the prescription drug benefit  An estimated 41 000 don  t even know there are penalties for late enrollment  33 000 don  t plan on enrolling at all  and only 26 000 have called or visited Medicare on the web            In the Rochester Finger Lakes region  there are 189 000 Medicare enrollees eligible for the prescription drug benefit  An estimated 87 000 don  t even know there are penalties for late enrollment  70 000 don  t plan on enrolling at all  and only 26 000 have called or visited Medicare on the web            In the Southern Tier  there are 117 000 Medicare enrollees eligible for the prescription drug benefit  An estimated 117 000 don  t even know there are penalties for late enrollment  54 000 don  t plan on enrolling at all  and only 16 000 have called or visited Medicare on the web            In Western New York  there are 270 000 Medicare enrollees eligible for the prescription drug benefit  An estimated 124 000 don  t even know there are penalties for late enrollment  100 000 don  t plan on     enrolling at all  and only 37 000 have called or visited Medicare on the web       The Medicare Informed Choice Act of 2005  S  1841   co sponsored by Senators Schumer  Bill Nelson  FL  and Dick Durbin  IL  provides additional protections for Medicare beneficiaries during the first year of the program s implementation  Adding time and flexibility to the Medicare prescription drug benefit  this piece of legislation would delay late enrollment penalties and give every beneficiary a chance to change plans once during the first year  By enacting this bill  Senator Schumer believes we can make sure seniors are not forced to make hasty decisions they may later regret        According to the Kaiser Family Foundation  KFF  and the Harvard School of Public Health  61  of seniors report that they don  t understand the drug benefit and 43  haven  t figured out whether or not to sign up  One of the only comprehensible ways to decipher the plans is located on the Medicare gov website  But according to KFF  only 6  of seniors have ever visited the site  and 76  of seniors have never used the Internet at all       For example  for a senior who lives in Syracuse and takes five commonly prescribed drugs  the Medicare website returns 44 different plans that range in annual costs from  2 300 to  11 000  Estimated co pay ranges are from  0  250  estimated drug premium ranges from  9 to  85  and the monthly cost share  which is the payment after meeting the deductible  ranges from  125 to  872        Seniors who do not decide on a plan quickly could be penalized heavily if they ever choose a Medicare drug plan in the future  Medicare recipients must join by May 15  2006  or else wait until November 15  2006 to enroll  For those who join late  premiums will go up 1  per month for every month they wait after the deadline  Like other insurance  enrollees will have to pay this penalty as long as they have Medicare prescription drug coverage  If seniors join by December 31  2006  coverage will begin January 1  2007       For seniors who are eligible for extra financial help  the forms are so long  intrusive  and confusing that many people in New York think it  s a scam and don  t want to fill it out  forgoing potential savings         This is just way too confusing  This bill is one of the great government fiascos of the 21st Century  We need to tear up this plan and put a real plan into effect that helps seniors  not the pharmaceutical industry  Seniors need   the Cliff Notes for these choices not the Encyclopedia Britannica     Schumer concluded       This is not the only flaw in the Medicare prescription drug program  which is also prevented from negotiating prescription drug prices using bulk orders like the Veteran  s Administration does to save billions of dollars        Senator Schumer is a member of the Senate Finance Committee that oversees Social Security and Medicare  and is the author of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001 with Senator John McCain  R AZ   The Act enabled generic drugs to be brought to market sooner  and lowered the cost of prescriptions for millions of American seniors       Click here to
