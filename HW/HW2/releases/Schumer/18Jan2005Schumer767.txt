IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 18  2005 With Hepatitis C Dramatically Growing On Long Island  Schumer Lays Out Plan To Stop It In Its Tracks

                                   New Nassau and Suffolk data shows growing prevalence of Hepatitis C on Long Island    over 11 000 current cases   could pose a greater threat than the emergence of HIV two decades ago   Old blood transfusions  shared needles  tattoos and body piercing seen as causes  Standing with Nassau and Suffolk Health Commissioners  Schumer outlines bipartisan multi point plan to vastly expand funding and rese Armed with new data showing that Hepatitis C is becoming a major health crisis on Long Island  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today joined the Nassau County Health Commissioner Dr  David M  Ackman  and Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr  Brian L  Harper at the Nassau County Department of Health to outline a plan to fight the disease  including the shared needles from the increasingly popular drug crystal meth  as well as the tattoos  body piercing  and unprotected sex that cause the spread of the disease         Twenty years ago  when HIV AIDS was first rearing its ugly head  our health care policy in reaction was to was to stick our collective heads in the sand  and we  re still paying the price for not doing what we should have to stop that epidemic in its tracks     Schumer said    Now we  re seeing the early warning signs from health experts that Hepatitis C could quite possibly become the AIDS of the 21st century  If one good thing could ever come out of our nation  s early AIDS ignorance  it  s that maybe the next time such an ugly epidemic appears on the horizon  we  ll move fast to stop it instead of vainly hoping the inevitable never occurs          Like Hepatitis A and B  Hepatitis C is a member of a family of infectious viruses that attack the liver  Like Hepatitis A and B  Hepatitis C can be effectively controlled when detected early  Unlike Hepatitis A and B  Hepatitis C infections are not preventable through vaccines  And because Hepatis C can cause irrevocable liver damage  and experts fear a shortage of liver transplants in future years to help patients who have the disease        While hepatitis C infections on Long Island still do not approach those in New York City  experts testifying before a New York State Assembly Health Committee hearing a week and a half ago predicted a tidal wave of infections that is going to hit in 2015 to 2020  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that within a decade there will be a 279 percent increase in the incidence of liver damage nationwide due to hepatitis C  a 528 percent increase in the need for transplants and a 223 percent increase in the liver related death rate       According to the Suffolk County Department of Health  Suffolk County has identified approximately 7 000 residents as having hepatitis C  Suffolk receives approximately 200 hepatitis C reports per week  While some of these are repeat reports  hepatitis C is Suffolk  s most common infectious disease identified through laboratory reporting  The Nassau County Department of Health reported 4 364 cases of chronic hepatitis C in 2004        According to health experts  the true number of Long Islanders infected with the hepatitis C is far higher than current statistics show  More than 90 percent of Hepatitis C infections do not display symptoms  The incubation period ranges from 2 weeks to 6 months  most commonly 6 9 weeks   and the great majority of the people who have hepatitis C are unaware they are infected for many years  Chronic infection may persist for greater than 20 years before the onset of evidence of the hepatis C like cirrhosis or hepatoma  The overwhelming majority of Long Island cases were first identified in asymptomatic individuals who were attempting to donate blood or applying for life insurance policies        Because of the long incubation period and lack of overt symptoms for hepatis C and because the federal government has only recently started focusing in earnest on the disease and required centralized reports of the disease  s incidences  health experts still do not fully understand transmission of Hepatitis C  While it is known that the disease is spread through shared intravenous drug needles  unsanitary tattoo needles  and unclear body piercing equipment  the incidence is also very high among nasal cocaine users who deny intravenous drug use  New York health experts that Schumer  s office has consulted hypothesized that this may be because microscopic drops of blood may be inhaled off of shared straws used to snort drugs  It may also be because crystal meth  cocaine  and other drug users may not remember that they engaged in at risk activities like unprotected sex acts that they performed while high  And many hepatitis C infections have resulted from blood transfusions in the 1970s  before the virus was screened in the blood supply       As health experts report that Hepatitis C is beginning to pose a a greater threat on Long Island than the emergence of HIV two decades ago  Schumer today proposed a multi point plan for Hepatitis C education and training  surveillance and early detection  and research  Working with Republican Senator Kay Bailey Huchison of Texas and Democratic Senator Edward M  Kennedy of Massachusetts  Schumer will be co sponsoring the Hepatitis C Epidemic Control and Prevention Act  which will       Require the US Department of Health and Human Services to develop and implement a plan for the prevention  control  and management of hepatitis C virus  which will include strategies for education and training  surveillance and early detection  and research  The bill will also require HHS to conduct an assessment of their plan every other year to ensure that it is working and make any required changes       Require the Federal Government to support the development of voluntary State  local  and tribal hepatitis C testing programs and counseling  It will also provide individuals infected with hepatitis C to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B and other infectious diseases        Create shared Hepatis C surveillance databases       Establish a Hepatitis C Clinical Research Network        Direct the National Institutes of Health to establish a Liver Disease Research Advisory Board        In addition  Schumer spoke about his efforts to link HIV AIDS and Hepatitis C  research  Hepatitis C disease trends don  t just mirror AIDS trends  many patients have both hepatitis C and HIV  Some 30  of HIV patients also have hepatitis C  Currently  there s no mechanism to properly coordinate testing  services  and the like  Schumer said today that key players involved in this year s reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act are focusing on linking HCV and AIDS treatments and research       Schumer has a strong record in improving Ryan White  and said today that he would build a similar coalition to try to bring federal action on hepatitis C  In 2003  Schumer introduced an amendment calling for a  215 million increase for AIDS Drug Assistance Program and more money for the rest of the Ryan White CARE Act  In March 2004  in response to a concerted lobbying effort Schumer helped lead  HHS increased the funds for New York City under Title I of the Ryan White CARE Act even as the total amount of funds available nationwide went down  New York received an additional  18 2 million in 2004     122 1 million compared to  103 9 million in 2003  This 18  increase was used for outpatient health care  home health and hospice care  nutrition services  case management  and transportation services for persons with AIDS        Schumer also briefly outlined his efforts to clamp down on crystal meth   a major factor in Hepatitis C growth  Between 1989 1998  there were less than five methamphetamine labs reported in New York State  In 2003 73 methamphetamine labs were reported in New York State  After the President  s inauguration this week  Schumer will re introduce his legislation to make the penalties for selling meth the same as for selling crack cocaine  The bill will make the threshold amounts of meth which trigger tough federal penalties the same as those for crack cocaine  Under current federal law  penalties for drug dealers who sell crack are tough regardless of the purity of the drug  but penalties vary for meth depending on its purity  Dealers who happen to sell meth that is less pure face lower penalties  This endangers local law enforcement who must make more undercover buys before they can make an arrest  It also helps dealers get away with lighter sentences  Under the Schumer bill  all meth and crack cocaine dealers will be treated the same regardless of the purity of the drug  A dealer who sells 50 or more grams of any substance containing a detectable amount of crack now faces a 10 years in jail to life  Someone who sells 5 grams faces a 5 years to 40 years and someone who sells less than 5 grams can face up to 20 years in jail  Schumer s bill matches it for meth       Schumer will also co sponsor the bipartisan Methamphetamine Blister Pack Loophole Elimination Act to close a major loophole that aids meth production  Under current federal law  it is illegal to sell more than 9 grams of any bottled pseudoephedrine product  including cold medicine  at one time    far more than would ever be needed for a bad case of the flu  But current law places no limit on the amount of loose pseudoephedrine tablets which can be individually wrapped in large packages known as  blister packs   As a result  meth manufacturers can buy hundreds of cold medicine pills and combine them with other commonly available ingredients to make meth  This bill simply applies the existing 9 gram limit that is already on bottle pseudoephedrine tablets to blister packs as well        It s 1984 all over again  Twenty years ago  crack was headed east across the United States like a Mack Truck out of control  and AIDS was starting to ravage our communities  Those twin threats slammed New York hard because we just didn t see the warning signs  Well  the headlights are glaring bright off in the distance again  this time with Hepatis C and meth  We are still paying the price of missing the warning signs back then  and if we don t remember our history we will be doomed to repeat it
