                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Provisions Include Major Expansion of MILC Repayment Program and Significant Funds for Specialty Crop Growers Schumer  who Traveled the State Meeting with Agricultural Leaders    Pushed the Northeast Marker Bill to Ensure Unique Issues Facing NYS Farmers were Heard Loud and Clear Schumer  MILC Program and Specially Crop Funding Provisions will Give NYS Farmers a Much Ne Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry Committee finished marking up the much anticipated 2007 Farm Bill and it includes two provisions that benefit New York State farmers  The bill  which is set to move to the Senate floor for debate and a full vote in early November  includes a provision that will greatly expand the MILC program   benefiting the states thousands of dairy farmers  and a provision that would increase funding for the states specialty crop farmers  including farmers of grapes  onions  apples and other fruit and vegetable crops    Schumer spent the last year touring the state and meeting with the agricultural community to hear specific farming concerns  He also pushed his Northeast Marker Bill  which was written to ensure that the unique needs facing the states small farmers were not drowned out by the interests of large  corporate Midwest and Western farms   This bill has two solid provisions that will give the twin pillars of New Yorks farm community  dairy farmers and specialty crop farmers  a much needed shot in the arm  said Senator Schumer  The MILC program  a vital safety net  is vastly expanded over the House version  and specialty crop farmers  like apples and tomatoes and cherries and onions  can expect to receive a windfall in additional funding  Agriculture is the lifeblood of the upstate economy and Congress needs to do everything it can to ensure it stays that way   The Committees mark up is part of Congresss efforts to reauthorize the provisions passed in the 2002 farm bill  which is massive legislation that supports the farming economy across the country  Schumer today said that in years past  the needs of farmers and the agricultural community in the Northeast have been left behind in favor of major agriculture conglomerates in the Midwest and on the West Coast   Under this bill  the fruit and vegetable farmers who are the heart and soul of New Yorks growers are no longer the forgotten orphans of American agricultural policy  This bill is by no means perfect  but I think that its treatment of specialty crops and the MILC program are much better than the 2002 farm bill  or the House version of this years bill  said Senator Schumer   New York State is one of the countrys leading farm states  Agricultural production returned over  3 6 billion to the farm economy in 2005  About 25 percent of the states land area  or 7 55 million acres  is used by the 35 600 farms to produce a diverse array of food products  Milk is New Yorks leading agricultural product and is produced all across the state  Milk sales account for one half of total agricultural receipts  Production in 2005 was 11 7 billion pounds with a preliminary value of  1 91 billion  placing New York as the nations 3rd leading producer   Between 1999 and 2005  cash receipts for farms in upstate New York are up nearly  470 million  Below is how the numbers break out across upstate from   In the Capital Region  cash receipts are up  32 813 000      from  265 830 000 to  298 643 000  There are 3 980 farms      in the region   In Central New York       cash receipts are up  32 163 000 from  312 795 000 to       344 958 000  There are 3 620 farms in the region   In the Rochester   Finger Lakes region  cash      receipts are up  104 874 000 from  603 778 000 to  708 652 000  There      are 5 990 farms in the region   In the Hudson Valley  cash      receipts are up  7 666 000 from  280 945 000 to       288 611 000  There are 3 190 farms in the region   In the North Country       cash receipts are up  97 186 000 from  445 259 000 to       542 445 000  There are 5 125 farms in the region        In the Southern Tier  cash receipts are up  60 388 000      from  358 684 000 to  419 072 000  There are 6 465 farms      in the region   In Western New York       cash receipts are up  134  345 000 from  657 511 000 to       791 856 000  There are 6 535 farms in the region     Today  Schumer hailed two provisions in the freshly marked up 2007 Farm Bill that will benefit New Yorks dairy and specialty crop farmers    First       the marked up bill includes benefits for the states huge dairy industry       The Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program repayment has been raised      from 34  to 45   andthe production cap has been raised from 2 4      million pounds to 4 15 million pounds  The bill protects dairy farmers      when milk prices tumble and increases the amount of milk on which those      subsidies are paid    A farm with approximately 130 cows will produce 2 4 million pounds a year  the new limit will cover production from roughly 225 cows  For farms with more than 4 15 million pounds of production  the first 4 15 million pounds will be covered  The MILC program is a lifeline for thousands of upstate New York dairy farmers when times get tough  For many  it is the difference between staying afloat or sinking when there are sudden drops in milk prices  added Schumer    Specialty      crop farmers  who include grape  onion  and apple farmers can expect to      receive a boost in funding with the bill setting aside  2 2 billion      nationwide over the next five years  The money will be spent on      research to combat pests and disease  marketing assistance  technical      assistance  and shipping improvements  The bill also provides  270      million over 5 years in mandatory funding for block grants to states       which can tailor programs to benefit the specific needs of their      residents  The House version of the farm bill dedicated  1 6 billion      over five years    In December  Schumer called on Senate Agriculture Committee ChairmanTom Harkin to include a permanent extension and expansion of the existing MILC program in the 2007 Farm Bill and include language that would increase the annual production capa plan that could mean millions more in relief for New Yorks dairy farms   On September 19  the Senator sent a joint letter to the Committee asking for increased funding for specialty crops  Specialty crop provisions are a key component in this years reauthorization of farm programs  he wrote  Therefore  we believe very strongly that the next Farm Bill should include provisions to support and enhance this important sector of American agriculture  The Committees mark put money into many of the programs which Senator Schumer identified  including research  marketing  and technical and trade assistance
