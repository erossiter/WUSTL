IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 26  2007 Schumer  Big Mortgage Companies Still Flooding Airwaves With Ads Pushing Deceptive Mortgages to Unsuspecting Consumers  Despite Current Credit Crisis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Major Subprime Mortgage Lenders Still Advertising Misleading and Expensive Loans to New York Homebuyers Prolonging New York and Nationwide Foreclosure Wave Schumer Also Reveals Some Lenders May Be Hiding Behind Obscure Rule Making It Harder for Those Already on Brink of Foreclosure to Refinance Back Breaking Loans With NYC Foreclosures Up 80 Percent Since Febr With the subprime mortgage market in freefall and New York homeowners scrambling to avoid foreclosure  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that major mortgage lenders  some of whom are in bankruptcy themselves  are still constantly advertising and pushing on consumers the very same loans that have brought on the current crisis  Schumer said that banks should not be offering these loans and sucking more New York homebuyers and homeowners in to taking on more debt attached to a sky high interest rate  Subprime loans  made to borrowers with poor and nontraditional credit histories  have wreaked havoc in the mortgage market as higher interest rates have led to rising defaults and delinquencies among borrowers  Schumer also discussed his concern that some lenders may be continuing to hide behind a discredited interpretation ofanaccounting standard known as FAS 140  claiming they can t refinanceor modify mortgages in danger of foreclosure despite being given the exact opposite interpretation by the accounting industrys governing bodies   There mortgage crisis has created a perfect storm for homeowners in New York and across the country  Schumer said  It is inexcusable that lenders are continuing to advertise subprime loans as if everything was hunky dory  Unfortunately  instead of working with endangered homeowners  unscrupulous lenders are going out of their way to push high risk loans and preventing mortgage holders from refinancing  We need all hands on deck to stem the rising tide of foreclosures   Schumer today blasted major mortgage lenders for continuing to advertise deceptive and expensive home loans to homebuyers despite the current credit crisis and the collapse of the subprime mortgage market  Over the past few years  tens of thousands of New Yorkers and millions of Americans have been suckered in to taking our subprime loans  claiming to offer low interests rates  but actually attaching large hidden fees and unexpected interest rate spikes  Now  millions of homeowners are facing interest payments that far exceed their initial required payment and struggling to avoid foreclosure    However  as Schumer revealed today  despite the wave of foreclosures  lenders are still flooding television  newspapers  and the internet with advertisements pushing the very same loans that have caused the current crisis and cost millions of homeowners thousands of dollars and even their homes    For example  AOL com this week  the Internet based loan company LendingTree offered Bad credit options and a  425 000 loan for only  1 376 a month  And   the nation s largest mortgage lender  declared  Bad Credit  Call Today  Refinance or Tap into Your Home s Equity in an online ad from its Full Spectrum Lending Division    Schumer also said that constant television advertising by Countrywide and LendingTree makes no mention of the pitfalls and current dangers of taking out subprime  and variable rate loans  leaving unsuspecting consumers thinking that these loans are still safe to take out  According to the Washington Post  even though dozens of lenders have shut down their mortgage operations or laid off employees  many others are trying to generate interest among potential borrowers even if the companies ultimately cannot qualify them for loans   Schumer today released a new report showing that the same subprime loans that are still being advertised has created an unprecedented surge in home foreclosure that has spread across the country and no reached the New York City area  In New York City alone  according to RealtyTrac com  foreclosure filings are up 80 percent since February  Below is how the statistics break out across the city    Foreclosure filings in the Bronx are up 45 percent over the last six months  from 220 filings in February up to 321 in July    Foreclosure filings in Brooklyn are up 68 percent over the last six months  from 520 filings in February up to 875 in July    Foreclosure filings in Manhattan are up 1050 percent over the last six months  from 22 filings in February up to 321 in July    Foreclosure filings in Queens are up 56 percent over the last six months  from 566 filings in February up to 882 in July    Foreclosure filings in Staten Island are up 142 percent over the last six months  from 95 filings in February up to 230 in July   In addition  Schumer today said that  instead of finding ways to help homeowners on the brink of foreclosure avoid losing their homes  lenders have in the past hid behind a controversial interpretation of an accounting rule  making it much harder for mortgage holders to refinance  The accounting standard  known as FAS 140  was used by lenders to claim that they couldnt refinanceor modify mortgages in danger of foreclosure   In July  both the Financial Auditing Standards Board  which is responsible for issuing the accounting principles used by auditors  and the SEC  which is responsible for enforcing violations of the accounting rules  issued guidance making clear that FAS 140 is not an obstacle to the modification of loans that are near foreclosure  Nonetheless  Schumer said that he remains concerned that FAS 140  among other things  might continue to be used as an excuse to avoid loan modification  and stressed the need for the accounting industry to ensure that its clients were appropriately informed that the accounting rules did not prevent loan modifications for mortgages in danger of foreclosure   The best way to avoid foreclosures is to give homeowners every opportunity possible to refinance and get out from under unexpectedly high mortgage payments  Schumer added  Instead of tying homeowners hands  lenders need to give homeowners as many options as possible to avoid foreclosure   To protect homeowners and ensure that millions more potential buyers avoid getting scammed  Schumer today announced a three point plan to crack down on potentially false advertising by lenders and clear up the accounting rule that may make it harder for homeowners to avoid foreclosure    FTC Advertising Alert  Schumer today called on the Federal Trade Commission to immediately issue a widespread consumer alert to help potential homebuyers avoid misleading advertising and loans  While the FTC is currently investigating subprime mortgage advertising  it has yet to issue a consumer alert advisory and post information on their website to help the average consumer  Schumer said that during the current crisis  consumers need as much information as possible to avoid trouble    Legislation Creating First Ever Standards to Crack Down on Predatory Lenders  Schumer is also the author of the Borrower s Protection Act of 2007  which requires all lenders to register with the federal government and establishes a fiduciary duty for mortgage brokers and other non bank mortgage originators  The bill also creates a faith and fair dealing standard for all originators and for the first time prohibits steering  i e  brokers may not direct or counsel a consumer to rates  charges and principal amount or prepayment terms that are not appropriate or suitable for the them     Call on Lenders to Help Homeowners Refinance  Schumer wrote to the heads of the biggest auditors asking them to inform their clients about rules and opportunities that will help consumers refinance and get out from under high mortgage payments  Schumer specifically asked the auditors to ensure that their clients  lenders and banks  follow the true interpretation of FAS 140 and not use it to prevent homeowners from refinancing  Schumer said that he s concerned companies could still be using FAS 140 as an excuse to lock mortgage holders in to sky high rates  He asked that the follow the recent accounting rule clarifications that allow mortgage changes without affecting balance sheets    Schumer called on Deloitte  Touche LLP  KPMG LLP  Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to urge financial institutions to modify home loans
