IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 3  2007 Schumer  With Summer In Full Swing And Westchester Residents Heading Outdoors  The Risk Of Lyme Disease Skyrockets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Since 2002  Westchester County Has Suffered 2 500 Cases of Lyme Disease and Remains One of the Worst Hit Areas in the Metropolitan Region   Schumer Unveils Legislation that Creates New Funding for Research  Prevention  and Education Efforts   Schumer  It s Time to Take the Bite Out of Lyme Disease                                                                                   Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer warned that with the arrival of summer and Westchester residents hitting the outdoors  the number of individuals at risk of contracting Lyme disease will soar  Over the past decade  Westchester has continued to have a high level of annual Lyme disease cases  and while the disease is highly curable if caught in the early stages  if untreated it can cause musculoskeletal  arthritic  neurologic  psychiatric and cardiac damage    Today  in his latest efforts to protect New Yorkers against the disease  Senator Schumer discussed comprehensive legislation that will fund Lyme disease prevention  education and treatment    With summer in full swing  and children and parents streaming outdoors  the number of Westchester residents who contract Lyme disease could soar  said Senator Schumer  The first step is to educate our community against this disease to take several simple  preventive measures  My legislation will provide the necessary funding so we canbring Lyme disease out of the woods and ensure that all New Yorkers know the facts on how to protect themselves and how to spot the symptoms of Lyme disease early   In Westchester County  there have been nearly 2 500 cases of Lyme disease since 2002  In Upstate New York  there were 3 836 known cases of Lyme disease reported in 2006    Lyme disease is the most common of all the diseases in the United States transmitted by mosquitoes  ticks and fleas  with approximately 20 000 cases reported each year  It most commonly occurs in the Northeastern  Mid Atlantic  and North Central states  Connecticut  Delaware  Maryland  Massachusetts  Minnesota  New Jersey  New York  Pennsylvania  Rhode  Island and Wisconsin have had the most cases in recent years   The Lone Star tick  Amblyomma Americanum  has also been spotted in Westchester and is one of the most aggressive ticks and will actually pursue a potential human host from 30 to 40 feet away  According to the Lyme Disease Association  the Lone Star tick  typically found in the Southwest  is migrating North in large numbers and now poses a significant threat to Westchester    While deer ticks commonly attach themselves to at least 125 species of birds  mammals  and reptiles  the Lone Star tick commonly preys on humans  The Lone Stars relationship with deer in its larval  nymph and adult stages suggests that its spread across the Westchester area correlates with the areas rising deer population  Even more disturbing  is that the Lone Star tick is much more aggressive in their hunting tactics than deer ticks  The Long Star tick actively searches out its victims and its bite leaves behind irritated  red welts    Lyme disease  though highly curable if it is detected in its early stages  is difficult to diagnose as its symptoms are similar to the common flu  The bulls eye rash that accompanies infection of the disease at the site of the tick bite often goes undetected especially on darker skin tones  and there is not a reliable blood test for the disease  In addition  there is no vaccine  and medical authorities disagree over how to treat the illness  particularly when it persists after short term antibiotic treatment    The Lyme and Tick borne Disease Prevention  Education  and Research Act  S  1708   authored by Senator Chris Dodd  D CT   with Schumer as an original co sponsor would     Authorize  100 million over five years      for increasing and coordinating federal prevention  treatment and research      of Lyme disease and other tick borne diseases  including developing      sensitive and accurate diagnostics for tick borne diseases and increasing      public education for such diseases      Provides  250 000 over two years to      establish a Department of Health and Human Services advisory committee to      facilitate communication between federal agencies  such as the Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  and the National Institutes of Health       NIH  andmembers of the community  includingpatient      organizations doctors andscientists   as they attempt to raise      awareness  treat  and cure tick borne diseases  Additionally  the      committee would compile local and state data to improve information about      the Lyme and other tick borne diseases     The legislation is also sponsored by Senator Christopher Dodd  D CT  and co sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE    In the past  Schumer has sent a letter to the Center for Disease Control  CDC  calling on federal health officials to investigate the rise in the Lone Star tick in the Lower Hudson Valley  He hasalso secured almost  200 000 for theLouis Calder Center  Fordham University s biological laboratory and field station in Armonk  New York forLyme Disease and tick research    Schumer was joined by Patricia Smith  National President of Lyme Disease Association
