IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 30  2005 Schumer  Clinton  Key Senate Panel Backs  11 Million For Defense Projects To Benefit The Capital Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Funding is part of FY 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee   Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York State Economy and National Security U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved  11 million in the FY06 Defense Department Appropriations bill for projects to benefit the Capital Region        Projects to be funded under the bill include  4 million for the Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS Raven  by Benet Labs   2 million for Plug Power  s Fuel Cell Development for Continuous Operation of Government project  and  5 million for High Temperature Superconductor  HTS  Generators for Navy All Electric Ships by Superpower         This is great news for the Capitol Region   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Capitol Region and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Capitol Region defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge          The Capital Region has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support           4 million in federal funds will go to Ben    t Labs for the ATLAS Raven project  This system supports the goal of developing an ultra lightweight combat vehicle that will significantly enhance the ability of all services to rapidly deploy to trouble spots worldwide  The ATLAS system will provide the enabling technologies for unprecedented reductions  50   in the weight of large caliber high muzzle energy cannons  These weight reductions in the gun system will in turn bring the vehicle weight well under the 14 ton limit required for air transportability  Ben    t Labs in located within the Watervliet Arsenal        2 million in federal funds will go to Plug Power to support efforts to develop fuel cells for Continuity of Government  DOD is required to have an effective Defense Continuity Program  DCP  to ensure mission critical functions continue despite any potential enemy threats or attacks  Continuous run  distributed power in disperse locations  is a significant component of any DCP  This program will develop and optimize fuel cell systems for these DCP applications  and begin demonstration and evaluation in distributed sites  culminating in an extensive report evaluating fuel cell ability to meet Defense Continuity requirements  Such a demonstration will help to illustrate the vital role that fuel cells can play in providing distributed power generation and reliable back up power in the event of terrorist attacks  natural disasters  or grid failure  Plug Power is a founding member of New Energy New York        5 million in federal funds will go to Superpower for the HTS Generators for Navy All Electric Ships  The Navy has made a decision to implement electric drive on its next class of surface combat ships  and to examine the use of all electric power systems in other ships and submarines  The all electronic design will enable electric warships to quickly divert a ship s propulsion power for use by state of the art electrical weapons and advanced long range sensors  Second generation high temperature super conducting wire has the potential to revolutionize this and a variety of other military applications where high power density  as well as reduced size and weight  at reasonable cost is absolutely essential  Although dramatically smaller and lighter than conventional generators  HTS generators can produce an equivalent amount of electrical power  The reduced size of HTS generators is of particular relevance to the All Electric ship because it allows increased flexibility in ship architecture  enhanced power density  and transient response  improving overall ship performance and survivability  Superpower is a founding member of New Energy New York       The Senate Appropriations Committee included  440 billion in the bill which now heads to the floor for a full vote in the Senate  A vote is expected in the coming weeks  and after final passage a Conference Committee will reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill before Congress gives final approval to the legislation and sends it to the President for his signature
