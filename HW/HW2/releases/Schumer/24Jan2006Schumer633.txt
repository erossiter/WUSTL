IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 24  2006 Schumer Votes No On Alito Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              U S  Sen  Chuck Schumer  the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  announced his opposition to Judge Samuel Alito  s nomination to the Supreme Court today in the Judiciary Committee Markup session on Alito       The following is Schumer  s statement    Mr  Chairman  in the confirmation process  the roles of the President and the Senate are equally important  The President nominates  and the Senate is charged with advice and consent  Once the President has nominated  hopefully with the advice of the Senate   Senators review the record  meet with the nominee if possible  pose questions  review responses  deliberate among themselves  and ultimately determine whether to give or to withhold their consent       The hearing is the one time that the nominee takes center stage    to clarify past statements  to explain previous views  and to reassure Senators and citizens alike that he or she is in the broad judicial mainstream        The purpose of such hearings is for the nominee  speaking frankly and forthrightly  to advance our understanding of his views  temperament  and judicial philosophy       If that does not happen  if the public is no better informed about a nominee at the conclusion of the hearing than at the start  the blame for that must be laid squarely at the feet of the nominee       This morning I want to discuss my reasoning as to why I will vote no on the nomination  First  Judge Alito was not forthcoming about his own Constitutional views on too many issues  despite in many instances having a prior written record on those views  Second  and most importantly  Judge Alito  s record on the bench is very far out of the mainstream on these many issues  And finally  the only mitigating factor Judge Alito offers is not a rejection of those views  but rather a pledge to respect stare decisis  Given  however  what past nominees have said on the subject and given his own Third Circuit history of ignoring or circumventing precedent  these pledges do not mitigate those extreme positions and are hardly reassuring       Failure to Answer Questions      First  because of the approach taken by this nominee and his handlers  we did not much advance our knowledge of Sam Alito during the just concluded hearings       Although Judge Alito responded to hundreds of questions  he meaningfully answered far too few of them       On too many issues  we were treated to artful evasions and pleasant banalities       Time after time  Judge Alito took careful cover in platitudes about the law  with which no nominee who has ever come before the Committee could have disagreed         Judge Alito declared  for example  no fewer than eight times  that he would keep an   open mind     But  has any nominee ever told us he would have a closed mind         He intoned  no fewer than six times  that   no one is above the law     But  has any nominee ever said that certain people are above the law         He continually invoked the phrases   judicial restraint    and   self restraint             And  of course  he repeatedly paid homage to precedent and the doctrine of stare decisis       And maybe most of all  Judge Alito sought to give the impression that he  like any other judge  simply did   what the law requires          But there is much that this facile formulation ignores       If it were so simple to   do what the law requires     we would hardly need judges  juries  and legal advocates       Sometimes    indeed  often    the law is silent  Sometimes  the law requires the judge to use his discretion  And of course  sometimes   what the law requires    will mean different things to different people of good faith         So  these statements tell us absolutely nothing about his views and can hardly be reassuring to anyone       The American people were entitled to honest answers  not practiced platitudes  The American people deserved to hear more       Of course  as these hearings evolve  and as witnesses perfect the artful dodge  the only people being disserved are the American people       Even a supporter of Judge Alito  Stuart Taylor of the National Journal  described the nominee  s performance in these terms    Again and again  Alito ducked and dodged  The questions seemed fair  The answers seemed lame  evasive  even infuriating  to those of us who want straight answers          Some will say  as Senator Specter has  that a nominee will answer as few questions as he can get away with  Perhaps that makes him look better at the hearings  perhaps it even gets him confirmed  but it does a disservice to the American people and to our democracy       That is so because it is in the instances when   what the law requires    is not at all clear or unanimously accepted  that Judge Alito invariably charts a rightward course       When   what the law requires    is that Judge Alito exercise his discretion    whether to overrule a precedent protective of personal autonomy  whether to uphold the dismissal of a civil rights claim  or whether to defer to the judgment of the legislature   he too often sails out of the mainstream       A Record Out of the Mainstream      So  in light of his refusal to explain his views on particular Constitutional questions at the hearings  we must take examine his written record even more closely  And that examination tells us that  in case after case and on issue after issue    especially when left to his discretion and especially when there is any plausible legal wiggleroom    Judge Alito is a judicial outlier who stands well out of the mainstream       The supporting evidence is simply overwhelming       During the time he has served on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals  not one other judge has dissented as many times as Judge Alito  Not one  Indeed  many have dissented only a fraction of the time       More telling is how he ruled in those opinions  Based on a study of those dissents  Professor Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School concluded that Judge Alito took a more conservative position than the majority of the court 91 percent of the time       Professor Sunstein further found that   when there is a conflict between institutions and individual rights  Alito s dissenting opinions argue against individual rights 84 percent of the time          As I said at the start of the hearings  Judge Alito certainly gives the impression of being a meticulous legal navigator  but  in the end  he always seem to chart a rightward course       During the week long hearing  Judge Alito did nothing to dispel that assessment       He has stood alone  at the edge of the judicial mainstream  in too many important cases and on too many important issues       Taken together  these cases paint an unmistakable portrait       1  In the area of sex discrimination law  the record shows that Judge Alito stands outside the judicial mainstream  He stood alone against 11 of his fellow judges  who criticized him for raising the bar too high for a victim of discrimination    Surely  the judicial system has little to gain by the dissent s approach          2  In another area of civil rights law  Judge Alito also stands outside the mainstream  The majority found his dissent in one case to be so extreme that they felt   Title VII would be eviscerated    if they were to follow Judge Alito  s analysis       3  In the area of Presidential power especially  Judge Alito has carved out an extreme niche for himself  having embraced and endorsed the theory of the   unitary executive     endorsing a truly vast power for the President       4  In the area of Congressional authority  Judge Alito has also shown himself to be out of the mainstream of jurisprudence  standing alone on his Court in voting against Congress  s power to regulate the possession and transfer of machine guns        5  In the area of criminal law enforcement  Judge Alito also has at least one foot out of the mainstream  In one case  his fellow judges charged that his analysis served to   minimize the history of discrimination against prospective black jurors and black defendants          6  And  of course  when it comes to a woman  s right to choose  Judge Alito has also shown himself to be outside the mainstream  having asserted that the Constitution does not protect a right to choose and having drafted the plan to erode the protections afforded by Roe v  Wade       Disrespect for Precedent      The only thing that could serve to temper Judge Alito  s extremism on the bench  he and others tell us  is faithfulness to the principles of stare decisis  respect for precedent  But we have been down that road before       After all  we have seen other nominees come before us and solemnly swear fealty to the same broad precepts         Before this very Committee  then Judge Bork claimed loyalty to the notion of stability and stare decisis  But outside of the hearing room  it turns out  Robert Bork    whom Judge Alito inexplicably called   one of the most outstanding nominees    of the 20th Century    had said    I don t think that in the field of constitutional law  precedent is all that important          And  of course  Robert Bork has continued to advocate for the overruling of Roe v  Wade  among other cases  even as recently as a few weeks ago         Then Judge Thomas similarly pledged allegiance to the doctrine of stare decisis  but as we showed at the hearing  since taking his seat on the Supreme Court  he has voted to overrule or unravel more than 30 precedents of the Court       So  given that other nominees  like Justice Thomas  have pledged fealty to stare decisis and then gone on to ignore precedent and given President Bush  s own pledge to nominate judges in the mold of Clarence Thomas  his invocation of that doctrine is of small consolation       Even more troubling is Judge Alito  s own record on the Third Circuit  His fellow judges have repeatedly criticized him for ignoring and sidestepping the precedents of his own court       On the Supreme Court  Judge Alito would have even greater freedom to ignore or overrule precedent  Given his record on the Third Circuit  what can Americans expect him to do on the Supreme Court       1  In one case  the majority of the court said that his opinion   guts the statutory standard    and   ignores our precedent          2  In another  the en banc majority argued that Judge Alito  s view ignored   case after case    relied upon by the majority and   accords little weight to these authorities         3  In yet another the majority said Judge Alito  s dissent   does not comport with our reading of the  relevant  caselaw          4  In another  Judge Alito said he wanted to   overrule Bello and the cases that followed it          5  And  in one case  Judge Garth wrote that Judge Alito  s opinion was   unprecedented    in its   disregard of established principles of stare decisis           These examples are just some of the cases in which Judge Alito found himself alone in disagreement with his colleagues on Third Circuit precedents       I recite these examples because of the critically important question they raise       If Judge Alito has been so willing to disregard the precedents of his own court in   unprecedented    ways  what solace can we take in his professed allegiance to stare decisis should he be confirmed to the Supreme Court  where he would have even more freedom to overturn important and settled precedents  relied upon by millions of Americans         What of Gonzales v  Raich  which upheld the federal government  s ability to protect public safety by regulating illegal drugs within the states          There is certainly cause for alarm because he voted  in the Third Circuit  to strike down federal firearms regulation in strikingly similar legal circumstances         What of Morrison v  Olson  which held that the President does not have total and unfettered power to fire independent officials          Here  too  there is also cause for alarm because Judge Alito has stridently endorsed the view of the lone dissenter  Justice Scalia  and refused meaningfully to distance himself from that view at his hearings         What of Mitchell v  Forsyth  which held that executive branch officials cannot completely escape accountability for warrantless wiretapping          Again  there is cause for alarm because Judge Alito once argued the losing side in that case in a memo explaining his personal legal perspective that officials should have absolute immunity for warrantless wiretapping         What of Nevada v  Hibbs  which protected the rights of state employees to challenge violations of the Family Medical Leave Act          Once again  there is cause for alarm because Judge Alito voted  in the Third Circuit  to prohibit state employees from doing just that in Chittister         And  of course  what of Roe v  Wade  which this very week marks the 33rd anniversary of protecting a woman  s Constitutional right to choose       Here  the alarm is probably greatest because Judge Alito repeatedly and inexplicably refused to say whether he still held the views that he had once so proudly stated  that the   Constitution does not protect    a woman  s right to choose  He was also asked whether he believed that Roe v  Wade was   settled law     Again  he refused to answer       This was particularly troubling because  on some questions of course  Judge Alito was forthcoming  He was prepared to distance himself  for example  from earlier statements suggesting that he did not believe in the principle of one person  one vote  And he was prepared to distance himself from earlier statements that the elected branches were   supreme          On this vital Constitutional question  however  Judge Alito remained utterly opaque  leading to the only possible reasonable conclusion    that he still believes that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion  but does not want to tell the American people because he knows how unpopular that view is       In light of ALL of the evidence  to suggest    as some here have    that Judge Alito will not vote to overrule Roe v  Wade is to ask us not just to take a leap of faith  but to suspend disbelief       Indeed  it asks too much       In the end  Mr  Chairman  given Judge Alito  s refusal to answer many important questions  given that he is out of the mainstream on so many issues and would move the country backwards  and given that pledges to follow precedent provide little consolation  I have no choice but to vote nay  and I urge my colleagues to do the same
