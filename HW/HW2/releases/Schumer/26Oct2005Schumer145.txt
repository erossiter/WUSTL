                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            New Analysis Reveals 1 2 Million Upstate New Yorkers Could Pay More In Taxes  Costing  4 5 Billion Per Year   Senator To Introduce Resolution In Senate Denouncing Change  Requests Data from IRS  Vows To Fight Any Legislative Move In Finance Committee    Schumer to Detail Tax Hike in Each Region If Proposal Becomes Law  Capital Region Taxpayers Could Pay  538 million more  Central NY  428 m  Rochester Over one million taxpayers across New York could see an average tax increase of  3 589 if a recommendation from the Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform is made to the tax code  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer explained today  Next week  the Panel will formally recommend eliminating the federal deduction for state and local taxes as a way to pay for broader tax reforms         This idea is an absolute killer for New York     Schumer said    Repealing the deduction would devastate people at all levels of income  from working families of modest means to the upper middle class  but would also crush budgets at both the state and local level  As communities face pressures to slash spending  this will hurt our teachers  police  and firefighters    who are already squeezed as it is  It would also make it less likely that entrepreneurs will set up shop here in New York  costing many thousands of jobs down the line  because these smart people won  t want to locate where taxes are rising and services are declining  Protecting the federal deduction for state and local taxes is my number one priority on the Finance Committee          Schumer today released county by county  detailing how much taxpayers in each county will have to pay if the recommendations become law         An estimated 159 000 Capital Region taxpayers could pay  538 million more in taxes  The average itemizing household could pay a  3 373 tax increase         An estimated 139 000 Central New York taxpayers could pay  427 million more in taxes  The average itemizing household could pay a  3 064 tax increase         An estimated 350 648 Hudson Valley taxpayers could pay 1 7 billion more in taxes  The average itemizing household could pay a  4 872 tax increase         An estimated 79 000 North Country taxpayers could pay  212 million more in taxes  The average itemizing household could pay a  2 667 tax increase         An estimated 190 000 Rochester Finger Lakes taxpayers could pay  625 million more in taxes  The average itemizing household could pay a  3 286 tax increase         An estimated 97 000 Southern Tier taxpayers could pay  265 million more in taxes  The average itemizing household could pay a  2 758 tax increase         An estimated 220 000 Western New York taxpayers could pay  689 million more in taxes  The average itemizing household could pay a  3 014 tax increase       In response  Schumer announced today that he is introducing a resolution in the Senate to defend the deduction  The resolution will be introduced shortly  and if passed  will express the sense of the Senate that federal tax deduction for state and local taxes paid should be retained  Schumer also said he will use his seat on the Senate Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over all tax issues  to fight any legislative movement to implement the changes into the tax code        Schumer is also requesting better data from the Internal Revenue Service on the local impact of the proposal  In a letter to Mark W  Everson  Schumer noted that while the IRS collects detailed information for tax returns nationally  the amount of data that they collect and publish on a state by state or county by county basis is far more limited  With the Tax Panel about to recommend the outright repeal of  or significant changes to  important deductions that millions of New Yorkers claim  it  s essential for members of Congress to understand the impacts that these changes will have across their states not just in their state as a whole  Senator Schumer is calling on Commissioner Everson to greatly expand the amount of information they publish on a state by state and county by county basis  so Members of Congress have a greater understanding of what the Tax Panel  s recommendations will mean to their constituents        Schumer today argued that eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes would create a new form of double taxation since repeal would require millions of taxpayers to pay federal taxes on income that is also taxed at the state or local level       Local taxes have been deductible from the federal income tax since the inception of the federal income tax in 1913  Congress has even taken steps to expand the state and local tax deduction  by reinstating a deduction for state sales taxes for some taxpayers as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004       The nonpartisan Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center  has said that that eliminating the deduction could   lower support for public services and lead to a   race to the bottom   in terms of state and local expenditures as states compete to have the lowest taxes in order to attract higher income households          In tax year 2003  43 538 000 taxpayers in the United States took advantage of the federal deduction for state and local taxes  deducting a total of  315 69 billion  thereby saving taxpayers in the United States approximately  88 39 billion in federal income taxes  assuming an average marginal rate of 28 percent for taxpayers who itemize  The top 25 states  led by California and New York respectively  ranked by the number of taxpayers affected  represented 77 percent of the taxpayers affected nationally  and took 85 percent of the total deductions for state and local taxes        On January 7  2005  President Bush created the President  s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform  charged with providing several options for federal tax reform that would simplify Federal tax laws  retain progressively  and promote long run economic growth and job creation  Last Tuesday  the Panel confirmed publicly that it would recommend the repeal of the federal deduction for state and local taxes  slated to be presented publicly on November 1st  The recommendations will officially be submitted for review to the Department of Treasury for Administration review  which will then decide which of the proposals to pursue        Click here to view
