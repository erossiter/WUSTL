IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 5  2005 New Schumer Survey Reveals Scores Of Previously Undisclosed MTBE Leaks Located In Capital Region Pose Grave Danger To Public Health                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Schumer Releases New Capital Region Map Of 175 MTBE Spills In Albany  Rensselaer and Schenectady Counties    Schumer Vows To Block Energy Bill Currently Just Passed By House If MTBE Giveaway to Large Oil Corporations Is Not Removed Standing at the site of one potentially cancer causing MTBE spill like the dozens that threaten the environment and public health in the Capital Region  Senator Charles E  Schumer released a new list of MTBE hotspots  The previously undisclosed list of MTBE spills in the Capital Region identifies threats to residential homes  commercial properties  water supply wells  and the Hudson River  If a specific special interest provision included in the Energy Bill passed by the House is not removed  the enormous clean up costs will be incurred by consumers  Schumer on Thursday will announce his intention to filibuster the Energy bill if the MTBE provision is not removed         This may be the single worst special interest giveaway to polluters that I have ever seen in more than 20 years in Washington   Schumer said   It is shocking that New York  s drinking water is threatened by leaks and spills that haven t been cleaned up for more than 20 years and  adding insult to injury  consumers will have to foot the bill  This underscores why the Energy Bill has no business being passed if these provisions are included  The idea that we should let the companies whose product literally poisoned our groundwater get away free    and instead force innocent New Yorkers to pay for the cleanup    is so audacious that words fail to describe it  When my kids were four years old they knew that if you make a mess  you clean it up  If the people who introduced poison into our wells and aquifers think that they can getaway without a fight  they have another thing coming          The map exposed by Schumer today  include some of the capital region  s most potentially dangerous MTBE hotspots  Schumer described a spill that was found at a former Mobil Station on Wolf Road that still doesn  t meet standards nearly 20 years after first being reported  A full map of the other MTBE hotspots is attached       The so called  Safe Harbor  provision in the Energy bill    which has already passed the U S  House of Representatives    would make taxpayers in New York  and those all over the country pay the entire cost to clean up the methyl tertiary butyl ether  which is better known as MTBE  MTBE is a potentially cancer causing chemical that was first added to gasoline in the 1970 s and has been in widespread use since the 1990 s  When gasoline containing MTBE was spilled or leaked out of underground storage tanks  it poisoned underground water systems  including 175 sites in the Capital Region       The  Safe Harbor  provision would prevent petroleum companies from having to pay a cent to clean up the damage their toxic product created by making a blanket declaration that no chemical that gets added to gasoline as part of the energy bill s ethanol mandate  or MTBE can ever be considered a  defective product  in a court of law  even if the chemical is a possible carcinogen       MTBE came into wide use around 1979  MTBE became even more widespread after changes to the Clean Air Act in 1990 required that reformulated gasoline containing an oxygenate be sold in areas like New York with poor air quality  When MTBE leaks out of an underground storage tanks and into an underground drinking water system like the one under the surface of Capital Region  the poison does not break down  moves through the water quickly  and makes the water smell and taste like turpentine  While the nonpartisan US General Accounting Office has detected MTBE in groundwater and drinking water in every state in the US  the problem is particularly acute in New York  In New York State alone there are 2 727 MTBE spills  including 89 spills in Albany County  44 in Rensselaer County  and 42 in Schenectady County       Oil and gas lobbyists got the so called  Safe Harbor  provision added into the US House version of the Energy bill expressly to prevent court decisions that would hold oil companies liable for MTBE poisoning  In 2002  a Lake Tahoe  California jury found  clear and convincing evidence  that three major oil companies acted  with malice  and were liable for polluting ground water with MTBE  During the case  plaintiffs uncovered internal industry documents showing companies had known for years about the dangers of MTBE while they still were promoting its use   The House of Representatives recently passed its version of the Energy Bill  which included the  safe harbor  provision        MTBE is a poison that threatens the environment and public health in the Capital Region     Schumer said    No two paragraph statement in a piece of legislation is going to change that truth  and I m not going to let Big Oil push these cleanup costs onto New York homeowners without a fight
