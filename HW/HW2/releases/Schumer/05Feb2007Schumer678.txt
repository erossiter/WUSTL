IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 5  2007 Schumer Analysis  2008 Bush Budget Gives New York Cold Shoulder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Senator  Emphasis on War Funding and Tax Cuts For Very Wealthy Leave No Room For Health Care  Education  Homeland Security and Transportation Needs of Middle Class   Some of the Largest Cuts Include Homeland Security High Threat Funding  Medicare  LIHEAP Funding U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today said that the Administration  s budget proposal for fiscal year 2008 includes big cuts to a number of key programs relied on by New Yorkers   The Administration has slashed funding for Medicare by  75 8 billion and Medicaid by  25 7 billion  and cut money for the Urban Area Security Initiative  which provides more targeted funds to high threat areas  and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP         The Administration  s budget acknowledges there is an annual gap of  290 billion between taxes received and taxes owed the government  yet another contribution to the growing federal deficit  Given an opportunity to step up to the plate and offer proposals to shrink this gap  the Administration instead offers ideas that would shrink the tax gap by only  29 billion over ten years    less than one percent each year          This budget doesn  t pay enough attention to the middle class     Schumer said    In his budget  President Bush has given New York the cold shoulder  The President hasn  t learned from his mistakes    dramatic cuts to education  transportation  and health care show he still doesn  t get it  The President s budget will effectively cut the core out of the Big Apple          Listed below are some of the most significant cuts proposed in the Administration  s budget  including New York programs         101 5 billion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid  The Administration s budget cuts funding for Medicare by  75 8 billion and Medicaid by  25 7 billion   The lion  s share of these cuts will come out of health care providers such as hospitals  nursing homes  and hospice   New York State  s hospitals have been operating at a loss for the last eight years in a row  but are targeted for drastic reductions in payments      State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  The President proposes  10 billion less than is needed merely to continue covering the children already enrolled in the Children  s Health Insurance Program  which is called Child Health Plus in New York   He also proposes to scale back eligibility requirements to twice the federal poverty level   This would kick kids off of New York  s program  which currently covers children up to 2 5 times the federal poverty level        Eliminated Health Care Programs  The budget eliminated the Advanced Education Nurse Training program  which received  57 million last year  provides financial support to registered nurses who enroll in advanced training programs to serve as nurse practitioners  nurse educators  public health nurses  and other vital roles   The Community Services Block Grant  which provides education  employment  housing  and health care among other services  was also eliminated in the President  s budget   New York received  54 4 million from this program last year   Also eliminated were the Emergency Medical Services for Children program  the Newborn Hearing Screening program  and Alzheimer demonstration grants      Ryan White CARE Act   The Administration  s budget barely increases funding levels overall for the Ryan White CARE Act programs  which provide vital assistance for those living with HIV AIDS   The only program that receives any increase at all is the AIDS Drug Assistance Program  ADAP    ADAP receives a  25 million increase  but still falls short of authorization levels by  4 3 million   In addition  the Administration requests only  2 16 billion for funding for all Ryan White CARE programs  falling  48 7 million short of an already meager authorization level      Child Support Enforcement   The Administration  s budget cuts the federal share of state and local administrative costs and incentives by  452 million nationwide   Child support enforcement is one of the most effective and efficient programs in the federal government  and in 2004  for every federal dollar spent  families collected  4 38 in child support   The Administration  s budget would decrease funding to New York State from and estimated  255 million in FY2007 to  228 million in FY2008  resulting in a  27 million decrease from FY07   These cuts will seriously undermine the dramatic progress that New York State has made in its Child Support Enforcement program   In the last twelve years  New York State improved its child support collection rate from 12  to 50    With the proposed federal funding cuts  NYS   collection rates will likely drop        Social Security  President Bush has again snuck a big Social Security privatization plan in his budget that  if enacted  would cost  637 billion over the next ten years and trillions more in the decades to come to create private personal accounts  The change would result in millions of middle income workers receiving much smaller guaranteed Social Security benefits in retirement  In New York  there are currently about 2 1 million people receiving retirement benefits   Middle income workers who retired 50 years from now would receive total annual benefit cuts of  7 229 under the President  s private account plan  compared to what they would be entitled to under current law      Homeland Security   The proposed budget cuts total funding for state and local homeland security programs by 25 percent  to  1 896 billion  The State Homeland Security Grant program  SHSGP  budget was slashed by 64 percent  down to only  187 million  While this drastic reduction in funds will greatly curtail homeland security efforts  there is one bright spot for New York and other high risk states  the proposed budget would change the funding formula from a  75 minimum per state to a  25 minimum per state  meaning more funding is freed up to go to states that are most at risk  From 2003 to 2006  New York received  252 million in SHSGP funding      Urban Area Security Initiative  provides more targeted funds to high threat  urban areas at greater risk of terrorist attacks  The Administration  s proposed budget allocates only  600 million  down 22 percent from 2007       Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program   under the proposed budget  the LETPP program receives only  263 million  LETPP  which is targeted specifically at preventing terrorist attacks by providing law enforcement and public safety communities  working together with private partners  funds to support intelligence gathering and information sharing  hardening high value targets  building interoperable communications  and collaborating with non law enforcement partners  other government agencies and the private sector   New York has received  67 37 million in LETPP funding from 2003 to 2006      FEMA  The budget for disaster relief for the Federal Emergency Management Agency came in at  1 7 billion  In 2006  New York alone received  227 million in disaster relief funds after major flooding last summer  For the National Pre Disaster Mitigation Fund  which helps communities prevent damage from floods and other disasters  the budget request is a mere  100 000       Targeted Infrastructure Protection Program   Despite increased national focus last year on improving security at ports and transit facilities  the Administration is proposing a budget that keeps funding the same for ports and mass transit  while reducing money for trucking security  The budget request would provide only  210 million for port security   175 million for mass transit and rail security and  9 million  down from  12 million for trucking security       Local Law Enforcement  The Administration is proposing to cut the Community Oriented Policing System  COPS  program  from  541 million in 2007 to  34 million in the FY08 budget  This dramatic 93 percent reduction will undermine all COPS programs  which help law enforcement agencies hire police officers  enhance crime fighting technology  and support crime prevention initiatives  New York received  7 8 million in 2006  Funding for methamphetamine prevention and prosecution would be dropped from  63 5 million to  39 3 million    a 38  reduction  The Byrne Formula Grant Program  a partnership among federal  state  and local governments to create safer communities  would receive only  353 million      FIRE Grants  The Administration is  once again  calling for significant cuts to the FIRE program  a 55 percent reduction  from  662 million to  300 million  FIRE grants provide funding for our city and volunteer fire departments and non affiliated emergency medical services  These grants are aimed at helping communities enhance their first responder capabilities  including protecting the health and safety of the public and our nation  s first responders   The funds go to specialized emergency response training  hiring additional firefighting personnel  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment acquisition and facility upgrades  and fire prevention and safety programs     Education  The Administration  s budget proposal continues the Administration s practice of massively underfunding two vital education programs  No Child Left Behind  NCLB  and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA    In addition  the Administration  s proposals eliminate 44 other important educational programs  including the Javits Gifted and Talented program  Education Technology State Grants  and the Even Start Program         Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA   The Administration s FY08 budget falls short of congressional commitment  calling for level funding of grants to states  Through the Administration  s budget  the federal government would again provide a smaller share of states   total costs for special education   The Bush budget also falls further below the authorized levels in the IDEA Improvement Act of 2004   The proposed level of  10 49 billion falls  8 8 billion short of the FY08 authorized level of  19 3 billion   The Administration s proposed level funding would only fund IDEA at 16 5 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for educating students with disabilities   still less than half of the 40 percent  full funding  promised by Congress when the law was enacted 30 years ago  Schumer estimates that New York s share of the program would be level funded when compared to the likely FY07 level  This is  564 million short of the increase called for in the reauthorization of the law  and  766 million short of fulfilling Congress s  full funding  promise   Under the Administration s plan  New York City s funding would also be level funded at approximately  243 million   This is  198 million short of levels set forth in the new law and  268 million short of 40   full funding  levels      NCLB Title I  Title I Grants to local educational agencies are the largest component of the NCLB legislation and are designed to help raise student achievement in the most impoverished communities  Under the Administration s proposal  Schumer estimates that New York s share of the program would increase by  137 8 million over the estimated FY07 level   from  1 198 billion in FY07 to  1 336 billion in FY08  This increase falls far short of fully funding the No Child Left Behind Act   While No Child Left Behind stands to be reauthorized this year  the President  s budget request shortchanges New York State by  1 119 billion compared to the level set in the law for FY07  and fails to each all students who are eligible for the program  Under the Administration s plan  New York City s funding would increase by only  89 6 million  from approximately  778 6 million in FY07 to  868 2 million in FY08    727 5 million less than what New York City is promised under the law  Under the Administration s plan  over 325 445 children in New York State will not receive promised Title I services       After school Programs   The Bush budget leaves behind 1 9 million students who would receive after school services if the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program were funded at the level promised in NCLB   21st Century funding would decrease from  10 million from estimated FY07 levels  to  981 million   While the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program is up for reauthorization as part of No Child Left Behind Act this year  the President  s FY08 funding level falls  1 5 billion below the  2 5 billion authorized level for FY07   NY State would receive only  90 87 million   138 million below the authorized level of  229 million   Because of the proposed decrease in funding  182 491 New York students will be denied promised after school services        Americorps and Job Corps   The President s budget cuts Americorps funding by  9 2 million  which will be a direct hit of  1 04 million to New York s Americorps funded programs that provide volunteer services in local communities such as tutoring and mentoring  building affordable housing  and managing after school programs   Job Corps  a highly successful program that helps young people from age 16 24 to turn their lives around and find a career path  was cut by  55 million   There are seven Job Corps programs in New York State     Head Start  Head Start  a national program that readies young children to enter the public school system  was cut by  100 million in the President s budget  This will mean a loss of approximately  6 3 million to New York State Head Start programs     Terminated programs  The Bush budget eliminates 44 Education programs  for a total of  2 25 billion  They include Educational Technology State grants   272 million   State Grants for Innovative Programs   99 million   Javits Gifted and Talented Program   9 6 million   Even Start   99 million   and Tech Prep Education State grants   104 8 million        New York receives millions in funding from many of the programs every year which would be terminated in FY2008 under the budget proposal  In addition  New York will receive  2 4 million for Byrd Honor Scholarships in FY2006  the last year for which grant data is available    59 5 million in Vocational Education State Grants and  5 3 million in Tech Prep Education State Grants   all of which   would be terminated for FY2008    The complete list of programs slated for termination is at the end       AMTRAK    The Administration is continuing to rip the rails out from under Amtrak  providing only  800 million in federal subsidies for Amtrak  down 38 percent from  1 3 billion last year  Transportation experts say  900 million is the minimum funding necessary to keep Amtrak  s trains running   More than 10 million New Yorkers ride Amtrak trains each year  and ridership is growing        The Administration is only requesting  500 million for capital improvements and  300 million in operating assistance for Amtrak      Airport Improvement Program  The Airport Improvement Program  which provides grants for local airports to improve facilities was cut 21 percent in the proposed budget  to  2 75 billion  down from  3 515 billion last year      CDBG  After being saved by Democrats in Congress two years in a row  the Community Development Block Grant Program  CDBG  is once again on the President  s chopping block   The CDBG program is a signature program for New York  s cities  counties and local communities to create jobs  spur economic development and small business opportunities and expand homeownership   New York  s CDBG funding is being reduced by  104 million  to only  249 million  New York City  s portion would be reduced by  55 9 million       Community Development Financial Institutions  CDFI   The Administration has requested  29 million for the CDFI Fund in the FY08 budget   While this is  20 7 million above the FY 2007 request of  7 9 million for administration only  the CDFI Fund has dropped precipitously since FY 2001 when the agency was funded at  118 million    In the joint funding resolution recently approved by the House for FY 2007  the CDFI Fund received less than half this amount  This request is significantly lower than the amount needed for the Fund to provide equity investments  grants  loans  and technical assistance to new and existing community development banks and credit unions  community development loan and venture capital funds and micro enterprise loan funds   In the last 11 years  the CDFI Fund has invested  123 2  million in New York banks and CDFIs  In 2005  New York received more than  7 15 million     Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities  Section 811    The Administration has proposed to cut the Housing for Person with Disabilities by over 50    In FY08  the program would only receive  125 million  reduced significantly from last year s appropriation of  239 million   Nationally  the Disabled Housing program is responsible for developing approximately 1 400 new units of rental housing and funds approximately 1 600 five year tenant based rental assistance vouchers for persons with disabilities each year   New York State public housing authorities  PHAs  and non profit organizations operate 1 200 programs   Under the new proposal  New York organizations are expected to receive at most    half of their FY07 allocation    it is unclear if that amount will be enough to renew all existing rental assistance vouchers   But it is certain that under the new proposal  organizations would not be able to develop any new units of rental     HOPE VI   The Administration has once again proposed to terminate the HOPE VI program that rehabilitates and restores severely distressed public housing projects   In addition  they have requested to rescind  99 million    the entire FY07 funding allocation   For the past 5 years the Administration has proposed to eliminate HOPE VI   In the FY07 funding resolution  Congress funded the program at a  100 million level making available roughly 5 grants for the entire United States   Currently  New York has 16 HOPE VI projects    all of which could possibly be in jeopardy of getting their funding rescinded   Niagara Falls Public Housing Authority received a HOPE VI grant in a competitive grant process late last year      Section 202   The Administration has proposed slashing Section 202 grants for housing funding for the elderly by almost 25  from the FY07 funding resolution levels   In FY05 Section 202 was funded by over  1 billion  in FY06 and FY 07 Section 202 was funded at  742 million  and now the Administration is proposing an additional cut of almost  200 million dollars to the already under funded program   Section 202 funds are used to house the elderly in supportive housing with services and support from service coordinators   If enacted  these proposed budgetary cuts would leave many New York Seniors without the adequate services they need     Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS  HOPWA   The Administration proposes a modest funding increase to  300 million however they don  t go far enough  The National AIDS Housing Coalition  NAHC  estimates that a bare minimum of  454 million is needed in FY08 to maintain existing programs  provide funding for two additional jurisdictions that became eligible for HOPWA in FY07 and expand access to HIV AIDS patients stuck on waiting lists for housing and services  HOPWA funds are used to provide safe  secure housing for people living with HIV AIDS  Several studies have demonstrated the importance of stable housing in effective treatment of HIV AIDS and shown that HIV AIDS patients with stable housing are less likely to engage in behaviors associated with the spread of the disease  New York is the largest recipient of HOPWA funding and will receive approximately  3 million in additional funding from this increase  but would receive an additional  36 million if the program were funded at the recommended level   Public Housing Capital Fund  The Administration has proposed cutting funding for the Public Housing Capital Fund by over  150 million  This cut follows cuts of  252 million in FY06 and  140 million in FY 07  If this cut is enacted  New York State  s Housing authorities will lose over  70 million in funding from the Capital Fund this year  New York City alone would lose  57 2 million   These cuts demonstrate the Administration  s continuing effort to reduce the resources available to the nation  s public housing stock  The Public Housing Capital Fund is designed to respond to the capital and management improvement requirements of public housing  The New York Housing Authorities have specifically used capital funds to modernize the physical stock of their public housing developments  which includes providing new roofs  new windows  new heating and cooling units and new security systems for their many buildings      Rural Rental Housing  The Administration has again proposed zero funding for the Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program  Congress has rescued this program and funded it at  100 million for the past 3 years  The Section 515 is multipurpose  providing funding for rehabilitation of existing projects and construction of new affordable rural rental housing  New York has one of the largest stocks of Section 515 in the country with over 13 000 units spread over 429 different housing projects  However  New York  s housing projects are some of the oldest in the nation and are in need of the rehabilitation funding provided by Section 515  New York is one of the largest overall recipients of Section 515 funding  with over  17 million received since 2000  Funding for rehabilitation of New York  s existing housing stock as well as construction of additional units would be lost under the Administration  s plan       USDA Rural Single Family Direct Homeownership Loans  The Administration has proposed eliminating the Section 502 direct homeownership loan  a funding cut of over  1 billion  These loans are one of the most effective government loan programs  providing an affordable single family home at a cost to the government of only  10 000 per unit  New York received 253 loans totaling over  22 million in FY06  Additionally  there is a backlog of over 300 applications from New York families seeking housing assistance  Under the Administration  s plan  these families won  t receive this assistance and will be forced into higher cost homes they can not afford      Rural Housing and Economic Development  RHED  Grants  The Administration has again eliminated the RHED program in its budget request  These grants are used to develop affordable housing in rural areas  through direct funding for housing and for support services through local non profits  Since the program  s inception  New York has received 7 grants  totaling over  1 1 million dollars      Veterans Health Care    While returning veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  more than 155 000 so far  are increasing demand for VA services  the Administration  s budge continues to underfund the VA  providing only  36 8 billion for veterans   health care in the proposed 2008 budget  More than 1 1 million veterans in New York rely on VA health services  and troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are expected to draw even more heavily on medical and psychological health care services       Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program  The proposed budget funds the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program at only  46 3 million  down from  104 6 million last year  The MEP program has helped over 1 400 manufacturing companies in upstate New York stay afloat by providing consulting and training services for small to medium size manufacturing companies       Trade Adjustment Assistance  The Administration s budget proposal would cut funding for the Trade Adjustment Assistance  TAA   TAA provides aid to workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages are reduced as a result of increased imports  Under the proposed budget   50 million less would be available to assist these workers   Developed in response to expanding globalization  TAA provides training for employment in another job or career  weekly cash payments called trade readjustment allowances  TRA  as well as job search and relocation allowances      Clean Water  The Clean Water state revolving fund received only  687 5 million  a 22 percent decrease from 2006  New York  s portion would be reduced to  75 6 million     Workforce Investment Act Training and Employment Services Funding   The Administration  s proposed budget slashes funding for workforce training by 500 million  down to  4 6 billion      LIHEAP  Despite energy prices that  have remained historically high  and have driven an increasing number of people to seek help paying their heating bills  funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  was cut to 1 8 billion  down 10 percent from 2007  For New York  where more than more than 840 000 households received LIHEAP funding in 2006  funding was cut to  187 million  a 22  percent reduction       Buffalo Courthouse  One spot of good news for New York  the Buffalo Courthouse received  46 7 million under the Administration  s proposed budget      Education Programs that will be Terminated in the FY 2008 Budget  Foundations for
