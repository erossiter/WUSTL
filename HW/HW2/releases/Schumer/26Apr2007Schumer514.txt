IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 26  2007 Schumer Demands Navy End 6 Month Delay And Immediately Follow Through On Contract With Rome Research Corporation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Rome Company Won Competition to Perform Critical Navy Functions Last October  but the Navy Has Inexplicably Pulled Back   RRC Has Shown Itself to Be the Best Company for the Job   Schumer to Navy  Stop Dragging Your Feet   This Contract Was Awarded Fair and Square  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the Department of the Navy to immediately finalize their contract with Rome Research Corporation  RRC  to have RRC manage and oversee certain operations of the Naval Satellite Operations Center  NAVSOC    Although the decision to award the contract to RRC was reached in October 2006 after a competitive bidding process  the Navy still has not provided the requisite Congressional Notification that represents the last hurdle before the contract can begin           This is red tape at it s worst   it is inexcusable that operations have been repeatedly held up by Navy foot dragging when RRC has demonstrated numerous times that this contract is the most effective and cost efficient option for the Navy   said Schumer    Those at RRC have worked hard for this contract and the entire Oneida County community will benefit from this economic boost   The Navy must act now to ensure that operations begin immediately so that the workers at RRC and their families are not left hanging in limbo another day             The Department of the Navy issued an initiation performance decision announcing Rome as the winner of the NAVSOC competition in October  2006   RRC was then officially awarded the contract in January of 2007 to manage and oversee certain operations of the Naval Satellite Operations Center  NAVSOC   This  33 million performance decision was made after a competitive bidding process during which RRC demonstrated that they could perform the NAVSOC functions for 11  less than the Navy  providing a  4 3 million savings to the government  As part of the Navy s A 76 competitive sourcing process  RRC spent over a year working with the Navy  making 9 different submissions to the department to demonstrate that they could do the work effectively and at a lower cost than the government         Enough already   said Schumer   RRC has jumped through hoops  leapt over hurdles and passed every test  the Navy needs to hold up their half of the bargain and let them put people to work         Under the terms of the award  Rome Research Corporation would be charged with managing four existing facilities operated by NAVSOC  including outlets in Port Magu  California  Colorado Springs  Colorado  Bangor  Maine and  Finegayan  Guam  NAVSOC is responsible for operating  managing and maintaining a variety of strategically important satellite systems on behalf of the Navy  These satellites provide critical information and intelligence gathering resources  as well as navigational and logistical support to military outposts throughout the globe     Overall management of NAVSOC would be performed in Rome  NY  RRC has approximately 600 employees around the world and 200 in New York  They currently provide support functions to several Department of Defense projects throughout the United States and around the world   This A 76 contract would provide work for existing employees and allow RRC to hire 10 new managers     Since the initial decision  this contract has received  and stood up to  the utmost scrutiny both before and after it was rewarded  After the contract was granted a protest was filed by an Agency Tender Official with the General Accounting Office  GAO  objecting to the deal  The GAO dismissed this protest   As recently as last Friday  April 20th  an internal investigation by the Navy again cleared RRC to undertake this work    Under Public Law  the Navy must submit a report to Congress detailing the results of such a public private competition   After this notification is made  there is a 60 day waiting period before the contract can commence   This notification is generally made directly after the award decision is made  No Congressional Notification has been issued in the case of RRC      In a personal letter to Secretary of the Navy  Donald C  Winter  Schumer wrote   In order for the contract to commence  it is my understanding that the Navy must now provide congressional notification of the award    As the award was made over 6 months ago  I would urge you to do this with all due speed
