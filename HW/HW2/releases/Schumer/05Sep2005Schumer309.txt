IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 5  2005 In Light Of New Survey Showing Shocking Disparity In Gas Prices In NY NJ  Schumer  Corzine Call For Top To Bottom FTC Investigation Of Entire Oil Industry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hurricane Katrina Related Gas Price Gouging Costing Metro Area Residents Millions  Could Continue Long After Clean up Period without Decisive Action  Senators ask FTC to look at Full Picture  Gas Stations  Big 4 Oil Companies and Pipelines In light of shocking disparities in gas prices in the New York New Jersey Metropolitan area  and  as gas prices continue to soar  today Senators Charles E  Schumer and Jon S  Corzine called on the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to launch a top to bottom investigation into the oil industry  The Senators  who released a survey that showed a huge disparity in gas prices throughout the entire New York and New Jersey Metropolitan area expressed their concern that people could be profiting in the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina        We are only beginning to comprehend the breadth of what truly is a devastating national tragedy  Hurricane Katrina has destroyed homes  communities  families  and an entire region of this nation  The thought that a few bad apples might profit from this tragedy is unconscionable     Schumer said       This should be a time of shared sacrifice not exploitation     said Corzine    The unprecedented damage of hurricane Katrina cannot be compounded by gasoline price gouging  it is our responsibility to see that those who would seek to gain because of a horrible natural disaster are swiftly prosecuted        According to AAA  gas prices have  in less than a week  jumped by as much as 60 cents a gallon and on average  gasoline is 50 percent more expensive than it was last year  If the cost of gas were to stay at  3 a gallon New Yorkers will spend  3 305 556 000 on gas in the next calendar year versus  2 343 639 204 at September 2000r4 prices for an increase of  961 916 796 or almost 1 billion dollars  The average vehicle in NYC will cost the owner  548 41 in extra gas prices if they don  t come down      Schumer and Corzine also released a survey of gas prices in the metropolitan New York and New Jersey Area  The survey  which was done over the weekend  showed a wide range of prices for a tank of regular gas both borough by borough  within New York  within New Jersey  and across the metropolitan area  In Queens for example  prices differed as much as 76 cents between one of the higher prices stations and one of the lower priced stations  In Brooklyn prices differed by 80 cents  In northern New Jersey  the widest disparity in gas prices was about 44 cents  The survey is attached     Though some of the increase in gas prices can be attributed to the interruption in oil and refined gas supplies  and the uncertainties of such an unprecedented and unpredictable event as Hurricane Katrina  the Senators expressed fear that some of the fluctuation and inconsistencies in gas prices are a result of price gouging at the pump  They called on the FTC to launch a top to bottom investigation to make sure that oil companies and gas station owners and the pipeline in between them are operating ethically and within the law      Though the Federal Trade Commission already monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust violations in the petroleum industry  Schumer and Corzine called for immediate formation of a task force to promptly identify the many cases of price gouging being reported across the country  and asked that the task force formulate a process by which price gougers are swiftly prosecuted     Across the Northeast  gas prices have surged from pre Katrina levels  Market forces have certainly played a role in these prices  but the variety of prices at gas stations and the fact that profits continue to flow to big oil indicate improper pricing  There are currently no federal laws that specifically address price gouging  The state laws that do exist regarding price gouging are usually only triggered in situations arising from a declared emergency  Schumer and Corzine  in a letter to the FTC asked for the Commission  s recommendations on the most effective way to strengthen the federal government  s authority in this area     In a letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras Schumer and Corzine wrote    Even before the devastation of Hurricane Katrina  surging gas prices were already a salient issue for the American consumer  Now  with an energy crisis looming  the topic has become even more critical  and Americans are reaching ever deeper into their pockets for this necessary commodity  We fear that some of the fluctuation and inconsistencies in gas prices are a result of price gouging at the pump  Price gouging must not be tolerated and we must do more to make sure that oil companies and gas station owners are operating ethically and within the law  especially in the wake of this disaster
