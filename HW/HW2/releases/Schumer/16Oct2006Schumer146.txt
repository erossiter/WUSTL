IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 16  2006 Schumer Announces New EPA Study Of Contaminated Newtown Creek  Calls For Creation Of Local Heath Registry  Testing For Toxic Oil Vapors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Two Decades Since Nation  s Worst Oil Spill Was Discovered  Greenpoint Residents Remain Vulnerable to Potentially Cancer Causing Vapors   Schumer  EPA  s Newtown Creek Study a Good First Step  Next Step is to Extend Testing to Surrounding Area for Methane and Benzene Vapors  and Create Local Health Registry                                                                                      As one of the world  s largest underground oil spills continues to imperil the health of New York residents  poison the Newtown Creek and financially hinder small businesses and home owners almost twenty years since it was first discovered  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  joined by U S  Representatives Anthony Weiner and Nydia Velazquez  announced a new Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  study of Newtown Creek  the site of the oil spill  In addition to the EPA study  which will assess Newtown Creek  s soil  water and air to determine the oil spill  s health impact on local residents  Senator Schumer is also calling for comprehensive testing to document the prevalence of Methane and Benzene vapors produced by the spill  Senator Schumer also called for the creation of a health registry for local residents following yesterday  s news that four cases of the rare sarcoma bone cancer were identified in Greenpoint  Brooklyn  a neighborhood that sits above the oil spill         This EPA study is a terrific first step toward cleaning up and resurrecting Newtown Creek  which for decades has been a toxic blight on Greenpoint  s community     said Senator Schumer    After letting Exxon Mobil drag its feet on the clean up for more than 35 years  this study will give us more of the documentation we need to hold their feet to the fire             While the oil companies lag in their cleanup responsibilities  the health and safety of Newtown Creek  s residents hang in the balance     said Rep  Weiner     Thousands of homes and businesses are affected by this terrible oil spill   The public has the right to know what effects this oil spill is having on our community and local environment            With record profits and surging gas prices  Exxon Mobil is more than capable of expediting the remediation process  thereby reducing further risk to residents in my Congressional district     said Rep  Nydia Vel    zquez     Not only should the spill be cleaned up  but residents must be fully informed of any environmental and health risks this oil spill might have caused through time          The nation  s largest oil spill was first discovered in 1978 when U S  Coast Guard patrols identified oil slicks on Newtown Creek which runs along the border between Brooklyn and Queens  The oil is believed to have seeped into the waterway following an oil tank explosion in 1950 at the former Standard Oil depot  now Exxon Mobil  While the blast sent at least 17 millions gallons of oil underground  over 55 acres  evidence suggests that the spill may be much more extensive with some estimates putting it as high as 25 30 million gallons  This dwarfs the infamous Exxon Valdez spill of 11 million gallons that ravaged Alaska s coastline  Evidence also suggests Amoco and Chevron facilities may have also contributed to this spill  While the size of the oil spill remains undefined  a conservative estimate identifies 238 homes and 82 businesses  probably in excess of 1000 people who have regular exposure  lie atop it        Despite the magnitude of the oil spill and its health and environmental risks  in 1990  Exxon Mobil won a favorable deal in negotiating a clean up consent decree from the Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC   The deal lacked timelines for cleanup  benchmarks  mitigation measures for residents  and penalties for non compliance  Although the clean up effort recently received good news when the DEC shifted negotiation power for a new consent decree to the New York State Attorney General  s Office in May  residents of Brooklyn and Queens continue to suffer health risks from oil vapors seeping through the soil  Last month  the DEC and Exxon Mobil found elevated levels of cancer causing Benzene and potentially explosive Methane gas near homes in the surrounding community of Greenpoint  Brooklyn  Yesterday  it was a revealed that four cases of the rare Sarcoma bone cancer were identified in the neighborhood  A very unusual type of bone cancer  only 24 cases of Sarcoma bone cancer were reported last year in all of NYC  compared to 10 000 cases of breast cancer        The new EPA study  which was authored by Reps  Weiner and Velazquez is a congressionally mandated study  will focus on the Newtown Creek  examining the effects the spill has had on soil and groundwater  pinpointing how far contaminants from the spill have spread into the New York Harbor  and determining whether Exxon is using the most effective methods to clean up the Creek       Today  Senator Schumer hailed the new EPA study and also announced that in addition to the study of Newtown Creek  he was calling on the DEC to expand their efforts to test resident  s homes for Methane and Benzene soil vapors  Concerned that there is no clear idea on how much  these soil vapors have impacted Greenpoint  Brooklyn and other nearby neighborhoods  Schumer wants testing to be nearly doubled to allow more residents to get testing if they so choose       Schumer also called for testing for Benzene and Methane  chemicals that according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  ATSDR  can cause drowsiness  dizziness  unconsciousness  anemia  and leukemia  In 2004  Riverkeeper  a leading advocate for cleaning up the spill  conducted tests which detected the presence of BTEX  Benzene  Toluene  Ethelbenzen and Xylense   which are chemicals found in gasoline  far in excess of cancerous standards  Riverkeeper argued that the BTEX vapors may be seeping into as many as 100 homes  This year  even Exxon Mobil reported Methane and Benzene vapors coming up through the soil        Finally  Schumer called for the creation of a health registry to evaluate the health impact on local residents caused by the oil spill and vapors  The health registry would focus on residents living above the spill as well as residents in the surrounding areas and residents who have moved out of the community  Voluntary participants would submit detailed health histories for questionnaires  data about local environmental conditions would be collated and blood work would be collected in an effort to more specifically understand the medical predicaments of local residents  Senator Schumer called for a federal public health study to be done in consultation with leading community stakeholders  This would be modeled after the recent collaborative efforts of Mt  Sinai Hospital and the New York State Department of Health  DOH  and Center for Disease  CDC  to study residents and workers downtown after 9 11         Senator Schumer called on Exxon Mobil to foot the bill for this new health study  by tapping into their record breaking profits last year and the profit of oil resold from Greenpoint  Since Exxon Mobil has begun clean up  they have pumped at least 8 5 million gallons of the salvaged product out of the ground under Greenpoint  This oil is then taken to New Jersey for reprocessing where it is refined and sold as gasoline  home heating oil  or other products  Beginning a study of this scope is estimated to cost at least  500 000 with costs rising in coming years        Under federal law  funding for the study of Newtown Creek will come from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund  The EPA must report its findings by July 12  2007  a year from the day that legislation authorizing the study was signed into law  The EPA is working closely with such relevant state agencies as the Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC   the Attorney General  s Office  and the New York Department of Health
