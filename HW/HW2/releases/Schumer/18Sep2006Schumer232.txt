IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 18  2006 Schumer  Fed Paralysis Undermines Ability To Stop Large Bombs From Being Built    Demonstrated Ability Of NYPD To Build 2400 Lb Ammonium Nitrate Bomb With Ease Shows Need For Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Simple Three Point Plan Could Prevent Future Attacks  ID checks at point of sale   taggant  identifiers placed in all ammonium nitrate  and tracking trucks that carry hazardous materials   Schumer led fight to require taggants after  95 Oklahoma attacks and   96 Atlanta Olympic pipe bombing    Announces new push                                                                                 In light of last week s revelation that New York Police Department officers were able to purchase over one ton of ammonium nitrate and build a bomb with no restrictions  Schumer today renewed his call to restrict the purchase of ammonium nitrate  Even eleven years after the bombing of the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City  sales of ammonium nitrate    the explosive fertilizer most commonly used in truck bombs    continue without restriction  and efforts to put inert tracers called  taggants  into the chemicals have gone nowhere       Schumer today unveiled his plan to require these tracers in all ammonium nitrate and to mandate ID checks and  sales records for anyone purchasing large amounts of the explosive compound        This time it was the NYPD building a bomb and driving it around New York to demonstrate how wide open we are to an attack  but we may not be so lucky next time   Schumer said   The fact that two NYPD detectives  with no knowledge of bomb making were able to create an enormous and lethal bomb from directions found on the Internet should serve as yet another wake up call  The least we could do is take some commonsense  simple steps to know who is buying this explosive and where it is going        Ammonium nitrate is one of the most common farm fertilizers in the world  and instructions for turning it into a bomb are widely available on the Internet  The truck bomb that destroyed the Alfred R  Murrah Oklahoma City federal building in 1995  killing 168  used a combination of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil  According to news  reports  during the NYPD s recent Operation Kaboom  technicians mixed a small amount of fuel oil with the fertilizer to render it combustible and detonated it on the NYPD firing range       In the wake of the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993  then Congressman Schumer proposed requiring  taggants      identifying chemical markers   to be used in all explosives manufactured or sold  in the United States  Taggants aid in tracing explosives used in bombings because they allow law enforcement officials to determine based on debris exactly where and when the materials were manufactured and purchased  With technological advances over the last decade  taggants can now be made out of inert  microscopic beads containing laser engraved identifying codes       In 1996  Schumer succeeded in getting a federal study of the potential of taggants to fight terror  That federal report was released in 1998 by then US Treasury Undersecretary Raymond Kelly  who is now the Commissioner of the New York Police Department  That report  prepared by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms  found   great promise   in combating terrorism by putting taggants in explosives and  after  examining the use of taggants in Switzerland over 17 years  found  no safety concerns at all   Also in 1998  a National Academy of Sciences panel of scientists and security experts recommended that Congress require that buyers of ammonium nitrate provide identification and that stores keep records of the purchases       Because of the growing threat from vehicular bombs in New York  since 2004 Schumer has led efforts to require taggants to be added to ammonium nitrate  the combustible fertilizer used in truck bombs  After the NYPD announced the results of their bomb making experiment  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly was quoted as saying    The operation demonstrated that safeguards are needed to make it harder to acquire bomb building materials and easier to regulate and track their sales        Schumer today announced his plan to restrict sales of ammonium nitrate and prevent its use in terror plots       First  Schumer today sent a letter to Congressional conferees on the DHS appropriations bill  urging them to include a provision to mandate taggants in ammonium nitrate and spend federal funds to avoid cost increases for farmers  Almost all ammonium nitrate in this country is sold to farmers who use it for fertilizer  and they should not have to bear any increased cost for the safe and legal use of a product that is central to their livelihood  Even though requiring taggants would have a minimal marginal cost to ammonium nitrate producers  Schumer is calling for giving federal funds to ammonium nitrate producers to prevent any cost increase to farmers  Because the DHS appropriations bill is already in conference committee  adding a taggant requirement now would allow the measure to be quickly passed into law       Second  Schumer also called for requiring identification for sales of ammonium nitrate  and requiring sellers to keep sales records and to be registered with the Department of Homeland Security  Currently  any  individual can purchase unlimited amounts of ammonium nitrate throughout most of the United States  New restrictions on ammonium nitrate sales are a part of the bipartisan Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Act of 2006  which Schumer cosponsored and is currently working to get passed on the Senate floor       Third  Senator Schumer has been a leader in creating security regulations for trucks that carry hazardous materials  hazmat  like ammonium nitrate  Schumer was an original co sponsor of legislation in the Senate  S  1052  to encourage the use of wireless communications in hazmat trucks  to require that TSA review and approve security plans from any hazmat carrier  and to require hazmat trucks to have specific written route plans  These measures were added by unanimous consent to last week s port security bill  which passed the Senate without objection on Thursday        There s an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  Ammonium nitrate is available  it s easy to get  and it s relatively easy to make into a bomb  We shouldn t be stopping people from selling it  but it shouldn t be so easy to get either   Schumer said
