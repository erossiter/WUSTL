renewed  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer explained today  Schumer discussed new plans to renew the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program  that has served as a safety net for dairy farmers  protecting them from wildly fluctuating milk prices  The MILC program officially expired on September 30th and without a legislative extension all payments will be terminated         With gas prices through the roof  New York  s dairy farmers are having a hard enough time and deserve a helping hand     Schumer said    Unfortunately  there are economic conditions we cannot control when it comes to the price of milk  The good news is we can help farmers endure the financial risks caused by unstable prices  It  s time to roll up our sleeves and leave no stone unturned until we get this program funded again          Introduced in the 2002 Farm Bill  the MILC program has helped dairy farms to survive artificially low prices by providing over  180 million in benefits to New York farmers  The current MILC program provides payments to eligible dairy farmers when the price of Boston Class I milk falls below  16 94 per hundredweight  cwt   Payments are issued for up to a maximum of 2 4 million pounds of milk per dairy operation per year       Schumer today released county by county  detailing how much money farmers in each county have received from the MILC program            In the

of a bipartisan proposal to extend the current MILC program  without cuts  for two years and double the annual production cap to 4 8 million pounds  a plan that could mean millions more in relief for New York  s dairy farms  It is estimated that raising the cap from 2 4 million pounds to 4 8 million pounds would increase eligible participation by New York dairy farmers in the MILC program from 72  of production to 84  of production       Last week  the Agriculture Committee was set to vote on a plan to cut agriculture spending by  3 billion  including a provision to extend the MILC program for two years at reduced levels  Along with other farm payments  the program would be cut 2 5   In addition  the rate of compensation for low milk prices would be reduced       Schumer today said he would leave no stone unturned until the program is renewed  He will work with a bipartisan coalition of Senators  including Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT   Mark Dayton  D MN   Arlen Spector  R PA   and Norm Coleman  R MN  and others to aggressively lobby the Agriculture committee to include an extension of the program in the Agriculture Budget Reconciliation Act  currently pending before the Committee  The Agriculture Budget Reconciliation bill is intended to resolve spending conflicts between the federal budget and the spending amounts allocated by Congress  Right now  the Committee is charged with cutting  3 billion from the 2006 budget       In light of statements of support from by President George W  Bush during his reelection campaign  and a recent endorsement of the program  s extension by Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns  Schumer called on Johanns to take an active role in making sure Congress passes an extension  Last Thursday  Johanns said Administration is committed to the MILC program so Schumer today wrote to him  urging the Administration needs to be more aggressive in securing this provision in the Agriculture Budget Reconciliation Act        Large price swings remain a real threat to farmers     Schumer said    Now is the time to stand by our farmers  not gut the very programs that help them maintain their livelihood           Click here to view
