IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 21  2007 Schumer Announces DOJ Approves Death Benefits For Capital Region Resident Kathleen Shea   Hails It As Huge Step To Ensure Family Members Of Fallen Firefighters Across The Nation Receive Just Compensation                                                                                                                                                                                                      Despite Being Entitled to Federal Death Benefits Under 2003 Hometown Heroes Law  Shea Family was Denied Benefits by the Department of Justice DOJ had Inexplicably Claimed that Chief Shea   and Scores of Other Families Across the Nation  were Ineligible for Benefits Because Response to an Emergency was  Routine  After Schumer Argued that Responding to a Fire is  Inherently Non Routine   DOJ has Promptly Reversed Original Denials on Appeal  Awarding Benefits to Four Families Across the Nation  including Two in the Capital Region Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that Kathleen Shea  the widow of the fallen Elsmere Fire Chief Kevin Shea  will receive death benefits from the Department of Justice  DOJ   Death benefits for the Shea family had been inexplicably blocked by the DOJ after the agency claimed that Chief Shea s death occurred during so called routine activity  and therefore his family was ineligible for receiving the federal death benefits under the Hometown Heroes law    But in October  Schumer took part in a Senate Judiciary Hearing  pushing the DOJ to reverse its decision and to grant the Shea family benefits  Schumer argued that responding to a fire is inherently non routine and therefore Shea s family  along with other families of fallen firefighters across the nation  should be granted death benefits    Schumer today hailed the news and said it was a huge step forward in ensuring that the families of fallen firefighters across New York State and the entire nation receive the death benefits they re entitled to  In the wake of Schumer  s arguments  the DOJ has promptly reversed its decisions on four cases  awarding benefits to the respected families     DOJ s reversal on Shea s case comes only two weeks after the Justice Department reversed its original decision on another Capital Region case involving death benefits for the family of Assistant Chief Michael Falkouski of Rensselaer  who died while responding to a fire     This Thanksgiving the Shea family can take solace in the fact that it will finally receive the death benefits it is entitled to due to the heroic efforts of a fallen family member  said Senator Schumer  In recent weeks  we ve seen the DOJ acknowledge how it wrongfully  and tragically  misinterpreted the 2003 Hometown Heroes law  misconstruing a law that was designed solely to assist the family members of brave heroes who died in the line of duty  I m optimistic that families of fallen firefighters across New York State and the entire nation will now receive the benefits they re entitled due to the heroic efforts of fallen family members     Schumer is an original sponsor of the 2003 law which extends federal benefits to the survivors of career and volunteer firefighters  police officers and other first responders killed by heart attacks or strokes while on duty  Even though Shea died from such conditions while on duty  the Justice Department earlier this year denied federal death benefits for his family because it claimed that the firefighters  deaths occurred during so called routine activity     However  Schumer has argued that responding to an emergency  working at the scene of a fire  and the immediate period afterward is inherently non routine and places the human body under irregularly high stress levels     In April  Schumer sent a letter to Domingo Herraiz  Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance  and pointed to the 2003 law and argued responding to a fire or emergency scene  from beginning to end  is an inherently non routine activity as that term was intended by Congress  and  thus  any stroke or heart attack that occurred while responding would make the families eligible for benefits     In May  Schumer s office met with DOJ officials in Schumer s DC office  Schumer said the initial meeting was an important first step toward reforming the process and securing benefits for these families   The Justice Department needs to carefully re examine their interpretation of the law and their approach to deciding these claims  which is currently at odds with Congress  intent when we passed this law     In October  Schumer invited Susan Falkouski  the widow of Assistant Chief Michael Falkouski of Rensselaer  NY  to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee  and both argued that responding to a fire is inherently non routine  Mrs  Falkouski testified that in a letter she received in March from the DOJ  the agency stated that the act of responding at any hour of the day or night to the scene of a fire event is a routine engagement     Prior to the Judiciary Committee hearing  the DOJ released a directive that further clarified which activities are considered non routine   Among these activities is responding to an emergency call  Domingo Herraiz  Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance  testified that  I have recently provided binding direction to my staff regarding application of this term       this direction makes clear that all responses to emergency calls will be considered presumptively non routine     Since the October hearing  the DOJ has assessed four cases under the Hometown Heroes Act on appeal and reversed their initial denials in all four cases     Schumer today hailed the reversal in the Shea and Falkouski cases as a major breakthrough in ensuring the families of firefighters across New York State and the nation receive the death benefits they re entitled to     Chief Shea s family has also been denied benefits by the DOJ  Chief Shea died when the Elsmere Fire Department responded to an odor of smoke in the Good Samaritan Nursing Home  while the infirmed residents were being evacuated from the building by staff  Though the odor was not due to a serious fire  Chief Shea had no way of knowing that  and responded thinking that he was facing a potential mass casualty incident       Determining that the building was safe  Chief Shea returned to the firehouse momentarily and suffered a heart attack in his car  in front of the station    It was less than forty minutes between the initial call and when Chief Shea was stricken     Chief Falkouski suffered a severe stroke after responding to a fire scene during inclement weather   He furiously cleared ten inches of snow off his car and driveway so he could respond to the crisis   As he was doing so  the first arriving companies reported a heavy fire condition  multiple explosions  and a severely burned civilian  Chief Falkouski drove through the bad  weather conditions as quickly as he could  arrived at the scene  got out of his car  and in the process of putting on his firefighting gear  suffered a stroke   He died later that day     Schumer is an original sponsor of the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of 2003  S 459   introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont  which closed a loophole that prevented families of firefighters and police officers who died in line duty from a heart attack or stroke from collecting federal bereavement benefits  The legislation was signed into law on December 15  2003 and ensured that the surviving families of first responders  who died of heart attacks or strokes in the line of duty  or within 24 hours of a triggering incident while on duty  would be eligible to receive financial assistance  regardless of whether a traumatic injury is present     A study conducted by Harvard University found firefighters face a much higher risk of death from heart attack when battling a blaze  up to 100 times the normal rate  and are more likely to be struck even when they re doing less strenuous tasks  Looking at firefighter heart attack deaths nationwide over a decade  the researchers found that the risk of heart attack is highest when firefighters are working at a fire scene  with increased odds ranging from 10 to 100 times the normal risk of heart attack     Although firefighters spend only 1 to 5 percent of their time putting out fires  32 percent of firefighter deaths from heart attacks occur at fire scenes  the study found  Just as striking  the study found that 40  of firefighter heart attack deaths come while responding to  or returning from  an emergency     The study  published in the New England Journal of Medicine  found that among the approximately 1 1 million firefighters in the United States  of whom about 70  are volunteers and 30  are paid career personnel   about 100 die each year in the line of duty  Nearly half of the deaths that occur while firefighters are on duty are related to cardiovascular events  The study clearly stated that firefighters face an increased risk of illness and death due to cardiovascular disease during periods of intense physical and even psychological stress at work     During his visit to Albany on April 10  Schumer was joined by the families of both the late Chief Kevin Shea of Elsmere and Asst Chief Michael Falkouski of Rensselaer who have had their benefit applications denied   Schumer was also joined by Tom LaBelle of the NYS Assn of Fire Chiefs  David Quinn of the Fireman s Assn of the State of NY  representatives of the NYS Professional Firefighters Assn  and numerous local firefighters
