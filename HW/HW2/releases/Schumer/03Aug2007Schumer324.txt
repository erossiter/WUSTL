up to 400  of Poverty Level   Most Inclusive Standard in the Country     Schumer Beats Back Amendment That Would Have Cut Aid to New York                                                                                            With the clock winding down on a vital health care program responsible for insuring 402 943 New York children  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced Friday that the Senates passage of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  Reauthorization Act will deliver a whopping  456 7 million for New York to preserve and expand health coverage for the states most in need kids  The Schumer backed legislation could expand eligibility to New York families earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty lineby far the most inclusive standard in the nationand add upwards of 300 000 new  currently uninsured kids to the coverage rolls   Barring reauthorization  the CHIP program is slated to expire next month  But the Schumer supported billwhich boosts New York funding for the state administered program by more than 35 percent over last years levelspassed the Senate Thursday night with 68 votes  enough to override a threatened veto by President George W  Bush  In the closing days of debate  Schumer personally helped to beat back an amendment offered by Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky that would have slashed the funding set aside for New York    This is a huge victory for New York families who rely on the Childrens Health Insurance Program to provide basic care for their children  Schumer said  The state of New York is setting the standard for delivering high quality health coverage to the most kids possible  and this funding will ensure that work goes on  Not only will this plan prevent 400 000 New York children from losing their coverage  it also gives our state the resources to insure up to 300 000 more kids    As the skyrocketing cost of private medical plans makes health care insurance increasingly unaffordable for thousands of New York City families  Schumer stressed that the CHIP bill has proved invaluable at easing the burden by offering subsidized insurance for families who have incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid  but who still have trouble making ends meet  In New York City alone  the program insures over 164 000 children  It has helped thousands of children obtain comprehensive health coverage when their families couldnt provide it  However  CHIP is currently at risk of being terminated by September 30  2007 unless the program is reauthorized    New York City is also home to over 200 000 children who currently without any healthcare coverage  Many of these children are already eligible  and many others will be eligible for it under the expanded CHIP bill  which will allow New York to insure children whose families earn an annual income up to 400  above the poverty line  The expansion of this program is particularly vital for New York  where recentlyfor the first time in almost a decadeNew York saw the number of uninsured children rise by 17  between 2004 and 2005   Despite the Presidents threat to veto any expansion to the Children Health Insurance Programclaiming it would pave the way to a universal healthcare systemthe bill enjoys bipartisan support  Additionally  funding states efforts to reach out to children who are not currently enrolled in the CHIP program is a sound public investment  According to the Joint Economic Committee  JEC   individuals without health insurance and access to preventative care tend to have higher rates of serious health problems and more frequently use the more expensive services of emergency rooms and acute care  Research demonstrates that low income children who have health insurance are more likely to have regular well child and dental visits and have fewer unaddressed medical needs when compared to their uninsured counterparts   CHIP is jointly financed by the federal and state governments  and is administered at the state level  Broad federal guidelines allow each state to determine the specifics of its program  including eligibility  benefit packages  payment levels  and administrative procedures  The federal government provides a capped amount of funds to states  who in turn match the amount  For a nominal fee or no cost  CHIP insurance covers doctor visits  immunizations  hospitalizations and emergency room visits for uninsured children under the age of 19
