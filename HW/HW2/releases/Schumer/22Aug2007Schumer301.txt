Crisis    Schumer  New Thinking Needed  Housing Non Profits Must Serve Intermediary Role Once Played by Neighborhood Banks  Otherwise  Crisis in Markets Will Worsen Washington   DCToday  Senator Charles E  Schumer cautioned Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke that the regulators efforts to bring liquidity to tightened credit markets have so far overlooked the harrowing situation in the underlying mortgage market that stoked the credit crunch in the first place  In separate letters to both federal financial market regulators and more than 40 major market players in the subprime mortgage industry  Schumerthe chairman of the Joint Economic Committee  JEC  and the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housingsaid that banks must follow the lead of the U S  Senate  where the appropriations committee approved  100 million for non profit housing groups to help facilitate refinancings  The full Senate is expected to pass the appropriations bill this fall   Preserving liquidityin financial marketsis important  but it does not solve the fundamental problem of the weak and worsening conditions in the mortgage market  particularly the subprime mortgage market  Unfortunately  the regulators have not adequately addressed the seriousness of our mortgage market troublesthus far  Schumer wrote to the regulators  Yet until we deal with the widespread uncertainty about the depth and seriousness of the problems in the mortgage market  we will not ease the crisis of confidence in the broader credit markets  no matter what actions are taken to address the credit crunch   Schumer noted that the prevalence of securitization in the mortgage industry has slice and diced individual home loans  With few of todays lenders holding on to the mortgages they underwrite  borrowers facing resets on their adjustable rate loans frequently have no intermediary to negotiate with on the terms of a potential workout  Schumer has supported the empowering of non profit agencies  sanctioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  to play this role of facilitator  These groups are on the front lines providing foreclosure prevention assistance to borrowers  but are increasingly stressed for resources as demand for their services grows Earlier this spring  Senator Schumer fought to ensure that  100 million in foreclosure prevention assistance was included as part of the HUD spending bill   Today  he called upon banks  lenders and loan servicers to follow the Senates example and direct resources to the non profits on the frontlines of the mortgage crisis  This steptogether with a temporary lifting of the cap on Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs portfolio  allowing them greater flexibility for refinancingswould provide a comprehensive solution to stave off the looming foreclosure spike  Schumer said   This crisis does not call for a bailout of borrowers  but it does demand a new way of refinancing a borrower that could have been accomplished simply by the borrower going to their neighborhood bank twenty years ago  Schumer wrote to Paulson and Bernanke   Since 2005  the number of subprime loans has more than doubled  In both 2005 and 2006  approximately 3 million subprime loans were made  as compared to 6 7 million in 2006  resulting in  1 2 trillion in outstanding debt by the end of last year  It is estimated that at least one in five subprime loans will end in a lost home   Market experts estimate that up to 40  of current subprime borrowers could now qualify for prime  fixed rate loans  making the crisis one that could be curtailed by strong efforts to assist borrowers  Not only will such efforts save thousands of families from losing their homes  it will also prevent further damage to the already weak housing market and the economy overall   Over the next two years  nearly 2 million homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages will experience payment shocks as their loans reset in a weakening housing market  a harbinger of more foreclosures to come Acting to prevent these foreclosures is not only important fromthe perspective of protecting entire communities  but it also makes good economic sense Foreclosures can cost up to  80 000 for all stakeholdershomeowners  neighbors  cities and local governments  lenders  and loan servicers  Meanwhile  estimates suggest that foreclosure prevention counseling can costas little as 1 000 per household  To be successful these programs require one on one counseling with the homeowner and negotiations with a variety of stakeholders  making them very resource intensive  The rising wave of subprime foreclosures has caused existing programs to become overwhelmed by requests for assistance  stressing the non profits ability to give troubled homeowners the assistance they need to workout asuitable payment plan with the lenders   Copies of both of Senator Schumers letters appear below                  Ben S

Federal Reserve Bank has taken good steps to restore liquidity to the financial system  but there is still much more that needs to be done to address the risks that we face to our broader economy caused by the ongoing turmoil in the mortgage market  Preserving liquidity is important  but it does not solve the fundamental problem of the weak and worsening conditions in the mortgage market  particularly the subprime mortgage market  Unfortunately  federal regulators have not adequately addressed the seriousness of our mortgage market troubles  Until we deal with the depth and seriousness of the problems in the mortgage market  we will not ease the crisis of confidence in the broader credit markets  no matter what actions are taken to address the credit crunch  It is essential that the Federal agencies overseeing the financial markets use their influence over the major market players to encourage them to engage in a major effort to modify or refinance the loans that have a high probability of defaulting so that the upcoming wave of foreclosures that is anticipated can be abated and market confidence can be restored   UBS estimates that the interest rates on  339 billion in subprime loans underlying mortgage backed securities will reset between the third quarter of 2007 and the end of 2008  The total volume of subprimes that will reset is even larger  It is widely acknowledged that the loans which are about to reset are already performing poorly  with higher than expected default and foreclosure rates  Therefore the reset process is very likely to contribute to higher foreclosure rates  rates which are already alarming  Just yesterday  we learned that national foreclosure filings are 93 percent higher than they were this time last year   If increased foreclosures are allowed to proceed unchecked  the ultimate harm will extend well beyond the families who will lose their homes  Regional housing markets in several states are experiencing high ownership vacancy rates and have large inventories of new homes for sale  In these markets  increased foreclosures will put additional downward pressure on housing prices  and this additional pressure could contribute to spiraling price declines and additional foreclosures  The effects on households  neighborhoods  and the broader economy are likely to be severe  In addition  the continued uncertainty about the credit worthiness of mortgage products  caused in large part by the widespread loss of faith in the integrity and accuracy of credit rating agencies  will continue to spook the financial markets   Over the past several decades  innovations in the mortgage markets have made it much more difficult for too many homeowners to refinance their loans when they need to  Furthermore  the prevalence of unscrupulous lending fueled by the increased appetite for subprime mortgage securitizations has resulted in a growing number of homeowners facing payment shocks as rates reset that could cause them to lose their homes  In order for them to keep their homes  their loans must be modified  Twenty years ago  most of these borrowers could go to the bank that held their mortgage and seek assistance  Today  with their loans sliced and diced into many pieces held by a variety of unaffiliated market participants  there is no one on the scene to help beleaguered homeowners do loan workouts   However  there is a way out of this mess  According to the Center for Responsible Lending and other sources  up to 40 percent of current subprime borrowers could now qualify for safe  prime  fixed rate loans  Fannie Mae has estimated that 80 percent of resetting subprime loans could qualify for a fixed rate prime loan  Our ability and willingness to assist these borrowers is going to be essential to our efforts to prevent the further damage to the housing market  credit markets and overall economy that would otherwise result if their loans are not modified or refinanced  Only a concerted effort by market participants  the administration  Congress  the GSEs and nonprofit foreclosure prevention specialists on the ground can reach all of these borrowers  refinance them into safe loans  and head off this looming crisis   The reality of todays mortgage market calls for new and creative thinking by the regulators  There are many nonprofit groups that are experienced and willing to assist these borrowers  but they are both resource constrained and need the cooperation of the banks  lenders and loan servicers  In addition  there are still financial institutions  mainly regional banks  that do not sell off their mortgages and thus can readily assist their borrowers by refinancing them into safe  fixed rate loans  Commitments have also been made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help refinance homeowners stuck in high interest adjustable mortgages  While the federal government and regulators have largely been reluctant to use these tools to help struggling homeowners in the past  this new type of crisis demands a new type of response  This crisis does not call for a bailout of borrowers  but it does demand a new way of refinancing borrowers who can no longer simply go to their neighborhood banks  as they could have twenty years ago   Therefore  I am urging you to take the following steps to address the problems we face in the mortgage market   First  I respectfully ask that additional federal resources be targeted to HUD certified nonprofit groups currently helping struggling subprime borrowers navigate the complicated nexus of lenders and servicers who control the rights to loan modifications  I cannot stress enough the successes that many nonprofit organizations across the country have had in negotiating for workouts and loan modifications between struggling borrowers and private sector lenders and loan servicers  Senators Sherrod Brown  Bob Casey and I have been working to ensure that the  100 million in foreclosure prevention funding that we have secured in the Senate Committees 2008 appropriations bill is approved this Fall  As you can appreciate   100 million will not go far enough to ensure that the nonprofits helping borrowers will get the resources they need to help their increasing case loads  I urge you to ask the administration to come up with quick additional financing   Second  as mentioned  GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have already made commitments to provide substantial resources for subprime refinancings  I have publicly stated that I will introduce legislation when Congress reconvenes in September to increase the portfolio caps on the GSEs to increase their flexibility to participate in loan modifications with borrowers and lending institutions  I encourage the regulators to act before Congressional action is necessary  and raise these caps to help facilitate more loan modifications   Finally  I urge you to use your leverage over financial institutionswhether banks  lenders  servicers  or brokeragesto encourage them to match the federal governments efforts to provide funding to nonprofit groups working to prevent foreclosures  and to work with the nonprofits to help borrowers who need of loan modifications  Using your influence over the market players in this regard is an acceptable course of action that is urgently needed in todays world  In the past  the regulators have shown no reluctance to jawbone financial institutions to issue more credit  In todays world  the analogous action is asking these same institutions to help accomplish refinancing   I have sent the attached letter to the largest private sector players in the subprime lending industry requesting that they do everything in their power to modify loans or provide refinancing alternatives for loans held by struggling subprime borrowers and help facilitate others to do so  including supplementing the Senates efforts to provide foreclosure prevention funding to nonprofit specialists on the ground  I respectfully ask that you make available any additional federal resources and also join me in strongly urging the major market players to take an active role and help struggling borrowers before they lose their homes    Sincerely    Senator Charles E  Schumer    Enclosure  Letter to Banks and Lenders           Dear Sirs and Madams   I have sent the attached letter to the financial market regulators today to urge them to use their resources  authority and influence to bring about major efforts to modify or refinance the subprime loans that have a high probability of defaulting so that the upcoming wave of foreclosures that is anticipated can be abated and market confidence can be restored  The letter asks them to enlist your cooperation  which I hope will be forthcoming   In addition  so that we can base our legislative responses on fact  I respectfully ask that you respond to the following questions    What      efforts have you made to date to modify subprime loans or help struggling      subprime borrowers  How      many subprime loans have you succeeded in modifying or refinancing over      the last twelve months  What percentage does that represent of the      total loans you service  What percentage of these modifications      extended the initial monthly payment for a period of 60 months or      more  What percentage of these modifications extended the initial      monthly payment for a period of 36 months or more  How      much money have you directed  and over what time period  to HUD certified      nonprofit or community organizations working locally in your markets to      prevent foreclosures and help borrowers with loan modifications  What      specific activities have you funded with these resources  What      percentage of your customer service calls relating to troubled subprime      loans have you been able to assist with one on one assistance  What      language do you provide to your front line modification staff to ensure      that borrowers without legal representation get the same modification as a      borrower represented by an attorney or counselor  What      steps do you plan to take going forward to limit the number of home      foreclosures on loans that you have originated or serviced  What      major obstacles remain to refinancing troubled loans that would benefit      from policy actions taken by the federal government or legislation in      Congress    It is in all of our interests to take steps to avoid the high financial and social costs of foreclosures  We must use all the tools at our disposal to prevent an impending crisis that will threaten our housing market and our broader economy  I look forward to your prompt response   Sincerely    Senator Charles E  Schumer
