IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 14  2007 Schumer Reveals  Recently Revived Port Of Oswego Now Threatened By Increasingly Shallow And Dangerous Channels   Without Immediate Dredging  Ships Will Be Impeded From Entering Port                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Over the Past Several Years  the Port of Oswego has Transformed into a  Growing Economic Engine for Central New York   Number of Tankers Annually Entering Port has Soared to 150 With Silt Build Up Putting Portions of the Port Complex Several Feet Under the Recommended Water Level  Navigating  Waterways  is Becoming Increasingly Difficult for Ships  Several Major CNY Businesses Could Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that the future of the Port of Oswego  which has recently undergone a remarkable revitalization fueling economic growth across Central New York  is threatened by undredged  shallow waterways that constrict access forshipsnavigatingthe port  Over the past three years  the ports popularity with the shipping industry has exploded due to its status as the only deep water port on the U S  shores of Lake Ontario   However  Schumer pointed out that an absence ofroutine maintenancedredging at the portin the lastthree yearshas left it suffering from shallow waterways that are increasingly treacherous for ships to navigate In some portions of Oswego Harbor  the water level is3 to 4 feetbelowthe recommended depth Schumer warned that unless the Army Corps immediately redirects additional funding to dredge the Port of Oswego  its recent revitalization  as well as anticipated growth  could be jeopardized    For years  the Port of Oswego was hemorrhaging money and essentially dormant  but today this slumbering economic giant has finally awoken  and its resurrection has been nothing short of remarkable  Today  it lures scores of tankers to the shores of Central New York and buoys financial growth across the entire region  said Senator Schumer  However  the ports promising future is now jeopardized by undredged  shallow and dangerous waterways that are treacherous for ships to navigate  Therefore  its essential that the Army Corps immediately dredge the port so it can continue importing success   After consistently losing money for years and seeing minimal activity  the Port of Oswego has undergone a startling rebound in recent years  adding capacity and providing an economic boost across the region So far in 2007  over 150 ships have utilized the Port  many enticed by its standing asthe only deep water port on the U S  shores of Lake Ontario The bulk commodities that pass through Oswego Harbor generate approximately  5 9 million annually in direct revenue and support over 78 jobs    The Port has transformed into a critical asset for retaining existing businesses reliant on shipments and for attracting new growth opportunities to Central New York  Commodities shipped out of the port include soybeans  windmill components  cement  chemicals  ores and minerals  particularly road salt   Some of the major businesses taking advantage of the port throughout Central NY include NRG Energy  Sprague Energy  Cargill  LaFarge Cement and Essroc cement   However  today  Schumer revealed that the Port has gone without dredging since 2004  despitesiltand sediment accumulationat nearly 5 times the recommendedlevel The Army Corp smaintenance dredging plans call forapproximately 33 000 cubic yards  cy  of material be dredged from the Port area every 2 4 years  The dredging is essential to ensuring that navigable channel depths are maintained so ships can smoothly sail through points of entrance and into the port  Today  there is currently an estimated backlog of 159 000 cy of sediment whichhas decreased the depths of shipping berths and channelsbetween 6 inches and several feet    The absence of dredging has left the Port with increasingly shallow areas  especially around key access point for ships  Data shows that the main access pointto the port    thealready narrow Lake Approach Channel  has shrunk to half its size because of silt accumulation In addition  thewater directly in front of the Port s East and West Dockshas grown dramatically shallow  Inan areawhere the recommended water level is 21 feet  the Army Corp s own survey from May  2007found thatseveralareas havedepths between 16 and 17feet   This decrease inwater level has meant that ships hull must carry lighter loads to remain morebuoyant  ThePortofOswego has notedseveral instances where companies hadto add another ship because cargohad tospread out among several vessels    Schumer also emphasized that the longer the Port of Oswego goes without dredging  the more expensive the project becomes  Every year that dredging is not performed more sediment accumulates and the cost of the project rises  The cost was estimated at  635 000 in FY 07  but will rise to  715 000 in FY09 As the water level plummets at the Port of Oswego  the cost for dredging simultaneously skyrockets  added Schumer  Each cubicyard costs between  3 6 to remove    Today Schumer called on the Army Corp to investigate whether there are unused funds to perform the emergency dredging at the port  The area that must be dredged includes a 280 acre outer harbor  3000 feet of federal channel in the Oswego River and the area directly next to the ports piers Ifemergency funds are not found for this project  the Port will have to wait until the passage of the Federal fiscal year 2009 budget  By the time those funds are accessed  it could be another 2 years until the dredging is performed    In Upstate New York we must nurture and grow job creating centers like the Port of Oswego  A relatively modest amount of money can guarantee the continued success of this rapidly growing port  said Schumer
