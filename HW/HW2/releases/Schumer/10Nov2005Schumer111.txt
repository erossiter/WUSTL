Crisis Relief Act Today To Provide Emergency Energy Cost Relief To Hard Hit Districts  Introduce Hybrid Bus Tax Credit For Fuel Efficient School Buses  Increase Weatherization Assistance To Schools   Schumer to Detail Regional Shortfall Today U S  Senator Charles Schumer released a  showing that New York  s school districts are getting hammered by the rising cost of fuels  Across New York State  heating and transportation fuel budgets are up 18  and the average school district faces a shortfall of over  155 000 above and beyond what is budgeted  Statewide  districts budgeted over  63 million more to deal with the increases  and will still be short almost  89 million dollars  To deal with these shortfalls  schools are lowering the building temperature to 67 or 68 degrees  cutting down on field trips  combining or cutting athletic trips  combining bus routes  and even advising students to wear heavier sweaters  Schumer  s survey showed that 86  of New York  s school districts reported a shortfall of some amount  and of the remaining 14  the overwhelming majority said they would have a shortfall but did not report how much          Fuel costs are busting school budgets across New York State and forcing educators and administrators to turn down thermostats  cut down necessary bus routes  and reduce field trips  A choice between books and fuel is not one that any school should have to make  But these dramatic fuel price increases threaten budget stability this year and next year  Around the country some districts are considering going to a four day week and other dramatic cuts  That  s why I  m pushing for the Schools Energy Crisis Relief Act with Senator Harkin  which will give emergency relief grants to the hardest hit districts  This should hopefully smooth the rough waters for New York  s school districts          Schumer today released region by region  detailing how much more school districts in each county could have to pay due to rising energy prices         The average Capital Region school district budgeted over  825 000 on heating and transportation fuel this year and faces an  114 000 short fall  72 school districts in the Capital Region could see an  8 2 million shortfall overall          The average Central New York school district budgeted over  1 2 million on heating and transportation this year and still faces a  127 000 shortfall  57 school districts in Central New York school districts could see a  7 2 million shortfall overall          The average Hudson Valley school district budgeted over  730 000 for heating and transportation this year and still faces a  187 000 shortfall  122 school districts in the Hudson Valley could see a  22 9 million shortfall overall          The average North Country school district budgeted over  340 000 for heating and transportation this year and still faces a  70 000 shortfall  86 school districts in the North Country could see a  6 1 million shortfall overall          The average Rochester Finger Lakes region school district budgeted almost  1 1 million for heating and transportation this year and still faces a  201 000 shortfall  66 school districts in the Rochester Finger Lakes region could see a  13 3 million shortfall overall          The average Southern Tier school district budgeted almost  334 000 for heating and transportation this year and still faces an  81 000 shortfall  89 school districts in the Southern Tier could see a  7 3 million shortfall overall          The average Western New York school district budgeted almost  817 000 for heating and transportation this year and still faces a  295 000 shortfall  80 school districts in Western New York could see an almost  23 7 million shortfall overall        School Energy Crisis Relief Act   In response to the massive increase incurred by districts this year  Senator Schumer is unveiling emergency legislation to help the hardest hit districts  The Act authorizes the U S  Secretary of Energy to provide emergency energy grants to school districts that are struggling with the added and unexpected costs their system must assume due to the recent spike in fuel costs  Each eligible school district would submit an application to the Department of Energy in order to participate in a competitive grant process  The Department of Energy will review the applications and provide grants to high need districts in all 50 states  and will determine the total amount received in each State based on a State  s total population of youth ages 5 17 and their regional fuel cost  as a comparison of the national average fuel cost   The total amount of grant awards that a Secretary makes in each State must equal  in the aggregate  the amount originally determined for that State  The determination of each State  s total will be made using the most recent data from the U S  Census and the Energy Information Administration  U S  Department of Energy        Schumer also said that more needed to be done to give school districts fuel efficient bus options    Over the long term  New York School Districts deserve the option to manage fuel prices by purchasing fuel efficient buses  the same option families have  That  s why I  m introducing a tax credit to spur manufacture of hybrid diesel electric and clean natural gas buses  For our school districts  tax payers  and environment these vehicles are win wins  These buses could save almost half the fuel costs over the life of the bus          Hybrid School Bus Tax Credit   With over 46 000 school buses in New York State  more than any other state  New York districts need fuel efficient options the next time they need to upgrade their bus fleet        Schumer will introduce a  50 000 tax credit for the manufacture of hybrid diesel electric school buses  and clean natural gas vehicles  At the moment  no U S  manufacturer has made a hybrid school bus  despite the 500 000 school buses in the United States that represent a huge market and consume over a billion gallons of diesel fuel a year  Typical school bus fleets are averaging seven to eight miles per gallon  Using plug in hybrid electric technology  fleet managers could realize an increase in fuel economy of 40 to 100 percent       To date  the Hybrid Electric School Bus Project has successfully brought together more than 10 percent of the North American school bus purchasing market  more than 60 percent of the school bus manufacturing sector and several governmental and community agencies to steer the project  This consortium includes New York  s NYSERDA and has agreed to purchase the first 20 hybrid buses  but the manufacturers are waiting for additional funding of  6 8 million to cover certain development costs  New York would receive two of the first round of hybrid school buses  Schumer  s tax credit could act to jump start the bus market  Should the hybrid bus market develop along the lines of the hybrid passenger vehicle market  BAE Systems in Johnson City  near Binghamton could become one of the power train suppliers to the manufacturers        Increasing School Energy Funding    Schumer also called for tripling funding to the State Energy program  Last year the Department of Energy gave  2 4 million to New York out of  30 million to the State Energy program  which can go towards weatherization and modernization of schools and hospitals  The Department of Energy maintains a comprehensive website of techniques and strategies for maximizing energy efficiency specifically by school districts at
