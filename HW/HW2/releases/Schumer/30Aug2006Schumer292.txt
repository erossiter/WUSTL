IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 30  2006 As Senate Authorizes New Funding For Autism  Schumer Visits University Of Rochester  s Autism Program To Urge House To Do Same So Bill Can Become Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator  Joined By Leading Researchers And Families Affected By the Autistic Spectrum  Announce Passage of Senate Legislation Funding Autism Research  Education   University Of Rochester Is One Of Eight Autism Research And Treatment Centers Nationwide Created By The Federal Government   Schumer Pushes House to Vote on Bipartisan Combating Autism Act  Which Would Provide  860 Mil U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today met with leaders of the University of Rochester  s renowned autism disorders program  where he announced the Senate s unanimous approval of the Combating Autism Act  which would authorize  860 million over five years to increase and coordinate federal autism research and education   In early August  the bill unanimously passed the Senate  Now Schumer will push the House of Representatives to do the same so that the bill can become a law  The Combating Autism Act would create a national education program for both doctors and the public about autism  provide grants to states for autism screening  create a new National Institutes of Health  NIH  center of excellence for research on autism  and create a nationwide autism data clearinghouse   Additionally  the bill would facilitate the collaboration of individuals and groups who are working on autism  extend the activities of the Autism Coordinating Committee to manage the efforts of various federal health agencies  and require the NIH to create a strategic plan to combat autism  Nationwide  autism has a tremendous impact on the lives of children and their families   The rate of autism diagnoses has grown in the past few decades  with 1 out of every 166 children now being diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder         Autism is a nationwide epidemic that has lived in the shadows for too long     Schumer said     The University of Rochester  s nationally recognized autism programs help hundreds of children and their families every year cope with the devastating affects of autism  but they need more help   Our bill would not only provide critical funds to schools and other organizations as they help families affected by autism receive counseling and education  but would also give public and private researchers the tools they need to find a cure for this developmental disorder          The University of Rochester is one of eight prestigious universities that are part of a national autism research and treatment network created by the federal Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee  IACC   which was established by the Children  s Health Act of 2000   The IACC is made up of leaders of federal agencies involved in autism research and services  including five NIH institute directors   The University of Rochester  s autism programs also provide behavioral consultation  parent and staff training  and technical assistance to families  schools and developmental agencies  Recently the autism program has expanded to include research into the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders        Studies by the U S  Centers for Disease Control   Prevention suggest that the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders has significantly increased  from approximately four in 10 000 children born in the early 1990s to as many as one in every 166  children born today  Despite its strikingly high prevalence  autism research remains one of the least funded areas of medical research by both public and private sources  Currently  the causes of autism are unknown and there are no specific medical treatments for autism  or a cure   Furthermore  physicians have no blood test or diagnostic scan that can definitively diagnose autistic spectrum disorders       The Combating Autism Act would create a national education program for doctors and the public about autism  provide grants for statewide autism screening  create a NIH center of excellence for research on autism  and create a nationwide data clearinghouse   Additionally  the bill would increase the collaboration of individuals and groups who are working on autism  extend the activities of the Autism Coordinating Committee that manages efforts of various federal health agencies  and require the NIH to create a strategic plan to combat autism       Schumer was joined today by Evan Nagel  and his mom Sharon  Evan is a senior at Brighton High School  and has been diagnosed with Asberger  s Syndrome  a form of autism  Evan is applying for college  and the school is working with him on his college applications and entrance exams  Also joining Schumer will be Beth Bullen and her two sons who have been diagnosed with autism  Donald  9  and Paul  7   Beth is a nurse at Strong Memorial Hospital  and credits early intervention and education programs with helping her children with their social skills  Also joining Schumer will be Dr  Susan Hyman of the Strong Center for Developmental Disabilities and Dr  Patricia Rodier  Director of the Rochester s NIH Collaborative Program of Excellence in Autism and Rochester  s NIH Studies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment Center
