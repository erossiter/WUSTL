IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 30  2006 Schumer Visits Riverwright Ethanol Project To Unveil New Ethanol Tax Credit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator  This Is A Win Win Win For Western New York    Paving The Way For New Jobs  Using Local Crops  And Lowering The Price Of Gas    Schumer  s Legislation Provides Tax Credit For Building Ethanol Plants In Places Such As New York With High Consumption  Low Production   With Ethanol Production Set To Begin In September 2007  RiverWright Hopes To Eventually Buy 40 Million Bushels U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today visited the RiverWright Ethanol Project and unveiled his new ethanol tax credit legislation  Schumer  s bill will provide tax credits for building ethanol plants in places such as New York where there is high consumption and low production  In order to increase domestic production of ethanol plants in New York and other states that consume a lot of fuel and produce little  Schumer will introduce The Ethanol Stimulus Act of 2006  a new tax incentive that would benefit non traditional producers of ethanol  The tax incentive would allow a larger depreciation schedule for new ethanol facilities to states that produce less than two percent of the entire ethanol supply yet consume 2 percent or more of the total gasoline purchased in America         This summer we have had near record high gas prices in Western New York     Schumer said    New Yorkers are getting hit harder than most Americans at the gas pump  The bottom line is  in order to solve this problem we need encourage more domestic production of ethanol in states like ours that don  t produce but do use ethanol  The RiverWright ethanol project will bring cutting edge technology and put Western New York at the forefront of ethanol and next generation fuels production in the Northeast  This is a win win win for the region and will pave the way for new jobs  use our own local crops and bring down the price at the pump           Since New York does not yet produce ethanol  the state is reliant either on limited domestic supply or on the more expensive foreign supply of it  which makes up 10 percent of each gallon of gas  To combat this  next week Schumer will introduce The Ethanol Stimulus Act of 2006 to create a new tax credit designed to spur ethanol production in states that consume more than two percent of U S  gasoline  but produce less than two percent of U S  ethanol  For new production facilities in these states  this bill would give new producers in these states a tax credit of 20 cents per gallon on the first 50 million gallons produced a year  as long as the plant  s total annual ethanol production does not exceed 150 million gallons  To be eligible for the new credit  the contract to build the plant must be entered into between August 8  2005  the date of enactment of last year  s energy bill  and August 8  2010   A production facility is eligible for the credit for a total of five years         Everyone is feeling the pain at the pump these days     Schumer continued    Without immediate and concrete efforts by the federal government to help produce more ethanol domestically  we could see 4 dollar a gallon gasoline  drastically increased airline tickets  and the average American family will be stuck with the bill           Schumer visited the site of the RiverWright LLC  s  80 million ethanol manufacturing project that will add to Buffalo  s industrial waterfront business base  It will utilize more than 20 existing buildings including four grain elevators  two former flour mills and a malting house  Located on an 18 acre parcel along the Buffalo River  the plant is expected to produce 110 million gallons of ethanol annually  As many as 60 lake freighters a year are expected to serve the plant  delivering some of the 40 million bushels of corn the ethanol plant will use for production  RiverWright will break ground this September on the site which includes 20 existing buildings  and ethanol production is set to begin in September 2007  with 65 full time permanent jobs  They have the potential to sell 100 million gallons of ethanol annually and 400 000 tons of feed grain annually  and 24 separate rail lines enter the property       Schumer was joined by Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown  and from RiverWright  Rick Smith III and Kevin Townsell  Schumer also stood with the AutoMobius  one of Buffalo  s art cars which operates on 10   Ethanol blend  This fuel blend contains more oxygen than petroleum only based gasoline which improves combustion and reduces emissions of harmful compounds such as carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide  and carcinogens like benzene and toluene  A 10   ethanol blend reduces particulate matter emissions by 50 percent  carbon monoxide emissions by 30 percent and emissions of other toxic compounds by 13 percent
