IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 18  2007 Schumer  Clinton Urge VA To Implement Cutting Edge Genetic Research Program At Ualbany     Program Would Make Capital Region A National Center In Biotech                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Despite Contract for Innovative Genebank Project being Signed by SUNY Albany and the VA in December of 2003  Program Still hasn t been Implemented Genebank Project Would Accelerate Identification of Genetic Linkages to Disease  Enhance the Medical Research Program at the VA and Create Jobs and Investment in the Cap Region Schumer  Clinton  in Letter to Veteran Affairs Se In a letter to Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Nicholson  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the VA to act on a previously agreed upon genebank program at the University at Albanys Center for Functional Genomics  The program  originally delineated in a contract signed by University of Albany and the VA in December of 2003  would establish a biorepository of blood samples for genomic and proteomic analyses  Since the 2003 agreement  despite several requests by University of Albany to have the program implemented  the Department of Veterans Affairs has failed to act   It is absolutely ridiculous that this innovative and job creating program has been stalled for so long said Schumer  This project has the potential of not only accelerating the identification of genetic linkages to diseases and the development of new therapies  but also of significantly enhancing the medical research program at the VA and creating jobs in the Capital Region  I will continue to fight tooth and nail for its immediate implementation   New York State  SUNY Albany and the scientists involved have been working for the last four years to get this important project underway  It is time for the VA to do the same and allow for this critical research to commence  According to SUNY Albany  this project would represent the most comprehensive genebank in the United States  Continued delay by the VA risks having the United States advancement in biotech lag behind the world scientific community  said Senator Clinton     A copy of the letter sent to Secretary Nicholson follows   Dear Secretary Nicholson   We write to request your assistance with the implementation of a genebank program  which  as we understand it  would establish a biorepository of blood samples for genomic and proteomic analyses  and which was reportedly delineated in a contract signed by the Research Foundation of the State University of New York on behalf of the University at Albany and Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  in December 2003  According to the University at Albany  the genebank has been held in abeyance by the VA since that time  despite their anticipation that the program would begin shortly after the signing of the 2003 agreement    According to the University at Albany  in 2002  Dr  Paulette McCormick  a researcher at the University at Albany  and at that time the Director of Genomic Research for the Stratton VA Medical Center  submitted an executive summary proposal to the VA Central Office of Research and Development  ORD  in Washington  D C  After review by the Office of Research and Development  we are told  Dr  McCormick was asked to submit a full application  which she did in collaboration with senior staff at the Stratton Medical Center and VA VISN2 in April 2003    We have been informed that this agreement would authorize VA medical centers to begin to collect blood samples through an informed consent process  to remove identifying information about the donors  and then to send the samples to the University at Albanys Center for Functional Genomics for analysis  The University at Albany would then provide DNA analysis of these samples to medical researchers focusing on VA approved medical research  The University at Albany believes that this project holds the potential of not only accelerating the identification of genetic linkages to diseases and the development of new therapies  but also of enhancing significantly the medical research program at the VA and creating jobs in upstate New York through the establishment of a cluster of new research and manufacturing companies in the life sciences    The University at Albany has informed us that despite repeated requests to begin implementation of this project  the VA has not permitted it to do so  The University at Albany believes that it has complied with all of terms of both the 2002 Cooperative Technology Administration Agreement  CTAA  and the 2003 Genebank Agreement  including by    Submitting semi annual reports to the VA      Receiving approval for HIPAA and Informed Consent protocols from the Stratton VAs Medical Research and Development Committee and Institutional Review Board      Receiving a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institute of Health  and     Receiving approval from the VA Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service for the banking of blood samples and associated clinical data     Additionally  it is our understanding that New York State has committed up to  10 million for start up costs associated with the genebank project and secure space has been reserved at the Cancer Center at the University at Albany for the effort    According to the University at Albanys  while they have made repeated requests to commence the project as well as complied with all existing agreements  the Department has not fully implemented this partnership  In fact  the University at Albany has expressed concern that the Department may be using the concepts developed by Dr  McCormick to establish a gene bank in another location  The ability to identify medically relevant genetic sequences from large populations could help ensure that many cutting edge initiatives in medical research will progress more rapidly  Given the advanced nature of the agreement between the VA and the University at Albany  we urge you to resolve the issues regarding implementation of the genebank program at the University at Albany  in short order   Thank you for your consideration  We look forward to hearing back from you    Sincerely   Charles E  Schumer Hillary Rodham Clinton
