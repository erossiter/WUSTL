                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            New York has 22 million FEWER Square Feet of Office Space than it did before 9 11  Something We Cannot Settle For   Urges Bloomberg to Focus on Jobs  Silverstein to Fill World Trade Center 7 Today  U S  Senator Charles E Schumer made the following statement on redevelopment at Ground Zero  Schumer has long emphasized a need for more office space to keep pace with the growing office sector in New York  Schumer put together the   Group of 35     a blue ribbon committee of business and labor leaders and economic development experts that set forth a bold plan to greatly expand NYC s commercial office space capacity over the next few decades       Below is the statement as prepared for delivery         I share the concerns recently expressed by Mayor Bloomberg that the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan is not moving fast enough  I have long been a critic of the   culture of inertia    that often grips this City and stops important projects from moving forward  However  I strongly disagree with Mayor Bloomberg  s contention that we ought to reconsider the plan to build 10 million square feet of office space at Ground Zero       New York needs jobs and economic growth above all  For us  office buildings are our   factories     They are at the center of economic growth and job creation in New York  Without them  we will not create the jobs we need to ensure our City  s prosperity and preeminence  Without those jobs  the demand for housing  retail and other services will inevitably decline        And we must plan many years ahead to create those jobs  Right now there are 22 million fewer square feet of office space in Lower Manhattan than before 9 11  Do New Yorkers want to resign themselves to a city that is shrinking and has fewer of the kind of jobs that fuel our economy  We have learned in the past that if you don  t plan for office space for the future  supply grows scarce  rents skyrocket  and companies flee for New Jersey  Florida  Texas or overseas  I am an optimist and I have faith in New York  s ability to grow and create many new jobs  but we must do all we can to create the conditions that make this growth a reality        Furthermore  the Lower Manhattan site has been designed specifically to spur commercial growth  While I share the desire of so many New Yorkers to build more housing  especially affordable housing for working and middle class families  there are many other suitable sites for housing in the City  There are precious few sites  however  that have the kind of infrastructure in place to support major commercial development       Lower Manhattan must remain a major business district and employment center  It remains one of the few areas in the City where it will be possible to obtain large blocks of commercial space  right near a major transportation nexus  which will further enhance the area  s attractiveness for commercial development  We have been able to obtain an unprecedented  4 6 billion in Federal funds to improve and expand the transportation infrastructure in Lower Manhattan to move large numbers of workers in and out of the area  We are making these major public investments to spur commercial development and job creation       I would urge the Mayor to reexamine his position  I agree we need to get things moving at Ground Zero    and FAST  but to abandon office space at a time when Wall Street is growing again  Goldman Sachs  a major employer  has just agreed to build a new 2 1 million square foot headquarters building downtown in Battery Park City  does not make sense  Our City needs more major investment like a Goldman and new commercial space is one of the best ways to make that happen       But the burden also falls on Larry Silverstein to find tenants quickly for World Trade Center 7 and thus demonstrate the demand for commercial space downtown  Larry Silverstein deserves credit for all his efforts at Ground Zero  but as long as World Trade Center 7 remains empty  those of us pushing for more commercial development downtown remain at a major disadvantage in making our case  Silverstein should do everything he can  including lowering rents if necessary  to attract major tenants to the building        At the same time  I call upon the Port Authority to lead the charge and move into World Trade Center 7 from its current offices further uptown  As the agency responsible for building the original World Trade Center  it is only fitting that the Port Authority return to the site as soon as possible       Our shared goal must be to have signed leases in place for all 1 7 million square feet of office space in World Trade Center 7 by 2007       Creating jobs is my highest priority for Lower Manhattan and all of New York  and I stand ready to work with the Mayor  Governor  Port Authority and Larry Silverstein to do whatever I can to ensure our City keeps growing and prospering
