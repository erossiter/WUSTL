                                      Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer met with local growers  dairy farmers  and other members of the agricultural communities in Orange and Sullivan counties to discuss the upcoming Farm Bill  In response to years pastwhen the needs of farmers and the agricultural community in Upstate New York and the Northeast have been left behind in favor of major agriculture conglomerates in the Midwest and on the West CoastSchumer sponsored comprehensive farm legislation to provide targeted relief to upstate New York farmers   The so called Northeast Marker Bill will ensure that the leaders on the farm bill cannot ignore the unique needs of Orange and Sullivan County farmers  The legislation will support small farmers  dairy producers  and growers of specialty crops  It will expand specialty crop funding  promote government purchases of fresh fruit and vegetables  and improve crop insurance to ensure that the types of diverse farm operations in the region have access to better risk management tools  expand the MILC program   Agriculture and farming are critical to the Hudson Valley economy and we need to do everything we can to ensure it stays that way  Schumer said  New York farmers and farmers across the Northeast have unique needs that differ  sometimes significantly  from their Midwestern and West Coast counterparts  which is why I laid out our regions priorities in the Northeast Marker Bill  and why I am going to fight to ensure that the needs and concerns of Upstate New York dont get plowed over in the 2007 Farm Bill    Crop Insurance  Schumers proposal would expand the crop insurance programs to ensure that specialty crop growers are covered and receive a fair share of payments  Although the list of covered commodities has grown in recent years  80  of total policy premiums and federal subsidies are accounted for by just four commodities  corn  soybeans  wheat and cotton  Nearly 56  of payouts go to farmers in four states    Texas  North Dakota  South Dakota  and Oklahoma  Schumers proposal would double the Agricultural Management Assistance program  reauthorize and improve the Adjusted Gross Revenue Insurance Pilot Program  and expand crop insurance incentives to include beginning farmers  as an incentive to enter agriculture   In addition  the bill increases funding for the Agricultural Management Assistance Program and retains the current flexibility of use provision  This bill makes several program improvements including higher levels of coverage  establish a floor to the 5 year income history  and revise the definition of animals to include contract livestock growers  It creates a pilot product that would provide revenue insurance plans to new and beginning farmers  and that offers higher subsidies on crop insurance premiums as incentive to enter agriculture and provides producers with coverage area flexibility to better match their operations     Dairy Safety Net  Schumers legislation includes an extension and expansion of the existing MILC program developed in conjunction with Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand  D NY   It also raises the federal milk marketing orders target price for class I milk to  15 58 hwt  The bill would require USDA to study the economic benefits to producers of establishing two classes of milk  require mandatory reporting of all dairy commodity transactions and establish a loan guarantee program to encourage investment in new processing technologies  The bill will also expand funding for research into and expanded cost share assistance for methane digestion    Conservation  The bill would authorize funding for working lands conservation programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  and the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program  FRPP   Specifically  Schumer would raise funding for EQIP to  2 billion every year  up from  1 3 bill annually and increase funding for FRPP to  300 million  These programs are extremely important to farmers in New York where there is a huge backlog of unfunded applications  Schumers proposal also includes fully funding the Conservation Reserve Program  which removes producing cropland into conservation uses for about 10 years    Energy  In addition to Schumers previous legislation to boost corn based ethanol production in upstate New York  Schumers proposal would provide direct incentives to speed up development of cellulosic ethanol  Specifically  Schumers proposal would reauthorize Section 9008 of the 2002 Farm Bill  which funds research and development on production of bio based fuels  including feedstock production  harvesting  transport  and storage    Market and Economic Development  The bill proposes a new program focused on fostering farm profitability for all producers  The program would be administered through each states department of agriculture  with USDA playing the critical role of ensuring program accountability  State departments of agriculture would distribute grant funds within each state to eligible entities for allowable uses consistent with the priorities and needs identified through state level strategic plans  Program funds could not be used to directly subsidize the price of an agricultural commodity    Honey Bees Population Loss  The bill authorizes  250 million to combat Colony Collapse Disorder that is decimating the bee population in upstate New   York and across the country   Congress is set to reauthorize the provisions passed in the 2002 Farm Bill  which is massive legislation that supports the farming economy across the country  The provisions in the current farm bill will expire on September 30  2007 unless reauthorized  The House of Representatives recently passed its version of the Farm Bill  and the Senate bill is slated to be marked up after the August recess   Agricultural production returned over  3 6 billion to the farm economy in 2005  About 25 percent of the states land area  or 7 55 million acres  are used by the 35 600 farms to produce a very diverse array of food products  Milk is New Yorks leading agricultural product and is produced all across the state  Milk sales account for one half of total agricultural receipts  Production in 2005 was 11 7 billion pounds with a preliminary value of  1 91 billion  placing New York as the nations third leading producer
