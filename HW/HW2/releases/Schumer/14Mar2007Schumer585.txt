IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 14  2007 Schumer Reveals Five New Questions Raised By DOJ Documents   Asks for Full Explanation From White House                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today raised five new serious questions arising from the Department of Justice documents released yesterday to Congress  Schumer today called on President George W  Bush to offer a complete explanation for each of these instances         When it s possible the law was broken  admitting mistakes  but not doing anything about it  does not cut it   Schumer said   Simply apologizing and firing a fall guy is not enough  We need a full accounting from the White House as to what went on here  the resignation of the Attorney General  and a clarification from the President of his role        Senator Schumer s five questions to President Bush are       1  In an email to the White House  Mr  Sampson refers to a  problem  with Carol Lam  What was this  problem  and was Lam s firing motivated by her investigation into former Congressmen Randy Cunningham and Representative Jerry Lewis    a  Gonzales  chief of staff  Kyle Sampson  contacted William Kelley  Deputy Counsel to the President  on replacing Carol Lam  stating    t he real problem we have right now with Carol Lam that leads me to conclude that we should have someone ready to be nominated on 11 18  the day her 4 year term expires      b  Mr  Sampson s email was sent the same day that the Los Angeles Times had broken the news that Ms  Lam s investigation of former Congressman Randy Cunningham  R CA  had expanded to include Representative Jerry Lewis  R CA         2  What was the involvement of the President and members of the White House staff on the removal of these eight U S  Attorneys   a  White House spokespeople have portrayed the White House as having only limited involvement in the plan to dismiss these U S  attorneys  Yet the documents released to the Senate Judiciary Committee clearly show that the idea of removing a group of U S  attorneys originated in early 2005 with Harriet E  Miers  then serving as the President s Counsel  Ms  Miers suggested dismissing all 93 U S  attorneys  Mr  Sampson replied   Harriet  you have asked whether President Bush should remove and replace U S  Attorneys whose four year terms have expired   I recommend that the Department of Justice and the Office of the Counsel to the President work together to seek the replacement for a limited number of U S  Attorneys     3  Who at the Department of Justice was responsible for inserting a line into the USA PATRIOT Act in March 2006 that allows the appointment of interim U S  Attorneys without Senate approval  Did the President know of or approve this effort   a  Documents provided to Congress indicate that  during reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act in March 2006  the Justice Department specifically requested a provision that authorizes the Attorney General to appoint interim U S  attorneys for an indefinite period of time  This provision may have been deliberately exploited   and perhaps even deliberately added to legislation   in order to bypass the Senate confirmation process for U S  attorneys  At  b  Mr  Sampson told Ms  Miers   I strongly recommend that  as a matter of policy  we utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the AG to make USA appointments     By not going the PAS route  we can give far less deference to the home State Senators and thereby get  1  our preferred person appointed and  2  do it faster and more efficiently  at less cost to the White House         4  Was Karl Rove or Ms  Miers involved in lobbying for the appointment of Tim Griffin as U S  Attorney in Arkansas   a  In a letter responding to questions from Senator Schumer dated February 23  2007  the Department of Justice informed Schumer that it was  not aware of anyone lobbying for Mr  Griffin s appointment  and that   t he Department is not aware of Karl Rove playing any role in the decision to appoint Mr  Griffin     b  An email from Mr  Sampson sent an e mail on December 19  2006 contradicts these statements  His email stated   I m not 100 percent sure that Tim was the guy on which to test drive this authority  of the Attorney General to appoint interim U S  attorneys   but know that getting him appointed was important to Harriet  Karl  etc   Please explain any involvement of Karl Rove or members of his staff in the decision to request the resignation of H E    Bud   Cummins III as U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas and to install Tim Griffin in his stead        5  When and why did U  S  Attorney David Iglesias become a target for removal  Was President Bush involved in that decision    a  On March 2  2005  D  Kyle Sampson provided identified David Iglesias in bold type as an individual that Sampson  recommend ed  retaining  based on Iglesias s strong job performance and  loyalty  to the Administration    b  On October 17  2006  Mr  Sampson drew up a list of Attorneys they  should consider pushing out   Mr  Iglesias was not among those names    c  On November 15  2006  Mr  Sampson prepared a detailed  Plan for Replacing Certain United States Attorneys  that lists Mr  Iglesias among the prosecutors to be dismissed by the Department  As you know  in accordance with that plan  the Department contacted Mr  Iglesias on December 7  2006  to request his resignation
