Projections   Schumer to Detail Loan Debt For St As New York college students graduate this month  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer released a new  finding that part time and full time college students in upstate New York will carry  6 43 billion in student loans after they graduate partly due to heavy handed marketing practices by private lenders and banks hiding excessive future loan obligations          Student debt is quicksand    it swallows you up before you have a chance to gain your footing     Schumer said    Graduating from college should kick start a young person  s professional life  but massive debt will just bog you down for decades  Graduates are not only leaving college with a diploma this season  they  re also leaving campus with mountains of debt  At a time when a college education is becoming more and more expensive  we need to make sure students and parents get complete and unbiased information on all of their options  including any and all affordable loans           According to the National Center for Education Statistics  in 2004  67 2  of students who graduated from an undergraduate college or university in New York borrowed money to pay for college  On average  these students graduated with  20 838 worth of student loan debt  Nationwide  the amount of debt from undergraduate loans has skyrocketed  Over the past decade  debt levels for graduating seniors more than doubled from  9 250 to  19 200  a 58  increase after accounting for inflation  Nearly two thirds of students at four year colleges and universities nationwide have student loan debt up from less than one half in 1993       Rising student loan debt can affect a student  s livelihood for decades after graduation  Student loan debt can limit post collegiate career options  delay the purchase of large items like a home or a car  and discourage borrowers from starting a family  In the most extreme cases  burdensome debt can cause some students to default  resulting in lifelong ruined credit        Schumer today released a new  showing how much student loan debt full time and part time college students in each region carry when graduating  Specifically  Schumer found that             Of the 68 389 current undergraduate students in the Capital Region  over the next four years an estimated 45 957 will graduate with  957 660 468 worth of debt            Of the 61 394 current undergraduate students in Central New York  over the next four years an estimated 41 257 will graduate with  859 708 532 worth of debt            Of the 88 298 current undergraduate students in the Rochester Finger Lakes Region  over the next four years an estimated 59 336 will graduate with  1 236 448 903 worth of debt            Of the 89 034 current undergraduate students in the Hudson Valley  over the next four years an estimated 59 831 will graduate with  1 246 755 211 worth of debt            Of the 31 578 current undergraduate students in the North County  over the next four years  an estimated 21 220 will graduate with  442 191 029 worth of debt            Of the 41 340 current undergraduate students in the Southern Tier  over the next four years  an estimated 27 780 will graduate with  578 889 642 worth of debt            Of the 79 239 current undergraduate students in Western New York  over the next four years an estimated 53 249 will graduate with  1 109 594 494 worth of debt       Schumer revealed that major private lenders contract with some universities in a deal that gets colleges more money if they steer their students toward the more expensive private loans  The government  however  is prohibited from using the same system  and cannot provide revenue to schools for each federal loan that the school facilitates  This means the government cannot compete fairly with the private lenders  depriving students of potentially viable and cheaper alternatives        In addition  private lenders hide the actual amounts students will have to pay over the life of the loan and do not disclose onerous late fees and penalties  Under current law  major student loan banks do have to provide an estimate of how much a student will have to pay in total  including interest  in order to pay off the loan   but only after the student has graduated  This leaves students without any real concept of how much more they will have to pay when they sign up for a loan       In response  Schumer today announced a three point plan to combat rising and burdensome student debt            Introduce Legislation to Eliminate Private Lender Kickbacks  Schumer announced that he is going to introduce to a bill to end private lender kickbacks to universities and restrict major private lenders from providing financial incentives to universities that push an individual company  s loan  This will allow students to get the best deal available instead of being pushed toward loans that may be more expensive            Mandate Clearer Disclosure  Schumer  s legislation will also create a new   Schumer Box    that both private and public lenders will be required to include on every loan application package  The box will contain various loan scenarios  different loan amounts  interest rates  and payment periods      and lay out exactly how much a student would have to pay  including interest  in order to pay off the loan             Call For Access to Individualized Debt Projections  Schumer today also wrote to Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Mark Everson and Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings asking them to create a program that would calculate an estimated financial aid package using the average cost of attendance at public 4 year institutions for all households  For example  a family with a household income ranging from  25 000 to  49 000 would be informed that they can receive a grant that covers 65  of the cost of college from the government  but would have to secure loans and or work study to finance the unmet need        The information would be calculated during the annual tax filing process and sent to the filer shortly thereafter so they would have a complete accounting of how much their out of pocket expenses would be for their child  s future college education  The mailings would begin when a child was in the 8th grade and allow families to plan far in advance how much of a loan they may need to take out in order to pay for college       Schumer today also reiterated his call to block the provisions in the current budget proposal that eliminate Perkins Loans  which provide a unique opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students to obtain a low interest loan through their educational institutions  The budget proposal not only eliminates all federal contributions to the Perkins Loans programs  it also rescinds the  7 billion the federal government has given to educational institutions to provide Perkins Loans  canceling all future forgiveness programs  Cutting Perkins loans would leave 62 000 New York students without this critical part of student aid        The federal budget proposal also freezes the maximum Pell grant at  4 050  Unlike student loans  Pell grants do not have to be repaid  and students may use their grants at any one of approximately 6 000 participating postsecondary institutions  In the 2004 2005 school year  Pell grants served 5 3 million students nationwide and 380 000 students in New York State  Pell grant eligibility and the grant amount awarded depend on family income  the cost of attending the institution  whether the student attends full time or part time  and whether the student attends for a full academic year or less  Schumer has repeatedly pushed for an increase to the Pell grant ceiling       Click here to view
