                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           As Nation s Largest Lender Becomes Latest Casualty of Credit Market Turmoil  Schumer Renews Call for Bush Administration to Allow GSEs to Help Ease Liquidity Crisis    Senator Helped Secure  100M For Housing Non Profits To Prevent Foreclosures  Will Fight For Still More Resources From Private  Public Sectors    Schumer  We Cannot Afford a  Wait and See  Approach When it Comes to the Health of Our H As signs of distress continue to mount in the credit marketswith the nations largest lender  Countrywide  forced to draw from its emergency credit facilitySenator Charles E  Schumer today renewed his call on the Bush administration to immediately lift the portfolio cap on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help ease the liquidity concerns in the mortgage markets  Schumer added that if Fannie and Freddies regulator doesnt act soon to temporarily allow the companies to provide more liquidity  he will introduce legislation to do so as soon as Congress reconvenes in early September    We cannot afford a wait and see approach when it comes to a credit crisis that threatens to derail our economy  said Schumer  The Bush administration continues to ignore one tell tale sign after another that the subprime woes are threatening the broader mortgage markets  Fannie and Freddie are uniquely positioned to inject badly needed liquidity into the economy  but the President wont let them do their job  These companies need their caps lifted now  If the Bush administration wont act  we will    Last Tuesday  Senator Schumer wrote a letter to James B  Lockhart III  the director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight  OFHEO   urging him to consider temporarily raising the limit on purchases of home loans by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in response to increasing concerns of a credit crunch spilling into the broader mortgage market  Raising the caps would allow Freddie and Fannie to provide much needed liquidity in a mortgage market that is drying up for all lendersincluding Countrywide  the nations largest mortgage lender     Since OFHEO rejected Schumers request to raise the portfolio caps last Friday  it has become increasingly clear that the deterioration in the mortgage markets has gone from bad to worse  Liquidity is virtually nonexistent for loans that do not conform to Fannie and Freddies portfolio standards  e g   jumbo loans   which is hurting current and aspiring homebuyers ability to access lending  Just this morning  Countrywide Financial Corporation  the largest U S  residential mortgage lender  announced that it has been forced to draw on its  11 5 billion credit facility due to the drying up of liquidity in the secondary mortgage market     News of Countrywides troubles coincided with new reports highlighting the dramatic decline in the U S  housing market  Earlier today  the U S  Commerce Department reported that in July  housing starts declined 6 1   to their lowest level in a decade  Future building permits also fell  suggesting we are far from the bottom of the housing slump  These results  both substantially worse than the poor numbers experts had already anticipated  raise fears that the tumbling housing market is on the verge of dragging the broader economy down with it    If the regulators do not take action to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to perform their critical role as market stabilizer  Senator Schumer plans to introduce legislation in September to temporarily raise the portfolio caps that are serving as impediments to the GSEs ability to preserve liquidity in the market  This emergency measure is not only important to restore confidence in the mortgage market for current and aspiring home buyers  but it would also allow Fannie and Freddie to engage in subprime foreclosure relief efforts across the country before the October surprise of subprime resets further shocks the mortgage markets  One trillion dollars worthof adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs are due to reset between now and November of next year  Fannie Mae has estimated that 1 5 million subprime homeowners who face resetting ARMs and potential payment shocks this year and next would qualify for a safe  fixed rate loan backed by the GSEs    I am disappointed that the administration and the regulators have turned down the calls to consider temporarily raising the GSEs portfolio limits to provide market liquidity at a time when it is most needed to protect American families and the economy from further damage  said Schumer  If these latest market developments do not motivate the administration to act  then I plan to introduce legislation in September that will allow us to use the critical tools we have through Fannie and Freddie to immediately address this crisis    Senator Schumer has been at the forefront of Congressional efforts to contain the subprime market crisis and ensure that irresponsible underwriting of this magnitude is not allowed to happen again  In May  Schumer introduced the first major legislation to deal with unscrupulous lending practices this Congress  the Borrowers Protection Act  which would upgrade standards that mortgage brokers must abide by when making new loans to borrowers    Schumer has also helped to secure  100 million in foreclosure prevention funding that was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee for HUD Housing Counseling programs in the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies spending bill  With these funds  non profit agencies will be able to provide individual counseling by working one on one with borrowers who are in unsuitable subprime loans  Schumer has vowed to continue fighting for additional resources from both the federal government and the private sector to equip foreclosure prevention groups working on the front lines to keep homeowners in their homes
