IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 15  2005 Schumer To Justice Department  Courts In Danger  Witnesses And Judges Are Unprotected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator pushes Attorney General Gonzales to immediately launch top  to bottom review of courthouse security  restore funding to witness protection program    Schumer  The courts exist so justice can be served  that system breaks down if judges and witnesses are being killed As new loopholes are being exposed in courthouse security  as most recently illustrated evinced in Atlanta  and major cuts to the federal witness protection system are revealed in an Inspector General report  Senator Charles E  Schumer today  on the Justice Department to thoroughly review staffing needs in the federal witness protection program and to study courthouse security and make immediate recommendations to ensure judges can carry out their duties without fearing for their lives  Schumer  s letter comes on the heels of an audit of the US Marshals Service  s administration of the witness protection program that showed staffing has been cut 25  over the past 8 years while the number of witnesses and their families have climbed 12  in that time         The courts exist so that justice can be served  The system is broken if judges and witnesses are being killed and don  t have the peace of mind that they will be protected from violent criminals     Schumer said    I  m urging the Justice Department to remedy the understaffing of one of our most critical federal programs to protect the rule of law and hope they can answer fundamental questions about security in our courts          In the last two weeks one judge and a judge s family were brutally murdered by individuals who had appeared before them in court  Judge Lefkow  a federal judge sitting in the Northern District of Illinois  came to home to find her husband and mother shot to death  Apparently  a criminal defendant in one of her cases had found her home  snuck inside  lain in wait  and killed her husband and mother because he was unhappy with the way he was treated in Judge Lefkow s courtroom  Then  last week another judge  along with various court personnel  were murdered in open court because of lax security in a courthouse in Atlanta  Georgia       Schumer  in his   asked Gonzales to answer the following questions        What is the current level of funding for courthouse security  i e  number of magnetometers  private security guards  law enforcement  barricades  etc    Are theses levels adequate or should they be increased            Should personnel  private or law enforcement  be permitted to carry weapons in courthouses            What resources are currently used for assessing threats to judges and prosecutors and how can such threat assessments be improved            What is the training of law enforcement and other courthouse personnel with respect to violent offenders and what equipment and resources do they have at their disposal  What improvements can be made to the training of court personnel and law enforcement to prevent future acts of violence in courthouses       As the Inspector General report revealed today  there is also a potential problem in the way we protect witnesses who agree to testify in criminal cases  The report finds that there is a serious deficiency in funding and staffing of the Witness Security Program run by the Federal Marshals Service  The Witness Security Program has been enormously successful  granting new identities to more than 17 000 people during its history and helping to secure the convictions of countless violent criminals    including the most vicious mafia murderers of our time  Witness protection is available to those who provide key testimony and whose safety could be jeopardized because of their cooperation with prosecutors  The conviction rate in cases where these witnesses have testified is an impressive 89 percent         The bottom line is  these recent attacks on judges don  t just affect the victims  they are an assault on our justice system  and on the rule of law  We must assess and implement the most basic steps to protect our judges     said Schumer    We must also restore funding and increase staff levels for witness protection  We cannot afford to be penny wise and pound foolish  These witnesses are literally willing to put their lives on the line for the sake of justice  The least we can do is protect them from the criminals who want to harm them
