IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 28  2006 Schumer  This Week  s Amtrak Outage Shows Rail Infrastructure Problem Akin To Northeast Power Grid During Blackout  Demands Outside Investigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Amtrak Unable to Provide Answers on What Went Wrong  Why Entire Electrical Grid Went Down When Only A Fraction Should Have Been Affected   Schumer Calls for DOT to Appoint Panel of Independent Experts to Examine Viability of Electrical System in Northeast Corridor In light of this week  s blackout on Amtrak that left thousands of people stranded in cramped train cars for hours  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called for the Department of Transportation to appoint an independent panel of experts to examine the electrical system in the Northeast corridor  Schumer  a longtime defender of Amtrak compared the domino effect present in Amtrak  s Northeast corridor outage to the domino effect that led to the failure of the power grid during the blackout of 2003  Amtrak has been unable to pinpoint what specifically went wrong and says that it may take weeks to ascertain what the genesis of the outage was         Its time to get to the bottom of what ails Amtrak     Schumer said    It is unacceptable that the power could shut down at the height of rush hour  strand thousands of people and no one can offer an explanation  It is clear that we need outside experts to step in and fix what  s broken          The massive disruption of service on Thursday morning  the largest since the blackout of summer 2003  stranded thousands of commuters along Amtrak  s Northeast Corridor  which stretches from Boston to Washington  The outage resulted from an electrical failure that moved through the system in minutes  However  it remains unclear  even to Amtrak  what caused the initial circuit to trip  At 7 55 AM  an abnormality tripped two circuit breakers at an Amtrak substation in Maryland  These occurrences  though fairly common  are usually localized incidents because the infrastructure has built in protections to that shield the whole service from being disrupted  If one substation goes down  the others should continue to operate    not set off a chain reaction       The tripped circuit breakers in Maryland were followed seconds later by two additional breakers tripped at a Sunnyside  Queens substation  Trains kept going until 8 02 am  when four breakers located at a substation outside of Philadelphia cut electricity  As circuit breakers opened along the 225 miles of track and unleashed a widely fluctuating level of power that threatened to overheat the system  s components  concerned Amtrak operators shut down the system  s power source before any permanent damage could occur        At the worst point of the outage  trains came to a standstill along a 225 mile stretch of Amtrak  s busiest tracks  Amtrak officials reported that the outage affected 4 205 of its passengers  The situation was even worse for the various regional rail systems that use Amtrak  s lines  Over 30 000 New Jersey Transit passengers were affected along with 20 SEPTA trains in Pennsylvania and 8 MRAC trains in Maryland  Amtrak officials estimate 52 000 people were effect      Schumer today said he feared that this might happen again if it the problem is not immediately identified and fixed       To combat this threat Schumer today called for the U S  Department of Transportation to appoint an independent blue ribbon panel of experts to examine the electrical system and report back within six months with recommendations for improvement  Schumer said the task force would function similarly to the joint Canadian U S  task force led by the Department of Energy after the blackout of 2003 and called for the panel to include respected railroad and electrical  engineers  outside rail experts  and some of the electrical experts that sat on the 2003 panel        In the past year Amtrak has faced a spate of problems  In April of 2005 it cancelled service on its high speed Acela trains because of a brake problem  effecting 10 000 passengers  They did not restore service until September of that year  In November of 2005 Amtrak received harsh criticism from the Government Accountability Office which said that Amtrak needs to keep a closer eye on its financials and its performance  In November Amtrak fired their President  David Gunn and has yet to replace him  Schumer has been critical of the Amtrak board which has three of its seven seats vacant  He has called on the administration to fill those seats with transportation professionals immediately  Schumer has also been a chief voice in trying to get Amtrak full funding       In its Fiscal Year 2007 budget request  the Administration only requested  900 million in federal subsidies for Amtrak  a 30 percent cut from last year  which the rail corporation year after year has said is the absolute minimum amount to keep them from shutting down  In recent years  the Administration has tried to reduce Amtrak s funding  proposing no federal subsidy for Amtrak in FY 2006  which Congress on a bi partisan basis increased to more than  1 3 billion  The Administration is only requesting  500 million for capital improvements and would put the other  400 million in the hands of the Secretary of Transportation to dispense for various Amtrak routes and projects as he sees fit  leaving no operating subsidy directly for Amtrak  Last year  Amtrak received  780 million in capital improvement grants and  495 million in operating assistance
