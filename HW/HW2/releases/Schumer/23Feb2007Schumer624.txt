IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 23  2007 Schumer Calls On CSX  Feds To Slow Down Freight Trains Through East Rochester                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator Backs Mayor Bonacchi s Effort to Reduce Train Speeds to 30 MPH After Rash of Major Accidents   Schumer  CSX and the FRA Have Not Done Nearly Enough to Make the Rochester Area Tracks Safe   East Rochester Accident Could Have Been Devastating Had Cars Been Carrying Hazardous Materials After a CSX investigation released yesterday revealed that fractured tracks caused a January 16 derailment in East Rochester  today U S  Charles E  Schumer called on CSX to slow down the trains as they run through the area to 30 miles per hour from 60 mph   Schumer said a recent rash of accidents  and Rochester s tragic history  clearly show that there needs to be an overhaul of the rail infrastructure in the region to avoid more serious accidents  CSX said the derailment was caused by an internal rail crack that didn t show up on previous electronic screenings and was not detected by a visual inspection the day before the accident   After the January derailment  Schumer announced a new push to pass his comprehensive rail safety and security legislation  the Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act        This is the smoking gun that there is a very serious rail safety problem right here in East Rochester   Schumer said   This most recent accident and East Rochester s long history with derailments  crashes  and accidents must be a wake up call to CSX and FRA to get their house in order   Unfortunately  we are years behind where we need to be  and without slowing down the trains until there is an infrastructure overhaul  we could be inviting disaster          The January derailment occurred when thirteen cars on a CSX train left the tracks in the village of East Rochester  No one was injured  but at least two motorists were nearly hit by falling trailers that were dislodged from their train cars   After another freight train derailed on Tuesday in Kentucky  hazardous chemicals aboard caught fire  sending 11 people to the hospital  Yesterday  a preliminary report by CSX revealed that a broken rail was the cause of the accident       Also yesterday  East Rochester Mayor David Bonacci called on CSX to slow down its trains that pass through East Rochester  Schumer today backed the mayor s call and sent a personal letter to both CSX President Michael J  Ward and FRA Administrator Joseph Boardman asking them to reduce the maximum train speed in the area       Schumer pointed to CSX s checkered past in Rochester with the major railroad conglomerate involved in several major accidents  crashes  and derailments all in the Rochester area   In 2001 a CSX train crashed in Rochester  derailing 23 cars  three of which spilled thousands of gallons of toxic chemicals into the Genesee River  However  this accident could have been far more tragic had the chemicals spilled in to a more crowded community area       In 2004  John and Jean O Connor were killed after their car was struck by a CSX freight train when the warning gates at the crossing on South Winton Road failed to work  The same month  another CSX gate malfunctioned in Gates  and police officials report that CSX was very slow to respond  Because there were police stationed at the crossing  no one was seriously hurt       Schumer also cited the high number of pedestrian deaths in East Rochester  where at least 6 people have been killed since 1991  including 14 year old Mark Careri in 2002   On January 16  2003  Schumer called the area  a serious public safety concern   and specifically asked the FRA to investigate the safety record of the half mile length of track that runs parallel to Maple Avenue in East Rochester   Four years to the day of Schumer s letter  nine rail cars jumped the tracks at that exact location       CSX has been involved in a number of other accidents around the state  Earlier this month  a CSX tanker car carrying more than 20 000 gallons of methanol caught fire in the CSX rail yard in Selkirk  The tanker car was being held adjacent to more than two dozen other cars carrying the dangerous and highly flammable chemical  but thankfully the fire did not spread   More than 50 homes within a mile radius of the accident were evacuated         Schumer said that inadequate safety precautions put hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near rail lines at risk  According to Federal Railroad Administration statistics  there have been 63 rail accidents  30 derailments  14 casualties and 383 total injuries last year nationwide       To protect New Yorkers from a potential railroad disaster  Schumer today announced that he is going to reintroduce the bipartisan comprehensive railroad legislation that he wrote after the deadly Graniteville  South Carolina rail disaster in 2004   Schumer s legislation  the Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  co sponsored by Senator Lindsey O  Graham  R SC   sets tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology   The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and require the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents       The bill sets strict age restrictions for cars carrying hazardous materials by requiring every car be inspected and upgraded every fifteen years   In addition  all rail cars fifteen years or older currently in use must be inspected and brought up to federal code within one year  Schumer s legislation would also create a new infrastructure grant program that would authorize  50 million in federal funding to complete vital infrastructure improvements
