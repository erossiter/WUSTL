IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 18  2005 Schumer Warns  Upstate NY College Students Graduating With Diploma And Mountain Of Credit Card Debt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Amid Graduation Season  New Schumer  finds NY college students carry an astounding  774 million in credit card debt  Average college student starts school with one or two credit cards  and graduates with 4 or more    average college student credit card debt is  2300 As New York college students graduate this month  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released a new survey finding that part time and full time college students in New York are carrying  774 million in credit card debt due to misleading and heavy handed marketing practices by credit card companies that spike interest rates without clear disclosure and aggressively target students with easy offers of credit lines that they cannot afford to pay  Schumer will also unveil a series of reforms including clearer disclosure  advance knowledge of rate hikes  and parental consent for dependent students to help protect students and parents from the practices         Graduates are not only leaving college with a diploma this May  they  re also leaving campus with mountains of credit card debt   Schumer said    Credit cards should be a leg up for college students  not a leg trap that snares them in unbearable debt          According to a study done by the nationwide student loan center Nellie Mae  almost all second year college students have a credit card  compared to only half  54   of entering first year students  On average  a college student now carries more than four cards  4 25   and in fact half  47   of students with credit cards have at least four cards       The amount of debt a student holds on his or her credit card more doubles between the first and fourth year of college  The average credit card debt level for a first year student is  1 533  which escalates to  1 825   2705  and  3 262 for the second  third  and fourth year respectively  Overall the average credit card debt for a student is  2327  One fifth  21   of credit card holding Seniors have credit card debt between  3 000 and  7 000  These debts are on top of the mounting student loans they face upon graduation  According to the Nellie Mae study  graduating students leave with  20 402 in combined student loan and credit card balances       In upstate New York there are 332 102 18 24 year old undergraduate students  according to the Census Bureau  Based on the Nellie Mae numbers  this means they collectively carry some  774 million in credit card debt       Students find credit card offers stuffed into new textbooks  delivered to their physical and electronic mailboxes  and posted on bulletin boards on campus including in classrooms  Credit card companies seize almost any opportunity to recruit new borrowers  especially 18 24 year olds who make small purchases that are likely to add up unnoticed  This demographic is also the least likely to be able to pay off their monthly balance in full  racking up high finance charges       Schumer today released a new analysis showing how much debt college students in each county carry when graduating  Specifically  Schumer found that           Students in the Capital Region carry  94 million worth of debt        Students in Central New York carry  100 million worth of debt        Students in the Hudson Valley carry  180 million worth of debt        Students in the Rochester Finger Lakes area carry  149 million worth of debt        Students in the North Country carry  52 million worth of debt        Students in the Southern Tier carry  66 million worth of debt        Students in Western New York carry  133 million worth of debt       Specifically  Schumer  who as a Congressman was the author of the credit card   Schumer Box   enacted in 1988 which requires that credit card companies clearly inform consumers of their terms  in solicitations   found that students are often unaware of the many ways credit card companies take advantage of students  including           Low Annual Percentage Rates don  t stay low for long    it could more than triple in 7 months  According to the Public Interest Research Group  PIRG   credit cards that offer low starter Annual Percentage Rates    at an average of just over 4    will likely raise these rates sharply within months  PIRG found that on average after 6 9 months the rates shot up by 264   Since last year  this term of a credit card contract now appears in the Schumer box           If you pay your bill late just once  you could face late fees of up to  39    and your APR could hike to 25   Nellie Mae reports that students are far more likely to pay their bills late than adult card holders  Paying a credit card bill late can result in bad credit ratings in the long run  but there are also steep short run penalties involved  According to Consumer Action  a public interest organization who does a yearly survey of more than one hundred credit card companies  card holders can be hit with late fees of up to  39  However  the fee is not the only trouble students must look out for  PIRG found that punitive APR hikes after one late payment went as high as 25  for some credit cards           If you pay your cable bill late  your APR could go up again  Credit card companies are increasingly using a Universal Default provision in their contracts with card holders  Under this provision  the credit card company has the right to hike a customer  s APR based on changes to that customer  s credit history caused by external creditors  including other banks and companies with whom a student might have an outstanding debt like the cable company  Consumer Action reports that 44  of credit card companies have a Universal Default policy and industry watch groups have denounced this practice as deceitful though legal  The policy now appears in the fine print of a contract           If you go over your limit  it  ll cost you up to  35  According to Professor Michael Staten at Georgetown University  students also have a stronger likelihood of going over their credit limits  carrying balances that exceed their credit limits more often then their adult counterparts  PIRG research shows that some credit card companies will charge overage fines of up to  35 for customers who exceed their limits by even  1       Schumer today announced he will introduce legislation to expand current disclosures by mandating that credit card companies provide information to consumers    upon request   on the terms and conditions of cards once their applications are approved  but prior to acceptance and authorization of the actual card  Schumer is exploring the creation of an 800 number that can be linked to the authorization number so you hear the cards terms and conditions prior to activating the card       Schumer will also urge the credit card industry to give consumers prior notification of interest rate increases and an opportunity to   deny the new interest rate     and possibly introduce legislation mandating it for the entire industry  Specifically  the language would give consumers prior written notification of interest rate increases  and simultaneously offer consumers an opportunity to deny the increased interest rate  It is important to not that  in the event that the consumer chooses to   deny    the new interest rate they would be allowed to continue using their card to make purchases in accordance with the existing rates and terms until the card  s expiration date  This measure would also ban the practice of credit card companies immediately closing of accounts when a consumer chooses not to accept a rate hike       Schumer also announced that he will continue to support Senator Christopher Dodd  s  S  499  bill that focuses on parental consent and notification  This legislation would require credit card companies to have parental consent for dependent students under the age of 21 prior to issuing credit cards or establishing a credit plan  Students under the age of 21 would be exempted from this law if they submit a letter with the signature of a parent or guardian indicating joint liability for debts incurred and or submit financial information indicating financial independence  In addition to supporting the Dodd bill  Schumer announced his own plan to require monthly bills be sent to the underage consumer and the consenting parenting       Click  to view the study
