to the Senate floor for the second straight day to address the crisis in Iraq  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  said Wednesday that President George Bushs desperate plan to ally with Sunni warlords and tribal chieftans to pacify pockets of Iraq has exposed the futility of the Administrations troop surge   Schumer noted that by the Presidents own measureBush originally declared the goal of the surge was to give Iraqs central government breathing room to make progress on political reconciliationthe Bush Petraeus surge had failed to meet its objective  The government is suffocating while the surge goes on  It doesnt have breathing room  Schumer said    Schumer declared that aligning American forces with provincial Sunni factions whose loyalties may fade undermines Bushs high minded rhetoric about sowing the seeds of democracy in Iraq for the sake of a temporary fix   Are we placing our faith in the future of Iraq  in the hands of some warlords  Some tribal leaders who at the moment dislike al Qaeda more than they dislike us  Make no mistake about it  they re no friends of Americans  Schumer said  Is this the vaunted  clarion cry for democracy in the Middle East that the President announced when he started the build up in Iraq  Obviously not  This is a policy of last resort  This is a policy of desperation   Anbar is a mirage of calm amid a desert of chaos  Schumer later added    The full text of Schumers remarks is produced below    REMARKS BY SENATOR CHARLES E  SCHUMER September 5  2007  Thank you  Mr  President  I rise today to discuss the situation in Iraq and the continuing efforts of this administration to paint a rosy picture and cling to straws when the situation on the ground and common sense suggest just the opposite    Now  some have argued that the surge in Iraq is working  But  Mr  President  all you have to do is look at the facts to know that that is not the case  The President went to Anbar Province  which at the moment he is touting as a place of success  but we all know what s happening in Iraq  Many other provinces are in terrible shape  In Iraq you get the certain sense that when you push on one end of the balloon and make things a little better  something pops out at another end    And the fallacy of the President s new policy is just amazing  Are we placing our faith in the future of Iraq in the hands of some tribal leaders who at the moment dislike al Qaeda more than they dislike us  Make no mistake about it  They re no friends of Americans    Is this the vaunted  clarion cry for democracy in the Middle East that the President announced when he started the build up in Iraq  Obviously not    This is a policy of last resort  This is a policy of desperation    To say at the moment that some warlords in one province in Iraq happen to be shooting at al Qaeda when months from now they could easily turn around and resume shooting at Americanswhich they did in the pastthat s nothing to base a policy on  What kind of policy is it  What are the odds that six months from now the fragile and perilous situation in Anbar will reverse itself and collapse    We ve heard of success stories every six or eight months  This province  this town  this city  They re cleared  they re safe  And then because of the basic facts on the ground  we revert to the old situation  And let me be clear  the violence in Anbar has gone down despite the surge  not because of the surge    The lack of protection for these tribes from al Qaeda made it clear to these tribes  We have to fight al Qaeda ourselves  It wasnt that the surge brought peace here  It was that the warlords had to create a temporary peace here on their own  And that is because there was no one else there protecting them    And as I said  Mr  President  we ve heard about successes in the past  They re temporary  They re not based on any permanent structural change or any permanent change in the views of Iraqi citizens  We ve heard about success in Baghdad and we ve heard about success in Fallujah and they vanish like the wind    So now  at a time when the American people are crying out for a change in course  some are pointing to a temporary situation in one province  Anbar  based on a few warlords  who don t believe in democracy and who don t like America  as a way to continue the present misguided policy  It makes no sense  It makes no sense because the fundamentals in Iraq stay the same  There is no central government that has any viability  The Shiites  the Kurds and the Sunnis dislike one another far more than they like or want any central government  and these two facts doom the administration policy for failure    Just seven or eight months ago when the President began the surge  he said it was to give the present government breathing room  to strengthen the Maliki government  Today we have more troops  more military patrols  more death  and the Iraqi government grows weaker  How can we regard the Bush Petraeus surge as a success when its central goal  to strengthen the government  has failed    Again  more troops  more American deaths this summer than any other  and yet the government is weaker  when the very purpose of the surge was to strengthen the government  In the President s words  to give it breathing room  By the President s own words  the government is suffocating while the surge goes on  It doesn t have breathing room    Why isn t it apparent to the President  Why isn t it apparent to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the stated goal of the surge is failing  Strengthening the central government is not happening  As the surge and number of troops goes up  the strength of the central government goes down  That equation says failure in the Bush Petraeus surge  The goal is not a military goal  In the president s own words  it is to give the government of Iraq greater stability  greater breathing room and that government  by just about every standard  is worse off than before  And again  because a few warlords and tribal leaders are now temporarily on our side for the momenteven though they are not loyal to us  they don t like us and they dislike the central governmentthat is why we should continue the present course in Iraq  It makes no sense    Now then  those on the other side and the president say  Give us a chance  You re already declaring defeat  If this were 2003 or 2004 or 2005 or maybe even 2006  those words would have some resonance with the American people  But there s been new plan after new plan  new hope after new hope  and they all are dashed within months  Why  Why  Again  because the fundamentals on the ground don t change  The Kurds  the Shiites  and the Sunnis dislike one another more than they like any central government    If you look at the benchmarks  they show that  The independent GAO report showed little progress being made in meeting the 18 military and political benchmarks set out by Congress  The draft report from last week showed that only three of the benchmarks had been met  However  over the weekend  the Pentagon revised the report  and now miraculously an additional four benchmarks were partially met  Despite the apparent efforts by the Pentagon to edit this independent report  it will  sadly  take much more than a red pen to correct the failures of the President s Iraq policy    So the surgeby the President s own stated goalis failing  The central government is weaker  The fundamentals on the ground continue to deteriorate  There continues to be no loyalty to a central government in Iraq and no loyalty to Maliki  who seems to almost revel in his incompetence  The bottom line is very simple  We are worse off  not better off  Were not even in the same place in Iraq today than we were six months ago    The position of America  the position of democracy  the position of stability all continue to erode  If there was ever a need for a change of course in Iraq  it is now  I plead with my colleagues from the other side of the aisle  you know that we have to change course
