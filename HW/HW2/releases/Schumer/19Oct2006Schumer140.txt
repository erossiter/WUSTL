                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            New York State Ranked 31st in Percentage of Households with an Internet Connection  High Speed Internet is the Life Blood of the 21st Century Economy    With Wireless Hot Spots in High Demand  Senator to Propose Expansive New Federal Resources for Communities Looking to Create WI FI Networks  New Rules to Protect Wireless Customers from Hackers and ID Theft  Federal Tax Breaks To Expand Wi In light of the rapid growth of wireless internet access in major cities across the country  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a new plan today at the Syracuse Chamber of Commerce Lunch to bring wireless  including   Wi Fi     wireless fidelity   high speed internet access to homes  businesses  and communities in Central New York  New York State currently ranks 31st among all 50 states in percentage of households with an internet connection   Communities in Central New York are looking to create Wi Fi networks in public places  and even  covering the entire region   Schumer  s plan includes creating a federal resource for local communities who are looking to create wireless networks and tax incentives for individuals and businesses that purchase broadband or Wi Fi equipment         In a world that is increasingly reliant on high speed  easily accessible Internet  not having high speed Internet access is like not having air to breathe   said Schumer   Wireless high speed internet is the wave of the future and will be the hallmark of the 21st century community   One day our laptops may be like cell phones  where high speed internet access is available everywhere at just a click of a button  It is more important than ever for the federal government to help with the investment in high speed  universal Internet access throughout the country  Wireless networks will attract new types of cutting edge  high tech business to Central New York          Schumer today said Central New York residents  businesses and visitors do not have sufficient access to high speed wireless internet that is critical to businesses development in the 21st Century economy   According to Federal Communications Commission data  urban and densely populated counties have far more high speed internet providers with the vast majority of rural counties having less than three providers   According to an analysis done by ECC Associates  a internet consulting firm located in the Southern Tier  roughly 12 percent of homes in New York could not have access to a broadband connection  meaning they could not get high speed service  except for expensive satellite service  if they wanted   According to FCC data  there are 2 833 478 residences in New York connected to high speed internet lines   There are currently 797 Wi Fi hotspots in all of upstate New York   Schumer estimates that there are 93 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in Central New York   The counties with urban centers typically have seven high speed internet providers and the more rural counties have 4 or less       The presence of WI FI networks in Central New York would offer thousands of residents and the business community  which may not ordinarily have access to the web  the ability to utilize high speed internet anywhere   Pilot projects and new start ups are popping up across New York with dozens of other communities planning on creating networks         Right now  most wireless   hot spots    are limited to chain restaurants  coffee shops  and hotels  McDonalds  Starbucks  and Best Western provide Wi Fi access    However  some local governments across upstate New York  as large as Buffalo and Rochester and as small as Tivoli and Oneonta  have contracted with private companies to create wider scoped networks to cover public places and entire communities       In an effort to promote the burgeoning new frontier of high speed  universal wireless Internet access  Schumer today proposed a three point plan to bring WiFi to Central New York            Create a Comprehensive Federal Resource for Communities Looking to Start Wi Fi Networks  Schumer is calling on Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez to create a series of federal standards and best practices for creating wireless networks so communities who want to create these networks can navigate through any potential problems and can create a system that suits their needs   In his letter to Gutierrez  Schumer asked that there be a full time staffer employed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  NTIA  acting as a federal one stop shop for community leaders and local governments so their questions can be answered         Included in the best practices would be specific recommendations about size and scope of the network  appropriate prices for equipment  whether or not to charge users fees or use advertising based revenue to cover costs  and design specifications tailored to a community  s size  topography  and demography   Schumer also asked that NTIA encourage public private partnerships between communities and service providers to reduce cost and increase access to consumers by creating a comprehensive data based of certified companies   that provide and can create these networks            Establish Security Standards To Protect Wireless Users  Schumer urged the Commerce Department to coordinate with the FBI to craft a set of specific security standards to protect wireless users and prevent criminals from taking advantage of public internet services   Several law enforcement agencies have raised concerns about their ability to track and monitor Wi Fi users who may be using the network for nefarious activities  such as child pornography or identity theft   Schumer said the standards should include methods to trace the identity of users and set up firewalls to protect users   personal information            Tax Breaks for Broadband and Wi Fi Expansion  Schumer is pushing the bi partisan Broadband Tax Enhancement Act  S 1147   led by Senator Jay Rockefeller  D WV   which has passed out of the Senate Finance Committee   Schumer  s legislation would permit individuals and businesses to deduct from their taxable income costs associated with the installation and connection of broadband and wireless networks   This could significantly reduce the cost of creating Wi Fi networks and expanding existing broadband networks for consumers and businesses   This will start in underserved areas  like the Empowerment Zones  and then Schumer hopes to expand it across other communities
