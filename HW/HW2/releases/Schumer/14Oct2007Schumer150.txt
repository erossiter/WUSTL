IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 14  2007 In The Wake Of NYC Area Hamburger Recall  Schumer Reveals Feds Lack Authority to  Require  Recalls  Shut Down E  Coli Contaminated Meat Processing Plants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Despite Repeated Recalls and Hundreds of People Getting Sick  Current Law Still Prohibits USDA from Closing Plants That Fail E  Coli Inspections Schumer Unveils Comprehensive Plan that Would Toughen Inspection Standards  Improve Reporting  Hire New Inspectors  Identify Potential Biological Threats to Food Supply NYC Area Recall Affected 27 Million In the wake of the latest beef contamination and massive hamburger recall  US Senator Chuck Schumer today announced that he will reintroduce and aggressively push his federal legislation that would finally give the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  the power to temporarily shut down meat processing plants that repeatedly fail inspections for E  coli bacteria  expand USDAs authority to trace and recall contaminated food  fast track tougher inspection methods  improve food safety reporting regulations  and identify potential biological threats to the nations food supply  Schumer also called on the USDA to publicly release the names of failing meat processing plants and help consumers identify potentially unsafe products   The USDA has become a toothless tiger when it comes to keeping our meat clean and safe  Ensuring the safety of our meat and poultry requires immediate action  Schumer said  Theres no reason to allow meat processing plants that repeatedly fail inspections for E  coli to remain open  and thats why we need to give the USDA the authority it needs to shut those plants down and keep our food supply safe   In December 2002  the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the USDAs Food Safety and Inspection Service lacked the statutory authority to order the closing of plants whose products contain unacceptably high levels of the bacteria  disabling the enforcement arm of Americas meat safety system and prompting the need for Congressional action    Since 1996  the USDA has relied on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points  HACCP  system to ensure meat safety  The Food Safety and Inspection Service  FSIS  samples raw meat at vulnerable points in the production process  assesses the percentage of samples infected with E  coli bacteria  and then uses that number to measure the processors effectiveness at eliminating bacteria  Despite the dangers posed by E  coli  the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Federal Meat Inspection Act does not allow the USDA to order plant closings based on the presence E  coli in meat  because E  coli tainted meat does not qualify as adulterated within the meaning of the statute    Right now  the USDA can only recommend a recall to a company  or pull its products from shelves  not require dangerous beef and other food products to be recalled  Slaughterhouses are not required to test carcasses for pathogens  and if they do  they are not required to hold onto the meat until they get results  according to the American Meat Institute  a trade group   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   each year food borne pathogens such as Listeria  E  coli  Salmonella  and Campylobacter are responsible for over 76 million illnesses  more than 300 000 hospitalizations  and 5 000 deaths   Schumer announced that his legislation would give the USDA broad powers to crack down on producers and distributors that arent doing nearly enough to prevent a contamination  Schumers legislation would include the following provisions among others    Give the Secretary of Agriculture the power to shut down plants after contaminations  and to set and enforce standards and limits on all food born pathogens  removing the need for specific Congressional authority for the USDA to enforce violations for each type of pathogen      Expand inspectors authority to trace contaminated animals to their original farm to rapidly identify problem areas and recall contaminated food      The bill also directs the USDA to study ways to make inspectors jobs more attractive and reach new candidates nationwide      Make state reporting of microbiological outbreaks mandatory  Since state reporting is voluntary and often inconsistent  many food borne outbreaks go undetected  Effectively transferring information between local  state and national authorities would decrease the number of undetected outbreaks and improve overall meat safety      Direct the USDA to study whether chlorophyll detector technology should be required in all cases to detect the presence of manure carrying E  coli bacteria  and allow the FSIS to hire contractors to research rapid detection methods      Provide whistle blower protection to meat and poultry plant employees who reveal food safety problems and lax procedures to USDA inspectors      Direct the CDC to work with the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  and USDA to identify potential biological threats to our food supply and prepare a rapid response plan     Schumer noted that enhancing food safety procedures would only help guard the nations food supply against potential terrorist activity  Shutting down plants with repeated E  coli violations is a vital step  but its only the first step  Schumer said  The better we inspect and protect our food supply  the safer we are against bacteria that can come both from unsafe plants and from people looking to cause harm and wreak havoc by tainting our food supply  We need to be more vigilant than ever  and that applies to everything from airline security to food safety    Schumer also called on the USDA to publicly release the names of plants that fail E  coli tests and help consumers identify and avoid purchasing potentially dangerous meat  A new law  even one as obvious and important as this  takes time to pass  Schumer said  As an interim measure  the USDA would start releasing the names of plants that are failing inspections immediately  That way  retailers and consumers will know what theyre really buying
