IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 23  2006 Schumer  9 11 Families Call For Expert Army Unit To Search For And Identify Bone And Other Human Remains At Ground Zero                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Hundreds of Unidentified Bone and Other Body Parts Keep Families in Agony  City Med Examiner Doing All They Can  DOD Unit Would Make Search and ID Wider and Faster   Joint POW MIA Accountability Command is an Elite Military Unit with Unprecedented Record of Finding Remains of Soldiers and Civilians Who Have Made the Ultimate Sacrifice   Senator to Ask Defense Department to Authorize Unit to Begin Fu In the past months  as workers prepare to tear down the Deutsche Bank building that still stands at Ground Zero  tiny bits of human remains have been found on the roof and in air vents  Many of these pieces of bone are as small as one sixteenth of an inch  Identifying these fragments is painstaking work that is currently done by the medical examiners office    who is still working to find everything as the demolition proceeds  In an effort to expedite the process and widen the search  today Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Defense Department to deploy their Joint POW MIA Accountability Command  JPAC     the elite military unit that searches for and identifies remains of missing soldiers and civilians  to conduct a full investigation in the area around Ground Zero         It  s been four and half years since September 11th and while thousands of remains have been found  no trace of over a third the people who died at the trade center has been identified     Schumer said    The families of these victims deserve the best search team there is  and that is our military  s Joint POW MIA Accountability Command          In September  construction workers from Bovis Lend Lease who were working on demolishing Deutsche Bank found scores of bone fragments  They found the remains as they were removing the roof ballast  stone by stone  The Medical Examiners office established a protocol for handling these remains to ensure everything is handled appropriately  Now forensic specialists work side by side with construction workers  On the site there are two Medical Examiners  an anthropologist and retired FDNY workers who are tasked with coordinating the work of finding remains  A forensic dentist was sent to the site from JPAC in the aftermath of 9 11 but they have since not been asked to send a full team       Employing the world  s preeminent forensic experts  JPAC has located and identified American service personnel and civilians in battle zones and disaster areas around the world  They are charged with establishing a full accounting of the 88 000 Americans who never returned home from World War II  the Korean War  the Vietnam War  the Cold War  and the first Gulf War  They have also helped with the search and identification in the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina as well as other disaster areas around the world  With their breadth of experience  JPAC is the organization best equipped to direct the search for remains in Lower Manhattan and to lead the painstaking efforts required in extracting DNA to identify them        Last month  more fragments surfaced bringing the total of bone fragments found at the Deutsche Bank Building up to nearly 600  These discoveries lead many to believe that there is more to be found  Of the 2 749 people who died at the Trade Center  no traces of 1 151 have been identified         The appearance of these new fragments  all of this time after the attacks leads me to believe that we have to cast a wider net     Schumer said          Schumer today asked that the JPAC unit expand the search to buildings like Fitterman Hall and others on the perimeter but said he would leave the parameters of the search to them       The Medical Examiners office is trying to identify the fragments by extracting the DNA and making matches with samples of DNA provided by the family        Today Schumer sent a letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  requesting that he send a full team downtown to investigate the old Deutsche Bank Building and the perimeter of the site        In the letter Schumer wrote    Of the 2 749 people who perished at the World Trade Center site on 9 11  no trace of 1 151 has been identified  In the New York area  this has meant that thousands of people have been unable to come to any closure on the deaths of their loved ones  Deploying JPAC to search for remains to provide assistance in identifying them would help countless families find the peace they so ardently seek  and so richly deserve          The text of the letter follows      Dear Secretary Rumsfeld       The recent discovery of many hundreds of bone fragments on the roof of the former Deutsche Bank Headquarters  which suffered extensive damage when the World Trade Center s South Tower partially collapsed on it on 9 11  is compelling indication that the search for those lost at the World Trade Center on 9 11 is not yet complete  This development also indicates that   despite the considerable  sincere  and often excellent efforts of those involved in this endeavor to this point    more resources and expertise are needed to complete this essential task       That is why I now ask you to deploy personnel from the world renowned Joint POW MIA Accountability Command  JPAC  to New York City to assist with the ongoing recovery efforts at the Deutsche Bank Building  I also ask that this elite unit launch their own  full scale search effort to recover human remains in the area around Ground Zero  Simply put  there is no better outfit in the world to assist in the daunting and complex task of the recovery of human remains at Ground Zero  than the JPAC       Employing the world  s preeminent forensic experts  JPAC has located and identified American service personnel and civilians in battle zones and disaster areas around the world    some decades after they have perished  With their breadth of experience  JPAC is the organization best equipped to direct the search for remains in Lower Manhattan and to lead the painstaking efforts required in extracting DNA to identify them       Many of the nearly 600 bone fragments found at the Deutsche Bank building are as small as 1 16 of an inch and have been exposed to outdoor elements for some time  Construction crews  in concert with the New York City Medical Examiner  s office and the New York City Fire Department  have done a fine job locating these remains  and  when possible  identifying them  As the demolition of the Deutsche Bank will proceed for some time to come  I believe that workers currently at the site would benefit greatly from JPAC  s assistance       The finding of bone fragments at this one building  nearly 5 years after 9 11  also leads me to believe that we must cast a wider net in searching for additional remains  While I would leave it to the JPAC experts to determine the scope of a search  it stands to reason that many smaller fragments are dispersed near Ground Zero       Of the 2 749 people who perished at the World Trade Center site on 9 11  no trace of 1 151 has been identified  In the New York area  this has meant that thousands of people have been unable to come to any closure on the deaths of their loved ones  Deploying JPAC to search for remains to provide assistance in identifying them would help countless families find the peace they so ardently seek  and so richly deserve       I look forward to working with you to ensure JPAC has the resources necessary to add this recovery work to its current assignments without detracting from ongoing work       Again  thank you for your consideration of this matter and please let me know if I can be of assistance to coordinate this effort with state and local authorities         Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer  U S  Senator
