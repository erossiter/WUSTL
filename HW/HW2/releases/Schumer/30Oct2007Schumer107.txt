IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 30  2007 Schumer Offers Groundbreaking Legislation Creating New Commerce Dept  Post To Coordinate Food And Product Safety Oversight                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Official Would Be Tasked With Creating  One Stop  Website with Consumer Safety Info  Implementing National Recall Alert System Czar Would Also Promote Development of Food Tracing Technology to Reveal Supply Chain History of All Consumable Goods Proposal Follows Rounds of Recalls Of Unsafe Food and Lead Tainted Toys That Have Exposed Massive Gaps in U S  Safety Framework WASHINGTON  D C U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  unveiled legislation Tuesday establishing a new office within the Department of Commerce to coordinate the oversight activities of the patchwork of agencies that regulate foods and products sold in the United States   The current hodgepodge system for inspecting products sold in this country has too many holes to adequately protect consumers  Schumer said  The Bush administrations approach on consumer safety puts too many chefs in the kitchen  with none of them in charge  Right now  consumers are not getting the information they need about dangerous and defective food and consumer products  This proposal installs one official at the top who can say the buck stops here on everything sold in the United States     Schumers proposal comes on the heels of a summers worth of consumer scaresincluding multiple recalls of lead tainted childrens toys from China  The breaches exposed gaping holes in the nations efforts to ensure consumer safety  which is hobbled in part by confusing overlaps in agency jurisdiction and the lack of uniform standards for product quality and inspection regularity     Subtle differences in food products dictate which agency regulates a product as well as the frequency with which inspections occur  For instance  the agency responsible for ensuring the safety of a packaged ham and cheese sandwich depends on how the sandwich is presented  The U S  Department of Agriculture inspects manufacturers of packaged open face meat or poultry sandwiches  e g   those with one slice of bread   but the Food and Drug Administration inspects manufacturers of packaged closed face meat or poultry sandwiches  e g   those with two slices of bread    The new position would bring order to the current regulatory setup  The official would head a council  also formed under Schumers legislation  that includes representatives from the various agencies with food and product safety oversight responsibilities   Schumers bill  numbered S  2256  also obligates the official to undertake certain tasks   o Create a one stop online database with information on all food and product recalls  advisories  alerts  seizures  defect determinations  and import bans  When searching for food and product safety information  consumers must first figure out which agency has jurisdiction over the item  The answer is not necessarily intuitive or easy to determine  For example  the Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over childrens cribs  but not childrens car seats  Car seats are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportations National Highway Traffic Safety Administration     o Implement a national recall alert system for disseminating as it happens information on recalls to consumers and businesses  including retailers  the media  and medical professionals  The system could include email alerts to consumers such as that administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  for products under its jurisdiction  The system could also include email and fax alerts to retailers  national and local news media  school districts  hospitals  libraries  banks and post offices     o Improve identification and prevention of unsafe imports  Too many unsafe food and product imports are reaching the shores of the United States  Negotiations with our trading partners for U S  authorization to test  audit  and inspect food and consumer products before they are shipped to the United States are a priority  Development of risk assessment models that would better identify and prevent the importation of unsafe products also is a priority     o Promote the development of food tracing technology to provide consumers with access to the supply chain history of a consumer product  Independent projects and private sector companies are researching technology that could deliver information about the life cycle of a food product directly to the consumer  If this technology can be mainstreamed  a consumer could potentially punch a few numbers into a cell phone or PDA in the store and find out the whole backstory of a fruit or coffee or wine     The legislation is the latest effort by Schumer to improve the governments oversight of food and consumer products sold in the United States  He is also a co sponsor of comprehensive legislation authored by Sen  Mark Pryor  D AR  that would expand the authority of the CPSC  increase fines  and improve transparency and accountability  That bill was due to be approved by the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday
