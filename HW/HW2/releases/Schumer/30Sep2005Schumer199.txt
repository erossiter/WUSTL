IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 30  2005 Schumer  Clinton  Key Senate Panel Backs  13 1 Million For Defense Projects To Benefit Central New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Funding is part of FY 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee   Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York Economy and National Security U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved  13 1 million in the FY06 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for defense projects to benefit Central New York  including  5 1 million for Rome Labs for their Cyber Situational Awareness and Enable Network Centric Warfare projects   6 million for Syracuse Research  s Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Enhancement system  and  2 million for Cortland Cable  s Synthetic Material Arresting Gear Cable        This is great news for Central New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Central New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Central New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge         Central New York has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support         6 million of the federal funding will go to the Syracuse Research Corporation for the development of Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Enhancement  The funding will create new opportunities to improve and enhance national security  The radar  developed for SOCOM and currently in theater  provides the capability to automatically locate mortar firing positions by detecting and tracking the mortar shell  then backtracking to the weapon position  Accordingly  this technology will allow soldiers in combat to more effectively take cover from mortar fire  locate its origin  and respond  LCMR systems have already been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  Funding in this legislation would upgrade these systems  SRC received  2 5 million of federal funding for the LCMR in FY 05         5 1 million of the federal funding will go to Rome AFRL   1 9 million will go to AFRL  s Cyber Situational Awareness technology project and  3 2 million to the Enable Network Centric Warfare project  The funding for the Cyber Situational Awareness will be used in developing Cyber Course of Action Tools  which deal with determining appropriate fine grain  automated defensive responses to adversary information warfare attacks and developing sensor fusion  which is concerned with fusing the information collected by sensors in order to create a consistent  comprehensive picture of what is occurring at all levels of a military operation       Federal funding for Enable Network Centric Warfare would support efforts to develop  integrate  and demonstrate enhanced airborne networking capabilities in support of Network Centric operations  Funding will be used to accelerate the evolution of airborne networking technologies  providing both an immediate improvement to current warfighting capabilities  as well as forming the basis for enabling future airborne network centric capabilities        2 million in federal funding will also go to Cortland Cable for the development of Synthetic Material Arresting Cable  and is anticipated to have a positive employment impact  The funding supported under this request will continue previously funded efforts to investigate the use of lightweight  synthetic materials and novel cable construction to replace the steel cables that recover aircraft aboard U S  Navy Aircraft Carriers  Synthetic cables could improve the factor of safety of the entire system by 60   Because the strength to weight of synthetic materials is 4 5 times better than steel  system inertia is significantly reduced  enabling the arresting gear to apply breaking force much earlier  The use of synthetic cable also possesses a potential weight savings of 62 tons per carrier and increase arresting gear performance by 25   Cortland Cable received  1 million in FY 05       The Senate Appropriations Committee included  440 billion in the bill which now heads to the floor for a full vote before the Senate  A vote is expected in the coming weeks  and after final passage a Conference Committee will reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill before Congress gives final approval to the legislation and sends it to the President for his signature
