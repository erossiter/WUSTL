Block                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          After Already Threatening Funding For Key Acid Rain Monitoring Program  CASTNET  Administration Plans to Take Cleaver to Two More Programs that Examine Acidity in Lakes and Streams across NYS Schumer Calls on Senate Committee to Restore Full Funding for LTM and TIME Programs Essential to Protecting the Adirondacks and other Parks Across NYS Schumer  We Have Made Gains in the Battle against Acid Rain  but We Need Hard Data to Win the War  Two weeks after blasting the Bush Administration for threatening to cut a key acid rain monitoring program used across Upstate New York  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that the Administration is planning to further gut anti acid rain efforts by completely slashing funding to two additional programs  The President is planning to cut the Environmental Protection Agencys  EPA  Temporally Integrated Monitoring of Ecosystems program  TIME  and the Long Term Monitoring  LTM  program which are critical federal programs that work to combat acid rain across New York State and the country by examining the acidity of lakes and streams     Today  Schumer  a longtime crusader against acid rain  which has already decimated scores of pristine parks  forests and lakes across the state  called on the Senate Committee in charge of these programs budgets to immediately restore their funding levels     The Bush Administrations budget cuts continue to eat away at anti acid rain programs that are vital to protecting New York States forests  lakes and rivers  said Senator Schumer  With acid rain already decimating so many of New York States precious parks  lakes and rivers  it is inconceivable that we would now slash funding to federal programs that are vital to combating acid rain  It is absolutely critical that scientists and environmentalists fighting this scourge have the tools they need     These two programs work together to collect data on the prevalence of acid rain throughout the Northeast and Mid Atlantic states by examining the acidity of lakes and streams  The two programs take different statistical approaches to monitoring  and both approaches are necessary to provide scientists and policy makers with a thorough understanding of the effects of acid rain     The LTM program makes frequent measurements over many years of the chemistry of a set of acid sensitive lakes and streams  allowing scientists to evaluate trends in acidity in these sensitive areas     The TIME program  by contrast  monitors a statistically chosen sample of lakes and streams once per year  and allows scientists to determine what proportion of the lakes and streams in a region is affected  Together  the two methods provide a clear picture both of trends in acidity over time and also of its extent over the landscape at any given moment  Scientists and policy makers need both types of information in order to solve the problem of acid rain     Schumer sent a letter to the Senate Subcommittee on Interior  Environment  and Related Agencies  under the Senate Committee on Appropriations  calling on it to restore funding at the historic  800 000  The bill is set to move to conference with its House companion bill  Schumer urged that the funding be restored during conference     Earlier this month  Schumer sent a letter to the Senate Subcommittee  calling on it to restore full funding for CASTNET  a third acid rain monitoring program that measures acid rain pollutants in the air     We need all three of these programs in full force as we wage battle against acid rain  Schumer stressed today  Cutting funding for any or all of them would be a terrible blow to our efforts     Twenty years ago  acid rain was devastating the Eastern half of the United States  Congress  the EPA  state and local governments acknowledged the damage that unregulated emissions of certain acid rain producing pollutants were having on the environment  They took decisive action to curtail those emissions  and today  acid rain is not as bad as it once was  However  in certain parts of the country  acid rain continues to be a major ecological problem  The Northeast is the region most affected by this problem  with the Adirondacks in Upstate New York being brutally hit     As a result of decades of acid rain  more than 500 of the Adirondack Park s 2 800 lakes and ponds are too acidic to support their native life  Thousands of acres of high elevation red spruce and fir forests have been wiped out and mercury contamination exacerbated by acid rain has been documented in more than 20 Adirondack lakes  making the fish unfit to eat     Schumer emphasized that acid rain is a statewide and national problem  with every region in New York possessing dangerously acidic rain  Catskill Park s forests and lakes have also been severely impacted by acid rain  as have the Great Lakes of Western New York and the Finger Lakes     Acid rain has been attributed to sulfur dioxide  SO2  and nitrogen oxide  NOx   chemicals that can be transported in the wind  causing environmental and health problems hundreds of miles away  Fine particles can pose serious health risks  especially for people with heart or lung disease  including asthma  and older adults and children  Ground level ozone can irritate the respiratory system  aggravate asthma  reduce lung capacity and increase peoples susceptibility to respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and bronchitis
