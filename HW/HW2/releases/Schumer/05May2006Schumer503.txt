is the text of one of the letters sent today      May 5  2006  Mr  Joshua B  Bolten  Chief of Staff   Office of the President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  DC 20500      Dear Mr  Bolten       In January  we sent letters to President Bush and his Cabinet  asking that he and all Cabinet members detail whatever contact they might have had with Jack Abramoff  or any involvement they might have had in the   K Street Project          A number of your Cabinet colleagues quickly responded to our request  but we have not yet heard from you  Because so many of your colleagues have already responded  it is increasingly important that you also disclose any relevant information so the full record of this Administration becomes clear  one way or the other  Thus far  we have received responses from           The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary of Homeland Security        The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld  Secretary of Defense        The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  Attorney General        The Honorable Samuel W  Bodman  Secretary of Energy        The Honorable Norman Y  Mineta  Secretary of Transportation        The Honorable Carlos Gutierrez  Secretary of Commerce        The Honorable Gale Norton  Secretary of the Interior        The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary of Agriculture        The Honorable Robert Portman  U S  Trade Representative        The Honorable Stephen Johnson  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator        The Honorable John P  Walters  Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy       All of the above listed members of the President  s Cabinet have essentially stated that they have no recollection of any contact with Mr  Abramoff  It would benefit the public greatly to hear from you as well  silence on this issue is likely to only further the perception that the American people have yet to hear the full story  To reiterate our original request  we are simply asking that you detail all of your personal contacts with Mr  Abramoff during your time in the Bush Administration  If you know of others in the Administration who had such contacts  we ask that you please disclose those as well  Please also detail any official acts that have been undertaken on behalf of or at the request of Mr  Abramoff  Additionally  we ask that you reveal any involvement in the   K Street Project     the initiative launched in recent years by Republicans close to this Administration who have worked hard to increase the ties between lobbyists such as Mr  Abramoff and Republican elected officials        Regardless of whether or not there has been any contact between President Bush  s Cabinet members and Mr  Abramoff  we feel it is important that the record be set straight  We urge you to respond and come forward with any potentially relevant information  We anxiously await your response       Sincerely      Harry Reid   Dick Durbin  Charles E  Schumer   Debbie Stabenow  Bush
