                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         With the 2007 Farm Bill set to be introduced in Congress next month  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today introduced comprehensive farm legislation that provides targeted relief to upstate New York farmers  and to farmers across the Northeast  The so called Northeast Farm Bill will serve as a marker to ensure that the leaders on the farm bill cannot ignore the unique needs and issues facing Northeast farmers  The legislation will  expand and improve the delivery of crop insurance to ensure that the types of diverse farm operations in the region have access to better risk management tools extend the MILC program  and increase research and development of bio based fuels   I will to fight to ensure that New York farmers needs dont get plowed over in the 2007 farm bill  Schumer said  This legislation is just what the doctor ordered for upstate New York farmers  The bill alleviates all the pressure points that our farmers feel and will put them on a path for growth  Agriculture is the lifeblood of the upstate economy and we must do everything we can to ensure it stays that way  From grapes to corn  to vegetables  to milk  Upstate New Yorks diverse agricultural base is an economic force  and this new farm bill needs to reflect that  Upstate New York farmers  and farmers across the Northeast  have unique needs that differ from their Midwestern and Western counterparts  he added    Schumer today announced new comprehensive legislation to highlight the needs and issues facing upstate New York farmers and the entire agricultural community in the Northeast  The Farm  Nutrition and Community Investment Act of 2007 includes the following provisions    Crop Insurance  Schumers proposal would expand the crop insurance programs to ensure that specialty crop growers are covered and receive a fair share of payments  Although the list of covered commodities has grown in recent years  80  of total policy premiums and federal subsidies are accounted for by just four commodities  corn  soybeans  wheat and cotton  Nearly 56  of payouts go to farmers in just four states  Texas  North Dakota  South Dakota  Oklahoma  Schumers proposal would double the Agricultural Management Assistance program  reauthorize and improve the Adjusted Gross Revenue Insurance Pilot Program  and expand crop insurance incentives to include beginning farmers  as an incentive to enter agriculture   In addition  the bill increases funding for the Agricultural Management Assistance Program and retains the current flexibility of use provision  This bill makes several program improvements including higher levels of coverage  establish a floor to the 5 year income history  and revise the definition of animals to include contract livestock growers  It creates a pilot product that would provide revenue insurance plans to new and beginning farmers  and that offers higher subsidies on crop insurance premiums as incentive to enter agriculture and provides producers with coverage area flexibility to better match their operations     Dairy Safety Net  Schumers legislation includes an extension and expansion of the existing MILC program developed in conjunction with Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand  D NY   The bill would require USDA to study the economic benefits to producers of establishing two classes of milk  require mandatory reporting of all dairy commodity transactions and establish a loan guarantee program to encourage investment in new processing technologies  The bill also creates the Federal Dairy Education Loan Forgiveness program  which repays eligible college loans for students who complete and obtain a degree from a 2 or 4 year undergraduate program or technical school and then return to the dairy industry either as an owner or operator     Conservation  The bill would increase funding for working lands conservation programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  and the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program  FRPP   Specifically  Schumer would raise funding for EQIP to  2 billion every year  up from  1 3 bill annually and increase funding for FRPP to  300 million  These programs are extremely important to farmers in New York where there is a huge backlog of unfunded applications  Schumers proposal also includes fully funding the Conservation Security Program  which removes producing cropland into conserving uses for about 10 years     Energy  In addition to Schumers previous legislation to boost corn based ethanol production in upstate New   York  Schumers proposal would provide direct incentives to speed up development of Cellulosic ethanol  Specifically  Schumers proposal would reauthorize Section 9008 of the 2002 Farm Bill  which funds research and development on production of bio based fuels  including feedstock production  harvesting  transport  and storage    Market and Economic Development    The bill proposes a new program focused on fostering farm profitability for all producers  The program would be administered through each states department of agriculture  with USDA playing the critical role of ensuring program accountability  State departments of agriculture would distribute grant funds within each state to eligible entities for allowable uses consistent with the priorities and needs identified through state level strategic plans  Program funds could not be used to directly subsidize the price of an agricultural commodity    Honey Bees Population Loss  The bill authorizes  250 million over ten years to combat Colony Collapse Disorder that is decimating the honey bee population in upstate New York and across the country    Nutrition  In addition to provisions for farmers  the Farm Bill includes a nutrition section to feed the hungry and improve the quality of food available to low income Americans  often with the participation of local growers  Schumer s proposal would strengthen the Nutrition Title of the Farm Bill by eliminating barriers to enrollment in the Food Stamp program and preventing the reduction in available food stamp benefits  It would also increase the availability of fruits and vegetables in schools with low income children  expand the WIC program to provide supplemental nutrition for pregnant women and young children  and increase the availability of locally grown foods in school lunches and other food purchasing programs    Congress is set to reauthorize the provisions passed in the 2002 Farm Bill  which is massive legislation that supports the farming economy across the country  Schumer today said that negotiations over the provisions in the bill have already begun to rev up with the Senate Agriculture Committees goal of having a bill written possibly by the end of June 2007  The provisions in the current farm bill expire on September 30  2007   Schumer today said that  Unfortunately  in years past  the needs the agricultural community in the Northeast have been left behind in favor of major agriculture conglomerates in the Midwest and on the West Coast    Today  Schumer released a new report showing significant growth in agricultural production in upstate New York and its growing share of the overall upstate economy   Agricultural production returned over  3 6 billion to the farm economy in 2005  About 25 percent of the states land area  or 7 55 million acres  are used by the 35 600 farms to produce a very diverse array of food products  Milk is New Yorks leading agricultural product and is produced all across the state  Milk sales account for one half of total agricultural receipts  Production in 2005 was 11 7 billion pounds with a preliminary value of  1 91 billion  placing New York as the nations 3rd leading producer
