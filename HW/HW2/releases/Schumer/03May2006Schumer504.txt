IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 3  2006 With Deadline Looming  Schumer Reveals 27  Of Eligible Upstate NY  ers Still Haven  t Signed Up For Medicare Part D    Nearly Half Don  t Know About Deadline  Could Face Lifelong Penalties                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Though 1 3 Million Upstate New Yorkers Eligible  More than 350 000 Have Not Enrolled  And More than 162 000 Don  t Even Know About Deadline    Only Twelve Days Left To Enroll Unless Deadline Is Extended   Senator To Push Legislation Extending Deadline  Avoiding Lifelong Penalties This Year   Schumer To Release Number of Medicare Recipients In Each County Enrolled In Medicare Drug Plan  In Capital Region Although 1 3 million seniors are eligible for the new Medicare prescription drug plan in upstate New York  because the plan is complex and confusing only 434 432 have actually enrolled  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today  With the enrollment deadline set for May 15  2006  Schumer today called on Congress to immediately pass legislation to give seniors an additional six months to enroll in a plan without incurring any late penalties         This plan was poorly thought out from the beginning     Schumer said    Now the deadline is twelve days away and hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers don  t even know there  s a deadline  Charging these late penalties is absurd  permitting a lapse in coverage is unconscionable  It  s time to plug some of the holes here by extending the deadline  We owe it to seniors who have had enough trouble trying to navigate these incomprehensible plans           Schumer today released  detailing how many seniors in each county have enrolled in the Medicare benefit and how many are still left without Medicare or comparable prescription drug coverage           40 201 Capital Region seniors are currently enrolled in Medicare Part D and 41 430 are still left without coverage         44 444 Central New York seniors are currently enrolled in Medicare Part D and 42 494 are still left without coverage         72 116 Rochester Finger Lakes seniors are currently enrolled in Medicare Part D and 43 795 are still left without coverage         28 727 North Country seniors are currently enrolled in Medicare Part D and 23 387 are still left without coverage         114 616 Hudson Valley seniors are currently enrolled in Medicare Part D and 97 151 are still left without coverage         35 670 Southern Tier seniors are currently enrolled in Medicare Part D and 30 647 are still left without coverage         98 658 Western New York seniors are currently enrolled in Medicare Part D and 75 287 are still left without coverage        A recent report the by the Kaiser Family Foundation  a nonpartisan health policy research organization  found that only 55  of seniors realize the deadline is May 15  Only 53  know enrolling after the deadline will result in a lifetime penalty  Schumer  s study shows that 162 928 upstate New Yorkers fall into that category and are thus unaware of the May 15 deadline and subsequent penalties        Under current law  seniors who do not decide on a plan by May 15th will be penalized heavily if they ever choose a Medicare drug plan in the future  These seniors will be charged higher monthly premiums  which get more expensive the longer they wait  Premiums will go up by 1  for every month that seniors wait  so if a senior enrolls in May of 2007  Medicare will tack an extra 12  onto his monthly premium for the rest of his life  Seniors who don t enroll by May 15 will have to wait until November to sign up  and should receive drug coverage beginning January 1  2007 if they enroll during the 2006 calendar year  A senior who enrolls in November of 2006 is projected to pay an extra  4 800 in premium penalties over the course of twenty years of enrollment in the Medicare drug plan       Seniors aware of the impending drug plan deadline have sought help from community organizations and drug plans as they attempt to sort through which plan is best for them  However  the information available to seniors is inadequate and not easily accessible  The best way to compare drug plans is to use an internet tool offered by Medicare  but very few seniors have access to a computer  and many have never used a computer before  Community organizations have been forced to impose long waiting lists for seniors seeking help because of the sheer volume of requests for assistance        Additionally  although the call wait times at private drug plans have improved since the implementation of the plan  holding time has dramatically increased as the penalty approaches  It is likely that many seniors who want to enroll in the program before the deadline may not even be able to because they can t get the information they need to choose a plan        Schumer today announced a renewed push for the Medicare Informed Choice Act  S  1841   co sponsored by Senators Schumer  Bill Nelson  FL  and Dick Durbin  IL   which provides additional protections for Medicare beneficiaries  including delaying the enrollment deadlines and eliminating the late penalties for people who enroll as late as December 31  Adding time and flexibility to the Medicare prescription drug benefit  the bill would also give every beneficiary a chance to change plans once during the first year  Allowing for a change of plans once over the first year provides a safety net in case a senior has to go onto a new drug partway through the year that is not covered by the first plan they enroll in  Especially as the deadline nears  Senator Schumer believes we can make sure seniors are not forced to make hasty decisions they may later regret        Schumer also joined a bipartisan coalition of Senators  including Republican Senators Olympia Snowe  R ME  and Arlen Specter  R PA   in sending a letter to Majority Leader Bill Frist asking him to bring legislation to the Senate floor that would extend the existing six month open enrollment period to the entire year of 2006       This is not the only flaw in the Medicare prescription drug program  which is also prevented from negotiating prescription drug prices using bulk orders like the Veteran  s Administration does to save billions of dollars  Many seniors who are enrolled in the Medicare drug program are already encountering the  doughnut hole   a period of time during which they are responsible for 100  of the costs of their drugs and have no help from their insurance plans        Senator Schumer is a member of the Senate Finance Committee that oversees Social Security and Medicare  and is the co  author with Senator John McCain  R AZ  of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act   which became law in 2003  The Act enabled generic drugs to be brought to market sooner  and lowered the cost of prescriptions for millions of American seniors       Click here to view
