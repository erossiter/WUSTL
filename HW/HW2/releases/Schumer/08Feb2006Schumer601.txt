Reports Reveal Pharmaceutical Industry Making Out Like Bandits from Plan  Schumer To Grill CMS Administrator McClellan at Finance Hearing on Today  Advance Legislation To Address Gaping Holes Leaving New York  s Seniors Stranded Across New York  367 000 seniors enrolled in New York  s Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage  EPIC   may lose protection from loopholes in the new Medicare prescription drug plan  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today  Schumer grilled the Center for Medicaid and Medicaid Services   Administrator Mark McClellan and urged him to offer the same safeguards to EPIC that are currently given to other private plans  Schumer today also spotlighted how drug plans can change the lists of drugs they cover even after a patient has enrolled in a plan and has committed them to that plan for a year         The Federal government has not been straight with the American people  especially seniors     Schumer said    Seniors who thought they were getting a Cadillac of a prescription drug program are now finding out their insurance plan is a jalopy  We all have a special duty to protect New York  s seniors and turn this lemon of a program into lemonade          Schumer today released  detailing how many EPIC and dual eligible seniors in each county are eligible for the Medicare benefit         There are 22 484 Capital Region seniors enrolled in New York  s well regarded EPIC program  6 148 of whom will be transitioned to Medicare Part D  22 646 Capital Region seniors eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid may lose access to certain drugs if emergency coverage is not extended           There are 24 813 Central New York seniors enrolled in New York  s well regarded EPIC program  6 203 of whom will be transitioned to Medicare Part D  21 044 Central New York seniors eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid may lose access to certain drugs if emergency coverage is not extended           There are 43 070 Hudson Valley seniors enrolled in New York  s well regarded EPIC program  10 768 of whom will be transitioned to Medicare Part D  45 424 Hudson Valley seniors eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid may lose access

transitioned to Medicare Part D  17 507 Southern Tier seniors eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid may lose access to certain drugs if emergency coverage is not extended           There are 52 305 Western New York seniors enrolled in New York  s well regarded EPIC program  7 502 of whom will be transitioned to Medicare Part D  35 799 Western New York seniors eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid may lose access to certain drugs if emergency coverage is not extended       Transitioning From EPIC to Medicare   Some of the 367 000 New York seniors enrolled in EPIC will be forced to enroll in Medicare drug plans by July 1st  Governor Pataki  s 2006 budget proposal  released January 17th  would push about 91 000 low income New York seniors from the EPIC program onto the Medicare drug program  EPIC provides prescription coverage for seniors who have too high of an income to qualify for Medicaid  but need help paying for costly prescription drugs  These 91 000 people are the members of EPIC who are eligible for a federal low income subsidy if they enroll in a Medicare drug plan  which will make their drugs cheaper  but will also give them coverage that is inferior to EPIC       The EPIC program is a simple  cost sharing prescription drug plan that covers almost all medications for enrollees  Most pharmacies in New York accept EPIC  and EPIC seniors pay at most  20 for a medication  The Medicare drug plan  on the other hand  is extremely complex and difficult to navigate  With over 40 drug plan options in New York and each plan covering different drugs  many seniors have found choosing a Medicare drug plan unbearable  Additionally  the Medicare drug plan drastically differs from EPIC in that not all pharmacies accept the wide variety of Medicare drug plans  and co pays vary from plan to plan        The grave nature of the impending transition of EPIC seniors onto the Medicare drug plans by July 1st is amplified because of the Medicare drug plan  s remaining glitches  Many seniors still aren  t receiving the drugs they need  are trapped in inappropriate plans  or are paying far too much for their medications  Since the implementation of the Medicare drug plan  New York seniors   covered    by Medicare drug plans have faced dangerous gaps in drug coverage  Knowing the abundance of problems with the Medicare drug plan  EPIC seniors shouldn  t be forced from a simple plan that provides secure coverage to a complex plan that still has many glitches        Today  Schumer announced he will         Introduce legislation to prevent the remaining 276 000 EPIC enrollees from being transitioned onto Medicare in the future  The Medicare program currently pays 28  federal subsidies to employers to ensure that companies will not push their retirees from employer sponsored plans onto Medicare  EPIC should benefit from the same federal subsidies to give the State the incentive it needs to retain EPIC coverage for New York seniors            Call on New York State to put explicit protections in place for EPIC enrollees in any plan that will shift members of EPIC onto the Medicare drug plan  These protections should include the assurance that all EPIC enrollees can continue to stay on the same drugs they currently take  can continue to use the same pharmacies they use now  and should have a smooth transition that is not put into effect until the kinks in the Medicare program have been resolved        Formularies  Under current law  Medicare prescription drug plans can change the drugs that they cover  through their formularies  at any time  The only stipulation to this provision is that the drug plans must give their enrollees a notice two months in advance of the change  However  most seniors enrolled in a Medicare drug plan are prohibited from changing plans except during an annual open enrollment period  This provision traps seniors in drug plans without a guarantee that the drugs that they need will be covered all year long  Even a senior who has conscientiously decided on a drug plan that covers all needed medications could lose coverage of drugs if the drug plan changes its formulary       Today  Schumer  along with Senators Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Susan Collins  R ME   and others  introduced the Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act of 2006  which prohibits Medicare prescription drug plans from making their formularies more restrictive unless beneficiaries have the option to change plans        Medicare Medicaid Dual Eligibles  The 570 000 New Yorkers eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid eligible continue to struggle to obtain the medications they need through Medicare drug plans  Although Governor Pataki took emergency action to provide medication to New York  s vulnerable dual eligibles through the state  s Medicaid program  this temporary coverage of duals will end March 8th  Dual eligibles have been unable to consistently obtain drugs that they need  for a variety of reasons  and continue to leave pharmacies empty handed  Duals have to jump through many hoops  such as appeals processes  to obtain both formulary and non formulary drugs  have been charged inappropriate amounts for co pays and deductibles  cannot find a plan that covers all of their drugs  and have been auto enrolled in inappropriate plans        Schumer  along with others  introduced the Requiring Emergency Pharmaceutical Access for Individual Relief Act  S 2183  which would immediately provide relief to low income and disabled individuals that are experiencing gaps in drug coverage  through provisions including a requirement for plans to provide at least a 30 day supply of any needed drugs until an individual can switch to a plan that covers the drug       While seniors continue to face countless problems attaining and paying for their prescription drugs  new reports reveal record profits in the pharmaceutical industry  Economist Dr  Stephen Schondelmayer at the University of Minnesota estimates that Medicare could pay drug prices 20 30  higher than Medicaid drug prices  This means the windfall for the drug industry    just from the nation  s 6 4 million dual eligibles   could be  30 billion over the next ten years  According to pharmaceutical industry journal RPM Report  pharmaceutical manufacturers will earn an additional  2 billion in 2006 profits from supplying the same patients with the same drugs       Click here to view
