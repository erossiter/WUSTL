IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 17  2007 Schumer To Credit Bureaus  Make Consumer Credit  Freezes  Free And Automated

                                   Three Major Bureaus Have Allowed Consumers To Put So Called  Freezes  on Credit Reports to Prevent Identity Theft  But Fees and Mail based Activation System Make Securing Credit Records Costly and Cumbersome Schumer Tells Bureaus to Make Freeze Activation Free  Instant  and Web accessible  Will Consider Legislation if Bureaus Don t Act WASHINGTON  DCU S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today that he was demanding that the three major credit bureaus eliminate all fees and restrictions placed on consumers seeking to block unwanted access to their credit reports  The Senator said he may offer legislation requiring the bureaus to do so if they do not act voluntarily    In separate letters released today to the CEOs of Experian  TransUnion  and Equifax  Schumer praised the companies for agreeing recently to allow consumers to place so called freezes on their credit histories  A freeze puts a consumers credit report under lockdown  preventing any access into credit records and scores without the consumers knowledge and consent  But Schumer said that charging fees for the activation and de activation of those freezesas well as the mail based system for processing the requestsplaces too heavy a burden on consumers interested in guarding against identity theft and hinders legitimate lending transactions    Currently  the companies have said that they will only allow consumers who can prove they have already been the victims of identify theft to freeze their credit report for free  Otherwise  consumers will be charged around  10 to place a freeze per credit bureau  with additional fees levied each time the consumer wishes to lift or restore the freeze  Because a consumer would have to place the freeze at each of the three major credit bureaus  it would cost  30 just to initiate the freeze   Credit freezes should frustrate identity thieves  not the consumers they are meant to protect  Schumer said  Freezes need to be freely available to consumers before they become identity theft victims  not just after  This type of protection should be free of charge and available at the click of a mouse   While a majority of states have laws on the books that permit freezes  rules differ from state to state and there is currently no federal law that deals with the issue of credit freezes  In his letters to the credit bureaus  Schumer disclosed he was considering legislation on the issue  but expressed hope the bureaus could make that unnecessary by taking four steps on their own     Allow customers to request a freeze either by mail  online or by phone  Currently  the bureaus require a request to come via certified mail  which is a time consuming hassle for consumers and does nothing to help the bureaus verify a requesters identity   Eliminate fees for freeze requests  lifts  and removals   Make the freezes go into effect  and allow them to be lifted  as close to instantaneously as possible  Currently  there is a lag time associated with most requests because of the certified mail requirement   Require the bureaus to share freeze requests among themselves  so a consumer need only notify one bureau instead of all three   Schumer said making freezes free and easy would benefit consumers and creditors alike   Consumers should be able to suspend unwanted access to their credit records for any reason  without facing repeated fees  Schumer said in the letters  It makes even less sense to charge consumers for lifting or removing a credit freeze given that unfettered access to credit information benefits both consumers and lenders    Copies of the three letters appear below    Harry C  Gambill  CEO TransUnion 555 West Adams Street  Chicago  IL 60661  Dear Mr  Gambill   I write to urge TransUnion to adopt changes to its credit freeze policy in order to protect consumers better from identity theft  I applaud TransUnions recent decision to allow consumers nationwide to place credit freezes on their files  Credit freezes that suspend access to credit reports and scores without the consumers consent can be valuable tools to stop or prevent the ravages of identity theft  However  I am concerned that TransUnion intends to require consumers to initiate freezes through certified mail  I am also disappointed that TransUnion plans to charge consumers  10 for initiating  lifting or removing a freeze  unless they are identity theft victims    I am calling on TransUnion  and the other two leading credit bureaus  to protect consumers by making four simple  sensible changes to its credit freeze policies  Consumers are rightly concerned about the risk of identity theft  and credit reporting should foster trust by providing easy access to credit freezes for consumers who fear that their information will be misused    First  TransUnion should allow all consumers to request or lift a freeze by telephone  online  or through first class mail  at the election of the consumer  Certified mail does not provide any additional assurance of the requesters identity  yet the additional time and expense of using certified mail may dissuade consumers who need credit freezes from protecting themselves    Second  TransUnion should not charge any fee for placing  temporarily lifting  or removing a credit freeze  It is not just the known victim of identity theft who may wish to protect her private information with a credit freeze  but also the traveler who has lost her pocketbook in the airport  the elderly veteran who mistakenly gave out information to a stranger  or the consumer whose information was exposed in a data security breach  Consumers should be able to suspend unwanted access to their credit records for any reason  without facing repeated fees  It makes even less sense to charge consumers for lifting or removing a credit freeze given that unfettered access to credit information benefits both consumers and lenders    Third  TransUnion should immediately implement a consumer request to place  lift and remove a credit freeze  No consumer should have to stand by and wait for a credit freeze to be processed while a thief exploits that consumers good name  Moreover  as long as the requesters identity is verified  quick lifting of freezes will facilitate legitimate lending and borrowing without harming data privacy  Thus  a telephone or electronic request for changes to a consumers freeze status should be made within minutes of the request being received   Finally  now that all three major bureaus intend to offer credit freezes  TransUnion should transmit any consumers request for a credit freeze to the other two bureaus  as is currently done with fraud alerts  Using the same procedures developed for fraud alerts  consumers should be able to make a single request to freeze their files at all bureaus  Sharing freeze requests among the credit reporting agencies is more efficient for all parties and will ensure that consumers do not unwittingly leave the door open to identity theft by placing a freeze at only one bureau   In addition to contacting TransUnion  I am making these same four requests of the other leading credit bureaus  It is my hope that all the bureaus will promptly adopt these reforms  However  I am also prepared to consider introducing legislation to protect consumers by requiring credit reporting agencies to follow the policies outlined above    Again  I appreciate TransUnions decision to make credit freezes available  Thank you for your consideration  and I look forward to your reply    Sincerely   Charles E  Schumer United States Senator          Donald A  Robert  CEO Experian 475 Anton Boulevard Costa Mesa  CA 92626  Dear Mr  Robert   I write to urge Experian to adopt

Richard F  Smith  Chairman  CEO Equifax 1550 Peachtree Street NW Atlanta  Georgia 30309  Dear Mr  Smith    I write to urge Equifax to structure any new credit freeze policy in order to protect consumers best from identity theft  I was pleased to see recent news reports that Equifax plans to allow consumers nationwide to place credit freezes on their files  and I hope that Equifax follows through on this pledge  Credit freezes that suspend access to credit reports and scores without the consumers consent can be valuable tools to stop or prevent the ravages of identity theft  However  I
