Stormwater Abatement Ruining Summer Fun And Draining Taxpayer Dollars                                                                                                                                                                         Beaches Are the Backbone of LI Economy But Toxic Stormwater Runoff Forces Widespread Closures Every Summer   1 000 Closures Since 2001 Senator to Push Legislation to Open Up Existing Federal Funds to Upgrade Sewer Infrastructure and Help Prevent Future Closures  No New Spending Schumer   13 Billion Funding Gap Forced to Come Out of Local LI Taxpayer Coffers as Standing at Bar Beach that has been closed four times already this summer  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer released a new report showing that Long Island communities have lost at least  60 million in lost economic activity and sales tax revenues due to beach closings that are typically caused by toxic stormwater run off and could lose  2 million per day if current trends continue  Schumer said the federal government has dramatically shortchanged Long Island local governments and communities across the country to the tune of  13 billion to help upgrade stormwater abatement systems  Long Island communities have already shelled out  86 million trying to comply with EPA guidelines but have had little assistance from the federal government    Schumer said that the lack of federal resources is draining taxpayers dollars and  with beach closures due to contamination on the rise  threatens the backbone of the Long Island tourism economy  Schumer was joined by Martin Cantor  Director of the Long Island Economic and Policy Institute at Dowling College  who compiled the report at Schumers request   These beach closures are a dagger to the heart of not only the psyche and soul of Long Island communities  but also local governments bottom lines  Schumer said  Towns and villages across Long Island are being forced to face a false choice  fighting pollution or keeping their budgets in check  Clean water and balanced books shouldnt have to be an either or choice  and they wouldnt have to be if Washington gave us money to help   Cantor noted that rain and preventing the related storm water runoff is critical to the Long Island economy because the summer beach season is only 96 days long  and once beach related tourism economic activity and related sales tax revenues are lost  they can never be recovered   Schumers report found that near weekly beach closings and advisories amounting to 30daysor 31  of the entire 96 day beach season threaten to cripple the Long Island tourism economy  Between Memorial Day and August 3  2007  or68 percent of the total beach going season which extends through Labor Day  Long Island communities lost  60 694 898 in economic activity and sales tax revenue  This is based on an estimated  20 per day spentby each beachgoerfor food  beverages  and other beach related incidentals  During this period an average of 40beaches per day have been closedfor an aggregate impact of 1 155 beach days lost  If this trend continues through Labor Day  Long Island Communities will lose another  20 million of economic activity and sales tax revenues  accruing at a rate of  2 million per day    Some of the communities that were hardest hit were Islip  which has lost  497 047 so far this summer  Southampton  770 833  Huntington  211 730  and Long Beach  158 178    The frequency and severity of beach closures have been on the rise over the last 5 years  From 2001 to 2005  the number of instances of beach closings is up from just 1 in 2001 in all of Nassau County up top 75 in 2005  and from 57 up to 137 in Suffolk County  In addition  in Nassau County there were five days in 2005 where 76 beaches were closed at once and Suffolk County had 33 days where 46beaches closed  This means that Nassau County lost 380 beach days and Suffolk lost 1 518   On Long Island there are over 150 beaches operated by federal  state  county  town and local municipalities  including the 26 mile long Fire Island    Schumer said one of the major causes for beach closures is the presence of toxic chemicals and bacteria found in stormwater runoff that flows off of highways and roads during storms and contaminates neighboring beaches  Of the 951 individual beach closures from 2001 to 2005 close to 39 percent can be contributed to stormwater runoff based on statewide averages    In order to prevent toxic stormwater from contaminating beaches and local communities  more than a decade ago  the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  put in place a two phase plan to decrease water contamination caused by rainwater laden with grease  heavy metals  and sediments from roads and parking lots  The first phase  adopted in 1990  targeted large cities of 100 000 or more  Phase II  implemented in March 2003  requires smaller municipal stormwater systems  like those on Long Island  to take aggressive steps to curb stormwater pollution   The new Clean Water Act Phase II rules require smaller municipal stormwater systems  like those on Long Island  to take aggressive steps to curb stormwater pollution with an array of costly measures  including educating the public on runoff reduction strategies  detecting and repairing illegal connections to stormwater systems  preventing contaminated sediments from seeping off of construction sites  and controlling runoff from new developments by planting trees and preserving green spaces    However  the federal government has dramatically short funded programs created to help localities comply with these regulations to the tune of  14 billion  This is funding that the Environmental Protection Agency was supposed to send state and municipal governments to help upgrade their stormwater and wastewater systems  but was never appropriated   Instead  communities on Long Island and across the country have had to shell out millions from their own coffers to pay for these expensive upgrades  This has drained local budgets and slowed the progress of these needed upgrades   Local communities are getting hit from both sides  First they have to foot the bill for these federally required upgrades  making progress understandably slow  which then costs them even more as dozens of beaches have to be closed  Schumer added   To help municipalities afford these measures and to prevent the costs being passed on to taxpayers  Schumer announced today that he is reintroducing the Stormwater Abatement Act  S 1716   This bill would make funds ordinarily reserved to deal with agricultural pollution permanently available for stormwater abatement  Known as Section 319 funds  and named after the Clean Water Act Section 319   these resources would provide local governments with fiscal relief while helping them protect our precious environment  This would open up roughly  200 million per year in existing funds to help upgrade infrastructure
