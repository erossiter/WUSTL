Modernization by DRS    Electronic Warfare and Network Systems   5 million for the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center  s LENS X Hypervelocity Ground Testing program   4 million for Carwell Products   Army and Marine Corps Corrosion Prevention program and  2 million for Buffalo  s NanoDynamics Inc  for their Portable SOFC JP 8 Demonstrators        This is great news for Western New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Western New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Western New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge         Western New York has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support         9 million in federal funds will go to DRS    Electronic Warfare and Network Systems for the UMTE Modernization project  Money for the UMTE program will be used to upgrade four existing systems located at one of the key ranges at the Nellis Test and Training Range in Nevada  The continuing proliferation of surface to air missiles and other anti aircraft presents a significant threat to our military forces  This upgrade of the UMTE systems takes advantage of mature and electronic warfare threat simulation technology and will result in more realistic training  and increased aircrew survivability  while providing substantial savings  DRS received  2 5 million of federal funding for UMTE modernization in FY 05         5 million in federal funds will go to the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center for the Lens X Hypervelocity Ground Testing facility  CUBRC has designed and tested a prototype of a revolutionary ground test facility capable of performing ground testing of full scale missile and space systems at Mach numbers from 10 to 22  These funds will fully complete  instrument and test this facility prior to the demonstration of its performance in investigating the communication  guidance and aero heating problems associated with advanced missile and space systems to mitigate the risks and costs associated with the new hypervelocity missile systems in initial development by the DOD  CUBRC is a strategic partnership whose mission is to bring together scientists and engineers from academia and industry to provide the synergism to expand the research capabilities of all and provide significant growth opportunities in Western New York  CUBRC received  2 5 million of federal funding in FY 05         2 million in federal funds will go to NanoDynamics  Inc  for the development of portable SOFC JP 8 Demonstrators  The Army has identified a critical need for ultra lightweight man portable power  chargers  and power management for dismounted soldiers  This project will demonstrate the validity of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell  SOFC  power generation technology that utilizes JP 8 and other commonly available military fuels  The Portable SOFC JP 8 demonstrator will develop 200 to 300 Watts in a low weight and volume  safe  reliable and cost effective power source that will increase the Future Force Warrior s tactical sustainability and survivability        4 million in federal funds will go to Carwell Products for their Army Corrosion Prevention and Control program and Marine Corps Corrosion Prevention and Control program  The  2 million for Carwell  s Army Corrosion Prevention and Control program will expand the Army  s highly successful Corrosion Prevention and Control Program and establish Corrosion Control Centers and mobile Corrosion Service Teams at Army high density vehicle locations  This effort will be expanded to include Army Prepositioned Stocks as well  The  2 million for the Marine Corps Corrosion Prevention and Control program will establish and operate Corrosion Service Centers  CSC  at Camp Lejeune  North Carolina  Camp Pendleton  California  Camp Kinser  Japan  Camp Smith  Hawaii  and ship facilities at Blount Island  FL and Albany  GA  These Corrosion Prevention and Control programs focus on extending the useful life of Army and Marine Corps equipment by reducing maintenance requirements and associated costs due to corrosion damage       The Senate Appropriations Committee included  440 billion in the bill which now heads to the floor for a full vote before the Senate  A vote is expected in the coming weeks  and after final passage a Conference Committee will
