IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 4  2005 Schumer  Central New York Faces Severe Shortage Of Volunteer Firefighters    Senator Unveils New Plan To Boost Recruitment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Schumer Stands with Local Firefighters And Announces New Schumer Hinchey Proposal That Would Give  1 000 Tax Credit to Volunteer Firefighters  Recruitment and Retention of Volunteer Firefighters Huge Problem for Central New York  Onondaga County Enrollment Has Dropped 35 Percent Since 1995  Schumer  Volunteer Firefighters Are True American Heroes and Deserve Recognition US Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a new proposal to support volunteer firefighters and emergency medical service  EMS  providers in Central New York  Joined by volunteer firefighters who shared their recruitment struggles  Schumer announced his legislation  the Supporting Emergency Responders Volunteer Efforts  SERVE  Act to offer a  1 000 tax credit for active members of volunteer firefighting and EMS organizations  Schumer specifically addressed the recruitment and retention problems that are plaguing Onondaga County        New York  s firefighters serve on the front lines of the War on Terror everyday     Schumer said    We must do everything we can to stand by them and give them the support they need to protect us and keep our communities safe  Areas across the Central New York and across the country are suffering from severe staffing shortages  and we must act immediately  I can think of no better way to show our gratitude for their sacrifice and address this crisis than by offering a  1 000 tax credit to each of these heroes          Schumer was joined by Onondaga County firefighters who shared their personal stories of service and discussed the importance of offering incentives to get people to join the volunteer fire and emergency services  Schumer  s tax credit  which is being sponsored by Congressman Maurice Hinchey in the US House of Representatives  would provide a  1 000 tax cut that would serve as an important recruitment tool for local groups to boost enrollment numbers  Most importantly  it is a way for the federal government to express the country s enormous gratitude for the daily sacrifices they make       Many communities around New York State rely on volunteer firefighters and EMS providers for much needed public services  but it is getting harder and harder to find people to fill the slots because middle class families have increasing demands on their time  or financial concerns that preclude their participation  The SERVE Act is designed to offer an incentive for people to get involved in their communities in this vitally important way       However  enrollment problems have reached a crisis stage in many areas of New York State  According to the Fireman  s Association of the State of New York  FASNY   fewer young people are joining the ranks  Many departments are having a hard time filling crews  especially during the day when most people are working  According to FASNY  enrollment of volunteer firefighters has dropped statewide 28 percent over the last ten years  leaving many departments thinly staffed  If this trend were to continue  many municipalities could find themselves without adequate fire protection in the near future  Onondaga County enrollment has plummeted 35 percent since 1995  leaving many nearby fire companies without adequate staff       While many local governments understand the need for a recruitment initiative  most simply do not have the resources to implement one  At the same time  our firefighters are often on the front lines of the War on Terror  and essential to our homeland security  Moreover  every single day we rely on volunteer firefighters to save residential and commercial property  and to clean up accidents and reopen our highways  all of which protects the economic prosperity of many of our communities       If enacted  the Schumer Hinchey bill  S  625  would provide a  1 000 federal tax credit to individuals who are active members of volunteer fire departments and emergency service crews to reward these brave men and women who risk their lives for little or no compensation  The SERVE Act would promote staffing at these emergency organizations to maintain the proper services needed to protect New York  s communities       Under the SERVE Act  any taxpayer who is a volunteer firefighter or EMS worker for the full year is entitled to a refundable federal tax credit of  1 000  if they work for part of the year  they are entitled to a pro rated amount  A refundable tax credit means that  if the credit exceeds their federal tax liability  they would receive the remainder as a tax refund         A tax credit for volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel will serve as an important recruitment tool for local companies that often have a difficult time getting people to sign up for volunteer service   said Hinchey  who has introduced the Supporting Emergency Responders Volunteer Efforts Act in the House since 2002    By providing a  1 000 tax credit that will make paying the bills easier  we will help encourage more community members to become volunteer firefighters and EMS providers  This  1 000 tax credit will also serve as a small token of our enormous appreciation for the risks our local firefighters and EMS providers take each day to protect us and our families  I am very appreciative of Senator Schumer s efforts to advance my legislation in the Senate and look forward to working with him          Schumer has long been an advocate for firefighters  In October 2000  Congress enacted the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  FIRE  Act to make federal grants available to fire departments to provide much needed firefighting equipment  training and fire prevention education programs  Last October  Congress reauthorized the legislation thru FY2009  Between FY2001 and FY2003   New York State received  53 026 million in FIRE grant funds   the third highest level in the country behind CA and PA       According to the National Fire Protection Association and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  which promulgated standards for the minimum number of fire fighters needed to safely and effectively respond to emergencies  an estimated 2 3 of all jurisdictions do not currently meet their safe staffing levels  In response to this concern  Congress enacted the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters  SAFER  Act to create a federal grant program to address the need of adequate staffing within the fire service  The goal of the SAFER Act is to hire up to 75 000 new firefighters over a seven year period       Schumer supports full funding of both the FIRE Act at  950 million and  1 billion for the SAFER Act in FY06  He cosponsored Senator Dodd s amendment to the Budget Resolution  which would have fully funded both the FIRE and SAFER Acts
