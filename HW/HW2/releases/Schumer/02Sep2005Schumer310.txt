                                    Floor Statement of Sen  Charles Schumer on Emergency Aid for the Victims of Hurricane Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mr  President  tonight our nation is experiencing one of the most tragic and heart rending natural disasters in our history  Entire towns have been destroyed  Lives upturned  families lost  and the chaos we have all watched unfold continues even tonight      Our hearts go out to the people of Louisiana  Mississippi and all of the Gulf states affected by Hurricane Katrina  And our prayers go out most of all to those still stranded in New Orleans and those who have lost loved ones  The images on TV are devastating   hungry  weeping children sitting on the street amidst garbage  family members returning to the destroyed remains of their neighborhoods  discovering they have lost everything they ever owned  from precious family keepsakes to their houses  cars and livelihoods and angry  frightened people  with nowhere to go and no rescue in sight  I join with all Americans  and people all over the world  in praying for the safe rescue of all the victims of this heart breaking tragedy     Four years ago  my City of New York faced a devastating attack and America stood with us in our time of need  New Yorkers will stand with the people of the Gulf region now as they stood with us      The love and support New Yorkers received from the rest of the country after 9 11 meant so much in the wake of those attacks and the long  difficult road to recovery  I want the people of New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf Coast to know we will support them too  no matter how long and difficult their recovery may be  We will do whatever it takes to help    now  tomorrow and into the future     Our first step comes tonight  when the Senate will agree to provide  10 5 billion in desperately needed disaster relief funds to the devastated region  And we will stand unified with President Bush and ready to provide everything and anything that New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf region will need to recover and rebuild  Just as we did after 9 11  this body and the entire nation will work together to overcome this disaster  The American people are strong and we will persevere     Like so many Americans  I have been watching the terrible images on TV and of course  I worry about the thousands of people still stranded at the Superdome and throughout the city and region without food  water  sanitary facilities or medical treatment  And I worry so very much about the desperately ill people  including small babies and frail seniors  who need medical care  And the people who may still be trapped in places rescuers have not yet reached     I know firsthand how difficult it can be to organize a massive rescue and recovery effort  and clearly this disaster is unprecedented in its scope and difficulty     Tonight a lot of peoples   lives still hang in the balance  Money for the long run is necessary  and that is why we are here tonight  but there is a lot more we must do immediately  We must focus all our efforts on rescuing those who are ill and need medicine  who are hungry and thirsty and frightened and despairing  We must get these people to shelter and to medical facilities immediately  We must fly in food  water  clothing  blankets  medicine and whatever else is needed  We must get as many ships  buses  and trucks as we can to transport the victims and begin clearing the wreckage  We must provide the soldiers and law enforcement officials needed to restore law and order     This is literally a life and death crisis  where every moment of delay has a human price  There is not a minute to lose  no matter the cost     I know the phones have been ringing off the hook in my office and those of my colleagues  We are hearing from our constituents who have so many difficult and heartfelt questions about what went wrong in this tragedy and what else could have been done to prevent it  Now we must keep our total focus on saving lives  but I want them to know that their questions are not falling on deaf ears  In due time  we will ask those tough questions  not to lay blame  but to learn from the mistakes that were made so that the nation will be better prepared for the next disaster we might face     But now is time for action  for solving these problems and for saving the lives that hang in the balance  In the days and months ahead this nation will pull together as we did after 9 11  We will do everything we can to help the victims and repair and rebuild the cities and towns of the Gulf  especially the much beloved City of New Orleans      Just as we did in New York  we will face difficulties and great sorrow  but I know I join all my colleagues here in the Senate in pledging all the assistance    financial and beyond    the Gulf region needs and anything else in our power to help our fellow citizens  Tonight our prayers are with them
