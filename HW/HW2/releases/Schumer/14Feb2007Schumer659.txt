IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 14  2007 Schumer Calls For Sharp Increase In Customs Screeners At Niagara Falls Airport   Says Sufficient Staffing Is Key To Making The Airport A World Class Shipping Hub                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Schumer Calls on US Customs and Border Protection to Promise that  As Cargo Traffic Increases  the Dept  Will Provide the Screeners Necessary to Ensure New Cargo Passes through Safely and Efficiently   On the Heels of a New Report Touting NF Airport as an International Shipping Hub and More Air Cargo Companies Interested in Increasing Service  Customs Must Ensure that the Airport Will be  Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  to provide specific assurances to the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority that it will provide as many agricultural and customs inspectors as necessary to accommodate any future increases in air cargo flow at Niagara Falls International Airport   Specifically  Schumer  who is leading the fight to make Niagara Falls Airport an international cargo shipping hub  asked CBP to provide specific and written assurances that  as cargo increases at the airport  the Department will commit an adequate number of screeners and whatever equipment and infrastructure is needed to avoid any cargo backups or delays   This assurance is vital as many cargo companies are seriously looking at increasing capacity and cargo throughput at the airport        In this instance we need the Customs  horses in the form of personnel to make sure we can move the carts that will come when cargo expands at Niagara Falls Airport   Schumer said   Certainty is a key to landing new firms and the NFTA must be able to let air cargo companies know that if they bring their business to Niagara Falls Airport  they ll be able to handle it  The bottom line is that CBP needs to step up to the plate and assure the NFTA that CBP will provide the manpower necessary so cargo can flow safely and efficiently should capacity expand at the airport        Schumer said that such a promise from CBP would go a long way toward reassuring interested air cargo companies that the airport will be able to handle any added traffic down the road   In addition  as the NFTA meets with these cargo companies  it is very important for them to be able to say that any new cargo will not be held up at screening       In some instances  cargo companies that NFTA officials have met with have said that they are interested in shipping perishable goods  such and fruits and vegetables  through Niagara Falls Airport from South America   A direct flight from South America to Niagara Falls would allow the shipping company to avoid a stop in Miami and directly offload the produce in Western New York for distribution throughout the Northeast and Midwest   Such a direct flight would reduce the travel time for the perishable goods by one or even two days        However  the companies have asked NFTA to seek the screeners assurance from CPB  because without adding additional CBP agricultural inspectors to accommodate the increased cargo flow  the one or two days saved by the direct flight could be lost if the goods have to wait to be screened once they arrive in Niagara Falls       Several cargo companies have already approached the NFTA about starting new service or expanding current operations at Niagara Falls airport  Last month  representatives from Polar Air  at Schumer s request  met with top NFTA officials and the parties are set for a second meeting in the coming weeks to discuss expanding cargo operations       Schumer said   The speed of processing is a key to growing cargo capacity  The potential to land new job creating businesses that ship perishable goods highlight the urgent need for an ironclad commitment to add new CBP screeners        Schumer also asked CBP to sit down with NFTA and local officials to go over what type of new infrastructure the airport would have to provide in order to accommodate any new screeners and screening stations   To date  CBP has provided some general information  but Schumer said the Department needs to provide specifics now so the NFTA can get to work before new companies and increased traffic comes to the airport       CBP inspectors screen inbound international cargo to prevent drugs  foreign agents  rotten or tainted food  or invasive species from entering the United States   In addition  these inspectors at times will check commercial products for counterfeit or stolen items   Schumer said it is vital that Niagara Falls have the screeners necessary to check incoming cargo safely and efficiently in order to avoid delays and to reassure shippers that their cargo is passing through a secure and responsible facility       In November  Schumer announced that Polar Air  a subsidiary of Atlas Air  had agreed to meet with officials from the NFTA to discuss bringing its services to the airport  Polar Air operates scheduled all cargo services with Boeing 747 aircraft  reaching destinations in North and South America  Europe and Asia  Schumer also said the CSX Corporation had agreed to meet with the  Come to America  Initiative to discuss cooperative efforts rail support for moving cargo in and through the Buffalo Niagara region  CSX operates rail lines throughout the eastern seaboard  as well as Ontario  Canada       During a June visit to the airport  Schumer said that Niagara Airport s transformation into a cargo center would be final step in making Western New York an intermodal cargo hub by interweaving rail  truck  sea and air shipping  Western New York is the crossroads of freight rail traffic in the Northeast  with CSX Corporation  Norfolk Southern  and Western New York Pennsylvania Railroad steadily increased shipments through the area
