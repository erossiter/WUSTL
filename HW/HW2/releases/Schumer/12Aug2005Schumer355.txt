Job Growth  Property Values  and Public Transit Ridership    New Federal Transportation Dollars Will Give Rochester the Downtown Hub That It Deserves                                                                      U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced the projected economic impact of the Renaissance Square Project today  including 4 000 new jobs  an increase in public transit ridership  and enhanced property values  Schumer was joined by Mayor Johnson  County Executive Brooks  and Monroe Community College officials to release new key dates for progress  including design  environmental study  land acquisition  demolition  and construction  As Schumer discussed the  24 million in federal funding slated for the project  officials announced the conceptual designs for the center will be released on September 7th         These federal dollars mean Renaissance Square is well on its way to becoming a reality     Schumer said    Not only will it have an enormous economic impact  but it will also strengthen Rochester  s public transportation  enhance artistic and education resources  and help build a strong sense of community  Renaissance Square is the key to our downtown revitalization efforts  and most importantly  will create thousands of new jobs             After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to Rochester and the Finger Lakes region     said Senator Clinton    These funds will go a long way towards helping communities make the infrastructure improvements needed to keep their economies moving   I am proud that our efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the ever increasing transportation demands on our state   We have made a substantial contribution to the future of Rochester by investing in these critical road and transit projects   I am especially pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Renaissance Square Project  which holds great promise for economic development and growth downtown      Two weeks ago  Senators Schumer and Clinton secured  10 million for the Renaissance Square Project  which will be used to design and build the transit center which will include a new Monroe Community College downtown campus and a performing arts center  This money is in addition to the funding provided by the House  and  8 million included in the Committee approved version of the Senate FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations bill  which is slated to be taken up by the full Senate later this year  bringing the total to more than  24 million headed toward the project  Since 1999  nearly  84 million in federal funds has been committed to this project        Schumer today released new projected figures for the economic impact of Renaissance Square on Rochester  including job growth  public transportation ridership  and property values      Job Growth   According to the US Dept of Transportation  every  1 billion in federal transportation spending creates 47 500 jobs   Since  84 million in federal money has been committed to Renaissance Square  this means the project could create nearly 4 000 direct and indirect jobs    Building a state of the art transit hub  performing arts center  and college campus will create an estimated 1 200 construction jobs  and will stimulate job growth in other sectors for many years to come   In addition to service and maintenance jobs in the facility  there will be new economic development in and around Downtown because businesses and developers will take advantage of the influx of commuters  shoppers  students  and visitors   When deciding where to locate  businesses look closely at the transportation options in the area  knowing that they need to pick a place that customers and employees can easily access   Renaissance Square  with its connections to the rest of Rochester  the suburbs  airport  and the fast ferry will make it the premier destination for new business in the area       Along with the transit center  the new performing arts center and college campus will make Downtown Rochester a social and cultural destination for all of Upstate   This will attract new night life  museums  restaurants  and other commercial business  meaning hundreds of new types of jobs for Rochester   This projection includes the establishment of new businesses in the area and the construction of hotels  condominiums  and commercial centers nearby   This will infuse millions of dollars in new business in to the area and create thousands of jobs      Public transportation ridership    According to Parsons Brinkerhoff  development around multi modal facilities can yield up to 20 to 40 percent higher ridership at the individual station through both commuter and non work trips  along with 5 percent system wide growth   Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority  RGTA  s  current system wide ridership is 40 000 people per day  with 15 million passengers per year   Within that number  25 000 per week use the system in downtown Rochester  Once completed  Renaissance Square will boost transit ridership all over the region        Increasing transit ridership helps all of Rochester by taking cars off of its already over burdened roads and highways   In addition  reducing congestion is environmentally sound because it cuts emissions and cleans the air   More riders will also boost revenues for RGRTA and will potentially allow it to expand in to new communities across Western New York and increase service within Rochester      Property Value Enhancements    Building Renaissance Square will also increase downtown property values dramatically   A report by Economics Research Associates  ERA  documents significant increases in property values for apartments  condominiums  commercial and retail properties located near transit stations  according to the Center for Livable Communities  In the study area  rent for retail space close to transit was almost three times higher than in other areas       In addition to Renaissance Square  the transportation bill also included  4 million for Rochester Institute of Technology Alternative Fuels and Life Cycle Engineering Research  The Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies  CIMS  at Rochester Institute of Technology  RIT  will create the Alternative Fuel   Life cycle Engineering Program to expand the use of alternative fuels  fuels other than gasoline and diesel  in the public transportation fleet  thereby reducing harmful environmental effects and the consumption of fossil fuels  extend the life cycle of public transportation vehicles  and optimize their performance  safety and uptime  through life cycle support and management  and promote vehicle remanufacturing and the use of remanufactured components to extend vehicle life  improve  performance and reduce capital purchase costs  while meeting environmental requirements
