IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 3  2006 With Negotiations In The Final Phase  Schumer Urges NFTA And Uniland To Include Three Critical Elements In Outer Harbor Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator Stresses That Agreement Must Incorporate Sections Parceled Off For Diverse Mix of Uses  Office Space to Attract New Large Scale Employers  And One Public Entity in Charge of Waterfront Development   Schumer  We Need Activity Along The Waterfront 24 7  365 Days A Year  The Waterfront Must Become The Vibrant Destination For Work  Play and New Families With negotiations over the development agreement for the Outer Harbor in the final phase  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on both the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority  NFTA  and Uniland Opus Lakefront Development Team to include three critical elements that will ensure the area  s success   Schumer  a longtime waterfront development advocate  believes the Inner and Outer Harbors can  and must  be transformed into a balanced mix of commercial office space to attract new employers  parkland and a thriving community for the City of Buffalo         Today  Schumer urged the NFTA and Uniland to include in their final agreement provisions that allow parceling off smaller sections for specialized developers to ensure a diverse mixed use  the development of job inducing office space along the Outer Harbor  and one public entity assume eventual responsibility for the development of the waterfront         We are at a critical juncture for a waterfront that is just bursting with potential for the future of Buffalo     Schumer said    We must use this opportunity to inject a new vigor into this project    the NFTA and the Lakefront Development Team must conclude their negotiations A S A P   and they must do so in a way that allows for the development of a balanced  dynamic 24 7 waterfront filled with new jobs  new parks and new homes               First  Schumer said the agreement should include a proven development principle followed by the successful waterfront Battery Park City project  parceling off smaller sections of the project for specialized developers  This would involve parceling the Outer Harbor into smaller sections  to be bid out to specialized developers in a competitive  public process  These pieces of the waterfront would be developed in accordance with the overall development plan agreed to between NFTA and Lakefront Development and will allow for a more flexible  organic and dynamic development plan that will give different developers the opportunity to what they do best  This would provide a diverse mix of uses along the waterfront    from recreation and retail to residential and office space  and we need to have developers doing what they do best in the context of an overall design   Schumer said that choosing the best developer for the parcels should be done in a competitive and public way    perhaps with a board of interested parties such as NFTA  Lakefront Development  City of Buffalo and the Erie Harbor Canal Development Corporation providing guidance and input to the decision             Second  Schumer stressed that it is critical that the agreement include provisions that allow for the development of significant job inducing office space along the Outer Harbor  Schumer has said that with the development of the waterfront  Buffalo has a unique opportunity to attract top notch employers to an attractive new environment  In the process of attracting large new employers  such as HealthNow and GEICO  to the area  Schumer believe economic development officials have a greater chance of landing new job creating business when they have a menu of location options to offer  The mixed use development will retain young people and attract newcomers who want to access the best of urban living    an exciting place to live  to work  and to play all at their fingertips  This effort must be synchronized with existing planning efforts  such as the master plan of the City of Buffalo  so that various nodes of economic development like the waterfront and the Downtown can both grow in a mutually beneficial way         Lastly  in terms of accountability  efficiency and success  Schumer stressed that it is critical that one    and only one    public entity assume eventual responsibility for the development of the waterfront  With the creation of the Erie Harbor Canal Development Corporation  there is a functioning public agency dedicated exclusively to waterfront development  As this organization matures and embraces its full mandate to develop Buffalo s whole waterfront  Schumer said the NFTA should turn over its control of the Outer Harbor to the EHCDC so that it can oversee a cohesive development of both the Outer Harbor and Inner Harbor      It is promising that there will be a final agreement within the next month     Schumer said    However  it is essential that the plan for the Outer Harbor include elements that will help it to thrive  Adding office space is critical to making the waterfront vibrant both during the day and after work  Enabling sections to be parceled off will ensure that the Outer Harbor plan is flexible and will lead to faster  smarter development  Finally  having one    and only one    public entity with the tools necessary to keep development moving forward and maintain the Outer Harbor is essential  We want to develop the waterfront into an area with constant activity and vitality that will contribute to the transformation of the City and entire region           In a personal letter to Gregg Stamm  Chair of the NFTA and Carl Montante of Uniland  Schumer wrote    As I have stated before  I have seen this formula  the mix of residential  retail  recreation and office space prove successful in Battery Park City along Lower Manhattan  s waterfront   I know it can be the key to the success of waterfront development in Buffalo too  In Western New York  we have long struggled to retain our youth who often move away after college  As a result  employers cannot find the type of young talent they require  and the entire region suffers  I believe that creating a lively waterfront could be the best tool we have to attract the new businesses that will entice our young workforce to stay in Buffalo  even as we create attractive new public spaces and new residential communities
