IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 11  2005 Schumer Urges Bush To Appoint Distinguished Delegation Of Former Military Leaders To Examine Iraqi Troop Training Deployment And Report To Public                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Today Sen  Chuck Schumer will send a letter to President Bush urging him to immediately appoint a distinguished delegation of retired military leaders to go to Iraq  examine the failures in troop training and deployment  and make a public report to the Congress and American people quickly  Schumer suggested that former military leaders like General Tommy Franks  General Norman Schwarzkopf  and Secretary Colin Powell should go to Iraq to make a first hand assessment about why the President s troop training plan is not going well  From all reports there is only one single battalion out of 97 that are ready to fight on its own in Iraq   that is only 750 troops       Schumer said    The lynchpin in the President  s plan for victory is training enough Iraqi troops so that they can stand up and the U S  forces can finally stand down    so it is critical to know what is going wrong  A distinguished delegation of former military leaders like General Tommy Franks  General Norman Schwarzkopf  and Secretary Colin Powell should be sent by the President to report back to the American public as soon as possible so we can fix these serious problems          Schumer  s letter to the President follows      December 11  2005      The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  DC 20500      Dear President Bush       As you know  the training and deployment of Iraqi Security Forces  ISF  capable of defending Iraq from outside influences and policing against domestic insurgents is a key objective of our ongoing efforts in Operation Iraqi Freedom  and one that must be completed before we can end our military presence  Like you  I recognize that America must succeed in Iraq and in order to accomplish that goal I steadfastly support the establishment of a competent and capable ISF       I am troubled by recent reports that the establishment of such forces is not moving forward as well as was hoped  and by the continuing inability to obtain a definitive assessment of the current status and abilities of the ISF  These matters lie at the very heart of the length and success of American military involvement in Iraq  and it is important for the American people to fully understand how much progress we have made in helping to establish the ISF       I am deeply concerned that the lack of this information will make it increasingly difficult to chart a proper course in Iraq and may ultimately serve to undermine our chances of success  In order to give America the best chance for lasting victory in Iraq  I urge you to appoint a senior delegation of distinguished retired military leaders to travel to Iraq  assess the situation for themselves  and issue a public report of their findings       As you have often said yourself   As the Iraqis stand up  we will stand down   Unfortunately  information available on the training and readiness of the ISF makes it difficult to predict when this will occur  For instance  in October it was revealed that out of over ninety ISF battalions  the number of fully independent  or  Category One  ISF battalions was revised down from three to one  The fact that two battalions were apparently downgraded would appear to be a significant step backward  In order to prevent any further regressions  it is important to have full and clear accounting of the situation on the ground and an explanation as to how this occurred       There are also important and unanswered questions as to the actual size and cohesiveness of the ISF  As of mid November the Department of Defense indicated that there were 211 700 members of the ISF  only about 65  of the number hoped to be reached by August of 2007  If we are to be successful in Iraq  we must clearly understand whether it is possible to complete training those already enlisted  as well as recruit and train the remaining personnel before the deadline       Similarly  information from the GAO would indicate that there is a significant chance that possibly tens of thousands of those in the police component of the ISF may have deserted  Concerns also abound that the ISF is still 18 24 months away from operational independence and lack a sufficient command structure  and are a target for insurgent infiltration  Obviously  we need to get to the bottom of whether or not the ranks of the ISF are stable and cohesive before we can certify that they have been fully trained and are ready to assume independent responsibility for Iraq s security       I agree with you that the stakes in Iraq and that the United States must succeed in its work there  By providing an unvarnished analysis of ISF numbers  capability  and cohesion the delegation I am asking you to appoint could provide the American people with an honest assessment of our progress  inform the Administration and Congress of the best path to take forward  and allow us to move toward the shared goal of bringing our troops home and out of harms way  I urge you to appoint this delegation as soon as possible       Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer  United States Senate
