                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Kids can log on and lose thousands with no safeguards or protections    Schumer unveils sweeping four point plan to combat underage online gambling menace This week  as NCAA March Madness kicks off and experts warn that online gambling is exploding in popularity  especially with New York kids  and problem gambling among adolescents is nearly three times the rate of compulsive gambling in the population at large  U S Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a new sweeping plan to stop online gambling sites from targeting minors  The online gaming industry has seen enormous upward growth in the past decade  in 1996 barely 30 sites existed  today there are nearly 2000 and none have enough safeguards to keep kids from playing         These online gambling sites think they have really hit the jackpot by targeting kids     Schumer said         Kids today grow up surfing the internet and know now that  in addition to parent and school mandated homework the web can now also be used be used for blackjack and poker          Online gambling is big business  especially with minors  Nationwide  the industry has increased exponentially in just a few years  Internet gambling pulled in  5 2 billion in 2003  up from  4 billion in 2002 and up from  1 1 billion in 1999  showing nearly 400  growth in four years  Gambling sites  because they are faceless  make it is far more difficult to deter minors from gambling  The websites can  t look at their customers to assess their age and request photo identification like in traditional casinos  Similarly  minors  many of whom are more tech savvy than their parents  can and do devise methods of defeating age verification procedures offered by some  but not all  on line gambling companies       The Annenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania reports that nationwide  the number of regular young gamblers is nearly 1 million  Approximately 25 000 New York City minors and young adults between the ages of 14 22 have played cards online in the past month  Over 55 000 minors and young adults have played cards online throughout New York State       Another study published in Montreal this year showed figures could be twice that  It found that 5 9  of people under the age of 18 had gambled online over the past 12 months  This translates to approximately 60 000 New York City minors and over 135 000 New York State minors gambling online in the past year       Among college students the numbers are even bigger  According to a recent Gallup poll  gambling has become more popular among students  whether they play for fun or more seriously through poker games and sports betting  Many college students use their hard earned money to gamble in poker games  casinos  pools and sports  In the last 12 months  67 to 71 percent of college students have gambled their money in one of these ways         Unless we take the necessary steps to eliminate online gambling  more and more of America s young people will be return from college holding a receipt of outstanding debt  instead of a diploma     said Schumer      Few of these sites have appropriate safeguards to keep kids from logging on to their sites and playing  The FTC reports that about 20  of online gambling sites contain warnings about minors  One study found that out of 37 randomly selected online gambling sites  a minor was able to register  play  and pay at 30 of them       Online gaming sites are not the only culprits  kids don t have to look far to find internet gambling sites  Banner ads and pop ups for casinos are everywhere on the Web  and often appear on sites popular with teens and even younger children  Many kids use sports betting sites where weekly winners are ranked and earn prizes  These sites are not considered to be hosting  real  gambling activities because visitors don t play for cash  Nevertheless  kids learn how to bet on these sites  which also often link to online casinos         The bottom line is  not enough being done to keep kids from logging onto computers and anteing up     said Schumer    Online gambling is an insidious hobby that could haunt these kids for the rest of their lives          To combat this dangerous scenario  today Schumer put forth a new plan to stop minors from gambling online  Specifically his plan will         Demand that online gambling sites not accept credit card payments from minors and verify identity and age information against available databases of government issued identification and age information  Credit card age verification procedures are inadequate because almost all credit card companies allow minors to hold credit cards         Encourage the FTC to create and publish a list of gambling websites so that parents are better educated on what sites exist and are better equipped to ascertain where their children are playing  The FTC has a   Kidz Privacy    page  targeted toward kids and their parents  it is perfectly suited for a comprehensive list of gambling websites that kids could potentially access  That site would be able to warn both parents and children about the risks of gambling online         Urge University presidents to block online gambling through university internet protocol  IP  addresses  Universities can block access to certain types of websites by blocking it from their IP address  This critical step would ensure that students are unable to gamble online using university computers or if they are connected on any computer to university servers         Push online gambling sites to include warnings on the dangers of gambling addiction and links to help sites such as Gamblers anonymous  Each site  under Schumer  s plan  would be required to put up labels to warn minors of the risks associated with gambling       Research shows that young men gamble online at nearly 3 times the rate of young women and that introducing someone to gambling at an early age is particularly dangerous  Experts warn that problem gambling among adolescents is nearly 3 times the rate of compulsive gambling among the population at large  Gambling also has the potential to lead to other problems as kids continue to grow  The National Council on Problem Gambling reports that kids who gamble are 50 percent more likely to binge drink  75 percent more likely to smoke marijuana and use tobacco       Senator Schumer was joined today by Tom Kenney  Director of GamPro  a comprehensive gamblers treatment program  www gampro org
