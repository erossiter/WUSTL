Bush to immediately issue a Major Disaster Declaration in order to provide federal aid for Broome  Chenango  Delaware  Herkimer  Hamilton  Montgomery  Otsego and Tioga Counties after severe rains two weeks ago   On November 27  Schumer wrote a letter to President George W  Bush and Director Paulison urging them to expedite an approval for New York State  s request for a major disaster declaration for counties hit by flash flooding on November 16  Senator Schumer also visited the Village of Sidney  NY on November 22 to discuss flood mitigation          FEMA disaster aid is essential for the communities that have been repeatedly hit with heavy rains and flooding     said Schumer     Local governments have been working hard to repair the devastating damage from previous storms in these communities  and now that they have been hammered again  they need support from the federal government to get the job done   FEMA aid must also get to flood victims so that they can get back on their feet as soon as possible           The flooding in Broome  Chenango  Delaware  Herkimer  Hamilton  Montgomery  Otsego and Tioga Counties occurred after annual rainfall averages totaled above 50 inches  well above the average for the year   As a result of the storm  highways were closed  gas and water lines ruptured  and public infrastructure was severely damaged   Hundreds of residents were evacuated or rescued from their homes  while many others were forced into shelters when their homes were left in ruins   Recovery costs are expected to surpass  32 000 000   This recent round of flooding compounds the damage incurred by these communities following this summer  s flooding       This recent round of flooding compounds the damage incurred by these communities following this summer  s flooding  Directly following the June floods  Schumer urged Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison  Governor Pataki  and President Bush to rush funds and assistance to storm ravaged areas    Schumer also urged Director Paulison to work swiftly to provide displaced individuals and families of Delaware and surrounding counties with trailers as they worked to repair their homes  He successfully urged FEMA to provide several types of individual and public assistance  the Small Business Administration  SBA  to award several disaster loans to local businesses after this summer  s floods  and the Department of Agriculture to grant millions of dollars in disaster related aid   Senator Schumer wrote FEMA to support the NYS Office of Mental Health  s application for funding under the Crisis Counseling Services program to provide services to those affected by the floods   In response to the latest November floods  Schumer urged Director Paulison and President Bush to expedite federal assistance for Broome and Delaware Counties  On November 22  Schumer toured the Amphenol facility  located in the Village of Sidney  to survey flood damage and discuss with local officials and business leaders what kind of federal aid is needed for recovery and long term mitigation   Schumer has facilitated discussions with Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  and the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to explore long term projects to prevent future damage          My office has been inundated with calls from anxious citizens with broken boilers and public officials with gaping budget holes who are concerned that the aid is being held up and will not arrive in time for them to deal with the cold weather and other looming problems     said Schumer       Last week  Schumer sent the following letter to the President and FEMA       President George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500      R  David Paulison  Director for Federal Emergency Management  500 C Street  SW  Washington  DC 20472     November 27  2006      Dear President Bush  Director Paulison       I am writing to urge you to expeditiously approve New York State  s request for a major disaster declaration for Broome  Chenango  Delaware  Herkimer  Hamilton  Montgomery  Otsego and Tioga counties following the crippling flash flooding that occurred on November 16th   Based on damage assessments conducted by state and federal emergency personnel  Governor Pataki has determined that the cost of recovery is beyond the capacity of the state and local governments   Federal assistance is urgently needed to help these communities recuperate       The 3 4 inches of rain that fell that night added to land already saturated by 47 inches of rain this year  well above the annual average   The storm caused highways closures  gas and water line ruptures and other severe damage to public infrastructure  businesses and individuals   Hundreds of residents had to be rescued and evacuated from their homes and car roofs  shelters have been set up to house hundreds whose homes have been left uninhabitable   The cost for recovery is expected to surpass  32 000 000       Tragically  each of the counties now seeking federal assistance is the victim of repeated severe flooding   Every one of these communities has recently been financially and emotionally overwhelmed by declared federal disasters   The costs from this storm alone are too great for the local governments to cope with on their own   When you consider that these communities are already steeped in repair and recovery efforts from prior disasters  it is unequivocally clear that federal aid is needed immediately       I ask that you issue a major disaster declaration for the affected counties without delay  ensuring that that the proper aid to individuals and local governments is delivered promptly   If you have any questions or concerns  please do not hesitate to contact Stacey Warady  in my office  at  202  224 7276   Thank you for your consideration of this important matter   Sincerely        Charles E  Schumer  U S  Senator
