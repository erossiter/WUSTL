IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 30  2005 New Schumer Study   Shame Of The Service     41  Of NY Reservist Families Now Suffer Deep Economic Hardship While Breadwinners Serve In Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Failure endangers future reserve enlistments  Senator  joined by reserve families  announces new push in Washington to right this wrong   New Schumer   Standing With Our Troops Tax Credits would encourage employers to keep paying reservists   salary while serving overseas Standing with Long Island and New York City reservists  military families and small business leaders  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today released a study that includes the newest data on New York military reservist families and finds that nearly half of them   some 41     are losing significant amounts of income while serving  Schumer today also unveiled a new plan to give tax breaks to employers who pay the salaries of activated reservists while the reservists are abroad fighting the War on Terror   which would cut the financial drain on reservist families          It  s the shame of the service  Reservists give up everything normal in their lives to fly halfway around the world to fight terror  only to take a huge hit in income back at home     Schumer said    If a reservist bought a house at his old salary and his wife and kids are still living in it  no bank is going to cut his mortgage 60  just because that  s the salary hit he  s taking to do his duty  We need to step up to the plate to help companies keep the jobs and paychecks coming until the reservists come back home to us          Schumer  s new study uses the latest troop data available from the Pentagon  s Defense Manpower Data Center  as of December 1  2004  and finds that more than 7 400 New Yorkers  including 2 406 from New York City and 733 from Long Island  are currently in activated status in the National Guard and Reserves  While these personnel are away from home fighting the War on Terror  their families often have trouble making ends meet  When reservists are activated  they receive the same pay as active duty military  except in very rare circumstances  However  military pay is determined by a combination of rank and experience  so different reservists are paid different amounts  In 2004  active duty enlisted military personnel paygrades started at  27 013 and officers   paygrade started at  41 856  according to the Uniformed Services Almanac  For 2005  pay rates will be about 3 5  higher        These figures do not include combat and other special pay  For a soldier serving in Iraq or Afghanistan  they could get on a monthly basis  225 in hostile fire pay   250 in family separation pay if they have dependents   100 in hardship pay in some cases  and a  105 in per diems  All told  soldier could be getting  680 a month on top of the figures above       But data from the non partisan and independent federal Government Accountability Office finds 41 percent of National Guard and Reserve drilling unit members reported income loss during past military operations  and senior officers in the reserve component reported average losses of  5 000 in income  For our troops  this loss in pay leaves great strains on the home front  Troops are forced to devote attention to whether their families can pay the bills  which diverts attention away from their mission  Families that are struggling with emotional strain of a spouse and parent being away and in harm  s way also must deal with the financial strain of lost income       In some cases  businesses who employ these reservists will continue to pay the difference between activated member  s civilian salary and their military salary  Schumer said today these employers are true patriots because this sacrifice can end up an expensive endeavor for small businesses    especially with the now frequent extensions of tours of duty  In addition  small business employers often have a difficult time finding temporary workers to fill while the reservists are serving  since the new employees know that the reservists can come back to claim their old jobs       Schumer today released the following report detailing the number of reservists in New York serving active duty as of November 31  2004  source  Defense Manpower Data Center  DOD          Click  to view chart      Schumer also released the following breakdown of activated reservists by arm of the military for New York State        Click  to view chart       Schumer today also detailed a new plan that he and the other members of the Senate Democratic Leadership team introduced as legislation on Monday  the Standing With Our Troops Act of 2005  which includes provisions to boost income security for the families of New York  s reservists currently serving active duty and to encourage more of their small business employers to pay the income difference while they serve  Also known as S  11  the Standing With Our Troops Act was the very first bill introduced by the Democrats in the Congress  It will            Create federal tax credits for employers to make up for 50  of the reservists   pay gap  Standing With Our Troops would provide a tax credit worth 50  of the salaries that employers are continuing to pay activated Guard and Reserve employees to make up for the income gap the reservists suffer while abroad  The tax credit would be applied on the company  s federal income taxes and would be worth up to  15 000 per employee  It is designed to reward patriotic employers who keep paying these salaries and encourage more employers to do so            Create federal tax credits to help small business owners and manufacturers hire temporary workers  Standing With Our Troops would also provide a  6 000 federal tax credit to help small businesses hire temporary workers to fill in for activated employees and a separate  10 000 credit for small manufacturers to hire temporary workers       Last week  Schumer formally joined the powerful Senate Finance Committee  which is in charge of all tax writing legislation in the Senate         The War on Terror is unlike any other war we  re ever fought  and we  re fighting it with an military unlike any we  ve ever had  Our military is more effective than ever not only because our men and women in uniform are better trained  but because so many of them are reservists who are a little older and have a little more real world seasoning  But that experience comes with important jobs and important obligations they  re leaving behind back home   and we need to create a way to help them keep those obligations     Schumer said       Schumer was joined today by military families including Francis Robinson Mercer  whose husband is currently serving in Iraq  Suffolk County Police Officer and Iraq Reservist Veteran Major Michael Simonelli  originally from Sheepshead Bay   Robert Farkas of the Association of the US Army  Ralph
