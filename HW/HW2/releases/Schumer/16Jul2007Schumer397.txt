IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 16  2007 House Approves Schumer Bill To Break Months Long Passport Gridlock And Hire Back Experienced Staff To Speed Up Processing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        With House   Senate Passage  Schumer Legislation Will Allow Dept  of State to Hire Back Foreign Service Employees Who Are Trained Passport Processors   Passport Application Explosion Creating Unprecedented Backlog Across The Country  Ruined Countless Vacations   State Says Up To 100 Workers Will Be Hired As a Direct Result of Schumer Bill                                             With staggering backlogs at passport processing centers across the country  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that his bill to break the passport log jam was approved by the full House of Representatives today  which comes on the heels of unanimous Senate approval last month  As amended  Schumers legislation  S  966  would give the Department of State flexibility to rehire retired Foreign Service employees to staff overwhelmed passport processing centers that are experiencing interminable turnaround times for new passports  The State Department will now have access to a long list of qualified retired adjudicators who can be called up to help process passport applications safely and efficiently  Schumer said that fear and confusion over impending new passport rules have led directly to the explosion in applications and processing gridlock  The Senate must vote one final time to approve House amendments before sending the bill to the President for his signature  The passport system is on the path toward a mass meltdown as processing delays have pushed the average wait time to two and a half months  said Schumer  These unacceptable delays are disrupting the lives of thousands of travelers and businesses  This bill will allow the State Department to tap into a wealth of retired employees who are already trained to process passports and assist travelers  Hopefully  these experienced people will be at their desks this summer to help people get their passports   Schumers legislation grants flexibility to the State Department to rehire  on a temporary basis  retired and fully trained passport processors to help existing processors manage the increased demand  Currently  retirees from Foreign Service have little incentive to assist in crises because they lose retirement benefits if they exceed strict wage and hour caps  The State Department has admitted that they have a database of qualified retired adjudicators at the ready who can be called up to help or who can extend their assistance if the Department is granted this new flexibility to respond to crisis situations  The Department of State already had some authority to waive the caps on working  but it was limited to personnel for Iraq and Afghanistan  Schumer s legislation expands this flexibility and waives salary caps so that the State Department can also recruit Foreign Service retirees in order to meet passport demand caused by new passport rules and to assist with visa processing at overwhelmed consular offices overseas  Against a backdrop of confusion and concern over new travel restrictions  the Department of State has been receiving over 1 million passport applications per month  The avalanche of requests buried its staff and caused delays of up to six weeks over normal processing times just as many people prepared to travel over the spring and summer  Schumer said that the current bottleneck is affecting all stages of passport processing  from the initial scanning of an application to the adjudication of citizenship  Call centers to assist people in New York   City and across the country are overwhelmed with passport processing issues but do not have the staff necessary to address the influx of calls  In response  the State Department has tried lengthening work hours and requiring overtime  but it is still crippled by a lack of qualified personnel who have undergone the background checks necessary to handle sensitive passport adjudications  The State Department recently admitted that it underestimated the increased demand that would be caused by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative and other passport policy changes  It takes the Department anywhere between three months and a year to vet and train a new passport adjudicator  but this necessary security precaution leaves the Department with little flexibility to handle surges in demand like the current crisis  According to the State Department  applications for new passports and renewals received between October 2006 and March 2007 rose 44 percent over the same period in 2005 2006  As a result  the Department is warning travelers that routine passport processing will take 10 12 weeks instead of the previous six  and expedited processing could take 2 3 weeks instead of two weeks  About 12 million passport applications were processed in 2006 and as many as 17 million are expected this year  the department said  At a hearing on June 19  the State Department told Congress that 2 95 million passport applications were currently pending  Sadly  this administration is unusually adept at imposing strict new guidelines and unusually inept when it comes to providing the resources necessary to meet them  This bill will give the State Department a critical safety valve to meet soaring passport demand  said Schumer  Shortly after Schumers initial call to break the logjam with this legislation  the Office of Personnel Management agreed on March 30  2007  to grant a similar waiver for the rehiring of civil service employees  This means that the State Department will also be able to tap into the reserve of retired civil service personnel already trained as passport processors  to alleviate the situation  Two weeks ago  after another Schumer call  the State Department admitted that it will refund the  60 passport expedite fee for all New Yorkers who paid the fee and have still not received their passports in an expedited fashion
