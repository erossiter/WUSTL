IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 19  2005 Schumer Announces Senate   House Passed Bill Establishing New Life Saving Umbilical Cord Blood Program

                                    175 000 People Nationally Diagnosed With Fatal Diseases That Cord Blood Can Treat  New Program Would Turn   Medical Waste into Medical Miracles      Schumer Traveled New York To Speak with Patients and Doctors On The Promise of This Science                                                                                                                                                           U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today that the U S  House of Representatives and the Senate passed the Cord Blood Stem Cell Act  which would create a network of qualified cord blood banking centers to prepare  store  and distribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the treatment of patients and to support research using such cells  Schumer  who co sponsored the legislation  met with doctors and patients across New York about the promise of this science throughout the year          This is an incredible opportunity to turn medical waste into medical miracles     Schumer said    There has always been a major deficit of bone marrow  and people find it almost impossible to find a match  But now  by making cord blood more accessible  we can help people who are in grave need  Today we are not only offering them hope  but also the promise of a science that saves lives           Umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells  which are the building blocks of the immune system and can be used to treat a variety of life threatening diseases  Cord blood has the ability to treat the same diseases as bone marrow but can be used in more situations because its cells are less mature than marrow cells and does not require a perfect genetic match to be used in a transplant        The Cord Blood Stem Cell Act  which passed both houses of Congress with overwhelming bipartisan majorities  would provide a total of  265 million for life saving stem cell therapeutic therapy  cord blood and bone marrow treatment   The legislation authorizes  79 million dollars for the collection of cord blood stem cells with the goal of reaching a total inventory of 150 000 units  making matched stem cells available to treat more than 90 percent of patients  with a particular focus on providing genetic diversity   It also reauthorizes the national bone marrow transplant system at  186 million over the next 5 years and combines both systems    cord blood and bone marrow    under a new program to provide an easy  single access point for information for doctors and patients       The national program would promote stem cell research by requiring participating cord blood banks to donate units that are not suitable for transplant to researchers who are working on new applications for cord blood stem cells   In addition  for the first time  a nationwide stem cell transplantation system would be established         At least 175 000 people nationwide over the past five years have been diagnosed with fatal diseases that can be treated by a bone marrow transplant  but many die waiting for a donor match  Blood from umbilical cords  a byproduct of birth  is a rich source of hematopoietic  HEM  AT OH POE  ET IC  progenitor cells  The only other place this type of stem cell is found is in bone marrow  Transplants of the stem cells have been used to cure a variety of lethal blood diseases from leukemia to sickle cell anemia   Bone marrow donors are difficult to find for sick patients because a perfect genetic match is usually required between donor and recipient  Cord blood stem cells  however  are less mature than those in bone marrow and can be successfully used even when there is not a perfect match        Cord blood stem cell transplants have saved the lives of roughly 20 000 Americans with fatal blood diseases  Unfortunately  thousands of patients who might benefit from these transplants die every year waiting for a bone marrow match if they have not heard about the cord blood option or if not enough units exist in public banks to provide for a match          There are approximately 180 000 units of cord blood stored in banks across the country  The Institute of Medicine figures that 50 000 units of the 180 000 currently in inventory are usable  but at least 150 000 usable units are needed to meet demand   The problem is compatibility  which experts say is determined by six surface proteins  or HLA markers  on each cell  The more closely the markers on the donor s cells match those of the recipient  the less likely it is that the patient s body will reject the transplant   Transplant recipients  especially African and Asian minorities  are much more likely to find a compatible donor if the supply of cord blood is tripled   While cord blood has been used in pediatric transplants for several years  it is only now starting to gain traction in the adult community      In addition to patients with leukemia  cord blood is now being used to treat over 60 other fatal immune and blood diseases  These include  severe combined immune deficiency    boy in the bubble syndrome      lymphoma  adrenoleukodystrophy  Lorenzo  s Oil Disease   and Sickle Cell Anemia among others       Cord blood also offers an extraordinary amount of hope for African Americans  who have the lowest success rate of finding non related bone marrow donors  The ethnic diversity of the bone marrow registry is quite low  although African Americans make up 12  of the population  they only account for 6  of the bone marrow registry  Many African Americans also have both European and African ancestry which puts them at a disadvantage because a person with both tissue types has much more difficulty finding a match  Because of the diversity of tissue types  an African American requires three times the number of donors as a Caucasian to have the same chance of finding a match  Cord blood is a particularly good choice for this community because it doesn  t require a perfect match
