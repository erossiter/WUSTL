IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 20  2007 Schumer Tells Chertoff  Go Back To Drawing Board On Inadequate Radiation Detectors And Renegotiate Contracts With Device Manufacturers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Senator Says Contractors Should Help With Costs of Certification Tests on Deficient Devices  Urges DHS to Seek New Partners on Project Calls for DHS Inspector General To Conduct Review of All Department Contracts Related To Screening Equipment WASHINGTON  DCWith the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  again delaying plans to deploy radiation detectors along the U S  border because of deficiencies with the technology  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  today demanded that the department consider new contractors for the project and immediately seek to renegotiate its contracts with the devices current manufacturers in order to offset the cost burden to the federal government from testing the machines    Citing concern about a related report that DHS improperly awarded a separate  no bid contract to a Virginia based company to maintain detection devices  Schumer also called for the departments Inspector General to undertake a top to bottom review of all DHS contracts related to the manufacture and deployment of next generation screening equipment    This is one of the most vital areas of our security and protection  When the Department of Homeland Security messes up royally on such an important mission  it makes every American less secure and should make every American wonder about the towering incompetence of this department  Schumer said    More than one year after Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff announced contracts to buy as many as 1400 cutting edge machines that can detect and identify radioactive material in cargo containers  the department has reportedly purchased fewer than 60 of the devicesand even those have not met basic performance standards   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that DHS officials have said that the machinesknown as advanced spectroscopic portal radiation monitors  ASPs  could be more than a year from being ready  This is just the latest setback for the project  DHS officials have repeatedly proclaimed ASPs to be ready for implementation  only to see the deviceswhich cost almost  400 000 eachcontinue to under perform in routine field tests    Homeland Security officials awarded these contracts thinking the technology they were buying was close to being ready  but clearly that is not the case  The contracts for these machines need to be reexamined  Schumer said  These detectors are promising and absolutely critical to keeping radiological material from crossing our borders  but the administrations strategy for putting them into use has been a disaster  We need to usher in the next generation of screening equipment at our borders and ports  but DHS isnt getting the job done    Security experts have envisioned the machines serving a critical role in screening cargo containers at both overseas ports and at domestic terminals such as the Port of New York and New Jersey  Government officials have also planned to deploy the devices along land borders  The technology could also be used in the Securing the Cities program  which seeks to deploy a network of detection devices around New York City to maximize security and prevent radiological attack    The  1 2 billion plan to develop and purchase the ASP technology was announced with much fanfare in July of 2006  The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had previously informed Secretary Chertoff that the machines were effective  Since the contract was announced  however  the Government Accountability Office has repeatedly raised questions about the performance of the machines and the governments testing process    The terms of the original contract between DHS and the device manufacturers called for a year to be dedicated to research and development  followed by four years of system acquisition  In a letter sent today to Chertoff  Schumer said that the planned timetable has been disrupted by the technology not being ready  He said DHS should renegotiate its contracts accordingly and even seek new partners to develop the technology  Schumer added that DHS should press the projects current partners  Raytheon Co  of Waltham  Mass   Thermo Electron Corp  of Waltham  Mass   and Canberra Industries in Meriden  Conn to agree to absorb some of the costs associated with the recurring rounds of testing that the government has had to undertake in unsuccessful attempts to certify the machines functionality    News of the delayed implementation of the ASPs coincided with a separate published report today on a  475 million  no bid contract that was improperly awarded by DHS to Chenega Technology Services  The firm  hired to service thousands of screening machines at U S  border checkpoints  was wrongly considered as a small  disadvantaged business  the departments inspector general found  In light of the report  Schumer called for a comprehensive review of all contracts awarded to companies producing or servicing detection equipment deployed at U S  borders    DHS has been reckless in determining who gets entrusted with the critical equipment that protects our borders  Schumer said  From developing to deploying to servicing this advanced technology  we need much better controls to ensure that taxpayers money only goes where it belongs
