IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 19  2005 Schumer Study Reveals  Upstate NY Short Of Millions Of Bird Flu Treatment    Senator Demands Immediate Licensing Of Production To More Companies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Tamiflu  the Only Effective Treatment of Bird Flu in Humans is in Short Supply  Roche  the Only Producer of the Drug  Has Said No Other Companies Could Produce It   Schumer Plan Allows Roche to Be Reimbursed  but Requires Company to License Production to 5 U S  Companies Within 30 Days Because of Shortage    Schumer Reveals How Many Antivirals Needed To Protect New Yorkers In Each County  Cap Region As experts predict a shortage for Tamiflu  the only known effective Avian Flu antiviral for humans  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today  that 2 79 million upstate New Yorkers would be left without treatment should an outbreak occur  Schumer today demanded that Roche  which has the exclusive right to produce Tamiflu  sub license production to five U S  companies in the next 30 days  Schumer  s call comes on the heels of worldwide concern that this particular strain may soon develop into a deadly pathogen in humans and cause a horrible epidemic in the United States and throughout the world with little ability to treat it  Roche has said they  re exploring licensing other companies  but there are no agreements to date and as the drug s sole patent holder  Roche has been unable to produce sufficient amounts of Tamiflu for government stockpiles         The numbers speak for themselves     Schumer said    If we increase the number of manufacturers producing Tamiflu  we can protect many more New Yorkers and Americans if a pandemic breaks out  Once the avian flu develops in people it will get to New York in the blink of eye and we must prepare for the worst because if we don  t once avian flu arrives we will be defenseless  By allowing other companies to produce this critical vaccine we  ll be much better prepared should the Avian Flu come our way          Schumer today released a county by county statistical  showing how many antiviral doses are needed to protect New Yorkers should a panedemic occur        The Capital Region could require over 337 000 doses of Tamiflu if an epidemic of Avian Flu broke out  The region  s share of the current national supply of 2 3 million doses is only 8 100         Central New York could require over 317 000 doses of Tamiflu if an epidemic of Avian Flu broke out  The region  s share of the current national supply of 2 3 million doses is only 7 600 doses         The Hudson Valley could require over 778 000 doses of Tamiflu if an epidemic of Avian Flu broke out  The region  s share of the current national supply of 2 3 million doses is only 18 700 doses         North Country could require over 188 000 doses of Tamiflu if an epidemic of Avian Flu broke out  The region  s share of the current national supply of 2 3 million doses is only 4 500 doses         The Rochester Finger Lakes region could require over 424 000 doses of Tamiflu if an epidemic of Avian Flu broke out  The region  s share of the current national supply of 2 3 million doses is only 10 200 doses          The Southern Tier could require over 222 000 doses of Tamiflu if an epidemic of Avian Flu broke out out  The region  s share of the current national supply of 2 3 million doses is only 5 300 doses       Western New York could require over 524 000 doses of Tamiflu if an epidemic of Avian Flu were to break out  The region  s share of the current national supply of 2 3 million doses is only 12 600 doses        Roche currently holds the patent for Tamiflu    the brand name version of oseltamivir and the only effective known treatment for the Bird Flu    through 2016  As the only company authorized by the drug s inventor  Gilead  to use its patents  Roche is limited to producing as much Tamiflu as its manufacturing plants can handle  Many more countries want to stockpile Tamiflu than Roche is able to supply  and the United States is currently far down on the waiting list  If pandemic flu was to happen this flu season  many countries  including the U S   would be left with no recourse for treatment  Roche has refused to license its product to other companies in order to ease the bottleneck and make sure that each country has enough Tamiflu on hand in case pandemic flu breaks out       Infectious disease experts advise that each country have enough Tamiflu on hand for 40    50  of its population  That would require the U S  to stockpile enough of the drug for over 100 million people  yet U S  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt has called for a supply for only 20 million  and the U S  has only enough pills right now to treat 2 3 million  Experts say that just over 2 million treatments will barely cover the military and emergency workers  who represent about 1  of the population  Roche has said that producing enough pills to treat 20 million people    let alone the 100 million treatments we actually need    will take years        If we increase the number of manufacturers producing Tamiflu  we can protect many more Americans should a pandemic hit   Schumer said   Knowing we have enough Tamiflu  just in case  would go a long way towards calming the public about potential shortages and hopefully dissuade people from buying  stockpiling or even taking a drug they currently don t need        In an effort to ensure that the United States doesn  t face a deadly shortage of the drug today Senator Schumer called for compulsory licensing of Tamiflu  The Senator  s plan will compensate Roche for the extra drugs produced by other companies    compensation Roche would not receive if no one was allowed to make extra doses of the drug  The problem  Schumer explained  is not the expense of the drug but rather the shortage of supply  which would immediately be rectified if other companies were able to produce it       Schumer said today that he is  on Roche to issue compulsory licenses within a month  if not he will do it with a legislative vehicle  Under the Senator  s proposal  the government will contract with a limited number of generic companies to produce just as much Tamiflu as is needed for stockpiling purposes  It will make two equivalent payments for each dose of drug produced  one to Roche for the use of its technology  and one to the generic company for completing the production       Though Roche has said it would take any generic company at least three years to ramp up to make the drug  experts in the generic drug industry disagree  Several U S  based companies are already interested and believe their existing manufacturing plants can be ready to produce the drug long before Roche can build more of its own  Companies in India and Taiwan are already prepared to begin production       Schumer said that in order for any of the generic manufacturers to reach agreements with HHS  the United States would have to agree not to seek indemnification from the generic drug manufacturers if Roche successfully sued  and would also have to agree to indemnify the manufacturers in the event Roche successfully sued them for patent infringement  Federal law permits the United States to purchase products from manufacturers other than the patent holder  but says that the government could be liable for the patent holder s recovery of  reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture   28 U S C      1498  No injunction preventing the generic manufacturers from producing oseltamivir and selling it to the government is available under     1498       The bird flu  knows as H5N1  has killed tens and maybe hundreds of millions of animals since it appeared in Asia in 1997 and has infected 120 people  killing half  The strain has been identified as a type A influenza virus which is both genetically versatile and able to elude a variety of defenses making it extraordinarily dangerous  This specific type of virus constantly changes as it replicates  Additionally H5N1 has never been a strain of flu before  so nobody has any form of immunity to this type of flu       H5N1 can also swap genetic materials and merge  This   reassortment process    creates a new strain that differs from both the parent strains and as a result  no population has immunity to the new strain and no existing vaccines can protect them  According to the World Health Organization  WHO   H5N1 has a documented ability to cause severe disease in humans        Even birds that survive the infection excrete the virus for at least 10 days  orally and in feces  thereby facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by migratory birds  The spread of infection in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans  If more humans become infected over time  the likelihood also increases that humans  if infected with both human and avian influenza strains  could serve as the   mixing vessel    for the emergence of a new strain with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person  Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic       In the wake of the Anthrax attacks using letters to the U S  Capitol and other places around the country in 2001  Schumer called on the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with generic companies to produce Cipro  a drug prescribed to those who were in the vicinity of the deadly substance  Cipro  a product of the pharmaceutical giant  Bayer  was in short supply and prohibitively expensive at a cost of  400 per patient  almost twice the cost of manufacturing the drug  Bayer responded by reaching an agreement with the government to produce more of the antibiotic and lower its price  Schumer hopes that Roche will respond in similar good faith to his request       Schumer is also a cosponsor of the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act of 2005  S  1821   The bill would        Prepare for a pandemic by finalizing  implementing  and funding pandemic preparedness and response plans         Improve surveillance and international partnerships so we may monitor the spread of avian influenza and detect the emergence of a flu strain with pandemic potential immediately         Protect Americans though the development  production  and distribution of an effective vaccine       Plan ahead for a pandemic by stockpiling antivirals  vaccines  and other essential medications and supplies         Strengthen our public health infrastructure         Inform Americans by increasing awareness and education about pandemic flu        According to the Wall Street Journal  scientists believe that flu pandemics occur in 25 year cycles  the most recent pandemic was in 1968  In the past century there have been three flu pandemics  each triggered by genes in bird viruses  The 1918 pandemic left 40 million people dead  and between one and four million died in each the 1957 and 1968 milder flu pandemics       The common flu spreads through the air making it extraordinarily easy to pass from one person to another  If the avian flu mutates so that it can spread from person to person  a cough in an office or a sneeze in a subway car could have dire consequences  Avian flu symptoms in humans start off with a mild fever  joint pain and headaches and develops into fever and respiratory difficulty  As oxygen gets cut off from the brain  coma and death may follow       Click here to view    Click here to view  to Roche
