IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 20  2005 Schumer Statement For Local Advisory Panel On Canandaigua VAMC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Schumer Successfully Lobbied New VA Secretary Jim Nicholson To Maintain Advisory Panel U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today submitted a statement to the CARES Local Advisory Panel  outlining the importance of the community advisory board and his commitment to maintaining the critical services provided at Canandaigua VA hospital  Schumer  who led the fight to establish the panel  aggressively and successfully lobbied the new Veterans Administration Secretary Jim Nicholson to maintain the community advisory board      Statement of Senator Charles E  Schumer for the CARES Local Advisory Panel for the Canandaigua VAMC       I thank the CARES Local Advisory Panel for allowing me to present this statement  and to express the hopes that I share with the Finger Lakes area  s veterans about the role that the proceedings of this panel will play in the development of a master plan to carry out the final phase of the CARES process       I would also like to thank the panel for remedying a fatal flaw in the CARES process by allowing the people most deeply impacted by these decisions  the veterans of this community  to speak at today  s meeting  When I testified before the CARES Commission  I was extraordinarily proud to present a petition signed by over 80 000 New Yorkers from across the state supporting the continuation of medical services at the Canandaigua Veterans   Hospital  The voices heard in that petition  and in the efforts of the entire community throughout the CARES process sent a loud and clear message to the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  that discontinuing medical services in Canandaigua would have been a monumental mistake  Without these voices  it would have been impossible to alter the VA  s recommendation to move desperately needed medical services to facilities in Bath  Batavia  Syracuse  and Buffalo  Excluding those voices from the Commission  s hearing was a mistake  The Panel  s inclusion of those voices today is a tremendous step in the right direction and should be continued throughout the process       Under the final CARES decision this panel  in cooperation with Price Waterhouse Coopers  PWC   has been charged with developing alternatives to facilitate the construction of a new  multi specialty outpatient clinic and nursing home complex in Canandaigua  This decision represented a vast improvement over the initial plan that would have forced the overwhelming majority of veterans who receive inpatient care at Canandaigua  and their families  to travel greater distances and experience longer waits to receive medical care  While these unnecessary barriers to quality healthcare have been largely eliminated by the final CARES decision  I believe that this panel and PWC must continue to work closely with the community to ensure that the final result of the CARES process in Canandaigua is not just to maintain  but enhance the quality of veterans healthcare       Canandaigua has previously been ranked as the top veterans healthcare facility in upstate New York  and received a rating of 94 out of 100  placing it among the very top facilities in the nation  It  s hard to believe that too radically altering services at that facility can do anything but harm the overall quality of veterans   healthcare in the Finger Lakes area  That is why I strongly believe that to the fullest extent possible  the master plan developed by this panel and PWC should attempt to locate any new healthcare facilities on the grounds of the existing Canandaigua VAMC  By doing so the VA would be able to take advantage of its existing facilities and personnel to ensure that the new medical facilities augment  rather than erode  the quality of veterans healthcare in the Finger Lakes       While I was extremely pleased with most aspects of the final CARES decision regarding Canandaigua  I remain skeptical of the decision to move acute inpatient psychiatric services from Canandaigua to facilities in Buffalo and Syracuse  I still do not believe that provision of mental healthcare services received an adequately detailed review throughout the CARES process  and am concerned that the decision to transfer these services to other facilities will significantly hinder the ability of veterans suffering from dementia  post traumatic stress disorder  and a variety of other mental illnesses to obtain quality treatment and remain close to their loved ones  When considering options for inclusion in the master plan  I urge the panel to take any possible steps to mitigate the consequences of this proposal       It is also of critical importance that the panel and PWC ensure that the recommendations contained in the master plan do not detract from the important role played by the Canandaigua VAMC in the local economy  Since it  s opening  this facility has been a linchpin of the community  providing 800 local residents with jobs and serving as one of the top employers in Ontario County  In addition  the facility has acted as a centerpiece of community life  It is of the utmost importance that the panel and PWC guarantee that these roles in the community are preserved       This nation made a pact with the generations of brave men and women who we ve been so fortunate to have don the uniform and risk the ultimate sacrifice for us  In return for their service  we would take care of them when they got back  It is my sincerest hope that by continuing to listen to the voice of the community and by protecting the quality of veterans healthcare service in Canandaigua  this panel can make good on that promise       I thank the Panel for the opportunity to present this statement at today  s hearings
