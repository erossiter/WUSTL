                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Concerns Have Arisen On The Impact This Decision Will Have On Local Veterans And The VA  s New Mission As Center Of Excellence In Mental Health   Schumer  Community Needs To Know Details Of The Plan Before VA Takes Any Action                                                                                                                                                                        U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to keep the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  s Acute Psychiatric Unit open  and requested a personal meeting with the Secretary to discuss the future of the campus   Earlier this month  the VA announced that services would remain on the Canandaigua VAMC campus and not move elsewhere in the area       The future of VA services in Canandaigua appears bright  but the details are still vague and the community needs to know what the plan is     Schumer said     The Acute Psych Unit has been an integral part of this facility  and it seems closing this unit so quickly while there are so many questions is just plain wrong   This is hallowed ground    this is what has served veterans in the past and we want it to serve the veterans in the future   We are not going to rest until this community gets everything it wants        Schumer expressed two main concerns regarding closure of the acute psychiatric unit   First  he is concerned about the impact that closure would have on area veterans who need acute psychiatric care   Veterans in a mental health crisis need continuity of care to get better   Canandaigua  s award winning  top quality services meet those needs  especially in light of new efforts launched at this facility  such as the geriatric psychiatry unit and the psychiatric rehabilitation unit   Taking acute care away from Canandaigua and sending veterans to Buffalo  Syracuse  or other cities would interrupt that continuum of care   This is especially worrisome given the number of veterans who will be returning from service in Iraq and Afghanistan who may very well need the mental health services offered at Canandaigua    Secondly  he is concerned about how eliminating a key element of psychiatric care fits in with Canandaigua  s new mission as a Center of Excellence in mental health   While the center is expected to focus on post traumatic stress disorders  final plans are not in place   Schumer said it would be reasonable to delay a decision on closing the acute psychiatric unit until plans for this center of excellence become better defined  hoping there is a role for the acute unit to play in the new center of excellence      During last month  s announcement  the VA said they will continue to study the best way to provide inpatient and outpatient services  and expect to have a final plan completed by the spring of 2007   They said the options under consideration would preserve the historic core of the campus through a combination of partial renovation and new construction  and that they would receive additional input from the local advisory panel as they finalize plans for the Canandaigua campus     In a personal letter to R  James Nicholson  Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Schumer wrote    I feel strongly that the VA needs to reconsider the closure of Canandaigua  s acute psychiatric unit   Again  it is vital that any decision regarding these beds at Canandaigua be halted until a complete  final decision is made on the future of the Canandaigua VAMC        Schumer has been very active in ensuring that the Canandaigua VA stayed open for services for New York veterans   Schumer has called former Secretary Tony Principi and R  James Nicholson numerous times over the past three years  lobbying to save Canandaigua VA  and to keep VA services on the current campus   On October 20  2003  Schumer testified before the CARES committee  stating that closing the facility would create a crisis in health care for area veterans and an economic crisis in the community   Schumer also presented the commission with a large box with 80 000 signed petitions by state residents opposed to the shutdown plan   When Secretary Nicholson took over the VA in 2005  Schumer pressed him to support the community advisory board  and to not make changes to the board   Nicholson assured Schumer that he would continue to support the local advisory panel examining Canandaigua   Then  in March 2006  Schumer urged President George W  Bush to visit the facility
