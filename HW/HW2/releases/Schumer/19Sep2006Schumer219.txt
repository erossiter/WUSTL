IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 19  2006 Schumer Reveals Major Medicare Part D Drug Plans Could Suddenly Drop Out Of Program Next Month  Seniors Left With Less Than Three Months To Find New Coverage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Unbeknownst to the More Than 486 000 Upstate New York Seniors Enrolled In Medicare Part D  CMS Will Announce Oct 2 that Some Drug Plans May Not Be Around in 2007  Thousands of Seniors Forced Go Through Sign Up Ordeal All Over Again   Senator Calls on CMS to Provide Individual Notifications to Seniors Who Could Suddenly Lose Coverage  Give Specific Guidance About Similar Plans and Advice t Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed untold numbers seniors could find out next month that they will either have to change prescription drug plans or lose coverage altogether because plans participating in the Medicare Part D program could suddenly drop out of the program   On October 2  the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services  the agency that administers the Part D program  is expected to announce which insurance companies have decided not to offer coverage in Medicare Part D next year   Unfortunately for the more than 486 000 upstate New York seniors enrolled in Part D who thought they had finished the onerous sign up process  CMS has only given them less than three months to go through it all over again and find a new plan         There are so many twists and turns with Medicare Part D  it  s as if upstate New York seniors are doing the slalom     Schumer said     Seniors just went through the time intensive and complicated process of signing up for one of these programs last year and now they find out they may have to do it all over again   CMS needs to give upstate New York seniors straight and easy to understand information about their program choices so we don  t have a repeat of last year  s near chaos        On October 2  CMS will release the new list of plans that will offer Medicare Part D drug coverage for calendar year 2007   Unfortunately for many seniors  some plans have already notified CMS that they will not offer coverage next year  forcing seniors to choose another plan   In addition  insurance providers that opt to continue to participate in Part D have the option to change  scale back  or raise premiums for their coverage   This could confuse many seniors that already had enough trouble picking a plan that meets their needs in the first place     According to the rules set by CMS  plans that are staying in Medicare Part D will be able to start sending out advertising materials for their new 2007 plans on October 1 of this year   However  seniors will only have from November 15 to January 1  2007 to decide which new plan they want  or risk losing all coverage for the entire year    The true timeframe is even tighter  given that seniors who sign up in the last half of December will probably encounter problems at the pharmacy because CMS will not have been able to fully process their requests by January 1st   Schumer said CMS has only given seniors less than two and a half months to go through a process that took far longer last year     More than 486 000 upstate New York seniors have enrolled in Medicare Part D     In light of what could be a very sudden change for tens of thousands of seniors  Schumer today called on CMS Administrator Mark McClellan to provide individual notifications for seniors whose plans are being discontinued   In these notifications  Schumer urged McClellan to include personalized information and specific recommendations of plans that seniors can easily sign up for with similar costs and benefits  as well as informing seniors of options for enhanced coverage that would avoid following into the donut hole     In addition  Schumer pointed out that the new   open season    from November 15 to January 1 would also provide an opportunity for all of the more than 77 000 upstate New York seniors who will fall in to the donut hole this year to pick a new plan with coverage in the gap   In July  Schumer revealed that under the current system  drug plans will pay 75 percent of senior  s drug costs between  250 and  2 250  but zero percent of the total costs between  2 250 and  5 100  with beneficiaries paying 100  of costs in the   donut hole      Coverage does not resume until the beneficiary reaches  5 100  leaving New York seniors to pay  2 850 in direct costs while in the donut hole     Once seniors fall in the donut hole  beneficiaries who had been paying  20 or  30 per month in co pays for their prescription medications will be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more   In addition  Schumer said that seniors in the donut hole get hit twice because they are forced to continue to pay their monthly premiums despite the lack of coverage   In July  Schumer announced he was pushing legislation to fill the gap in coverage  eliminate premiums for seniors while they are in the donut hole  and calling on insurers to provide plans without the donut hole in the future
