IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 4  2007 Schumer  Albany DA  This Week s Nationwide Steroid Busts Expose Gaping Hole In Feds Ability To Prosecute Trafficking Of Human Growth Hormone And Anabolic Steroids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Human Growth Hormone has Replaced Steroids as Performance Enhancing Drug of Choice  Internet Allows Illegal Pharmacies To Sell them Nationwide  Feds  Hands are Tied With No Federal Law Barring Unlawful Sale of Prescriptions   Schumer  Albany County D A  Soares Announce Bill to Make Growth Hormone a Controlled Substance  Criminalize Bad Faith Sale of Prescriptions This week  federal and local authorities exposed a multi state ring involved in the sale of possibly millions of dollars of steroids and human growth hormone over the internet  Today  Senator Schumer  standing with Albany County District Attorney P  David Soares  revealed that the federal government s hands are tied in the criminal prosecution of these cases  Schumer today unveiled legislation that would give the federal government the authority to criminally prosecute the bad faith sale of prescriptions  The legislation would also add human growth hormone to the list of  Schedule III  controlled substances   This would tighten restrictions on when human growth hormone can be lawfully dispensed   It also would allow for much tougher penalties for illegal trafficking        This week s raids have confirmed some of our worst fears about steroids and human growth hormone  buying either of these substances on the internet has become as simple as ordering a book online   Schumer said   With just a few clicks of the mouse anyone  including high school athletes  can find access to these poisonous  dangerous substances  and adding insult to injury  the Feds don t have the power to prosecute these cases  With unfettered access and no real punishment  there certainly is no compelling reason for unscrupulous pharmacies and users to stop         The arrests this week were made possible through the hard work of the Office of the Albany County District Attorney and partnerships with the Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement and several remarkable Florida law enforcement agencies   This is a good  first step  towards getting HGH and other prescription drugs off our streets in Albany County and out of the hands of our children   DA Soares stated today   The legislation posed by Senator Schumer today is crucial to preventing the illegal sale and distribution of harmful substances by giving Federal Authorities the ability to actively prosecute these criminals         On Tuesday  the Albany County District Attorney s office  led by David Soares executed numerous warrants in a multi state case concerning steroids human growth hormone and hydrocodone  At the center of this case are fraudulent doctors selling prescriptions to fraudulent pharmacies for these drugs  The Pharmacies take the orders    often over the internet    and fax the doctors the requests for the prescriptions   The doctors then typically fax the prescriptions back for a fee  all without doctor and patient ever meeting       One of the most popular drugs is Human Growth Hormone  HGH  which is popular with athletes looking to increase physical size and performance  Human growth hormone exists naturally in the body  and can be used to lawfully treat a handful of extremely serious conditions such as dwarfism and chronic wasting disease   However  because human growth hormone is hard to detect in drug tests  and can boost physical size and performance  it is popular with athletes   Human growth hormone poses potentially serious dangers  especially to young people        Designating human growth hormone as a Schedule III controlled substance allows federal regulation of the substance and is a formal  federal recognition that  1  it carries some potential for abuse   2  it has  under some circumstances  lawful  medical purposes  and  3  abuse of the substance could moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence   Also  the unlawful sale  distribution  or manufacture of a Schedule III substance carries penalties of up to five years imprisonment  and fines of up to  250 000 for an individual  or  1 000 000 for a company         Performance enhancing drugs have always been of concern to me  But as a United States Senator  and as a parent  I am much more concerned with the high school sophomore who is looking to bulk up for wrestling or to get faster for a track meet   HGH has a legitimate use for a very narrow group of patients  but like most drugs  when it is misused it can have disastrous results   Schumer said       Additionally  while the practice of selling prescriptions is illegal under New York law  it is not currently a federal crime   Schumer s legislation would fill this gap  by criminalizing the unlawful sale of a prescription for a controlled substance  targeting doctors who  sell  prescriptions to pharmacies   Under Schumer s new legislation  a doctor will sell a prescription  unlawfully  when he or she does so other than in good faith in the course of his or her professional practice          No more will fraudulent doctors be allowed to sell prescriptions to fraudulent pharmacies over the internet and across state lines  to  patients  they ve never even met   Schumer said    This law serves two purposes  to crack down on fraud  and to make sure that a serious  potentially harmful substance is regulated and administered only under the proper circumstances
