IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 8  2005 Schumer  New Orleans Rep  Jefferson Propose 5 Programs For Katrina Relief Based On What Succeeded In N Y  Post 9 11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Emphasis on Incentives at Getting Residents Businesses to Return to New Orleans as They Returned to Downtown NYC  Rent Mortgage Assistance  Commercial Residential   Liberty   Bonds  Business Recovery and Job Creation  Refinancing for Hospitals and Other Public Institutions  and Transportation Infrastructure   Schumer    Like the Rest of the Country Stood with New York on 9 11  We Will Stand with New Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and Rep  William Jefferson of New Orleans outlined the top five programs that helped New York City after September 11  2001  which should be transferred to the recovery and rebuilding efforts in New Orleans and the Gulf region  The programs  which are intended to bring back residents quickly and also offer incentives for businesses serve as a successful model for economic development in this hurricane devastated region        Schumer said    As your City of New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf Coast starts the long and difficult road to recovery in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  I am looking forward to working with you to develop successful Gulf Coast region economic development and recovery initiatives like the ones we created in New York after September 11th           The spirit of New York City and its leaders in a time of a horrible tragedy was remarkable   Jefferson said   And the City of New Orleans shares that spirit to rebuild and return to the vibrant  cultural and historical American Mecca that it has been for centuries  I look forward to working with you on our recovery efforts and I look forward to the day that our residents are able to return to a brighter future at home        Approximately one million citizens have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina and today the Congressional Budget Office announced that they estimate Hurricane Katrina will cost the U S  economy some 400 000 jobs  It is already estimated that Louisiana alone has lost at least 110 000 businesses  with that number sure to climb as we calculate the full extent of the damage  And  just as we did in New York after 9 11  we must quickly design a Federal incentive package to spur job creation and attract businesses and residents back to the region        Retaining Residents  The first and most urgent task  once the environmental clean up is completed  will be to encourage residents to return to the area  After 9 11  thousands of residents were displaced and we knew we needed an aggressive effort to attract them back to Lower Manhattan  which was desolate after the attacks  Using  226 million in HUD funds  the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation  LMDC   the economic development agency leading the recovery effort  created several residential grant programs that assisted over 65 000 households and could be replicated along the Gulf Coast        The Two Year Commitment Based Program provided grants of up to  12 000  covering up to 30 percent of rental or mortgage costs  over two years to those who committed to staying in the area for at least two years  The September 11 Family Grant provided between  750 and  1 500 per household with children that made a one year commitment to live in Lower Manhattan  FEMA also provided  200 million in Mortgage and Rental Assistance  which saved thousands of families who lost at least 25 percent of their income from losing their homes as well  and provided another  34 million to address short term lodging expenses and temporary housing repairs         Liberty   Bonds  The Liberty Bonds program was our most flexible and successful economic development initiative  It was designed to provide triple tax exempt financing to spur new commercial and residential development  both of which were needed in Lower Manhattan after 9 11  The Liberty Bond program cost  1 2 billion  but leveraged  8 billion in bonding authority  and spurred tens of billions of dollars in new construction in approximately 20 new commercial and residential projects       Business Recovery and Job Creation  Approximately 18 000 businesses in New York City  representing over 560 000 employees were disrupted or forced to relocate after 9 11  We were able to designate  1 7 billion in CDBG grants for businesses to be used by LMDC to retain and create jobs  attract and retain both large and small firms  as well as non profit organizations  And we were able to use the funds with unprecedented flexibility and a minimum of bureaucracy as many of our businesses  like yours  had lost all their records  Our goal was simple    keep businesses and jobs from deserting the City and moving to other States or overseas       LMDC administered four main programs  The Business Recovery Grant Program  the Small Firm Attraction   Retention Program  the Job Creation   Retention Program and the Disproportionate Loss of Workforce Grant  LMDC offered additional programs  including Bridge Loans  Employee Training Assistance and Compensation for Business Losses  So far  New York has spent nearly  1 2 billion to assist nearly 16 000 businesses and helped create and retain over 250 000 jobs       Bond Refinancing for Municipalities  Public Hospitals and Authorities  Many public institutions  especially local hospitals  were financially devastated in the wake of September 11 and as part of the recovery effort  Congress authorized New York City and State to advance refund  9 billion of general obligation bonds  Much like refinancing a mortgage  advance refunding allows a state or local government or public authority to take advantage of lower interest rates and reduce payments it makes on general obligation bonds  which are bonds issued for governmental purposes  such as building schools and roads  Normally  a general obligation bond can be advance refunded only once  but Congress allowed one additional advance refunding for a limited amount of bonds  saving hospitals and other entities hundreds of millions of dollars in interest costs       Transportation Infrastructure  Finally  while all the grants and tax incentives were so important in the immediate aftermath of 9 11  I realized that the best hope for the full economic recovery of New York lay in making substantial investments in our transportation infrastructure and I made that one of my top priorities in my negotiations with the White House        As you may know  there are strict rules about the use of Federal disaster funds for transportation projects  Those funds are to be used only to restore the affected transportation infrastructure to its pre disaster condition  But for an area of major economic devastation we felt that requirement was extremely short sighted  Lower Manhattan  for example  had a maze of disconnected and antiquated and sometimes redundant subway lines  lack of a centralized concourse linking the subways and PATH train  and no connection to Kennedy Airport  To just rebuild to a pre 9 11 state would have been a wasted opportunity to really improve the economic potential of Lower Manhattan       So New York transportation officials and agencies worked together to design a comprehensive list of projects for Downtown  including  4 55 billion for new transit infrastructure that will attract businesses and residents to the area  Clearly New Orleans and the Gulf Coast face the same situation on a much larger scale  with a need to redesign and upgrade the entire region  s infrastructure and public transportation network  The investments made here will pay dividends for generations to come        These comprehensive programs are intended to ensure that the poorest and the richest residents of our city  our government  our business community  and our public institutions are able to return to New Orleans without further economic distress   Jefferson said   We hope to learn from New York s recovery but we must also recognize that rebuilding an entire coastline of our Nation is a massive undertaking and will take the total commitment of our federal government to succeed  I thank Mr  Schumer for his commitment and look forward to working with my colleagues in both houses of Congress as the legislative process moves forward        Schumer concluded    In the days and months ahead this nation will pull together as we did after 9 11  We will do everything we can to help the victims and repair and rebuild the cities and towns of the Gulf  especially the much beloved City of New Orleans  At the very least I hope the lessons we learned during our recovery effort can be used to help you in your efforts in the weeks  months and years ahead
