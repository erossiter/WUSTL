Personally With Wilson On November 2nd   Schumer Joined By Ralph Wilson  The Bills Owner                                                                                                                                  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  joined by Ralph Wilson  the Bills Owner  today brought the fight to keep the Bills in Buffalo to the national stage  Schumer  a longtime advocate for the Bills  is forming a new coalition of Senior Senators representing small market teams from across the country to elevate the fight for teams like the Bills   Schumer also urged National Football League  NFL  Commissioner Roger Goodell  to work to ensure the preservation of small market teams   The NFL team owners are set to meet on October 24  and Schumer announced that Goodell will personally meet with Ralph Wilson on November 2 to discuss the needs of the team   After Goodell was elected NFL Commissioner  Schumer urged the Jamestown native to visit with Wilson as soon as possible       The Bills are one of Western New York  s greatest assets  and I want to be sure they stay and succeed     Schumer said    Goodell will be meeting with Ralph Wilson in less than a month  and that is a good step in the right direction   The formation of a coalition with my colleagues  who also represent small market teams  will ensure the Bills  and similar teams  get their fair revenue share and are protected   Small market teams are a vital part of local economies and the culture in these cities  and it is important that we work together to keep football in our communities        The NFL recently negotiated a Collective Bargaining Agreement  CBA  with its players  and among other issues  the agreement could alter the revenue sharing practices of the teams in the league  and many small market teams have expressed their concerns over the impact this could have on their ability to thrive in their current hometown  Over the next few months  the NFL and its team owners will make critical decisions about these issues     Schumer today urged his colleagues who represent small market teams  to join him in bringing attention to the plight of their hometown teams struggling to compete with teams in more lucrative and populous areas   Schumer specifically called on Senators who represent the Arizona Cardinals  Atlanta  Georgia  Falcons  Minnesota Vikings  Baltimore  Maryland  Ravens  Cincinnati  Ohio  Bengals  Cleveland  Ohio  Browns  Green Bay  Wisconsin  Packers  Indianapolis  Indiana  Colts  Tampa Bay  Florida  Buccaneers  Kansas City  Missouri  Chiefs  St  Louis  Missouri  Rams  New Orleans  Louisiana  Saints  Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  Steelers  Seattle  Washington  Seahawks and Tennessee Titans     Schumer said that the presence of an NFL franchise in smaller markets are important not just for the local economic impacts but also for the collective regional psyche and the broader influence the presence of a national league team has over the decisions of businesses to bring their operations  other tourist attractions and economic development opportunities to a City   Unfortunately  in many cases factors beyond the control of small market teams pose significant challenges to the team  s financial ability to compete  The ability of small market teams to generate revenue and compete for talented players is largely dictated by their ability to price tickets  merchandise  naming rights etc in a scale their local economy can afford  and yet  at the same time  their expenses such as player salaries are dictated by the national market   Traditionally  the NFL has been very aware of these circumstances and has put revenue sharing measures in place that create an equitable market so that all teams can attract the players they need to remain competitive  However  Schumer told his colleagues that it appears this balance is now in jeopardy   Schumer is concerned that the NFL is in danger of veering from its time honored approach toward economic and competitive balance between the small and large market teams  Before the effect shows up on the field and the ability of small market teams to stay viable    Schumer believes something must be done  and together these Senators can make a difference     Schumer gave the example that a business in Buffalo whose revenues were entirely based on the local economic environment but all the expenses were dictated by the expenses of New York City   He asked the Senators to imagine how long a business might last in that environment   This gives a basic description of some of the challenges that face small market teams     In a personal letter to the Senators  Schumer wrote    As a member of this small market team coalition  I would ask that you work closely with your state  s small market team owner to raise awareness of the potential impact of league changes  Lead peer to peer with other interested parties in your state  Encourage mayor to speak to mayors  county executive to county executive  etc and begin the chorus of conversation from your state to the leadership of the NFL about the importance of this issue  And finally  contact the leadership of the NFL and the owners of all NFL teams to ask that they actively supportive measures that will ensure the viability of small market teams and to preserve the character of the game as a national sport        Over the last several months  Schumer has been actively advocating for the Buffalo Bills to the NFL leadership and by raising public awareness of the issue with prominent Buffalonians like Jack Kemp and Tim Russert  Schumer worked closely with Commissioner Tagliabue and is now working with Commissioner Goodell to communicate the small market team  s point of view throughout negotiations around the CBA to ensure that measures are put in place that protect the health of small market teams but also the league in general  Goodell  a native of Jamestown  New York  was selected unanimously by NFL owners in early August  and his five year term began in September   Schumer immediately urged Goodell  in a personal phone conversation  to do everything he can to keep the Bills in Buffalo  Schumer and Goodell discussed the importance of making sure that small market teams are protected in any final revenue sharing agreements   Earlier this year  Schumer lobbied outgoing NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to ensure the league  s Qualifier Committee includes representatives from small market franchises  On April 21  after a meeting organized by Schumer with Tagliabue and Buffalo native Tim Russert  Tagliabue announced that Bills owner Ralph Wilson would serve on the eight team committee that is now determining how league revenues will be split       I am asking my fellow Senators to stand with me to protect our hometown teams   The power of the larger market teams who have competing interests over many of these decisions cannot be ignored  I believe it is critical that we build a coalition of advocates for the interests of small market teams to ensure their needs are met     Schumer added
