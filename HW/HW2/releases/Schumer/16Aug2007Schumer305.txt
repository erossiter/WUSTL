Calls for More U S  Inspectors on Ground in China  Reaffirms Need for  Import Czar     Chinese Manufacturers Must Meet U S  Safety Standards to Prevent Unsafe Consumer Products from Entering the U S                                Washington  DC  Citing the urgent need to clamp down on the flow of hazardous products into the United States from China  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the State Department to pressure China to allow U S  inspectors inside Chinese manufacturing facilities that produce U S  bound toys In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice  Schumer expressed grave concern about the Chinese governments inadequate response to the problem  which resurfaced this week when over 9 million Mattel toys exported from China were pulled from store shelves across the country   On Wednesday  Chinese government officials sought to ease U S  consumer concerns with promises of reformed product safety measures  but Schumer called Chinas proposed spot checks and product labeling system insufficient  The Senator urged Rice to demand Chinese cooperation with a plan to open its factories for point of origin inspections by U S  regulators  similar to checks already performed by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  on food and medicinal items   Performing serious inspections isnt childs play  It requires tracing this problem to its source  Schumer said  Parents should be able to buy toys for their kids without having to scrutinize labels and worry that their children will be put in harms way during playtime  We need more people on the ground in countries like China to inspect the factories where toys are made and ensure that they are not producing products dangerous to children   This weeks recall of over 9 million toys targets items containing rare earth magnets These extremely strong magnetsused in toys such as Mattels Polly Pocket dolls and Mega Brands Magnetixare 20 times more powerful than a typical refrigerator magnet  If multiple magets are ingested  they can cause serious damage by attracting to one another through the intestinal walls  which can cause blockages and rip soft tissue  The Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  has received complaints regarding toys that use rare earth magnets since 2000  documenting over 100 ingestions and one fatality    China already allows the FDA to inspect Chinese manufacturing facilities that produce food and medicinal items destined for the U S  However  there is no official  U S  government in country inspection of the many consumer goods that are manufactured in China and imported to the U S   In June  1 5 million Thomas the Tank Engine trains were recalled due to the use of lead paint  Since January  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  has issued 26 product recallsover 8 million individual itemsdue to lead paint hazards  89  of those items were manufactured in China  More than 15 million toys have been recalled in the U S  since 2006 due to their use of rare earth magnets   On Wednesday  Schumer announced plans to introduce legislation creating an import czar  The position would be installed as part of the Department of Commerce  and would be charged with coordinating the efforts of the various regulatory agencies charged with consumer safety related to imports   The text of Schumers letter to Rice is reproduced below     August 16  2007  The Honorable Condoleezza Rice Secretary of State U S  Department of State 2201 C Street NW Washington   DC 20520  Dear Secretary Rice   I am writing to express my grave concern about the flood of tainted Chinese imports and the Chinese governments insufficient and ineffectual response to this situation  The State Department  under your leadership  should pressure the Chinese government to openits toy manufacturing facilities to United States inspection teams in order to identify the sources of these problems and ensure that products intended for our children conform to the United States high product safety standards   Almost every week  we read about anothertaintedproduct being recalled that originated in the Peoples Republic of China  Whether it is fish  tires  toothpaste  or childrens toys  we must be vigilant in safeguarding our nations health and welfare  At a press conference yesterday  the Chinese government  while acknowledging the existence of a problem  yet again proposed a very feeble solution  Random checks and stickers on products will not solve this serious and urgent problem  I believewe should work with the Chinese government to allow U S  inspectors into Chinese manufacturing facilities while respecting Chinas sovereignty and WTO rules   Today  Food and Drug Administration inspectorsare allowed to inspect foreign manufacturing facilities  While flawsexistwith this process  I envision the precedent of working with the Chinese government is there to allow for additional inspections of toy manufacturing plants  Additionally  the Memorandum of Understanding with China signed in 2004  along with the 2005 Plan of Action  should provide support for a U S  request to inspect factories that produce products for our children  I know you share my commitment to protecting American consumers I appreciate your promptattention to this vitally important issue     Sincerely     Charles E  Schumer  United States Senator
