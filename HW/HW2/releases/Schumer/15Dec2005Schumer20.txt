IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 15  2005 Citing 9 11 Report Card  Schumer Urges Administration to Include  1b in FY07 Budget For Screening Systems Like SureScan  s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In This Year  s Appropriations Bill  Schumer Aggressively Lobbied For Measure That Allocated  45 Million to Deploy Machines Like SureScan   SureScan Developing State of the Art Bomb Detecting Device With Application For Airports  Ports and Mail  Could Bring Hundreds Of Job To Southern Tier U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today wrote a letter to President George W  Bush  urging him to include at least  1 billion in funding in next year  s budget both to deploy baggage screening equipment  like SureScan  s machines  and to install in line screening systems in commercial airports  According to the 9 11 Commission and aviation security experts  the best way to scan and secure checked baggage before it is placed on a commercial flight is by using in line baggage screening systems  SureScan  in Endicott  has created a state of the art in line screening system that can detect bomb devices at a much faster rate than existing systems  processing 1000 bags per hour as opposed to the 300 that current devices can scan and have fewer false alarms       Additional funding will be a step in the right direction not only for national security but for SureScan and the entire Greater Binghamton region     Schumer said    We need to ensure that the TSA and airports have the funds they need to implement the first rate homeland security systems SureScan is creating  This technology could greatly improve airport security if it is deployed widely  but we need to investment both to purchase these machines and to implement the in line screening systems at our airports  This could also mean hundreds of new jobs for the area  I will continue to fight hard for SureScan as they work to make this country a safer place         SureScan plans to manufacture a bomb detecting device that is designed to be much faster than existing ones  processing 1000 bags per hour as opposed to the 300 that current devices can scan  In addition  this device will have fewer false alarms  10  as opposed to the 30  that current ones experience   and is less expensive than current technology  In addition  SureScan plans to manufacture larger machines for processing cargo      In a personal letter to President Bush  Schumer wrote    Seventeen years ago next week  a bomb placed in a passenger  s checked baggage exploded over Lockerbie  Scotland  killing 270 people  This tragic event could be easily repeated  The 9 11 Public Disclosure Project rated the government   s effort to screen and secure checked baggage a   D     specifically saying   improvements here have not been made a priority by the Congress or the administration  Progress on implementation of in line screening has been slow  The main impediment is inadequate funding     We need to be doing much more to prevent this type of attack     I urge you to include at least  1 billion in your budget so airports across the country can purchase this vital equipment and implement the in line screening systems as the 9 11 Commission has recommended        To be able to sell the device to airports and other government agencies for potentially lucrative contracts  there needs to be official TSA certification  SureScan  a private company in Endicott is currently in close communications with the TSA and should be submitting for certification in the coming months     TSA has not determined the total cost of installing in line EDS baggage screening systems at airports that it had determined need these systems to maintain compliance with the congressional mandate to screen all checked baggage for explosives using explosive detection systems  or to achieve more efficient and streamlined checked baggage screening operations  However  TSA and airport industry association officials have estimated that the total cost of installing in line systems is  a rough orderof magnitude estimate  from  3 billion to more than  5 billion     In May  Schumer met with EIT  s and Sure Scan  s leadership  including President and CEO James J  McNamara and LeeAnn Levesque General Manager of SureScan Corporation who urged Schumer to secure this measure  Schumer has been active in Sure Scan  s certification process  which involves sending the unit down to the Atlantic City TSA testing facility for rigorous tests to insure that the device performs at the levels specified by the company  In summer of 2003  Schumer persuaded the federal Transportation Security Administration that the device Sure Scan is planning to build would be ideal for airports and government agencies to use      In this year  s budget  Schumer secured a measure that allocated  45 million for the next generation of homeland screening technology  a move that means SureScan will be one of a few companies able to compete for this money once they are certified by the Transportation Security Administration  TSA   Schumer  who first brought the TSA to meet with SureScan in 2003  lobbied aggressively for inclusion of the language in the Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Report
