IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 26  2005 Schumer Releases New Survey Showing Shocking Disparity In Lower Hudson Valley Gas Prices    Proposes Creating Investigative Authority For FTC Triggered By Energy Emergencies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hurricane Related Gas Price Gouging Escalating Costs in Westchester  Putnam  Rockland Counties  With No Decisive Action  Could Continue For Months    Senator Calls For Emergency Authority at FTC to Automatically Investigate Whenever President Designates Energy Emergency  Bolstering FTC  s Investigative Powers  Create Web site and 800 Number For Consumers To Report Gouging In light of shocking disparities in gas prices in the lower Hudson Valley  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today call for the creation of stronger tools for the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to examine price gouging  Schumer released a survey that shows the range of gas prices throughout Westchester  Putnam  and Rockland Counties  and express serious concern that people could be profiting in the wake of the devastation caused by recent Hurricanes       We are finally beginning to comprehend the breadth of what truly is a devastating national tragedy     Schumer said    Hurricane Katrina has destroyed homes  communities  families  and an entire region of this nation  The thought that a few bad apples might profit from this tragedy is unconscionable        According to AAA  New York gas prices are up 48  since last year and 11  since a month ago  before Hurricane Katrina  New York State has the high gas prices throughout the country  except for Hawaii and Washington  DC     Schumer released a survey of gas prices in the lower Hudson Valley  The survey  which was done over on Sunday  showed a wide range of prices for a tank of regular gas across Westchester  Putnam  and Rockland Counties  In the area  prices differed as much as 53 cents between one of the higher prices stations and one of the lower priced stations  The complete survey is attached     Though some of the increase in gas prices can be attributed to the interruption in oil and refined gas supplies  and the uncertainties of such an unprecedented and unpredictable event as Hurricane Katrina  Schumer expressed fear that some of the fluctuation and inconsistencies in gas prices are a result of price gouging at the pump      Across the Northeast  gas prices have surged from pre Katrina levels  Market forces have certainly played a role in these prices  but the variety of prices at gas stations and the fact that profits continue to flow to big oil indicate improper pricing  There are currently no federal laws that specifically address price gouging  The state laws that do exist regarding price gouging are usually only triggered in situations arising from a declared emergency     In an effort to crackdown on any possible price gouging  Schumer today called on the Federal Trade Commission to launch a top to bottom investigation to make sure that oil companies and gas station owners and the pipeline in between them are operating ethically and within the law  Though the Federal Trade Commission already monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust violations in the petroleum industry  Schumer called for the immediate formation of a task force to promptly identify the many cases of price gouging being reported across the country  and asked that the task force formulate a process by which price gougers are swiftly prosecuted     In addition  Schumer also called for           The creation of an emergency authority at FTC to investigate gasoline price gouging if President makes an Energy Emergency declaration  If the President declares an energy emergency  the FTC would be empowered to investigate price gouging throughout the nation  Currently  there is no federal anti gouging authority  The FTC  an independent regulatory commission  would conduct the investigation and would be authorized to fine companies for price gouging versus the more traditional remedies such as cease and desist orders and requiring that companies disgorge profits after the fact          A robust campaign encouraging consumers to report price gouging  including a new Web site and toll free number          Increased funding for emergency Low Income Heating Energy Assistance funds in a comprehensive spending bill  Schumer urged the Senate Appropriations Committee to include  1 276 billion in emergency Low Income Heating Energy Assistance funds in a comprehensive spending bill   1 276 billion is the money needed to just maintain LIHEAP purchasing power compared to last year  Schumer also joined a bipartisan coalition of Senators asking the Administration to support increased funding for weatherization and state energy programs and an energy education campaign to help consumer and businesses address the high cost of residential energy  including  500 million for weatherization   100 million for the state energy program  and  90 million for the energy education campaign
