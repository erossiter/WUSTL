                                     Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York Economy and National Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report filed late yesterday included  19 15 million for military projects in the Capital Region  The House and Senate must approve the bill before being sent to the President and signed into law      This is great news for the Capital Region     said Schumer    Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Capital Region and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Capital Region defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge        This is wonderful news for the Capital Region  This is cutting edge defense technology being made locally  supporting our men and women in uniform and our national security  These are important investments in local companies and research institutions that will in turn help the economy as well  I look forward to their final approval by the Senate     Senator Clinton said       Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes         Watervliet Arsenal    Arsenal Support Program Initiative  ASPI     3 million   The purpose of the ASPI is to help maintain the viability of Army manufacturing arsenals and the unique capabilities of these arsenals in supporting national security interests  These funds will be used to help the arsenal secure new companies on site  bringing significant new investment to the Capital Region       Watervliet Arsenal and Oto Melara  Inc     76mm Super Rapid Medium Caliber Gun    1 8 million  This will provide a funding stream for the Dahlgren WSESRB qualification of the 76mm Super Rapid Medium Caliber Gun so that it may be installed on Littoral Combat and other Navy and USCS ships   The 76 SR has already been selected for the Dgypt Fast Missile Craft   The barrels for the 76 SR will be manufactured by the Watervliet Arsenal with technical support from Benet Labs   Funding will help with WSESRB qualification of the 76 SR      Benet Labs    Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS Raven     1 1 million   This funding will help Benet Labs to continue their work on the Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS Raven  project  This system supports the goal of developing an ultra lightweight combat vehicle that will significantly enhance the ability of all services to rapidly deploy to trouble spots worldwide  The ATLAS system will provide the enabling technologies for unprecedented reductions  50   in the weight of large caliber high muzzle energy cannons  These weight reductions in the gun system will reduce vehicle weight and allow for air transportability       Plug Power    Fuel Cell Power for Continuity of Operations    3 9 million   Continuous  distributed power in disperse locations is a significant component of any disaster plan  This program will develop and optimize fuel cell systems for these applications  and begin demonstration and evaluation in distributed sites       Starfire Systems Inc    Functionally Integrated Reactive Surfaces Technology  FIRST  Program    3 million  The FIRST program will leverage nanotechnology for intelligent textile systems to protect the soldier against the presence of chemical and biological weapons and environmental stresses  To effect this development an integrated multidisciplinary research and development and technology transfer team has been created under the leadership of Starfire Systems  Inc  along with Syracuse University  Albany Nanotech and Southwest Research Institute  SWRI    This   350 million yr  multidisciplinary  applied R organization is developing technologies that would be able to detect and automatically ameliorate the threat of any injury to the soldier on the battlefield as well as allow first responders to operate unimpeded or with enhanced capability for longer periods of time in the presence of biological  chemical  and fire threats   In FY  05 and FY  06 Starfire received  1 8 million to develop patch prototypes that can sense chemical attack  monitor human heat stress  and control patch clothing permeability in response to the threat      C 9 Corporation    Defect Free Si C Semiconductors Using Superlattice Technology    1 million  Enriched silicon material will be developed for use in making better electronic power semiconductor devices and cooler Integrated Circuits  IC  serving critical DOD missions   C 9  Corporation intends to scale up the existing R production tool located at the Watervliet Arsenal site in New York   Production scale up is required to produce useable quantities of high purity Si 28 and other light isotopes  Because of its possible impact on semiconductors  Si 28 may be considered for US strategic material classification        Smart Machine Platform Initiative    TechSolve and Benet Weapons Laboratory    1 35 million  This program is establishing a smart machine test bed and initial identification of technologies and devices that will improve the capabilities of both new and legacy equipment   The objective or purpose of the project is the development and dissemination of first part correct technology for manufacturing systems   Benet Weapons Lab is an outstanding partner for developing and demonstrating these new capabilities    The challenges of the future are to develop lighter weapons with the same lethal force as today  s heavy weapons   The newer generation of weapons will require a rapid prototyping capability to produce components for evaluation and test    This prototyping capability is enhanced through the Smart Machine System by virtue of the systems ability to manufacture the first part correctly and avoid the redundancy of a trial and error approach      SUNY Albany   The Secure Advanced Electronics Fabrication Facility  SAEFF   National Secure Foundry  Initiative    2 million  The Secure Advanced Electronics Fabrication Facility  SAEFF  Initiative supports the creation of a fully integrated advanced 300mm and 200mm wafer nanoelectronics R and pilot prototyping facility   This facility will serve the needs of DOD  s   transformation    to a lighter  more agile fighting force built on high efficiency  low loss power electronics integrating high speed communication networks with the computational power necessary to process large amounts of data from multiple battlefield sources and sensors hardened for harsh environments   As such  SAEFF leverages combined investments in the Center of Excellence in Nanoelectronics  CEN  exceeding  3 billion from industry  government  and university to create a most effective consortium for enacting the U S  nanoelectronics defense industry technology roadmap      DayStar Technologies Inc    Advanced Photovoltaic Module Development for Lighter Than Air Vehicles    1 million  DayStar  s enabling technology developed in part with this USAF funding provides and delivers the USAF Research Laboratory  AFRL  a standardized and proven effective method for manufacturing and deployment of Lighter Than Air Vehicle  LTAV  renewable energy systems  This AFRL Advanced Space Power project enables joint service integration of LTAV platform development and establishes a cross service resource for solar array technology   The Advanced Photovoltaic Module Development for Lighter Than Air Vehicles project puts New York State in the forefront as a premier supplier of this technology  Along with planned expansions  this project enables Daystar to create or sustain 133 high technology jobs by adding about 85 new employees to the present staff of 48 at DayStar      New York Air National Guard    Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar    1 million  The 109th Airlift Group flies LC 130 aircraft in support of the National Science Foundation  NSF  Antarctica mission   One of the greatest dangers in supporting this mission is a crevasse hidden under the snow at a potential landing site   This system detects crevasses under snowdrifts   It will be optimized for snow runway assessment in the Antarctic region to assist in the selection of safe landing areas   It will provide the flight crews with a near real time capability to explore and evaluate candidate landing zones   One system is required  which can be utilized by all assigned aircraft
