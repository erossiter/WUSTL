IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 13  2006 Schumer Reveals  Airlines Seek New Rules To Disguise True Cost Of Tickets Adding Fuel Charges  Airport Fees  Other Surcharges At Very End  Buffalo Ticket Listed For  300 Could Ultimately Cost  500                                                                                                                                                                                                             Airline Seeking DOT Permission To Implement This Scheme  Senator Calls on Department of Transportation to Tighten Rules Instead to Include Full Disclosure   Senator  In light of Record Passenger Growth at Buffalo Airport  Deceptive Pricing The Last Thing Western New York Needs U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today that major commercial airlines in the United States are lobbying to loosen advertising restrictions  which could lead to misleading prices for consumers  Currently airlines have to advertise the full fare for ticket prices  and advertise certain government mandated taxes and fees separately  Under the proposed regulation change supported by the legacy carriers  the airlines would be permitted to   unbundle    fares and define fees as they wish        The bottom line is consumers shouldn  t get hit like a ton of bricks with hidden fees when they buy their airplane tickets online     Schumer said    Consumers need protection now more than ever and weakening the rules for airline ticket advertising is hanging them out to dry  plain and simple        Schumer offered that an airline could advertise a  100 round trip from Buffalo to New York and omit a  120 fuel surcharge  a  80 labor surcharge  and the other government taxes and fees  leaving the customer with a ticket over  300 that the consumer wouldn  t be fully aware of until they were about to hit   purchase     This would make comparison shopping over the internet virtually impossible  and would permit airlines to deceptively advertise low fares while still charging the same prices  Schumer today called on the Secretary of the U S  Transportation Department to deny this proposed rule change  and modify existing rules to ensure full disclosure of true cost of airline fares      In his letter to Secretary Mineta  Schumer said        Since 9 11  we have worked hard together to rebuild confidence in the airline industry  Forty seven million Americans bought travel online in 2005  up seven million more than in 2004  according to PhoCusWright  a Connecticut based travel research firm  Travelers will spend about  79 billion online for leisure and self booked business travel  I am concerned that growth in this industry could be stymied if airlines are able to advertise misleading fares    Overall  I think this would be a setback to an already shaky airline industry and urge you to abandon this rule change        According to the Department of Transportation  it is considering amending its rule on price advertising  Under the existing rule  DOT considers any advertisement that states a price for air transportation that is not the total price the consumer will have to pay to be deceptive and violates the a 1984 statute under which this provision was adopted  Although the Department has not officially changed the rule  it currently allow exceptions for certain taxes  fees  and other charges that are imposed by a government entity      Until now  the DOT has consistently prohibited airlines or other airplane ticket vendors from breaking out other cost elements  like fuel surcharges  from the advertised fare  Thought the Transportation Department has denied a recent request to allow separate listing of the fuel surcharges that carriers are adopting in response to soaring fuel costs  it is reexamining the fare advertising rule and its enforcement policy  The four options it is considering are  Maintain the current practice either with or without codifying all of its elements in the rule  end the exception for government imposed charges and enforce the rule as written  revise the rule to eliminate most or all requirements for airfare advertisements but to require that consumers be apprised of the total purchase price before the purchase is made  or eliminate the full fare advertising rule in its entirety     The most popular form of travel booking is online  Nearly 50 percent of airline ticket sales and reservations conducted exclusively online during the first six months of 2005  Forty seven million Americans bought travel online in 2005  up 7 million more than in 2004  according to PhoCusWright  a Connecticut based travel research firm  Travelers will spend about  79 billion online for leisure and self booked business travel according to them     Schumer noted that with the increased passenger traffic at Buffalo  s airport  it would be an unfortunate time to start to have a decline in consumer confidence in the airline industry and in getting fast  accurate fares and tickets online  Buffalo Niagara Airport handled more than 5 million passengers in 2005  setting a third consecutive yearly record  While airports nationwide averaged 6 percent growth  Buffalo  s airport saw 10 a percent passenger rate increase last year  Earlier this month Delta Airlines announced four new roundtrip flights from Buffalo to New York  s JFK Airport
