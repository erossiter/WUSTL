IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 21  2005 Schumer Meets Judge Roberts  Hands Him List Of Questions He Will Ask At Judiciary Committee Hearings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator  s Questions Touch Major Issues From the First Amendment to the Commerce Clause  Schumer Reaffirms Belief That Ideology and Legal Convictions Are More Important Than Personal Life In Evaluating Supreme Court Nominees Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer met with Supreme Court nominee John G  Roberts and presented him with a number of questions on his judicial philosophy ranging from the First Amendment to the Commerce Clause to the environment  Schumer  the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  re iterated his belief that questioning judicial nominees is a duty and not a privilege  which he first suggested that a nominee  s views and philosophy should be known in an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2001       Schumer said that he believed a court nominees   ideology and philosophy is fair game for questioning in a Supreme Court nomination hearing    I have long believed that federal court candidates    who serve for life    should explain their judicial philosophy and their method of legal reasoning  They should be prepared to explain their views of the Constitution  of decided cases  of federalism  and a host of other issues relevant to that lifetime post          Schumer said there is a difference between asking about a particular case with particular facts  but asking broad questions about particular issues is acceptable    I have always said that one should not ask a question specifically about Enron  because there are particular facts and parties involved  but one can certainly ask a question about a nominee  s views on corporate responsibility and the proper role of the federal Government in enforcing it            SCHUMER  S QUESTIONS FOR JUDGE ROBERTS        1  First Amendment and Freedom of Expression         What  if any  are the limitations on the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution           When can Government regulate public speech by individuals           When does speech cross the line between Constitutionally protected free expression and slander            In what ways does the First Amendment protect the spending and raising of money by individuals in politics           Can Government regulate hate speech  What about sexually explicit materials         Specifically           Do you agree with the landmark decision in NY Times v  Sullivan  1964   which held that public criticism of public figures is acceptable unless motivated by actual malice  Who do you believe constitutes a public figure under this standard           Do you believe the Supreme Court was correct to strike down the Communications Decency Act in Reno v  ACLU  1997  on the grounds that pornography on the Internet is protected by the First Amendment           What is your view on the distinction the Supreme Court drew in Buckley v  Valeo  1976  and McConnell v  FEC  2003  between contributions and expenditures in the course of political campaigns  Do you believe that it is legitimate to construe campaign expenditures as protected speech but not donations by individuals          2  First Amendment and the Establishment Clause         Under the Establishment Clause  what  if any  is the appropriate role of religion in Government           Must the Government avoid involvement with religion as a whole  or is the prohibition just on Government involvement with any specific religion           Is there a difference between religious expression in Government buildings  documents  and institutions and Government spending on private  faith based initiatives           What do you see as the Constitutionally protected or limited role of faith based groups in Government funded activity  In Government institutions          Specifically          In the two cases the Supreme Court decided on the Ten Commandments recently  a display of the Commandments inside a Courthouse was found unconstitutional  while a statue of the Commandments on the grounds of a state capitol was deemed acceptable  Do you agree with the distinction the Court drew between Van Orden v  Perry and McCreary Country v  ACLU  2005   In your view  are these decisions consistent with each other           What is your view of the Supreme Court s opinion in Santa Fe Independent School District v  Doe  2000   which held that prayer in public schools is prohibited even where it is student organized  non denominational  and at a football game         3  Commerce Clause         Beginning in 1937  when it upheld the National Labor Relations Act  the Supreme Court has granted Congress great latitude in passing laws under the Commerce Clause  The Court has upheld a wide range of federal laws  including those that regulate labor standards  personal consumption of produce  racial discrimination in public accommodations  and crime  In the last ten years  however  the Supreme Court has shifted course  doing something it had not done in sixty years  striking down acts of Congress on Commerce Clause grounds           Do you agree with the trend towards striking down laws on this basis           What do you believe is the extent of Congress  s authority to legislate under the Commerce Clause           Can Congress regulate local trade in a product that is used nationally           Can Congress regulate labor standards for states and cities under its Commerce Clause power           How closely connected must the regulated action be to interstate commerce for Congress to have the authority to legislate           Where would you look for evidence that Congress is properly legislating under its Commerce Clause authority  Do you rely exclusively on the text of the legislation  Do you look at the legislative history  Do you consider the nature of the regulated activity           What is the extent of the limitations imposed on state regulation by the Commerce Clause         Specifically           Do you agree with the Court  s decision in United States v  Lopez  1995   which struck down the Gun Free School Zone Act because education is traditionally local  Is there any circumstance under which Congress could regulate activities in and around schools using its Commerce Clause authority           Do you agree that it is the Commerce Clause that allows Congress to prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations  as the Court held in Heart of Atlanta Hotel v  United States  1964          4  Under what circumstances is it appropriate for the Supreme Court to overturn a well settled precedent  upon which Americans have come to rely           Does your answer depend at all on the length of time that the precedent has been on the books           Does your answer depend at all on how widely criticized or accepted the precedent is           What if you agree with the result but believe the legal reasoning was seriously flawed  Does that make a difference            Does it matter if the precedent was 5 4 in deciding whether to overturn it  Does it matter if was a unanimous decision         Specifically           Do you agree with the 1976 decision in which the Supreme Court held that Congress could not extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and city employees  National League of Cities v  Usery   or do you agree with the later 1985 decision  which held that Congress could  Garcia v  San Antonio Metropolitan Transit  overruling Nat  l League of Cities   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent nine years later  Why or why not           Do you agree with the 1989 decision in which the Supreme Court held that it was constitutional to execute minors  Stanford v  Kentucky   or do you agree with the later 2005 decision  which held that it was unconstitutional  Roper v  Simmons   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent 16 years later  Why or why not           Do you agree with the 1986 decision in which the Supreme Court held that states could criminalize private sex acts between consenting adults  Bowers v  Hardwick   or do you agree with the later 2003 decision  which held that the states could not  Lawrence v  Texas   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent 17 years later  Why or why not         5  Under what circumstances should the Supreme Court invalidate a law duly passed by the Congress           What amount of deference should the court give to Congressional action           Should the Court err on the side of upholding a law           Do certain types of laws deserve greater deference than others  Regulatory laws  Criminal laws            How closely tied must a law be to an enumerated right of Congress under Article I for it to be upheld          Let me ask you about a few cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down federal laws           Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s decision to strike down the Gun Free School Zones Act at issue in United States v  Lopez  1995   Why or why not           Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s decision to strike down provisions of the Violence Against Women Act in United States v  Morrison  2000   Why or why not         6  Is there a constitutionally protected right to privacy  and if so  under what circumstances does it apply           The word   privacy    is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution  In your view  does that mean it is wrong for the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution as conferring such a right           Do you believe that either the United States Congress or the states can regulate the sexual behavior of individuals within the privacy of their home         Specifically           Do you agree with the reasoning in Griswold v  Connecticut  1965   which held that the right to privacy in the Constitution protects the right of married couples to purchase and use contraception           Do you believe that Roe v  Wade  1973  was correctly decided  What is your view of the quality of the legal reasoning in that case  Do you believe that it reached the right result           Once the right to privacy has been found    as in Griswold and Roe    under what circumstances should the Supreme Court revisit that right         7  What is the proper role of the federal government in enacting laws to protect the environment            Does the Constitution provide any instruction on how Congress should balance the interests of industry against environmental interests            Under the Constitution  how far can Congress go in imposing restrictions on people and businesses to protect the air and water           Under the Constitution  how far can the states go in enacting laws to protect the environment  and does it matter whether there is federal legislation on the same subject         Let me put this in the context of specific cases            Do you believe that the Supreme Court correctly decided that the EPA has the authority to pursue industrial polluters in a state where the local authority has declined to do so  as in Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v  EPA  2004            Can the Clean Air Act preempt local emissions regulations  as the Court held in Engine Manufacturers Association v  South Coast Air Quality Management  2004          8  What is the proper role of the federal government in enacting laws to protect the rights of the disabled           Does the Constitution provide any instruction on how Congress should balance the costs to business against the government  s interest in creating equal access to facilities for disabled persons           Should federal laws mandating access to buildings for disabled people apply to both public and private buildings           For example  do you believe that the Americans with Disabilities Act requires state buildings to be accessible to the disabled  as the Supreme Court held in Tennessee v  Lane  or do you think that sovereign immunity exempts the states         9  What is the proper Constitutional role of Government in enacting laws to regulate education           How far can the Government go under the Constitution to ensure equal treatment for all students           How far can the Court go to protect speech and or prohibit violations of the establishment clause in the schools  For example  do you believe that Santa Fe Independent School Dist  v  Doe  2000  was decided correctly           Does the Constitution guarantee parents the right to choose their children  s education  as established in Meyer v  Nebraska  1923  and Pierce v  Society of Sisters  1925          10  How do you define judicial activism  Give us three examples of Supreme Court cases that you consider the product of judicial activism           Is the   activist    label limited to more liberal leaning judges  or can there be conservative activist judges  Can you cite any examples of conservative judicial activism           In cases where federal law and state law may be in conflict  who is the activist    the judge who voted to limit the federal law or the judge who limited the state law           Do you believe that the Supreme Court was engaging in judicial activism when it struck down provisions of the Gun Free School Zones Act  United States v  Lopez  or the Violence Against Women Act  United States v  Morrison   both of which had been passed by Congress           Was the Supreme Court engaging in judicial activism in       Brown v  Board of Education       Miranda v  Arizona       Dred Scott v  Sandford       The Civil Rights Cases of 1883       Lochner v  New York       Furman v  Georgia       Bush v  Gore         What distinguishes one case from the other       11  Do you describe yourself as falling into any particular school of judicial philosophy         What is your view of   strict constructionism            What is your view of the notion of   original intent       Original meaning            How do you square the notion of respecting   original intent    with the acceptance of the institution of slavery at the time the Constitution was adopted       12  What in your view are the limits on the scope of Congress  power under the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment         Does a law violate the Equal Protection Clause if it affects different groups differently  or must there be a discriminatory intent         Do you agree that  under the Equal Protection Clause  disparate impact alone does not render a law unconstitutional  as the Court held in Washington v  Davis  1976          Do parents have a Due Process right to make decisions concerning the care  custody  and control of their children  as the Supreme Court held in Troxel v  Granville  2000        13  Where is the line between civil rights questions that are political and questions that are appropriate for a court to decide         Do you agree with the reasoning in Powell v  McCormack  Why or why not         Do you agree with the reasoning in Baker v  Carr  Why or why not         Do you agree with the reasoning in Bush v  Gore  Why or why not            What power does the Supreme Court have to intervene in state election laws  as in Bush v  Gore          What role should the Supreme Court be playing in disputed elections       14  Which Supreme Court Justice do you believe your jurisprudence most closely resembles and why       15  When the Supreme Court issues non unanimous opinions  Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg frequently find themselves in disagreement with each other  Do you more frequently agree with Justice Scalia s opinions  or Justice Ginsburg s       16  Can you identify three Supreme Court cases that have not been reversed where you are critical of the Court s holding or reasoning and discuss the reasons for your criticism
