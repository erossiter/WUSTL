IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 12  2005 Schumer Announces Final Fed Approval For Linde Ceramics Workers Under Nuke Worker Benefits Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In November  Senator Called ON U S Dept of Health To Approve Linde Workers    and to Use The Same   Special Exposure Cohort    Provision For Former Bethlehem Steel Workers    Schumer  The Time for Justice is NOW for All Former Nuclear Worker    especially Bethlehem Steel U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced that U S  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt has approved former Linde Ceramics workers for access to the Nuclear Worker Benefit Program via an administrative action known as a Special Exposure Cohort  Last month  in a letter to Secretary Leavitt  Schumer stressed his support of the Linde Ceramics case  and also urged Leavitt to support Bethlehem Steel workers entry to the benefits program under the same clause        The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health is the gatekeeper to the federal compensation program that was established as a method of providing justice for workers who were contaminated with radiation while they toiled in America  s nuclear program during the Cold War  The Secretary of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services grants final approval of that board  s recommendations  and this decision is then forwarded to congress  However  if congress does not act on it in 30 days  the approval becomes law    I will fight to make sure this approval for Linde workers swiftly moves through congress     said Schumer          This is great news for those who worked at Linde  These men and women bolstered the defense of our nation during a time of crisis and have been denied justice for far too long     Schumer said    But now it  s time for the Bethlehem Steel workers to be approved as well  We need to give New York  s Cold War heroes the support they need and the compensation they deserve  Many former nuclear workers became ill developing the country s nuclear weapons program  and they should not have to wait a minute longer for help  We have been working so hard for so long to provide access to justice for former nuclear workers    the time for them to get this help is now          The Linde Ceramics decision was made using a clause which allows the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to grant a Special Exposure Cohort to workers if there is not enough information to estimate the radiation each worker was exposed to  In the case of Bethlehem Steel  NIOSH is using air sample data from Simonds Saw and Steel in place of Bethlehem Steel data to use in dose reconstruction  If using air sample data from a different factory shows a lack of information to conduct an accurate dose reconstruction  Schumer asserts that these workers should be awarded a Special Exposure Cohort as well        During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help  Workers at these facilities handled high levels of radioactive materials and were responsible for helping to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War  Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer       In his letter to Leavitt last month  Schumer said    By approving the Special Exposure Cohort for both facilities  Linde and Bethlehem   we can finally put the former workers on the path to getting the recognition and compensation they deserve  rather than have these beleaguered cold war soldiers battle with controversial dose reconstruction programs           Senator Schumer has aggressively worked to get aid for former nuclear workers in Western New York  In an effort to compensate these workers  Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allowed them to file claims with the U S  Department of Labor for individual payments of  150 000 and other benefits for medical treatments  Workers who got cancer caused by radiation exposure  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War were eligible  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history       In November 2004  Schumer successfully secured a mandate from Congress that establishes a resource center intended to provide Western New Yorkers with the support that they need to effectively navigate the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  Senator Schumer s language established a new resource center in Western New York that would help sick nuclear workers with their compensation applications  Schumer  who has lambasted the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  for only paying out ten percent of claims to New York nuclear workers  said that the resource center was vital to assist local nuclear workers with the application process  Last February  Schumer urged Mr  Shelby Hallmark  the Director of the Labor Department  s Office of Workers   Compensation Programs  for an accelerated timetable in establishing this center  and in July they opened an office in the Amherst Development Park
