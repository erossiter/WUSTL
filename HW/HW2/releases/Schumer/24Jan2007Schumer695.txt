IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 24  2007 With Suffolk Gang Membership Skyrocketing 900   Schumer Introduces New Gang Bill With Tougher Penalities And  1 Billion In Funding For Enforcement  Prevention  And Intervention Programs                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Schumer  Mayors  DA  and Local Law Enforcement Officials Lack Tools and Resources to Thwart Growing Gang Violence   Suffolk County is Now Home to an Estimated 2 000 Gang Members  Local Schools Targeted for Recruitment Concerned that Suffolk County is increasingly becoming a hotbed for gang related violence  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a plan to increase federal penalties to crack down on local street gangs and to provide more than  1 billion in funding nationwide for gang enforcement  prevention and intervention programs  Over the past decade  Suffolk County has become a breeding ground for gangs with the estimated number of members rising 900   from 200 in 1997 to 2 000 in 2007  according to the Suffolk County Police Department         We must nip the growing problem of gang violence in the bud  The recent wave of gang violence in Suffolk County threatens the quality of life for all residents  particularly our youth     said Senator Schumer    This bill gives law enforcement officials and community members the federal assistance and tools they need to attack the problem at its root and fix it before it grows out of control     said Schumer       Over the past five years  Central American gangs including Mara Salvatrucha  also known as   M 13    or   M 18     and the emergence of groups affiliated with the notorious Bloods and Crips have fueled a surge in illegal and dangerous activities across Suffolk County  In 2006  Danielle Baker  a 14 year old from Copiague  Long Island  was murdered at a party after gang related violence broke out and she was shot in the neck  Gangs are also expanding their ranks by targeting local schools for recruits        To increase available resources for local enforcement officials  Senator Schumer today announced that he will introduce new comprehensive gang legislation  the   Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007     Schumer  s legislation will assist enforcement officials by creating stricter criminal laws and penalties for those who commit gang related crimes  The legislation will also set aside funding to assist investigations  prosecutions  and witness protection programs       His legislation will authorize  1 05 billion for the following        500 million to support collaborative efforts by federal  state and local law enforcement in combating violent gangs in high intensity gang areas   These funds would be split evenly between law enforcement and prevention programs     150 million to expand Project Safe Neighborhoods  a Justice Department program to reduce gun violence  and the FBI  s Safe Streets Violent Crime Initiative     100 million to expand violent crime enforcement personnel  technology  equipment and training    270 million to fund witness protection programs        To protect Suffolk County  s minors  Schumer  s legislation will also make it a criminal offense for gangs to recruit minors        A longtime crusader against gang related violence  on April 3  2006  Senator Schumer announced his Short Term Witness Protection Act of 2006  which will create a new federal grants program to pay for protecting witnesses in state and local criminal trials  The  90 million a year plan makes the federal government responsible for assisting local governments in paying for witness protection in major violent crime court cases in high crime areas  Schumer said that threats against witnesses on Long Island often result in either dismissals or significantly reduced plea deals because witnesses are too afraid to come forward  The prosecution of a number of key cases in 2005 was seriously impeded because of witness intimidation       Schumer said that local prosecutors are faced with a double edged sword in protecting witnesses  they have far too few resources to pay to protect as many witnesses as they would like  but every dollar they add to witness protection programs comes at the cost of money for prosecutors and criminal prosecutions  Most District Attorneys report that putting any additional resources into the program without federal help will impede prosecutors  ability to try cases and will increase backlogs in the judicial system      The Justice Department s current Federal Witness Protection Program is designed to provide long term protection for witnesses in cases that are being tried in Federal courts  Schumer  s legislation would create a new grants program through the federal government with the sole purpose of protecting witnesses in state and local criminal trials
