IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 5  2006 Schumer Outlines 6 Types Of Federal Aid That Can Help Make Tenant Buyout Of Stuy Town And Peter Cooper Village Effective                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Urges Head of MetLife to Delay Bid Process so Plan Can Be Implemented   Schumer  This Should be a Win Win Win  A Win For the City and Middle Class Housing  A Win for the Tenants  and a Win For MetLife Today Senator Charles E  Schumer stood with Councilman Garodnick  Speaker Christine Quinn and tenants of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village to outline six ways that federal aid can help in any potential sale of the property  Schumer also called the head of MetLife and urged him to delay the bid process  The project was put on the market last week  bid books will be released in the coming days  offers will be taken by the end of the month and a winner will be selected by November  Schumer said today that the time frame is simply too fast       When Met Life hung the  For Sale  sign on the doors of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town last week  all New Yorkers  particularly those in the middle class  should have been troubled by the news     Schumer said    It is getting more and more difficult for firefighters  police officers  teachers  nurses and other working folks to call New York City home and that is why we need to do everything we can to preserve this vital stock of affordable housing     Schumer stressed that it would take some time to craft a deal to preserve the affordable housing at Stuy Town and Peter Cooper village  but that a small delay would be well worth it for all parties  He pointed to the federal intervention he spearheaded at Ennis Frances houses in Harlem and Gates Patchen houses in Bedford Stuyvesant as successful models for retaining affordable housing  Both projects were former Section 8 buildings with far less equity than Stuy Town  but with a host of federal measures they were retained as affordable rental and home ownership options for working families        Schumer  in an effort to preserve middle class housing in New York today outlined six ways that the Federal Government can get involved to preserve Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village  His effort to involve the Federal government is an attempt to find a workable solution that is in the context of the market and that addresses the needs of both parties  the tenants and the owners        The free market doesn  t always work perfectly and that  s why government sometimes needs to step in to protect vital institutions and resources     Schumer said    With the middle class being priced out of New York in alarming numbers  now is the time for action       Yesterday Schumer spoke with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both of whom assured him that their companies would be willing to sit at the table to find ways that they could help sustain the affordability of these projects         Schumer  s announced the following six potential ways that the Federal Government can be of assistance whether it is in a tenant backed purchase of the development or a public private partnership       1  Freddie Mac and Fannie May might be able to purchase the loan if a consortium of tenants purchased the property  effectively guaranteeing the mortgage  This secondary financing would give primary lenders the surety they need to originate a loan to tenants in order to convert the units to co operative housing          2  Freddie Mac and Fannie May might also be able to create special mortgage products to ensure that if tenants are interested in purchasing their units directly they would get reasonably priced loans  If these building are converted to co ops or condos  it could open up the possibility of homeownership to many who never thought it a possibility      3  There are currently federal programs that help teachers  firefighters  members of the military and civil servants achieve the dream of homeownership  The Home Possible program by Freddie Mac  for instance   is aimed at Police  Firefighters and military personnel and can increase their home buying power by up to 30   Schumer will look at these programs and work to make sure they can fit for this development       4  Schumer announced his intention to call HUD Secretary Jackson to ask him to bring his agency to the table  Specifically he will ask HUD to insure any loan taken out by a group of tenants or consortium of responsible investors  HUD does this for many projects all over the country including both low and middle income projects  It is a practice that severely slashes a loans interest rate  sometimes to as far down as 1          5  In an effort to ensure that the most vulnerable residents at Stuy Town and Peter Cooper Village are protected Schumer announced his effort to secure special vouchers for seniors on fixed incomes and low income families residing in this development to help offset any rent increases   Similar to Section 8 vouchers  these vouchers could ensure that the landlords could collect the fees they need to keep the building viable  but that rents are kept low         6   Schumer will look at the possibility of securing gap financing in the form of an appropriation from the US Senate  This money would help the tenants by providing the funds to make up the difference between the sale price and the affordable price tenants would pay if they wished to purchase their homes  Gap financing would operate exactly as it sounds    it would fill in the gap by lowering sale prices of units and help thousands of residents become homeowners  A similar commitment by the City and State  would go a long way in helping bring down potential sale prices
