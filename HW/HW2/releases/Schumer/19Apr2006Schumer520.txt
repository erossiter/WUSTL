IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 19  2006 Schumer  Hempstead Supervisor Murray Urge Immediate Action At Point Lookout    Massive Army Corps Erosion Control Project In Jeopardy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             May 1 Deadline to Support Reject Army Corps Erosion Action Plan Looms and Hempstead Beaches Could be Left in the Lurch   Schumer to Army Corps  We Need to Protect the Point Lookout Beaches  and We Need to Dredge Jones Inlet Now Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward as quickly as possible with the storm damage mitigation and long term erosion control project in and around Point Lookout in the Town of Hempstead  The proposed   Long Beach Storm Damage Reduction Plan     designed to lessen damage to the barrier island in the case of a major storm  is being considered for approval or rejection by May 1  by the City of Long Beach  but also impacts parts of the barrier island that falls within Hempstead      Schumer today called on the Army Corps to take action at the eastern section of Point Lookout    where the situation continues to deteriorate    regardless of the outcome in the City of Long Beach  For decades  Hempstead Town officials have strongly supported Army Corps plans to alleviate the terrible damage inflicted on residential  commercial and recreational interests       The residents of Point Lookout  and all those who enjoy the area  s beautiful beaches  are in desperate need of help that can no longer be fixed with band aids  The local community supports the Plan  Hempstead Supervisor Murray supports the Plan    so let  s get to work  The Army Corps of Engineers must move quickly to implement its storm protection and erosion reduction plan     Schumer said    Without the Corps taking these immediate and comprehensive measures to protect residential and commercial property  the Point Lookout community will remain in unnecessary danger from major storms and flooding          For well over a decade  the Town of Hempstead has been committed financially  ideologically and environmentally to implementing a project that will offer immediate and long term storm damage protection to our precious barrier beach communities     said Hempstead Town Supervisor Kate Murray    It is critically important that the Army Corps   Erosion Action Plan be implemented as presented to prevent further erosion and restore the severe damage to our shoreline  We are grateful for Senator Charles Schumer  s efforts to move this project forward and are eager to collaborate with our state and federal representatives         Severe erosion has devastated local Hempstead beaches and exposed the Point Lookout community to damage from major storms like Nor  easters and Hurricanes  In fact  Schumer noted that the Army Corps has recognized Point Lookout as the hardest hit area on the barrier island  Schumer also indicated that  by taking swift action the Army Corps will erect a bulwark against high energy waves and mitigate flooding in the event of a major storm  In his letter Schumer wrote    The Plan will also protect residential and commercial property  local business and its economy  the ecosystem and its habitat and recreational interests  The nourishment to the beaches of Point Lookout  as proposed in the Army Corps Plan  will help reverse the relentless erosion negatively affecting the area  and provide 50 years of monitoring and maintenance by the Corps          Hempstead has heard enough planning    action to protect its invaluable beaches is long overdue  After forty years of planning  twenty years of refining a feasibility plan  and two substantial reviews  there is a possibility that the entire project will be abandoned  For Point Lookout and Hempstead  which want to move forward  that would be a mistake     Schumer said  He added    If this plan is enacted  the Town of Hempstead will be able to implement desperately needed capital projects to restore environmental and recreational quality on the beaches  The Corps   Plan will provide storm damage reduction to municipal infrastructure  local homes and businesses  and evacuation routes  It will also enhance emergency response capability  while limiting damage to the mainland from a potential breach         In the letter  Schumer noted that implementation of the Plan in the area known as Reach 1 includes  dune and berm development  groin rehabilitation  four new groins with three deferred  and the extension of groin number one    In order to provide a minimal level of immediate storm damage protection to the easternmost areas  Schumer also asked that the Army Corps support maintenance dredging of Jones Inlet and concomitant beneficial placement of the dredged material on the immediate down drift shore  Together  the short term benefits of the sand from the channel maintenance project coupled with the 50 year long term storm damage reduction plan will provide the area with a level of protection sought by local officials through the Corps   original planning effort  By mitigating the problems at Jones Inlet  the Corps will offer sorely needed assistance in improving safe and productive commercial and recreational navigation  emergency marine response  and prevention of the westerly migration of deep water channel that threatens the shore stabilization structures along Point Lookout      Schumer  s letter also said    Now more than ever  residents of Point Lookout know they are threatened with the spectre of the Atlantic Ocean further encroaching upon their homes  I understand that the Point Lookout community  as well as the Town of Hempstead  enthusiastically endorses the Corps   Plan to provide this curative storm damage mitigation and long term erosion control to the area      The protection of this community and its beaches from storm damage demands a collective effort on the part of federal  state and local officials
