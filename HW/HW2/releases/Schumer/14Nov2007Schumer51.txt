IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 14  2007 With Quebec Firefighters Delayed At Border While Responding To Blaze In Rouses Point  Schumer Calls On CBP To Employ New System To Ensure First Responders Can Quickly Cross Border                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Border Agents Held Up Quebec Firefighters from Entering the U S   Leaving Rouses Point Firefighters Lacking Much Needed Backup to Fight Blaze at Local Restaurant Schumer Calls on CBP to Implement System that Will Speed Up Border Access for Emergency Workers who are Responding to Mutual Aid Calls Schumer  To Improve Safety for NY Border Communities  It s Essential that CBP Protect our Borders While Still Giving Quick Access to First Responders From Both Countries Two days after Quebec firefighters were delayed crossing the U S  Canadian border while responding to a fire a few miles away in Rouses Point  NY  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the U S  Customs and Border Protection to employ a regular system that would allow first responders from the two countries to swiftly cross the border so they can offer mutual assistance  First responders in communities dotting the New York State and Canadian border regularly participate in Mutual Aid calls where first responders from one country will cross the border to provide assistance  when requested  to their counterparts facing an emergency    However  on Sunday night  Quebec firefighters responding to a fire at Rouses Points Anchorage restaurant were held up at the border  leaving local firefighters on the scene of the fire without much needed backup and creating what the Clinton County fire coordinator termed a risky situation  Today  with DHS threatening to implement new border rules in as little as two months  Schumer called on the U S  Customs and Border Protection to develop and implement a permanent system that will allow responders to swiftly cross the border    Sundays blaze at the Anchorage restaurant has made it crystal clear that we need a better system for moving first responders across so that communities like Rouses Point can have the resources they need in life or death situations  where minutes matter said Senator Schumer  Border communities in both New York and Canada rely on each others first responders to provide vital backup  and Sundays events served as an unfortunate reminder of the need to incorporate a system that will make sure first responders can swiftly cross the borders while not compromising our border security   This past Sunday  The Anchorage  a landmark restaurant in Rouses Point  was destroyed by a serious fire  A Mutual Aid call was issued  meaning that nearby firefighters from both the American and Canadian sides of the border were called to battle the blaze  While firefighters from the Rouses Point area quickly arrived at the scene of the fire  firefighters from Lacolle and St  Paul Isle Noix fire departments in Quebec were delayed as they tried to the cross the border en route to the fire  Although it is still unclear how long the trucks were delayed  various reports have placed it between eight minutes and 45 minutes    It has long been the practice for Canadian and American fire departments to support each other in responding to emergencies  Especially in remote or rural areas  these arrangements are critical to the protection of the American and Canadian populaces  Smaller towns in New York cannot afford to maintain a fire department equipped for larger emergencies  and their safety depends on the assistance of their neighbors across the border    However  Schumer today noted that he is not aware of any arrangement that CBP has made to ensure that this mutual protection can continue  despite the fact that you have pledged to begin the first phase of WHTI implementation in January 2008   Schumer today recommended that a permanent system be put in place to ensure first responders can quickly cross the border  while making sure border security is not compromised  Specifically  Schumer requested that CBP consider establishing a pre clearance system for first responders and also to allowing emergency vehicles to cross the border immediately  if CBP is notified by the appropriate American authority that emergency assistance has been requested   Schumer wrote  CBP urgently needs to develop a plan for first responders that will ensure the security of our borders without sacrificing the safety of our population   Below is a letter the Senator sent today to the CBP     November 13  2007  Dear Secretary Chertoff   I write to draw your attention to the urgent problem of border crossing access for first responders  and to request that you develop a plan to address this issue before beginning implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   While I support the mission of Customs and Border Protection to ensure that every individual who crosses the border is admissible to the United States  recent events make clear that CBP must develop a better strategy to meet this goal while also ensuring that emergency responders are not delayed at the border    It has long been the practice for Canadian and American fire departments to support each other in responding to emergencies  Especially in remote or rural areas  these arrangements are critical to the protection of the American and Canadian populaces  Smaller towns in New York cannot afford to maintain a fire department equipped for larger emergencies  and their safety depends on the assistance of their neighbors across the border  To date  I am not aware of any arrangement that CBP has made to ensure that this mutual protection can continue  despite the fact that you have pledged to begin the first phase of WHTI implementation in January 2008   On November 11  two fire departments from Quebec responded to a call for mutual aid in Clinton County  NY  While the fire raged  the Canadian fire trucks and fire fighters were delayed for many minutes at the border as CBP officers processed the vehicle and its occupants  The fire coordinator for Clinton County Emergency Services reportedly stated that this lengthy delay created a risky situation by extending the strain on American firefighters who were battling the flames and needed to be relieved by the Canadian forces  The fire completely destroyed the landmark Anchorage restaurant in Rouses Point  NY   WHTI could also negatively affect American fire departments that depend on protection contracts in Canada for operating expenses  Based on a constituent report  I am aware that at least one American firefighter has had trouble returning to the United States after responding to an emergency call in Canada  If WHTI compels American fire departments to relinquish their Canadian protection contracts  it will pose a threat to the safety of both Americans and Canadians who are served by these departments   Given the seriousness of this matter and your pledge to implement WHTI beginning in just a few months  CBP urgently needs to develop a plan for first responders that will ensure the security of our borders without sacrificing the safety of our population  Specifically  I respectfully request that CBP consider whether it would be possible to pre clear the admissibility of Canadian firefighters and other first responders and then to allow emergency vehicles to cross the border immediately  if CBP is notified by the appropriate American authority that emergency assistance has been requested    Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter  I ask that CBP report back to me at the earliest opportunity to explain how it plans to address the needs of first responders at the border    Sincerely    Charles E  Schumer United States Senator
