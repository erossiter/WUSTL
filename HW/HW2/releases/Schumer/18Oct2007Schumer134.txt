IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 18  2007 As Acid Rain Continues To Threaten The Adirondacks   Destroying Forests And Lakes   Schumer Fights To Restore Slashed Funding For Vital Acid Rain Monitoring Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bush Administration is Slashing Funding for 80 Monitoring Stations in NYS and Across the Country that Provide Invaluable Information to Scientists and Legislators Fighting Acid Rain Deposition With the Bill Slated for Floor Debate  Schumer Calls on Senate Committee to Restore Full Funding for Crucial CASTNET Program Which Monitors Pollution from Coal Belching Midwest Plants  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on a Senate Committee to restore full funding for a key anti acid rain monitoring program that the Bush Administration seeks to cut  The program  the Clean Air Status and Trends Network  CASTNET   is a critical federal program that works to combat acid rain across New York State and the country by establishing monitoring stations that provide scientists and legislators with detailed information regarding acid rain deposition  While the program has been historically funded at  3 9 million  it is set to be slashed by  1 million  or more than a quarter of its funding  for next year     Today  Schumer  a longtime crusader against acid rain  which has already decimated scores of pristine parks  forests and lakes across the state  called on the Senate Committee in charge of the programs budget to immediately restore its funding levels     With acid rain already decimating so many of New York States precious parks  lakes and rivers  it is inconceivable that we would now slash funding to a federal program that is vital to combating acid rain  said Schumer  Acid rain is public enemy number one for the Adirondacks and parks across the state  and it is absolutely critical that scientists and environmentalists fighting this environmental scourge have the tools they need  We have made gains in the battle against acid rain  but we need hard data to win the war     Schumer today sent a letter to the Senate Subcommittee on Interior  Environment  and Related Agencies  under the Senate Committee on Appropriations  calling on it to restore funding at the  3 9 million budget  The bill is set to move to conference with its House companion bill  Schumer urged that the funding be restored during conference     Air quality and ecosystems in New York and the Northeast have suffered significantly from emissions from Midwest coal fired power plants that produce acid rain  Due  in part  to its ecological makeup  the Adirondacks have endured the worst damage in the nation from acid rain     As a result of decades of acid rain  more than 500 of the Adirondack Park s 2 800 lakes and ponds are too acidic to support their native life  Thousands of acres of high elevation red spruce and fir forests have been wiped out and mercury contamination exacerbated by acid rain has been documented in more than 20 Adirondack lakes  making the fish unfit to eat     Schumer emphasized that acid rain is a statewide and national problem  with every region in New York possessing dangerously acidic rain  Catskill Park s forests and lakes have also been severely impacted by acid rain  as have the Great Lakes of Western New York and the Finger Lakes     The CASTNET program is vital to fighting acid rain in New York State  The program is designed to give scientists  legislators and environmentalists the data and information they need to better combat acid rain  The program operates 80 monitoring stations throughout the country  including in New York State  and measures surface air quality  Within CASTNET  the National Atmospheric Deposition Program  NADP  partners with state and local governments to operate monitoring stations that measure the amount of wet acid deposition  acid rain  Together  these two programs provide invaluable information to scientists and legislators     CASTNET is the EPAs best source of information on the effectiveness of the nations endeavors to curb acidity  Without it  scientists and policy makers will have no way to gauge the response of the environment to various policies  and no way to curb the acid rain that will continue to fall     The program has historically been funded at approximately  3 9 million through the U S  Environmental Protection Agencys Science and Technology Account  in the Air Quality and Toxins program area  But this year  the EPA is looking to slash the program by  1 million in funding and said the money will come directly out of CASTNETs budget     This proposed cut in funding would slash the legs out from under this crucial program  added Schumer    Twenty years ago  acid rain was devastating the Eastern half of the United States  Congress  the EPA  state and local governments acknowledged the damage that unregulated emissions of certain acid rain producing pollutants were having on the environment  They took decisive action to curtail those emissions  and today  acid rain is not as bad as it once was  However  in certain parts of the country  acid rain continues to be a major ecological problem  The Northeast is the region most affected by this problem  with the Adirondacks in Upstate New York being brutally hit  CASTNET  and its subsidiary program NADP have been integral to the EPAs response to acid rain     Acid rain has been attributed to sulfur dioxide  SO2  and nitrogen oxide  NOx   chemicals that can be transported in the wind  causing environmental and health problems hundreds of miles away  Fine particles can pose serious health risks  especially for people with heart or lung disease  including asthma  and older adults and children  Ground level ozone can irritate the respiratory system  aggravate asthma  reduce lung capacity and increase peoples susceptibility to respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and bronchitis
