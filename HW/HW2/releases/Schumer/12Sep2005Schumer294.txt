IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 12  2005 Confirmation Hearing Of Judge John G  Roberts  Jr  Opening Statement Of Senator Charles E  Schumer   As Delivered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  To those who say ideology doesn  t matter  they should take their quarrel to President Bush       The best way  I believe  is through understanding your views about particular past cases    not future cases  but past  already decided cases     Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  will be making his opening statement at the confirmation hearing of Judge John G  Roberts  Jr  for Chief Justice of the United States  His prepared remarks follow      Judge Roberts  welcome to you  Mrs  Roberts and your two beautiful children  I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your nomination to the position of Chief Justice of the United States       This is indisputably the rarest opportunity in American government  In the entire history of the Republic  we have had but 16 Chief Justices       But the responsibility is as great as the opportunity is rare        One need only consider that generations of jurisprudence bear the names of Chief Justices who presided over the Supreme Court   the Marshall Court  the Warren Court  and of course most recently  the Rehnquist Court       The decisions of the Supreme Court have a fundamental impact on people  s lives  and the influence of a Chief Justice far outlasts that of a President       As the youngest nominee to the High Court  s top seat in 204 years  you have the potential to wield more influence over the lives of the citizens of this country than any jurist in history       I cannot think of a more awesome responsibility    awesome not in the way my teenage daughter would use the word  but in the Biblical sense of the angels trembling in the presence of God       But before you can assume that responsibility  we Senators    on behalf of the people    have to exercise our own responsibility       Fundamental to that responsibility is our obligation to ascertain your legal philosophy and judicial ideology       To me the pivotal question  which will determine my vote is this  Are you within the mainstream    albeit the conservative mainstream    or are you an ideologue who will seek to use the Court to impose your views upon us  as certain judges    past and present  on the left and on the right    have attempted to do       The American people need to learn a lot more about you before they    and we    can answer that question       You are without question an impressive  accomplished  and brilliant lawyer  You are a decent and honorable man  You have a remarkable resume       There are those who say your outstanding and accomplished resume should be enough  that you should simply promise to be fair  and we should confirm       I disagree       To me  the most important function of these hearings    because it is the most important qualification for a nominee to the Supreme Court    is to understand your legal philosophy and judicial ideology       This is especially true now that judges are largely nominated through an ideological prism by a President who has admitted that he wants to appoint Justices in the   mold    of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas  To those who say ideology doesn  t matter  they should take their quarrel to President Bush        I began to argue that a nominee  s judicial ideology was crucial four years ago  Then  I was almost alone  Today there is a growing and gathering consensus on the left and on the right that these questions are legitimate  important  and often crucial       Therefore  I    and others on both sides of the aisle    will ask you about your views       Here is what the American people need to know beyond your resume           They need to know who you are and how you think         They need to assess not only the sharpness of your mind  but also the fullness of your heart         They need to believe that an overachiever can identify with an underdog who has nothing but the Constitution on his side         They need to understand that your first class education and advantaged life will not blind you to the plight of those who need help and who rely on the protections of the Constitution    which is every one of us at one point or another         They need to be confident that your claim of judicial   modesty    is more than easy rhetoric  that your praise of legal   stability    is more than mere lip service         They need to know    above all    that if you take stewardship of the High Court  you will not steer it so far out of the mainstream that it founders in the shallow waters of extremist ideology       As far as your own views go  however  we have only scratched the surface        In a sense  we have seen maybe 10 percent of you    just the visible tip of the iceberg  not the 90 percent that is still submerged  And we all know that it is the ice beneath the surface that can sink the ship       For this reason  it is our obligation to ask    and your obligation to answer    questions about your judicial philosophy and legal ideology       If you cannot answer these questions  how are we to determine whether you are in the mainstream  A simple resume  no matter how distinguished  cannot answer that question       This is particularly important for you as compared to other nominees  because you are more of a tabula rasa than many other nominees in terms of your judicial philosophy  You have served only two years on the bench  much of your career has been spent making arguments for others  and we have not received many documents which would reveal your thinking from your days in the Solicitor General  s Office       So  for me  the first criterion upon which I will base my vote is whether you will answer questions fully and forthrightly  We do not want to trick you  badger you  or play a game of   gotcha     That is why I met with you privately three times  that is why I gave you a list of questions in advance of these hearings       There is only one purpose here  It rests on the Advise and Consent Clause of the Constitution  to find out what kind of judge you will be and to determine with much greater clarity your judicial philosophy and method of legal reasoning       Every federal court candidate    who will serve for life    should explain his or her judicial philosophy and method of legal reasoning  That obligation is even more fundamental for a Supreme Court nominee  and most important for one named to lead the entire federal judiciary       It is not enough to say that you will be fair  If that were enough  we would have no need for a hearing  I have no doubt that you believe you will be a   fair    judge  I also have no doubt that Justice Scalia thinks he is fair and that Justice Ginsburg thinks she is fair       But in case after case after case  they rule differently  they approach the Constitution differently  and they affect the lives of 280 million Americans differently  That is so  even though both undoubtedly believe that they are fair       You should be prepared to explain your views of the First Amendment  civil rights  environmental rights  religious liberty  privacy  worker  s rights  women  s rights  and a host of other issues relevant to the most powerful lifetime post in the nation       Now  having established that ideology and judicial philosophy are important  what is the best way to go about questioning on those subjects  The best way  I believe  is through understanding your views about particular past cases    not future cases  but past  already decided cases       It is not the only way  but it is the best and most straightforward way       Some have argued that for a nominee to answer questions about his or her personal views of the Constitution or about decided cases would indicate prejudgment about a future case        It does nothing of the sort  Most nominees who have come before us    including Justice Ginsburg  whose precedent you often cite    have answered such questions        Contrary to popular mythology  when she was a nominee  Justice Ginsburg gave lengthy answers to scores of questions about Constitutional law and decided cases  including individual autonomy  the First Amendment  criminal law  choice  discrimination  and gender equality       Although there were places where she said she did not want to answer  she spoke about dozens of Supreme Court cases and often gave her unvarnished impressions  suggesting that some were problematic in their reasoning while others were eloquent in their vindication of important Constitutional principles       Other nominees  from Powell to Thomas to Breyer  answered numerous questions about decided cases  and no one has ever questioned their fitness to hear cases on issues raised during their confirmation hearings       A large majority of the American people    whose lives will be profoundly affected by the next Chief Justice    believe that they have the right to know where you stand on important legal and Constitutional issues and on past cases  They have an innate wisdom about these things  and here their views are consistent with those of Senators and scholars       So  I hope that you will answer questions about decided cases  which so many other nominees have done        If you refuse to talk about already decided cases  the burden is on you    one of the preeminent litigators in America    to figure out a way  in plain English  to help us determine whether you will be a conservative    but mainstream conservative    Chief Justice  or an ideologue       Here are some of the specifics that we need to know         For example  you told me in one of our meetings that you believe in judicial   modesty     implying that you deeply respect settled precedent  yet as a younger man you celebrated the late Chief Justice  s attempt to   revolutionize    the settled law involving the Establishment Clause and criticized another opinion as   lame    for relying on stare decisis  That raises more questions  What does modesty really mean in terms of respect for precedent         You gave testimony at your last hearing that you endorsed   the vital role of the federal government in vindicating national interests     yet in the Reagan Administration you repeatedly fought against federal involvement in various issues of national urgency  That gives rise to a question  What do you really think now         You told me when we met that you believe that there is a right to privacy that extends to the bedroom  yet in your younger years you referred derisively to the   so called    right of privacy  That too gives rise to a question  Which view will you take to the bench now that you are no longer bound by precedent           You told me that you are not ideologue and that you share my   aversion    to ideologues  yet you have been embraced by some of the most extreme ideologues in America  like the leader of Operation Rescue  That gives to rise to a question  What do they know that we don  t know       Let me be clear  I know that you are conservative  and I do not expect your views to mirror mine  After all  President Bush won the election  and everyone understands that he will nominate conservatives to the Court  But while we certainly do not expect the Court to move to the left under this President  it should not move radically to the right       Let me make one final point  balance on the Supreme Court is also important  It matters a great deal  now more than ever  at a time when the Court is so divided  I have often said that a Supreme Court with one Scalia and one Brennan would be a vibrant and interesting Court  but five of either would be utterly imbalanced       One factor I will weigh is that you have now been nominated to replace the late Chief Justice Rehnquist    one of the most reliably conservative votes    rather than Justice O  Connor  the Court  s most important swing vote       But  regardless of whom you have been nominated to replace  it is your burden to prove that you are worthy of confirmation  it is not the Senate  s burden to prove that you are unworthy       Judge Roberts  if you want my vote  you need to meet two criteria  First  you need to answer questions fully so we can ascertain your judicial philosophy  And second  once we have ascertained your philosophy  it must be clear that it is in the broad mainstream       Judge Roberts  if you answer important questions forthrightly and convince me that you are a jurist in the broad mainstream  I will be able to vote for you       And I would like to be able to vote for you       If you do not  I will not be able to vote for you       I have high hopes for these hearings  I want    the American people want    a dignified and respectful hearing process    open  fair  thorough  full  and above board  One that brings not only dignity  but even more importantly  information about your views and ideology to the American people       I  along with the American people  look forward to hearing your testimony
