                                Subcommittee on Housing  Transportation and Community Development                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I want to welcome everyone to this critical hearing on Ending Mortgage Abuse  Safeguarding Homebuyers and thank the witnesses who are appearing before the Subcommittee today  Many of the members of this Committee  including myself  know first hand about the rising home foreclosures that are devastating communities in our home states  The big question is why  Is it really the economy  stupid  Is it as simple as lack of borrower education  Is it a sharp rise in family financial emergencies  Or is it downright bad lending practices   I hope we will get to the heart of this question today  so that we can figure out how best to solve it   There are a lot of different interests represented in this room today to ensure we get all perspectives   But at least we can begin by all agreeing that sustainable home ownership is the key to having a strong financial future in this country  Buying a home is the largest purchase most families will ever make and it is the path to wealth and asset accumulation for families and their future generations  It is also critical to building flourishing communities in which homeowners and small businesses are willing to invest in their local economies  create new jobs  and contribute to the countrys economic growth   Yet  our mutual respect for this basic principal has not been enough to prevent a widespread effort to exploit the most vulnerable segments of our population by tricking them into signing on to loans they can ill afford  making it virtually impossible for many to truly achieve the American Dream   African Americans  Hispanics  single mothers  and the elderly are targeted everyday in predatory lending schemes and deceptive loan practices  enticed into mortgages with low teaser rates that will only reset to future payments that the borrowers cannot mathematically afford  For example  a study by HUD and the U S  Treasury found that sub prime loans were issued 5 times more frequently to black neighborhood households as they were to white neighborhood households  And 39 percent of homeowners living in upper income black neighborhoods have sub prime refinancing  twice the rate of homeowners living in lower income white neighborhoods   This sub prime storm has left virtually no corner of this country untouched  You cant go a day without reading or hearing about the families in New York  in Ohio  in Pennsylvania that are stuck in risky loans that they cant afford  and desperate for a way out that allows them to preserve their home  The problem is bad and getting worse  This map shows the areas of the country with the greatest increases in reported foreclosures over the past two years   Depressed economic regions  like parts of the Midwest that have experienced significant job losses in recent years  have also been prime targets for deceptive lending practices  And even in growing states like Colorado and Georgia  unsuitable loans abound  According to RealtyTrac  nearly 3 000 foreclosure actions were reported in my colleague and former Chairman of this Subcommittee Wayne Allards state of Colorado last month alone   Before our eyes whole communities are being set up to fail when we should be arming them with tools to succeed  The risk of a foreclosure boom in these communities is real  In a widely publicized report  the Center for Responsible Lending estimated that 2 2 million sub prime loans made in recent years have already failed or will end in foreclosure  costing homeowners as much as  164 billion  primarily in lost home equity   It is bad enough that these families that have to foreclose will lose their main source of financial stability  not to mention their credit worthiness  but if these foreclosures are concentrated in a few communities  the effects will be devastating  Studies have shown that even one foreclosure could lower the value of nearby homes by almost 1 5   That is about  3 000 in lost home value per neighbor  or  150 000 of lost neighborhood value for just one foreclosure  If two million home foreclose nationwide  our communities would lose  300 billion in neighborhood wealth and  6 billion in local taxes that go to fund schools  roads  etc   Sothe question is why is this happening  There is a lot of blame going around  but I think the fundamental reason is very simple   The catalyst behind this impending avalanche of foreclosures are risky subprime mortgage loans that thousands of middle and lower income Americans were tricked into borrowing  even though the loans themselves are designed to fail them   These so called liar loans are often wrapped in complex rate terms  high fees  and shocking rate increases that in the near term leave the borrower unable to afford rising mortgage payments   I ask all of you panelists why have these loans not been underwritten at the fully indexed rate   Many in the industry participants argue that that these loans themselves are not to blame  its not the product  they say  its the economyand that is why we are seeing record delinquencies and foreclosures    But one look at this payment chart for the most popular subprime loan in recent years  a 2 28 Adjustable Rate Mortgage  and the answer is clear  These loans are traps    In this example  the borrower starts off paying  1300 a month  which is 44  of his monthly paycheck of  3 000  And because subprime borrowers dont have to escrow this payment doesnt even include the estimated  200 monthly payment for taxes and insurance   After just 30 months  the initial teaser fixed rate expires  and the borrowers monthly payment jumps over  400    Then  at 36 months  it resets again  to nearly 50  higher than her initial monthly payment  In 42 months  assuming the underlying interest rate rises 1 5 percentage points  the borrower is paying  2200 a month  or 72  of their income  to service this mortgage    In order to prevent payment shocks and stave off foreclosure  this borrower needs to get a 63  pay raise before his mortgage starts resetting   or win the lottery  And the worst part about it  is that the broker knows this from DAY ONE   They know full well that the likelihood of the homeowner defaulting on their loan is high  but they dont care because theyve already made their money   I know a man from my hometown by the name of Frank Ruggiero  who was talked into signing on to such a loan  Unfortunately due to his weekly dialysis treatments he could not be here today to share his story first hand   In Mr  Ruggieros case  he was recently tricked by an aggressive broker who told him to refinance his mortgage of  368 000 with a new mortgage of  416 000  Of the  48 000 additional debt on Mr  Ruggiero s home  he received only  5 728  and the balance went to closing costs  Out of this deal  the broker alone received  9 300 from the proceeds and received an additional fee of  11 900 from the lender as yield spread premium because he duped Mr  Ruggiero with such a profitable loan   Mr  Ruggiero is one of millions of borrowers that are getting duped into loans that are designed to fail the borrower and benefit the broker   The economy is not the problem here  Its the product  stupid  No one should be tricked into signing onto a loan that is purposely designed to fail them  The very existence of these loans is not a sign of the market working  The fact that these loans are underwritten almost exclusively to borrowers that cant afford them is a market failure  By some estimates  80  of subprime loans are these exploding ARMS     And what I want to examine today is why this product even came to be  and in such volume  Why are nearly three quarters of subprime loans are being originated by independent brokers or non bank affiliates with no federal supervision  or finance companies with only indirect federal supervision    And why are these bad loans being sold primarily to families that already own a home  According to the chief national bank examiner for the Office of Comptroller of the Currency  only 11percent of subprime loans went to first time buyers last year  The vast majority were refinancings that caused borrowers to owe more on their homes under the guise that they were saving money   The bottom line is that it should be illegal for lenders to qualify a borrower for a loan for anything less than its fully indexed rate  The industry must determine a borrowers ability to pay    Subprime borrowers should also be required to escrow for taxes and insurance  like virtually all prime loan borrowers  Including the taxes and insurance would make it impossible for most to get approved for these high rate mortgages  thus the reason the industry excludes them  Lack of escrows will only result in borrowers returning to lenders in serious trouble or default when tax and insurance payments are due   We must put an end to these practices and now   I have heard one horror story after another where brokers go into communities attend church services and not only offer to provide the loan  not only guarantee loans  but also offer to find the realtor and the appraiser  There is an unregulated world that is on the loose with out adequate supervision  and we need to change that   One of the things I have focused on   with my colleagues Senators Brown and Casey  is creating a national regulatory structure for mortgage brokers and other originators in addition to pushing the regulators to conduct more oversight using HOEPA and other relevant laws   In April  we introduced a strong bill  S 1299  to offer a fix to make it harder for irresponsible brokers and non bank lenders to sell mortgages that are designed to fail the homeowner and result in foreclosure   My goal is to strengthen standards for subprime mortgages by regulating mortgagebrokers and all originators under the Truth in Lending Act  TILA  by establishing on behalf of consumers a fiduciary duty and other standards of care  In addition  the bill outlines standards for brokers and originators to assess a borrowers ability to repay a mortgage  requires taxes and insurance to be escrowed on all subprime loans and holds lenders accountable for brokers and appraisers   The bill will also focus on appraisers a group that has been talked about less  The bill would protect appraisers who have often been pressured into becoming the silent partners in many predatory lending scams  providing inflated appraisals at the originators behest   It is clear that the subprime mortgage market has been the Wild West of the mortgage industry for far too long  We need a sheriff in town  Thank you  I look forward to hearing your testimonies
