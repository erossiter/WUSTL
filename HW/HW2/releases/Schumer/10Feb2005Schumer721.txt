IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 10  2005 With New Evidence That JFK Is Toughest Airport In Us On Asylum Seekers  Schumer Seeks Immigration Parole For Refugee Soldier Being Sent Home To Sure Death                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bipartisan Federal study this week uncovered vast disparities between how asylum seekers are treated at different US airports  concluded refugees are much more likely to be sent back at JFK than anywhere else no matter what the details of the individual case  Schumer asks top US Immigration Official to give immediate parole to Eritrean solider Senator and Long Island Nun have championed  Refugee a Armed with a new bipartisan US Government report that found vast disparities between how asylum seekers are treated at different US airports and concluded refugees are much more likely to be sent back at John F  Kennedy International Airport than anywhere else no matter the details of the individual case  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today asked the top US Immigration Official to give immigration parole to an Eritrean refugee solider that the Senator and a Long Island Nun have been championing while his case is being resolved       Schumer and sister Delores Castellano of the Archdiocese of Rockville Centre  Long Island  have long been trying to prevent the United States government from sending a refugee solider home to an almost certain death  The soldier    Alemseghed Mussie Tesfamical    has been in US Custody since May 2002 when he arrived at JFK International Airport seeking asylum after fleeing torture in the Eritrean Army        I am among the first to say that we need a strong and effective immigration policy  but America is also supposed to shine a beacon of freedom for victims of torture and persecution   and Mussie s story is the worst I have ever heard  hands down     Schumer said    People fleeing persecution come to the United States for one basic reason   equal justice under law  Now we learn that if Mussie had just happened to land in Miami rather than New York  he might be a free man living with his family instead in prisons and prison hospitals  That  s anything but equal justice under law  If nothing else  this report is clear  hard evidence that we should at least let this poor man go live with his family while his case is being decided          A bipartisan federal study released this week by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom found extreme differences in the handling of potential asylum cases at different airports  Based on 1 500 hours of observation of hundreds of cases at seven ports of entry across the country  the Commission concluded that the chance of being granted refuge may depend on which airport an asylum seeker uses and that Customs and Border Protection frequently failed to follow all the rules intended to make sure that immigrants were not returned to persecution  The Commission also found that by any measure  JFK is the toughest for asylum seekers        Using this study  Schumer today wrote to Michael J  Garcia the US Assistant Homeland Security Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   asking him to give Mussie Tesfamical immigration parole to release him from hospital prison while his case is being resolved  Tesfamical  s family has already documented in immigration papers that they would welcome him into their home here   typically a key issue in immigration cases       Mr  Tesfamical was born in Ethiopia but moved with his family to Eritrea in 1993  just as that country gained its independence from Ethiopia  When the two nations went to war in 1998  Mr  Tesfamical was forced to join the Eritrean Army  While in the Army  he was persecuted and tortured by his superior officers because of his Ethiopian origins  When Mr  Tesfamical assisted another native Ethiopian in reporting her rape  he was punished with severe torture  Eritrean army officials stripped off his clothes  tied his arms and legs together and forced him to lie on the ground for three days without shelter from heat and sun during the day or from the cold air at night  The soldiers also poured milk and sugar on his body to attract insects and flies  After three days  he was put in an outdoor jail which consisted of a dirt yard surrounded by wire mesh  thorny vegetation and landmines  Army officials again failed to provide him with any shelter from the elements  After Mr  Tesfamical suffered in this outdoor jail for a month  they forced him to return to duty in the army       Army officials arrested Mr  Tesfamical again two months later because he was listening to a Voice of America radio broadcast in his native language  Amharic  The Eritrean government prohibits listening to such radio broadcasts  The soldiers forced Mr  Tesfamical and five other Ethiopians to strip off their clothes  They tied up their hands and legs and forced the men to lie on the ground for four days  During those four days  they were given no shelter from the elements  were allowed to use the bathroom only twice a day and fed twice a day       Mr  Tesfamical was then put into a holding cell made out of a metal shipping container  These metal containers grow increasingly hot in the sun and prisoners who are kept in them at times lose consciousness as a result of the heat  Mr  Tesfamical was kept in the metal container for one month  He was released only after agreeing to sign a confession stating that he had tried to recruit other soldiers to participate in political and other anti governmental activities  He signed the confession in the belief that it was the only way to prevent further time in the metal container        Shortly after  Mr  Tesfamical was hospitalized for an infection and returned to his family  s house to recover at the end of his hospital stay  A friendly soldier came to his family  s house and told Mr  Tesfamical that Army officials suspected Mr  Tesfamical of being involved in opposition groups and participating in political meetings  He told Mr  Tesfamical that soldiers were on their way to arrest him  Upon learning of his impending arrest  Mr  Tesfamical fled to his aunt  s house  He remained in hiding there until he crossed the border on foot into the Sudan  During this time  soldiers repeatedly returned to his parents   house and told them that Mr  Tesfamical was wanted as an enemy agent of the government       The 2002 US Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices for Eritrea supports Mr  Tesfamical  s belief that his life is in danger because he is a deserter  It states that the Eritrean government continues to force men and women into military service and deploys military police throughout the country to round up deserters and draft evaders  The government authorizes the use of deadly force against those who resist  The report states that police routinely rely on torture techniques described by Mr  Tesfamical    prolonged sun exposure in temperatures of up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit or the tying up of the hands and feet for extended periods of time          Torture like this is not uncommon in Eritrea    the US State Department and numerous human rights groups say the country has one of the world s worst records on human rights  especially toward ethnic Ethiopians  Ethiopia and Eritrea have a long history of bloodshed between them   A time line of the Ethiopian Eritrean wars is included below   Mr  Tesfamical eventually arrived at John F  Kennedy International Airport in May 2002 seeking political asylum        A federal Immigration Judge issued an order to remove Mr  Tesfamical from the United States in September 2002 based on a legal reasoning that military deserters are not entitled to recognition under the US asylum laws  Schumer and Mr  Tesfamical s Catholic Charities immigration attorney strongly dispute this interpretation of the law  Mr  Tesfamical was deported in May of 2003 but was sent back to the United States days later by officials in Turkey  where his flight had a stop over       After being told by US Immigration officials that he would again be deported to Eritrea  Mr  Tesfamical attempted to hang himself while in Immigration custody  In addition to being of Ethiopian origin  Mr  Tesfamical was now a military deserter  which is a grave offense in Eritrea according to the State Department  Amnesty International  and other human rights groups  After his suicide attempt  Mr  Tesfamical was admitted to Holliswood Hospital  a private psychiatric institution in Queens  His case was also taken up by Sister Delores Castellano of Rockville Centre  whose work brought the case to Schumer  s attention       In October 2003  Schumer was told that he had succeeded in stopping the deportation of Mr  Tesfamical  But Mr  Tesfamical was not released to live with his family in the United States because officials in Washington at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement    the successor of the Immigration and Naturalization Service    cited a  zero tolerance  policy against overruling even faulty deportation orders like the one that attempted to send Mr  Tesfamical back to Eritrea       In late January  2004  after Schumer and Bishop William F  Murphy  Bishop of Rockville Centre Long Island  personally appealed to the senior government official in this area Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Michael J  Garcia  Schumer was told that the government had made a decision not to stop Mr  Tesfamical s deportation  With no other option left  in February 2004 Schumer asked the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security and Citizenship  Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia to open an inquiry into the case  Although Schumer sits on this Subcommittee  under only the Chairman can initiate such an inquiry under Senate rules  The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement shortly after received notice that Mr  Tesfamical s deportation order has been stayed        One year later  Mr  Tesfamical is still in US custody  awaiting resolution of his case       Although Eritrea had been historically and culturally separate from Ethiopia since the eighth century  it was formally made into Ethiopia s northernmost province in 1962  Shortly after this  the Eritrean War of Independence broke out  In 1993  Ethiopia s hard line Communist government was deposed and the new government allowed a referendum on Eritrean independence to take place  Eritreans almost unanimously voted for independence  and Ethiopia officially recognized Eritrea s sovereignty in May 1993
