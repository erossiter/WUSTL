IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 18  2006 Schumer Reveals NYC Flight Delays This Summer Could Be Worse Than Ever                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Of 33 Busiest Airports in Country  LGA  JFK and Newark Among WORST in Late Arrivals   Schumer Proposes New Legislation to Require Airlines to Immediate Alert Passengers of Delays  Give them Option to Rebook As the summer travel season heats up  and experts predict that June  July and August will be busier than ever before  today Senator Schumer revealed that flight delays at the New York metropolitan airports are at their worst  With 207 million people expected to fly this summer  and Newark  LaGuardia and JFK servicing 100 million travelers a year Schumer today unveiled his new bill  the Airline Travelers Late Awareness Act to rid airline travelers of the frustrations of not knowing when their flights will take off and land  even with posted delays       Nothing is more frustrating than when an airline knows that a flight is delayed but doesn  t tell passengers until they are sitting on a plane and stuck with their ticket     Schumer said    When you call ahead and are told that your flight is on time only to get to the airport and wait  causes endless frustration  Passengers deserve to know that their flight is delayed and should have the option of rebooking        207 million people are expected to fly this summer  which is up 2 million from the 205 million that flew last summer and up from 185 million travelers in the summer of 2001  Aside from the extremely high number of air travelers  experts predict that summer storms will likely send the already imperfect air traffic control system into disarray causing even more flight delays  In addition  70 000 fewer people are employed by airlines now than in 2002 and this year alone airlines expect 100 million more passengers     Of the 31 largest airports nationwide  JFK and La Guardia consistently rank near last in on time performance and Newark airport ranks dead last  For the year to date  of the country  s 31 largest airports  JFK  LaGuardia and Newark rank 27  29 and 31 respectively  In the past six months alone  according to Bureau of Transportation Statistics 23  of arrivals into JFK were delayed  34 5  of arrivals into LaGuardia were delayed and 37  of arrivals into Newark were late  The average arrival delay in April for late flights coming into JFK was 45 minutes  for LaGuardia was 53 minutes and Newark arrival delays averaged out at 55 minutes     Departure statistics were not much better  In the past six months 27  of flights departing JFK were late  34  of flights departing LaGuardia were late and 26 5  for flights departing Newark  For departures  JFK averaged at 41 minutes late  LaGuardia departures were 53 minutes late and Newark were one hour and one minute late     In the past year  most of these statistics have only gotten worse  and Schumer said today he expects the summer to be worse than is expected  For example  in April of 2005 Newark had 27 5  of its flights delayed  but in April of this year Newark showed over 34  of its flights delayed upon arrival  For departures  in April 2005 Newark had 17 5  of departures delayed  and in April of this year it had 25 7  of departures delayed  LaGuardia departure delays went up just under 5  in the year    last April 16  of flights were delayed departing  whereas in April of this year nearly 21  were delayed       Quality time with your family shouldn  t be wasted sitting in a crowded airport or packed airplane     Schumer said    Travelers spend hard earned money on summer vacations  they deserve better than unexplained  frustrating delays  Its time the waiting game becomes regulated        These delays might seem like only minor inconveniences  but to travelers with a tight connecting flight schedule  business travelers with meetings to make and families trying to reach a loved on in need  these delays can have serious implications  Schumer said today that airlines need to be mindful of these travelers and must do everything in their power to keep travelers as informed as possible both in the airport and on the tarmac so that passengers can make adjustments to their schedules and keep their loved ones and colleagues up to speed on their new estimated arrival times      Improving information to passengers about delays will mitigate at least some of the car and foot traffic at busy airports  Schumer believes that alerting passengers as soon as the delay becomes apparent will lead to calmer and more informed passengers  and will be of great help to airline employees and others working in the airport      To combat this terrible inconvenience  Schumer today unveiled his bill  the Airline Travelers Late Awareness Act  which requires airlines to make delay information available to passengers upon receiving it or be subject to a penalty     He also wrote the FAA  asking them to investigate different methods of informing airline passengers about delays and put together rules that would require the airlines to implement the most effective and expedited passenger alert program  In his letter he wrote    There are many possible methods  phone messages  emails and text messages could all work  However  we need a standard method and procedure to follow so that the information is delivered as quickly and as accurately as possible        The data released today suggests that New York  s airports will only become more crowded with more New Yorkers spending more time waiting on airport tarmacs and standing in long lines
