                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bill Would Close Loopholes  Allocate Immediate Dollars For Education  Prevention  and Treatment    And Put Pseudoephedrine Behind The Pharmacy Counter   Schumer  When Similar Laws Implemented In Oklahoma  Measures Drove Down Meth Seizures By 70 Percent As methamphetamine usage continues to plague every corner of New York State  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced major progress in the fight to crackdown on the crystal meth epidemic  Schumer  a co sponsor of the Combat Meth Act  said provisions of the legislation now slated for approval  will help close loopholes  allocate immediate dollars for education  prevention  and treatment  stamp out the international trade in methamphetamine  and put pseudoephedrine behind the pharmacy counter       We are waging a battle against crystal meth  and this is a major step forward     Schumer said    There  s a lot more work to be done and this bill would bill local law enforcement the tools they need to effectively combat this ongoing epidemic  This new  bipartisan momentum in Congress to deal with the spread of crystal meth will hopefully mean increased prevention  treatment  and care across New York State         Nationally  meth use has grown by as much as 300  in some communities  According to the Drug Enforcement Agency  during 2000  4  of the U S  population or 12 3 million people reported trying methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime  Nationwide meth lab seizures have more than doubled from over 7 000 in 1999 to over 17 000 in 2004  In 1999  there were three meth lab raids in the entire state of New York  but by 2003 there were 73  In the past year  we have made some progress with raids slightly dropping to 53 in 2004  Admissions for meth users NYS drug treatment clinics have risen by over 80  in five years  In 1999  623 people were admitted to treatment for meth addiction in NYS  but by 2004 that number grew to 1 118     This problem plagues every corner of New York State  there have been clandestine meth lab raids in 39 counties since 1999  In some regions  like the Southern Tier and North Country the problem is particularly acute  Meth lab raids in the Southern Tier and North Country account for 71  of the total meth lab raids  but only for 38  of meth addiction admissions     Schumer announced that a bipartisan deal was reached on provisions of the Combat Meth Act  originally sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein  D CA  and Jim Talent  R MO   Schumer said today that broad bipartisan agreement on the bill should mean that stand alone legislation dealing with the issue should move through Congress quickly  Specifically  the Combat Meth Act would           Restrict the sale of necessary ingredient to make meth    Amends the Controlled Substances Act to appropriately limit and record the sale of medicines containing pseudoephedrine by placing them behind the pharmacy counter and sets a limit on how much such medicines one person can by in a month    9 0 grams          Provide critical resources to hot spot areas to reduce availability of meth    Provides an additional  99 000 000 in grants to States and local law enforcement agencies to assist in the investigation of meth traffickers and to support State and local health department and environmental agency services deployed to address the meth epidemic          Increase penalties for meth smugglers and kingpins    Adds a sentence of up to 15 years in prison for those who smuggle meth into this country  and includes more large scale meth dealers in the category of drug kingpins who receive enhanced sentences          Enhance law enforcement  s ability to track major international meth producers    Grants  1 000 000 to add a special section on meth to the State Department  s report on major drug trafficking countries  if any of the countries designated in the report does not fully cooperate with the United States in limiting meth production and trade  their U S  aid will be jeopardized           Prevent the smuggling of meth from Mexico    In order to stamp out the dangerous and free flowing trade in meth across the Mexican border  the bill provides  4 000 000 to enhance bilateral border enforcement efforts and to facilitate cooperation with the Mexican government          Adds critical funding for federal drug courts        Authorizes an additional  70 000 000 to fund federal drug courts          Provide services for children affected by the spread of meth    Provides  20 000 000 in grant funding for Drug Endangered Children rapid response teams to promote collaboration among federal  state  and local agencies to assist and educate children that have been affected by the production of methamphetamine      Methamphetamine is perhaps the most deadly  fiercely addictive and rapidly spreading drug the United States has known  During the past decade  while law enforcement officers continue to bust record numbers of clandestine labs  meth use in communities has skyrocketed  Meth is cheap  potent  and available everywhere      The continuing proliferation of methamphetamine production continues to put a severe strain on federal and local entities  Fighting meth requires a comprehensive approach designed to assist states  local law enforcement and prosecutors to crack down on cooks and traffickers of meth while enhancing community education and awareness and treatment options for those addicted to this dangerous drug
