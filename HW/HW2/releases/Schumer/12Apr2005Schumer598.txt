                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Recent Examples of Egregious Loopholes That Are Compromising Personal Information Need Immediate and Thorough Action by Congress  Schumer Nelson Bill Would Empower FTC  Inform Consumer to Prevent ID Theft in Future  Not Just Punish Wrongdoers after the Fact On the heels of numerous and significant identity theft breaches  U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY  and Bill Nelson  D FL  are introducing major and comprehensive legislation today to prevent ID theft  to give broader authority to the Federal Trade Commission  and require more disclosure  The Schumer Nelson ID Theft Prevention bill is the first and most comprehensive effort to really prevent ID theft  not just punish those who commit ID theft  Sen  Schumer is a member of almost all the committees that would have jurisdiction over this bill including the Finance  Judiciary  and Banking Committees  and Sen  Nelson is a member of the Commerce Committee  which also has jurisdiction       Schumer said    What bank robbery was to the Depression Age  identity theft is to the Information Age  Identity theft has become so pervasive and so out of hand  that we must make a real effort to prevent it before it happens  When a company like Lexis Nexis so badly underestimates its own ID theft breaches  it is clear that things are totally out of hand          According to Lexis Nexis today  they found a 300 000 person sensitive personal information breach  not a 30 000 person breach  which was originally reported last month          This bill not only will help stop the erosion of privacy     said Nelson  a longtime champion of consumer privacy    But it also will cut through the red tape identity theft victims now face when they try to restore their credit           Schumer continued    Everyone knows that once your identity has been stolen  you can  t get it back  That is why our comprehensive measure focuses on making sure that your personal information isn  t surfing the Internet without your permission and that companies handling your Social Security number and other sensitive information should come under the watchful eye of the Federal Trade Commission immediately          Schumer Nelson ID Theft Prevention Bill will       Create FTC Office of Identity Theft to help the millions of victims of ID theft each year to get their identity back through an easily accessible website  toll free phone number and consumer service teams  and authorizes  60 million a year  for five years for this office       Regulate data merchants  akin to regulation of credit bureaus  by     Make them register with the FTC     Institute safeguards to prevent fraudulent access by unauthorized parties     Develop authentication process for their customers with individualized passwords     Users allowed these passwords are people who have passed a reasonably effective background check     Data Merchant should track who accessed what records and for what lawful purpose they were accessed     Allow consumers  like with their credit reports  to obtain reports showing which data merchants have their information and mandates a correction process to fix errors     Demands accuracy standards for their information      Regulates Credit Bureaus only if  and as far as  they sell credit header information currently unregulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its amendments        Disclosure Box   Any company that is collecting your sensitive personal information and plans to sell or transfer your information to an unaffiliated third party  must put a   Disclosure Box    on it  which lets the consumer know in PLAIN ENGLISH that   this information may be sold or given to an unaffiliated third party without your additional consent          Notification provisions in the case of an information breach are very similar to current California law  the law that forced ChoicePoint to notify consumers   But there is a new provision  allowing any consumer who is notified of a breach of their information to request  in writing  that their information be completely expunged from the company  s database       Every company required to take   Reasonable Steps    to protect sensitive personal information they are storing       Social Security Number Specific Provisions     Prohibits any company from asking for a Social Security number unless they actually need it in the normal course of business     Prohibits SSN  s displayed on employee IDs and prohibits inmates in prison from having any access to them as part of their prison jobs     Bans SSN purchase and sale  except for law enforcement  national security and fraud purposes     Grants U S  Attorney General the ability to further define the exemptions as situations arise and exempt more if needed       Would also require the FTC to     Study national  state and local governments   public postings of Social Security numbers  come up with recommendations and forward them on to the relevant national  state and local governments     Require a thorough annual report each year on ID theft     For each section there  s a maximum penalty  usually  1 000 per individual record per violation  which can be administered by the FTC or Attorneys General     Study international identity theft and determine ways to combat it     Create a blue ribbon working group representing both industry and consumer groups to find the best ways for private entities to protect consumer data       Stop public postings of private financial account numbers  i e  mutual fund companies posting shareholder information on Internet        Preempts state law to the extent that it is inconsistent with the provisions of this bill and then only to the extent of the inconsistency  If the statute offers greater consumer protections than this bill  it shall not be preempted by this bill       Create an Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security in the Department of Homeland Security  which is what an earlier Schumer amendment to the 9 11 bill and a bi partisan house bill in the 108th would have done
