IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 16  2006 With Long Island Primed To Become Largest Wi Fi Network In Nation  Schumer Unveils Ambitious New Plan For Federal Investment In Wireless Technology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Schumer and Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy Offer Bold Vision for Next Frontier of Internet Discovery   Bringing the Weight of Federal Resources Behind Providing High Speed Access to 3 Million Residents Blanketing 1 200 Square Miles   Wi Fi will allow residents to log on everywhere from the Long Island Rail Road to Eisenhower Park to Montauk Point  and Promote Long Island as a High Te In light of the rapid growth of wireless internet access in major cities across the country  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced a new plan to bring wireless  including   Wi Fi     wireless fidelity   high speed internet access to communities on Long Island  New York State currently ranks 31st among all 50 states in percentage of households with an internet connection  Schumer  s plan includes creating a federal pilot project for Long Island  expansive new federal resources and rules to protect wireless customers from hackers and identity theft         In a world that is increasingly reliant on high speed  easily accessible Internet  not having high speed Internet access is like not having air to breathe   said Schumer   Broadband technology is the lifeblood of the new economy and it is more important than ever for the federal government to invest in high speed  universal Internet access throughout the country  Wireless networks will allow residents  businesses  and visitors to connect wherever they may be and keep Long Island at the forefront of the 21st Century economy by attracting new types of cutting edge  high tech business            Suffolk County and Long Island have been leaders in many areas of computer technology  and we believe government can play an active role in encouraging and enabling the creation of a system to serve all of Long Island with universal  affordable or even free broadband access   said County Executive Levy  who unveiled his desire for a countywide  accessible wireless network in his State of the County address this past January   Wi Fi has us on the brink of a new era of possibilities  I thank Senator Schumer for recognizing the importance of this initiative to the region and for focusing on bringing federal resources to this and other municipalities throughout the state that are seeking to harness the power of this exciting technological opportunity        Schumer today said that Long Island residents  businesses  and visitors do not have sufficient access to high speed wireless internet that is critical to business development in the 21st Century economy  This new infrastructure and wireless capability will promote Long Island as a high tech region  attract new companies  and boost the local economy  For the public  there is the promise of Internet service in places where they would otherwise not have it  riding on the Long Island Rail Road  sitting on the boardwalk at Jones Beach  enjoying a day at Eisenhower Park  or even spending the day on a boat in the Great South Bay  Wi Fi will also offer great benefits to emergency responders  police and fire  and increased productivity and efficiencies for local governments        According to an analysis done by ECC Associates  a New York internet consulting firm  roughly 12 percent of homes in New York could not have access to a broadband connection  meaning they could not get high speed service  except for expensive satellite service  if they wanted  According to FCC data  there are 2 833 478 residences in New York connected to high speed internet lines        The presence of Wi Fi networks in cities and towns on Long Island would offer nearly 3 million residents and the business community  which may not ordinarily have access to the web  the ability to utilize high speed  inexpensive internet anywhere in Nassau or Suffolk counties  from Long Beach to Montauk Point   In addition  creating wireless high speed internet would connect downtowns to the 21st century economy and attract new types of high tech businesses to Long Island         Right now  most wireless   hot spots    are limited to chain restaurants  coffee shops  and hotels  McDonalds  Starbucks  and Best Western provide Wi Fi access    However  some communities across Long Island  such as Glen Cove and Fire Island  and even several marinas have created small networks to cover public places  Schumer and Levy  s plan would cover all 1 200 square miles of the region  County Executive Levy has already issued a Request for Proposals and is reviewing the responses from interested project partners  Recently  a phone survey was conducted of 400 people across Long Island and 67 8  supported the project        In an effort to promote federal investment in the burgeoning new frontier of high speed  universal wireless Internet access  Schumer today proposed a 3 point plan to bring Wi Fi to Long Island  A wireless broadband system would allow residents  businesses  and visitors to connect to the Internet from anywhere across the 1 200 square miles of Suffolk and Nassau counties       First  Schumer plans to introduce legislation to create a federal pilot project on Long Island  The Department of Commerce would designate Long Island as a model region and authorize  5 million to invest in the development of what would be the largest Wi Fi network in the nation geographically  Further  Schumer  s bill would establish an FCC regional resource facility to assist local governments such as Suffolk  the private sector  and the academic community  Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy has begun to develop a public private partnership with companies such as CA and Symbol with Brookhaven National Lab and Stony Brook University  s Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology       Second  in a letter Schumer wrote to the Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce  he urged the federal government to provide a comprehensive resource to communities looking to start wi fi networks  Specifically  Schumer called on the Secretary of Commerce to create a series of federal standards and best practices for creating wireless networks so communities who want to create these networks can navigate through any potential problems and can create a system that suits their needs  He also urged the establishment of a full time staffer employed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  NTIA  to act as a federal one stop shop for community leaders and local governments  And lastly  Schumer called on the NTIA to encourage public private partnerships between communities and service providers to reduce cost and increase access to consumers by creating a comprehensive data based of certified companies   that provide and can create these networks       Third  Schumer urged the Commerce Department to coordinate with the FBI to craft a set of specific security standards to protect wireless users against ID theft and crime as there are currently no security rules or best practices to protect computers on wi fi networks  Lastly  Schumer asked the Secretary of Commerce to work cooperatively with the General Service Administration to require that all federal buildings be linked to the network for municipalities that set up wi fi       Schumer was joined by Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy  Dr  Shirley Strum Kenny  President of Stony Brook
