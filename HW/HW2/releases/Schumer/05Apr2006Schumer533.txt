IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 5  2006 Schumer Uncovers New IRS Proposal To Make It Easier For Tax Preparers To Scam Upstate New Yorkers Out Of Millions Of Dollars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Unscrupulous Preparers Offer Immediate Cash When Full Refund Would Be Much More    Proposed IRS Rule Changes Would Make it Easier To Peddle These Loans With Sky High Interest Rates and Outrageous Administrative Fees   Senator Unveils Bipartisan Legislation With Wyoming Republican To Crackdown on Selling of Personal Information and Prevent the Marketing of Refund   Loans      Schumer to Detail Cost of Scam As Tax Day nears  thousands of New Yorkers are getting cheated out of millions of dollars via tax refund loan scams  and a new Internal Revenue Service  IRS  proposal would make it easier for taxpayers to be victimized by these predatory loans  The IRS proposal would remove restrictions on how tax preparers can market these loans to taxpayers  In an effort to combat this scenario  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced new bipartisan legislation to make it harder for tax preparers to sell personal tax information to companies offering these loans  The   instant refunds    are actually tax refund loans or Refund Anticipation Loans  RALs   short term loans secured by the recipient s tax refund and marketed as instant tax refunds by lenders  Customers are charged interest rates that can go as high as 700 percent on an annual basis to get their own tax dollars back from the government just a week or two faster than they otherwise would          This is a scam  plain and simple     Schumer said    We haven  t done nearly enough to expose these wolves in sheep  s clothing and today  s legislation will be a giant step forward  The bottom line is  New Yorkers  and people all over the country  are getting ripped off by these so called refund loans  and it  s time to stop them dead in their tracks          Refund Anticipation Loans are high cost loans secured by and repaid directly from the proceeds of a taxpayer  s refund from the IRS  RALs usually run for 7 14 days    the difference between when the RAL is made and when it is repaid by deposit of the taxpayer  s refund  As is often the case with terrible financial deals  RALs are targeted at low income consumers  who are often in need of funds quickly  Nationwide  over 9 6 million low income tax filers paid almost  1 billion in RAL fees  according to the Consumer Federation of America  CFA  and the National Consumer Law Center  NCLC   According to IRS data  one in every ten taxpayers took out a RAL  with 78 percent of RAL applicants in 2004 having an adjusted gross income of  35 000 or less       These loans are advertised all over the country as   instant tax refunds    with catchy slogans and colorful advertisements  Generally  a taxpayer goes into a tax preparer and is told that their refund can be made available immediately rather then waiting 10 14 days to get the IRS to process the refund  Loan Fees can range from anywhere from  30 to  150 depending on the combination of costs  which is steep  especially when consumers don  t realize that they are getting a loan  This charge does not include tax preparation fees which average almost  150  Though the charges may not seem extraordinarily high  depending in the size of the loan it means paying an effective annual interest rate of 40 percent to more than 700 percent according to the NCLC       Under current law  tax preparers can only pitch loans and services that their company   currently offers    at the time the consumer is having their taxes done  The IRS is proposing to remove those restrictions and allow tax companies to pitch an unaffiliated company  s deals  even long after a consumer  s taxes have been filed  In addition  the tax preparer would be also be able to disclose an individual  s private tax return to any other bank or company  who would then be allowed to solicit that individual as well  Schumer said this change would make taxpayers even more susceptible to identity theft because tax preparers would have an even greater incentive to share or sell an individual  s tax return       The NCLC reports that 18  of consumers have taken out a RAL at some point  Of these consumers  two thirds did not realize a RAL is a loan  Consumers paid an estimated  1 24 billion in RAL fees to get quick cash for their refunds  essentially borrowing their own money at extremely high interest rates       Once a taxpayer decides on receiving their   instant tax refund     the tax preparer then sends a request to the IRS to see whether that person is entitled to a full refund  partial refund  or nothing at all  The IRS tells the preparer what they  re entitled to  the preparer calculates the expected refund  minus the fees  The refund is then processed within 7 14 days and deposited into a dummy bank account set up by the preparer in the name of the recipient  The preparer then keeps the difference       Schumer today released  detailing how much New York taxpayers in each county are losing with these scams            In the Capital Region  42 276 taxpayers received instant tax refunds and lost  4 23 million            In Central New York  33 911 taxpayers received instant tax refunds and lost  3 39 million            In the Hudson Valley  61 376 taxpayers received instant tax refunds and lost  6 14 million            In the Rochester Finger Lakes area  42 559 taxpayers received instant tax refunds and lost  4 26 million            In the North Country  20 335 taxpayers received instant tax refunds and lost  2 03 million            In the Southern Tier  25 018 taxpayers received instant tax refunds and lost  2 50 million            In Western New York  50 261 taxpayers received instant tax refunds and lost  5 03 million       Schumer today announced new bipartisan legislation with Senator Craig Thomas  R WY  to make it harder for preparers to sell a taxpayer  s personal information to companies that offer these services  The bill would prohibit preparers from soliciting their clients   consent to sell personal tax information for marketing purposes to unaffiliated companies that offer RALs and other services  Earlier this week  Schumer announced opposition to a related IRS proposal to allow preparers of tax returns to sell or disclose taxpayers   most sensitive personal information  Under the proposed rule  commercial tax preparers  including on line tax preparation companies  could use private tax return information by simply obtaining a taxpayer  s signature on a consent form  which could easily be hidden in a large pile of tax documents  and then would be able to sell the information to a third party for marketing and commercial purposes        Schumer also has a bill in the Senate Finance Committee specifically targeting RALS  The Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act  S  832   would             Prohibit refund anticipation loans that utilize EITC benefits  Most refund anticipation loans are targeted at low income tax payers  Nationwide  there were a total of 12 17 million sold in 2004  79  of these were made to low income households and over 50  were made to EITC recipients            Require that the Treasury Department provide the opportunity for low and moderate income taxpayers to open a low cost direct deposit account at a federally insured bank or credit union through the use of appropriate tax forms  Filing electronically and having the refund direct deposited into a bank or credit union account permits taxpayers to receive their refunds in approximately seven to ten days  without paying the high fees associated with RALs             End the Debt Indicator  DI  program which shares taxpayers  personal information   beyond what is necessary   with tax preparers  In the RAL application process  the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  reduces the risk that lenders take on RALs by providing them with a Debt Indicator  DI  on all IRS e file acknowledgments        Click here to view
