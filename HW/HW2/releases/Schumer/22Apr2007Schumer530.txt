                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Mental Health Information Not Required to be Turned to Over to the Feds and Shared Between States  Allows Dangerous Gun Sales to Slip Through Cracks   Schumer and McCarthy Announce Bicameral Legislation to Close Loophole in System   Might Well Have Prevented Virginia Killing   System in Place to Ensure Guns Don t Get into the Wrong Hands is Broken  Cho Seung Hui Had Been Committe This week s tragic shooting of 32 people was committed by a gunman who had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and deemed a  danger to himself and others by a judge  but was still able to buy firearms  no questions asked   Cho Seung Hui was allowed to buy two handguns because no information about his mental condition showed up in his federal background check   Today  Senator Charles E  Schumer and Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy announced plans for legislation that would strengthen requirements for states to get critical mental health information to the federal government  something that may well have prevented the Virginia killings        The tragic deaths of 32 innocents this week at Virginia Tech at the hands of someone who was so clearly disturbed  and yet had no problems purchasing not one  but two guns  defies reason   Schumer said   It is long past overdue that we revamp our gun laws  and prevent dangerous people from slipping through the cracks in the system   I will fight tooth and nail as I have for the last 30 years to do so    My heart goes out to the victims and their families   said McCarthy    We have learned that this madman should not have been able to purchase a gun  yet still passed a background check   Congress has a responsibility to ensure the federal background check system is complete and current to prevent certain individuals from legally purchasing firearms   While maintaining NICS records ultimately is the responsibility of the states  state budgets are already overburdened   The NICS Improvement Act will give states the resources to eliminate the legal loopholes that allow prohibited individuals from legally purchasing firearms     In the tragic Virginia Tech massacre  Cho used two weapons  a 9mm Glock 19 and a  22 caliber Walther pistol  both semi automatics which allow the shooter to rapidly fire a shot with each pull of the trigger opposed to having to manually cock the weapon between shots  Both weapons were purchased in state  with Cho using a credit card to purchase the Glock 19 and a box of 50 rounds of ammunition for  571 00 from the Roanoke Firearms store in Roanoke  Virginia  on March 13  2007  After showing government ID and verifying his state residency  he passed the instant background check     Cho allegedly ordered the  22 caliber handgun over the internet  and picked it up on February 9  2007  from JND Pawnbrokers in Blacksburg  Virginia  only a few miles from Virginia Tech s campus  Cho was required to show the store clerk a driver s license and complete paperwork before passing the background check   Because no mental health information was in the system  he was able to pass his background checks     However  two years before buying the guns  Cho was accused of stalking two of his fellow female students at Virginia Tech  and was civilly committed  At the time  a court order found that Cho  presents an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness    He was then briefly admitted to a psychiatric facility for an overnight stay as an outpatient   This information was never conveyed to the Federal Government and never appeared on Cho s background checks       Federal law clearly prohibits buying a firearm by those who have been  adjudicated mentally defective  or  committed to a mental health institution    Also forbidden from possessing guns are people who      Are subject to a court order restraining them from domestic violence    Are under indictment for  or have been convicted of a felony    Are fugitives from justice    Are users or addicts of controlled substances    Have been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor   Have been honorably discharged from the military    Are illegal aliens  and   Have renounced U S  Citizenship        When someone tries to buy a gun  a background check is run through the National Instant Criminal Background  or  NICS  system   A NICS call center representative  or an automated system  runs a check of several databases to see if the purchaser has a record that prohibits him from buying a gun under federal law   Most potential gun buyers are either approved or denied almost instantly   But if the computer search can t reach a final determination  a NICS representative must conduct a manual search for missing information that will allow NICS to make a final determination   In this situation  the NICS representative must attempt to get the missing information by calling state and local courthouses  judges  clerks  or even law enforcement officers to get the information  If the NICS representative can t get an answer back in three days  the gun dealer automatically has permission to sell the gun to the buyer       A criminal background check is only as good as the records that the states provide to the system   Millions of criminal and mental health records are not accessible to the NICS system  mostly because state and local governments lack the money to submit the records    In addition  the process is often spotty   nothing necessarily requires states to turn over all information that could prohibit a person from getting a gun   So  as a result  many people who simply should not have guns are allowed to purchase them       In an effort to fix this problem  today Senator Schumer and Congresswoman McCarthy announced bicameral legislation  that would provide funding and huge incentives to states to help them automate their criminal history records and provide information to the FBI regarding any individual who is barred from having a gun       The legislation would do this by providing  250 000 000 to state agencies and  125 000 000 for state courts  to upgrade their computers to ensure speedy delivery of information   Using a  carrot and stick approach   states who poorly comply with the law will risk losing 5  of their funding under the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968   Significant incentives will be provided to states that have good reporting records       States who comply would be required to share information   such as an individual s relevant  disqualifying history of mental illness   with the FBI   The law also requires federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security to make their records available to the NICS database to endure timely and thorough background checks of those who purchase guns        Our legislation  had it been in place last week  may well have stopped last week s unspeakable tragedy   Sen  Schumer said    But we know that someone like Cho Seung Hui should never have been allowed to buy a gun   Our legislation will take one step toward preventing more people from falling through the cracks  and will try to make sure that such a horrible thing doesn t happen in New York  or Virginia  or anywhere else ever again
