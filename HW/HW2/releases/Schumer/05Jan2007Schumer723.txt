IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 5  2007 In First Week Of New Congress  Schumer Kick Starts Renewed Effort To Derail   Destructive    Pass Card Rule  Calls For First Time Independent Review Of Entire Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In Official Comment to the Department of State  Senator Blasts the New Rule as Inconvenient and Inefficient with Little Security Benefit    Schumer Lays Out Eight Steps the State Dept  Should Take Before Moving Forward in Order to Protect Upstate NY Businesses that Depend on Cross Border Commerce   U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today submitted a formal comment criticizing the Department of State  s proposed rule regarding the new People Access Security Service  PASS  Card and laid out eight steps the State Department should take before any final rule is implemented   In his comment  Schumer said the proposed PASS Card will offer all of the inconvenience and inefficiencies of a standard passport book  while providing none of the security assurances for individuals   private information   Schumer specifically asked that the State Department conduct an economic impact study on the economies in upstate New York and other border states and bring in an independent auditor to evaluate the entire program       The PASS card is simply a passport in sheep  s clothing     Schumer said    We need to bring outside experts in immediately to conduct a long overdue assessment of the security  privacy  and technical aspects of the PASS Card proposal because right now the State Department is flying blind   As it stands  the cards will still be too slow  too expensive  and too big of a hassle for businesses  travelers  and families across upstate New York  The feds need to go back to the drawing board and find a real alternative that protects both security and commerce        Schumer  who has long been critical of State Department and Department of Homeland Security proposals to require travelers to present additional identification documents  including passports  when crossing the Northern Border  spelled out more than a dozen reasons why the current PASS Card proposal is unacceptable  Schumer sent his comment directly to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  which will then be included in the federal record   The State Department announced its PASS Card proposal in October and is set to make a final decision in the coming months       Schumer  s primary concern is the effect the rule would have on cross border commerce and the upstate New York businesses and residents that depend on efficient  speedy  and reliable travel to and from Canada       The United States and Canada have the largest bi national trade relationship in the world  Trade with Canada supports an estimated 350 000 jobs in New York alone  Fully 25  of all New York State exports  accounting for  10 5 billion  go to Canada every year  The impact of tourism and spur of the moment trips is also staggering with Canadians accounting for 2 2 million visits to New York in 2002 injecting  389 million into the local economies     In his comment  Schumer said that   I fully appreciate the importance of and fully share your concern that we must secure our borders in order to prevent the entry of dangerous people or goods  However  border security measures must not be implemented in a way that strangles the US economy   I believe we can and must both secure the border and ensure the vitality of cross border commerce   In my view  the proposed PASS Card will offer all of the inconvenience and inefficiencies of a passport book  while providing none of the security assurances  I have serious concerns about the proposed rule  s impact on the US economy  its effect on the social and cultural fabric of border communities  the insufficient security protections of the RF Vicinity Read technology  and the thoroughness with which the Department of State developed this proposed rule  Therefore  I am unable to support the implementation of this proposed rule without significant further examination and justification        In addition to economic  technological  and security issues and impacts  Schumer specifically questioned whether the State Department had thoroughly evaluated the program and its overall feasibility  Schumer asked the Department of State either to perform more thorough analyses on the potential impacts of the PASS Card proposal or to commission studies to gather such data   In particular  Schumer said the Department of State should consult with the independent National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  to obtain its assessment of the technology options  This is especially necessary given NIST  s statutory responsibility to justify any deviation in security standards for travel documents used in the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative        In response to the growing concern about passports and the PASS Card  Schumer outlined eight specific steps the State Department should take before any final rule is implemented     1  Conduct a pilot program to assess the security and efficiency of the available technologies  Without conducting a pilot  the Department of State cannot claim with any authority that this untried system will produce the promised efficiency gains and avoid economic losses      2  Conduct or commission a rigorous study on the economic impact of this proposed rule on the economy of the United States and on the economies of New York and other border states  Specifically  this study should seek to determine whether the detrimental economic impact of issuing PASS Cards pursuant to the proposed fee schedule would exceed the cost of providing PASS Cards to all eligible individuals at no charge      3  Engage an independent body to assess the security  privacy  and technical feasibility of the proposed PASS Card technology and alternative technologies  No independent body was involved in assessing the feasibility  security  or privacy aspects of this system      4  Offer travelers information about the use of RF signals and give them a chance to opt out of this PASS card format in favor of a more secure form of technology      5  Provide details regarding the registered traveler program that must be made   readily available    for the benefit of border residents and provide a plan for permitting spontaneous travel by tourists and others  These programs must not be an afterthought  they are critical to the feasibility of a travel document requirement for border communities      6  Consider the feasibility  costs  and benefits of providing PASS Cards to children at no cost      7  Publicly release any privacy impact assessments  economic assessments  and other analyses that were performed for the purpose of developing the proposed rule      8  Conduct a public education campaign  especially in border communities  to inform potential travelers about the proposed rule and to obtain public reactions to the Department  s plan for implementation
