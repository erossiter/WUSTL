IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 19  2007 Schumer Visits With Vets At Canandaigua VA    Unveils New Plan To Require Full Guaranteed Funding For Vets Health Care And Increase Support For Canandaigua                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Schumer  a Long Time Supporter of the Canandaigua VA  Tours the Facility  Meets with Veterans  and Shows How New Proposal Would Bolster Canandaigua    Current VA Health Care Budget Would Shortchange Veterans Living in the Rochester   Finger Lakes Region by More Than  10 Million   Schumer Unveils Comprehensive Proposal to Ensure Federal Funding for Vets Health Care is Guaranteed Every Year Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer visited with veterans and toured the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  Schumer  joined by area veterans  also said that he will push a new proposal to ensure that the budget for veterans  health care is fully funded every year  Right now  the current Administration s budget shortchanges upstate veterans alone by more than  100 million   According to the New York State Division of Veterans Affairs  there are more than 30 000 veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan currently living in New York        The short funding and budget cuts for vets  health care have gone on for far too long   Schumer said   The VA here serves veterans well  but even still  they need every dollar they can get their hands on to ensure that all veterans in the area receive the care they need and deserve   Year after year  Congress has to step in at the last minute when the VA runs out of money   Our veterans should never have to worry if there is going to be enough money to pay for their care  They have earned far better from the federal government        Earlier this week  Schumer revealed that the current Administration s budget shortchanges Rochester Finger Lakes veterans by more than  10 million for Fiscal Year 2008   Nationwide  the budget gap equals more than  2 8 billion  Schumer s report found that this massive shortfall would cost upstate New York veterans an estimated  101 4 million in medical services  There are over 637 400 veterans currently living in upstate New York with 263 600 currently receiving VA health benefits       Right now  there are 93 456 veterans living in the Rochester   Finger Lakes Region with 37 731 enrolled in the VA health service  The current budget would shortchange these vets by  10 478 514        With 30 000 veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan currently living in New York and rising  Schumer said the federal government cannot continue to maintain these debilitating shortfalls without compromising care   Schumer said that  as the Walter Reed scandal has shown  the care active duty soldiers and America s veterans receive has slipped significantly over the past six years       As of September 2006  more than 50 500 US soldiers have suffered non mortal wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan   a ratio of 16 wounded servicemen per fatality  This is by far the highest ratio of any recent war  In Vietnam  the ratio was 2 6 injuries per fatality  Through advancements in field medicine and overall medical technology  more servicemen and women are thankfully surviving their wounds  however  Schumer said current and past VA budgets do not account for the dramatic new and long term burdens on VA health care  In 2005  the Senate was forced to pass an emergency  2 billion spending bill to make up for a dangerous shortfall that the VA had been denying for months   Schumer said that repeated budget cuts have created a crisis situation in the veterans  health care system         Specifically  the budget for the second year in a row dramatically underestimates the needs of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF   Though the budget includes  752 million to provide health care services for returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans  it is projected that this allocation will fall significantly short of real demand  According to the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee  the VA s estimates that it will service only 54 000 more new OIF OEF veterans during 2007  for a total of 109 191 could be 60 000 patients short of actual demand       Today  Schumer announced the following steps to ensure veterans health care is fully funded every year            Restore the Administration s Budget Cuts   Schumer today announced that the Senate Budget Committee has fully restored funding for VA health care in the Fiscal Year 2008 Congressional Budget   The budget  to be released this week  will add  3 5 million to more than make up for the shortfall         Earlier this month  Schumer called on Chairman and Ranking members of the Senate and House budget committees asking them to include at least  2 85 billion in additional funding for VA medical services to make up for the shortfall  Schumer said this must include  357 million just for health care for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan            Mandatory Funding   Schumer said he was going to push to ensure that funding for veterans  health care is guaranteed every year  His proposal would ensure that veterans health care funding was appropriated in the same manner as Medicare and Medicaid   Right now  the budget for veterans  health care can change from year to year and can shift wildly depending on which party controls Congress or the White House       Designating funding for the VA as  mandatory funding  would ensure that federal support for veterans  health care would be sufficient irrespective of demand   For veterans who receive treatment at the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  this plan would ensure that the VA is always fully funded  this  10 million gap would never occur  and veterans could count on the fact that the federal government would always provide the support our veterans need        Schumer  a leader in the Senate  also said that for the first time there will be a hearing on the issue of full funding of veterans health care   The committee will also discuss a new cost estimate and finally do the oversight that is necessary to try and make this proposal a reality
