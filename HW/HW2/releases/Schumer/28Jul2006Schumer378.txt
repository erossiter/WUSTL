IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 28  2006 Schumer Calls On Romanian President To Protect And Preserve Historic Romanian Jewish Cemeteries

                                Sanctity of Jewish Cemeteries Jeopardized by Community Development and the Deterioration of Headstones    Senator Urges Romanian President to Protect Resting Grounds Vital to Honoring Jewish History in Romania Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on Romanian President Traian B    sescu to restore and protect Romania  s Jewish cemeteries  a number of which are currently in disrepair due to community development that is cutting into the land and the deterioration of headstones  In a letter sent to President Basescu today  Senator Schumer urged the Romanian government to ensure that the Jewish cemeteries  which hold deep cultural significance to Jewish communities in the United States and across the world  be preserved         Cemeteries are an important issue to worldwide Jewry  and Jewish cemeteries in Romania are no exception     said Senator Schumer    For many Jews in the United States these cemeteries are the last link to their ancestry  I urge President B    sescu to pledge that he will honor those who lost their lives in the horrific acts of the Holocaust and their ancestors           According to an international commission report released by the Romanian government in 2004  between 280 000 and 380 000 Jews were murdered in Romania during World War II  Many of those died in the in the war zone of Bessarabia  Bukovina and Transnistria      The murders committed in Iasi  Odessa  Bogdanovka  Domanovka  and Peciora were some of the most horrific murders committed against Jews during the Holocaust  The World Jewish Congress reports that there were 428 312 Jews in Romania in 1947  but mass emigration during the British Mandate of Palestine and later Israel left only 144 236 Jews in Romania by 1956  Today  Romania  s Jewish population has dwindled to between only 9 000 and 15 000       The Jewish cemeteries in Prgu Frumos and Pdou Ilaoei were created with the intention to memorialize the victims of concentration camps  However  the cemeteries   land is continually under attack by local authorities who confiscate the property for development purposes  In many instances  local farmers devoid of any government authority seize significant chunks of the cemeteries  The cemeteries   headstones are also in dire need of restoration as many are in a state of deterioration          To counter the destruction of these historic cemeteries  a solution must be implemented that protects the sanctity of these final resting places while responding to the legitimate needs of nearby communities     said Senator Schumer            Below is the letter Senator Schumer sent to Romanian President Traian B    sescu today      The Honorable Traian B    sescu  President  The Republic of Romania  Palatul Cotroceni   Strada Geniului nr  1 3  Sector 5   Bucuresti   Romania   Cod postal 060116      Dear President B    sescu       As you complete your visit to the United States  I write regarding the preservation of Jewish cemeteries in Romania  an issue of great concern to the Romanian Jewish community in the this country        The preservation of ancestral cemeteries throughout Europe is a sensitive issue to worldwide Jewry  and Jewish cemeteries in Romania are no exception  For many Jews in the United States  these cemeteries are the last link they have with their ancestral homeland  Unfortunately  some of these cemeteries have fallen into substantial disrepair in Romania  others are threatened by development  It has been reported to me that  in some cases the land in and around a number of burial places is being sold by local authorities as if they were vacant lots  I ask you to pledge to do what you can to protect the sanctity of these cemeteries  and to protect the heritage of Jews of Romanian descent from around the world       By the end of World War II  the Jewish population was cut in half  from 750 000 to 375 000  Today  there are a mere 9 000 Jews living in Romania  These cemeteries are vital to the memory of the rich Jewish heritage in your country  For example  the Jewish cemeteries in Prgu Frumos and Pdou Ilaoei are being threatened with destruction  These cemeteries  created for the victims of concentration camps  are having their borders continually shrunk by neighbors who are either planting crops on the property or attempting to carve pieces out of them for themselves  This is a desecration of those who lost their lives in the horrific acts of the Holocaust  In other cases  older Jewish cemeteries where the headstones no longer exist are not recognizable as final resting places  and suffer incursion as a result  Your leadership is needed to forge a solution that protects the sanctity of these final resting places while responding to the legitimate needs of nearby communities  Of course  I stand ready to provide any assistance and support that may further the progress of this essential effort        Thank you for your attention to this matter  I hope that in your visit to the United States you witnessed the lasting connection between Romania and those in America of Romanian descent       Sincerely        Charles E  Schumer  United States Senator
