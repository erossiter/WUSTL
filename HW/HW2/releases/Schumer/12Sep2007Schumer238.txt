                                     Foreclosure Prevention Resources Represent First Federal Effort To Facilitate Safe  Sustainable Subprime Refinancings Schumer Calls on Mortgage Lenders and Loan Servicers to Pump In Additional Funds WASHINGTON  DCThe U S  Senate gave final approval Wednesday to a measure proposed byU S  Senators Charles E  Schumer D NY   Sherrod Brown  D OH   and Robert P  Casey  D PA togrant 100 million in fundingtohousing non profitson the front linesofthe fight to prevent a national foreclosure crisis from the subprime lending fallout Themeasurewhichwould provide resources to government approved agencies that help negotiatebetween borrowers and lenders to keep families in their homeswas contained in the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development HUD  spending bill thatpassed thefull Senate this morning   For the millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes  these nonprofits can provide shelter from the foreclosure storm  saidSchumer the Chairman of both theJoint Economic Committee and the Senate BankingSubcommittee on Housing  This investment will pay for itself many times over  through the avoidance of foreclosures and the pain and suffering they cost this country  both in economic and non economic terms But government alone cannot solve this problem  It will require a major commitment by others as well  particularly those banks and mortgage servicers which have the ability  through loan modifications and refinancings  to help homeowners avoid foreclosures   These funds will help thousands of families stuck in bad subprime loans  but there is much more work to be done  Senator Brown said  It is not just the economy and speculation that are behind todays crisis  but deceptive marketing by too many unethical mortgage brokers  We need tougher regulation of the industry  and we needed it yesterday   I have heard the heartbreaking stories of Pennsylvanians who have had the American dream turn into a nightmare as they lost their homes in the subprime mortgage crisis  saidSenatorCasey By helping those who are trying to keep people in their homes  this bill can have a profound effect on millions of families   Thefunding will benefit HUD certified nonprofitprograms thatperform one on one counseling withhomeowners and perform negotiations with a variety of mortgage industry stakeholders  Specifically  the  100 million in funding will allow these non profits to    Increase training and capacity to focus on default and foreclosure prevention counseling   Seek out and engagehomeownersto ensureearly intervention  Improve the communications between homeowners and servicers lenders  and   Negotiate modified loan agreements or refinances    The measure is particularly timely given the2 million homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages whoare expected toexperience payment shocks as their loans reset in a weakening housing market  Acting to prevent these foreclosures is not only important from the perspective of protecting entire communities  but it also makes good economic sense  Foreclosures can cost up to  80 000 for all stakeholdershomeowners  neighbors  cities and local governments  lenders  and loan servicers  Meanwhile  estimates suggest that foreclosure prevention counseling can cost as little as  1 000 per household    The initiative by Sens  Schumer  Brown  and Casey has been welcomed by the nonprofit entities  which have seen demand for their services soar in recent months  Among the groups supportive of the effort are  National NeighborWorks Association  Center for Responsible Lending  Consumer Federation of America  CFA   National Community Reinvestment Coalition  NCRC   andAssociation of Community Organizations for Reform Now  ACORN     Schumer  Brown and Casey first proposed the measure last May  at the same timethey introduced the Borrower s Protection Act that would impose first of its kind controls on the largely unregulated broker industry    Because there are so many distressed homeowners right now  the non profits are overwhelmed  Theyve already received more calls for help this year than they did all of last year  and things are likely to get worse before they get better  The non profits simply do not have the resources to deal with this crisis  Schumer said   In a letter to federal financial market regulators last month  Schumer sought the regulators  help in jawboning industry players from mortgage lenders to loan servicers to contribute still greater resources to the nonprofit groups  In addition in a personalmeeting withCountrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo last week  Schumer urged the companyto consider committing  250 million in funding to the groups  Both the Bush administration and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke have bothexpressed support for the work that these nonprofits are doing to prevent foreclosures
