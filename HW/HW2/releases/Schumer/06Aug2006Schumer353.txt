IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 6  2006 Schumer Reveals  New Scam Preys On Poorest And Most Vulnerable  Air Conditioners  Refrigerators  TV  s And Ovens Rented To Poor At 250  Mark Up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rent to Own Industry Promotes Deceitful Lease Agreements that Charge Customers  1 247 for a  350 Television   Rent to Own is a Multi Billion Dollar Industry that Sells Basic Household Goods by Making Low Income Customers   Lease    Items on a Weekly or Monthly Basis Until they have Fulfilled their Contract and Own the Item   Schumer Introduces Plan to Require Renegade Industry to Abide by State Usury Laws  and Calls for Tougher Enforcement Regulations and Better Disclosure for Customers U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed a new survey that showed New York City  s Rent to Own  RTO  industry uses deceitful lease agreements to grossly overcharge the city  s most vulnerable residents for common household goods  The Senator  s study exposed the RTO industry  s practice of charging excessive interest rates in New York and using misleading marketing tactics to prey on uninformed customers  The RTO industry targets New York consumers who lack the disposable income and access to credit cards to purchase basic household goods at competitive retail prices  These customers  in turn  are forced to pay astronomical prices for televisions  air conditioners and computers that are up to 256  higher than their recommended retail prices  To control this lightly regulated industry  Schumer today announced a plan that would force the RTO industry to better disclose its prices and hidden fees and abide by state limits on interest and financing charges        For too many years  Rent to Own industry has preyed on New York  s most vulnerable consumers     said Senator Schumer    Like highway bandits  these companies search out helpless consumers who desperately need basic household goods and milk them out of hundreds  and sometimes  thousands of dollars  Our plan will rein in this renegade industry and give New York consumers better prices  more knowledge  and  ultimately  more purchasing power          The Rent to Own industry is one of the country s fastest growing industries with 8 300 stores nationwide  2 7 million customers and  6 6 billion in revenues  RTO profits by having customers   lease    items such as appliances  computers  televisions and furniture on a weekly or monthly basis until they have fulfilled their contract and own the item  An air conditioner with a market value of  279 typically requires 30 weekly payments of  25 99  or a total of  779 70 when the lease has been completed  The additional  500 a customer pays for the air conditioner represents a 179  mark up from the market value price  RTO stores are often exempt from complying with state usury ceilings claiming that their fees are based on leasing charges  However  studies have shown that the industry is marketing the dream of ownership to its customers with 86  of RTO customers signing contracts with the expectation that they will eventually own the item   Studies by the Federal Trade Commission have shown that more than 70  of all RTO customers end up fulfilling their contracts and owning the goods they rent       In 1986  New York State passed a watered down law regulating the Rent to Own industry  The law establishes that charges are exempt from small loan usury caps and are not considered interest   While the law intended to cap the final rent to own prices at 200  above the  cash price  of the item  it doesn  t bar stores from setting their own  cash price  for those items  For instance  a Toshiba 27    television that typically sells for  349 00 is sold outright by Rent A Center in New York for a   cash price    of  623 00  This allows RTO stores to skirt the spirit of the law and charge consumers well in excess of the 200  ceiling         In New York City  the Rent to Own industry is dominated by the Rent A Center chain  Schumer  s office conducted a survey from late June to early August that documented the rental price information for 29 of the 38 local Rent a Center stores in the five boroughs  Brooklyn  8  Queens  7  Manhattan  5  Bronx  6  Staten Island  3   The study shows how Rent A Center almost exclusively operates stores in New York  s disenfranchised neighborhoods where local residents lack the economic means to shop at competitive retail stores  The study also demonstrated a concerted effort on the part of Rent A Center to skirt the spirit of the New York State s RTO law by setting its own   cash price    well above standard competitive retail prices and by being allowed to consider charges as fees  not interest        The study focused on the   cash prices    and lease contracts for four regularly rented household items including a Toshiba DF46 27    television and a Whirlpool ACM122PS air conditioner  Out of the stores which offered accurate price data for the television  most stores cited a lease plan consisting of 78 weekly payments of  15 99  Customers that fulfilled the entire duration of the lease would pay an overall price of  1 247 00  an egregious 256  markup from the  349 99 retail price listed on Toshiba  s official website   Out of the stores which offered accurate price data for the air conditioner  most stores cited a lease plan consisting of 30 weekly payments of  25 99  Customers that fulfilled the entire duration of the lease would pay an overall price of  779 70  a staggering 179  markup from the  270 00 retail price listed on Whirlpool  s official website       Today  Senator Schumer announced plans to introduce sweeping Federal legislation to reform RTO outlets sales practices and disclosure requirements  The main provisions of The Renter  s Rights Act of 2006 includes the following measures            All RTO outlets would be required to disclose  the cash price of item  an itemization of services offered under the RTO contract and the price of each service  annual rental price percentage rate of item under contract  the incremental  weekly  monthly  payment applicable under the contract  total payments needed to achieve ownership  specification of whether product is new or used  The disclosure would have to be on all products in stores and on all advertising material             All fees assigned to RTO transactions would be considered interest  not leasing charges  As such  RTO sales could not assess interest charges in excess of the interest charges that may be charged under the laws of the state in which the seller is located  In New York State  interest is considered criminally usurious when it exceeds 30  per year            Work towards establishing a standard cash price of items sold in RTO stores  The prices would be representative of merchandise offered within the area so that consumers knew if baseline retail prices were being artificially inflated in RTO stores  This measure would crack down on New York RTO outlets who regularly inflate prices to comply with the 200  ceiling               The following Federal laws would apply to all RTO Transactions  Truth in Lending Act  Equal Credit Opportunity Act  Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  Fair Credit Reporting Act  Greater oversight and accountability could be achieved if they were             Consumers would have the right to terminate at any point in the contract AND the termination fees cannot exceed 5  of contract price and must be disclosed in the contract       In addition to charging astronomical   rental    fees  RTO frequently sells used goods as new  incorporates deceptive add on fees and studies have documented their use of aggressive repossession tactics when consumers are late with payments  The stores are located largely in underserved neighborhoods  The Federal Trade Commission has found that 31  percent of RTO customers are African American  73  had a high school education or less  and 59  had household incomes less than  25 000  The average RTO customer rented an average of 2 5 items of merchandise per year over the last five years  Rent to Own customers typically have poor or no credit ratings         Over the past two decades  the RTO industry has lobbied legislatures in 45 states to pass law that treats rent to own as a lease  Despite RTO  s intense lobbying  New Jersey  Vermont  Minnesota  Wisconsin and North Carolina have successfully protected consumers against the RTO industry by treating rent to own sales as small loans and requiring them to comply with usury ceilings  APR disclosures and other consumer protection provisions       Schumer was joined at the event today by New York State Assemblyman James Gary Pretlow  D Mount Vernon  Yonkers   Pretlow is the author of Assembly Bill 592 which would limit many of the egregious and onerous tactics utilized by the Rent to Own Industry
