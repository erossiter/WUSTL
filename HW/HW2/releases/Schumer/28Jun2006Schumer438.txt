IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 28  2006 With Emergency Rooms Dangerously Overcrowded  Schumer Reveals Upstate NY Hospitals Short 6 000 Nurses    Could Limit Vital Health Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Upstate NY Struggle to Find Qualified Nursing Instructors Key Factor in Nursing Shortage   Schumer Unveils New Bill to Encourage Retiring and Inactive Nurses to Become Teachers in Order to Address Major Shortfall   Schumer  Nurses are Our First and Last Line of Defense in an Emergency    Schumer details county by county impact of the shortage  Capital Region is short 830 nurses  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that upstate New York hospitals are facing a massive nursing shortage that could compromise health care and medical treatment in the event of an emergency or a bird flu outbreak   Schumer released a new  showing that that there are 70 500 nurses currently working in upstate New York hospitals  6 100 less than are needed to meet demand  according to the Department of Health and Human Services   Schumer said a major cause of this nursing shortage is that there are not enough nursing teachers available to teach and train new nurses   Nearly 80 percent of New York nurse training programs reported lack of faculty as the main reason for turning away qualified applicants        New York nurses are our first and last line of defense in an emergency     Schumer said     Fewer nurses mean longer shifts  longer waits to see doctors and nurses  longer response times to in patient emergencies  and too few hands on deck during a crisis  If we don t aggressively take steps to recruit  educate  and retain more nurses  patients will not be able to expect the level of care they ve come to rely on  That s not something anyone wants to see  and we need to stop the shortage before it gets even worse        Schumer  s report  based on data from the University at Albany and the Department of Heath and Human Services  showed that upstate New York hospitals could be dangerously understaffed in an emergency   Schumer estimated that hospitals need 76 681 full time equivalent nurses to meet health care demands and fully staff hospitals   However there are only 70 580 actively employed nurses  which is 6 101 short of what is needed to meet demand   In 2004  72 percent of hospitals nationwide reported a shortage of registered nurses       A lack of well trained registered nurses has created a crisis situation at emergency rooms in upstate New York and across the country   A study by the American College of Emergency Physicians gave New York State a grade of C  for its ability to meet the emergency care needs of its residents   Though this grade was above the nationwide average  New York ranked 49 out of 50 in the number of emergency departments per million people       Schumer said one of the primary causes of the nursing shortage in upstate New York was a lack of qualified and experienced faculty to train new nurses   According to a survey conducted by the University at Albany  nearly 80 percent of the RN education programs in New York reported lack of faculty as the main reason for turning away qualified applicants      Schumer also said that in every region in upstate New York  there are more people with nursing licenses than are currently working as nurses  meaning there are thousands of upstate New Yorkers who  with the right training and incentives  could become nursing teachers and  train the next generation of nurses   Schumer said many nurses leave the field early because of the stress of the job   According to the New York State Nurses Association  58 6  of RN  s who intend to quit the profession within the next 12 months cited   stress    as one of the top three reasons for leaving   Three out of 10 hospital nurses planning to leave nursing listed stress as the top reason for leaving  In addition  the average RN is 47 years old  up from 44 and 41 in 1995 and 1985  meaning more and more nurses are getting closer to retirement       This is how the nursing shortage and the surplus of trained nurses who are not working in the field break out across upstate                   While 10 426 nurses need to be employed in the Capital Region to meet health care demands  there are only 9 596 full time equivalent nurses currently working  830 less than is needed   There are 12 997 licensed registered nurses in the Capital Region  3 381 more than are currently working in the field                      While 9 883 nurses need to be employed in Central New York to meet health care demands  there are only 9 096 full time equivalent nurses currently working  787 less than is needed  There are 12 266 licensed registered nurses in Central New York  3 170 more than are currently working in the field                      While 12 536 nurses need to be employed in Rochester    Finger Lakes Region to meet health care demands  there are only 11 540 full time equivalent nurses currently working  996 less than is needed  There are 14 437 licensed registered nurses in the Rochester    Finger Lakes Region  2 897 more than are currently working in the field                      While 4 919 nurses need to be employed in North Country to meet health care demands  there are only 4 527 full time equivalent nurses currently working  392 less than is needed  There are 6 387 licensed registered nurses in the North Country  1 860 more than are currently working in the field                      While 19 839 nurses need to be employed in the Hudson Valley to meet health care demands  there are only 18 260 full time equivalent nurses currently working  1 579 less than is needed  There are 31 569 licensed registered nurses in the Hudson Valley  13 309 more than are currently working in the field                      While 6 271 nurses need to be employed in the Southern Tier to meet health care demands  there are only 5 773 full time equivalent nurses currently working  498 less than is needed  There are 7 820 licensed registered nurses in the Southern Tier  2 047 more than are currently working in the field                      While 12 807 nurses need to be employed in Western New York to meet health care demands  there are only 11 788 full time equivalent nurses currently working  1 019 less than is needed  There are 18 914licensed registered nurses in Western New York  7 126 more than are currently working in the field        In order to address this critical shortfall in professional nurses and nursing faculty  and draw qualified nurses no longer working in the field back into the nursing profession  Schumer announced he is introducing the Brining Nurses Back Act of 2006   The legislation would provide financial incentives and create an educational preparation program for qualified registered nurses who are no longer at the bedside  including former emergency room and military nurses  to become faculty at nursing schools in Upstate New York and around the country         Schumer s legislation will capitalize on the existing knowledge of former nurses by encouraging them to teach at understaffed nursing schools  relieving the bottleneck of individuals who are willing  but unable to become nurses  While hospitals throughout the state are instituting a variety of practices to improve the workplace environment  nursing can be a demanding profession   Specifically  Schumer s legislation would        Provide scholarships to Registered Nurses with Masters  or Doctoral Degrees who have retired from clinical practice to complete additional education in order to teach in schools of nursing   Individuals who complete the program will be matched with a participating nursing school and will agree to serve in a faculty position for at least three years   For each of these three years  the participant will receive a federal stipend of  10 000 a year on top of his or her annual salary           Provide scholarships to Registered Nurses with Bachelors  Degrees who have retired from clinical practice to enter a preceptorship program sponsored by a local accredited school of nursing   Individuals who complete the program will receive a stipend of  5 000 a year on top of their annual salary   Preceptors are experienced nurses who serve as mentors  providing significant institutional support for brand new nurses who slowly grow into their responsibilities over a several week period   One study published in the Journal of Continuing Education in Nursing found that nurse preceptors increased the retention rate for new nurses from 30  to 77      In addition  Schumer is calling on Senators Arlen Specter  R PA  and Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman and Ranking Member of the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Committee to approve additional funding for the Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2001  which Senator Schumer is an original cosponsor of  and other nursing programs  In his letter to the Senators  Schumer said the programs provide vital scholarships for nursing students  partial loan repayment and cancellation programs  specialized training for nurses  and nurse retention programs
