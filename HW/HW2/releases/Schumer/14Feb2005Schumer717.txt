IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 14  2005 On Heels Of Yesterday  s Mall Shooting Schumer Renews Call On President To Re Enact Assault Weapons Ban                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Local man opened fire in Hudson Valley mall yesterday using a military style assault weapon used to kill large quantities of people  1994 Assault Weapons Ban written by then Congressman Schumer expired in September  2004   Assault weapons ban passed on the heels of the LIRR massacre  Since its expiration less than 6 months ago  gun manufacturers are once again able to produce and sell assault weap Yesterday  s shooting at a Hudson Valley shopping mall might have been prevented had Congress and President Bush re enacted the Assault Weapons Ban that expired last September  US Senator Charles E Schumer warned today  Schumer renewed his call to pass the law  which he wrote as a Congressman and passed on the heels of LIRR incident  and which had succeeded in slashing the rate of banned assault weapons used in crime by nearly two thirds        When the ban expired last year  gun manufacturers were once again able to produce and sell 19 types of military style assault weapons including TEC 9s  and AK 47s that have only one purpose    to kill human beings  Yesterday  s shooting is believed to have been promulgated by the use of a military style assault weapon         Ten years ago  Congress took the historic step of banning the sale of assault weapons in the United States and assault weapons crimes dropped dramatically  But sadly  Congress and the President last year allowed the ban to wither away  and the result is that assault rifles that kill human beings are now much more readily available     Schumer said    Yesterday  s horrific shooting is only the latest example of a military style assault weapon being used to shoot large numbers of people    and we need to renew the assault weapons ban so that yesterday doesn  t repeat itself over and over again          Yesterday  a gunman opened fire on the Hudson Valley Mall  wounding two and forcing the mall to be evacuated  The type of gun and assault likely would have been included under the assault weapons ban  Schumer said today that the shooting served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lie ahead without regulation by the Federal government         No community is immune from tragedies like the one New Yorkers felt yesterday  The world has changed immensely since 9 11 and we need the assault weapons ban now more than ever     said Schumer    Enough is enough  we must reenact the ban now  before any more of these weapons get into the wrong hands          Communities in New York have been changed enormously over the years because of gun crimes  In the 1970 s and 1980 s many parents feared sending their children outside  even cops were outgunned by thugs carrying military style assault weapons  Then  on December 7  1993  Colin Ferguson opened fire with a 9MM pistol equipped with a high capacity magazine on a 5 33 p m  rush hour eastbound LIRR train traveling between New Hyde Park and Garden City  Ferguson s shooting rampage killed six and injured more than a dozen others  After three Garden City men subdued Ferguson  the train stopped at the Merillon Avenue LIRR station around the corners from the Courthouse where Schumer and the families gathered today  A jury found Ferguson guilty of the murder and he was eventually sentenced to six consecutive life sentences   about 200 years in prison        Schumer wrote the original 1994 assault weapons ban which banned the manufacture of 19 types of common military style assault weapons and an additional group of firearms  which have two characteristics common to military style assault weapons  protected some 670 hunting and other recreational rifles for use by law abiding citizens  and gave police officers and other law enforcement officials the right to use and obtain newly manufactured semi automatic assault weapons  The law had helped prevent instances when law enforcement is outgunned by perpetrators        Schumer and Senator Diane Feinstein  D CA  then introduced new legislation last spring to re authorize the 1994 assault weapons ban by striking the sunset date from the original law  In addition  the legislation introduced would have closed a loophole in the 1994 law  which prohibits the domestic manufacture of high capacity ammunition magazines  but allows foreign companies to continue sending them to this country by the millions  A measure that would have closed this loophole passed the House and Senate in 1999 by wide margins  but was bottled up in the 1999 Juvenile Justice conference report due to an unrelated provision  Since 1994  the ATF has approved the importation of almost 50 million high capacity ammunition magazines from some 50 countries       Schumer said the original bill had succeeded in meeting its goal of making assault weapons more difficult to obtain  In 1995  the first year that the ban went into effect  assault weapons represented 3 57 percent of all crime guns recovered from crimes  By 2002  assault weapons represented only 1 22 percent of the number of guns used in crimes  The Justice Department data shows a steady decline of criminal firearm traces in which the 19 banned assault weapons were used  Assault weapons were nearly three times as likely to be recovered in a crime in 1995 than last year
