IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 22  2007 Schumer Reveals  USDA Recently Eliminated Inspectors At Beech Nut s Canajoharie Plant  Leaving Lone Inspector Unable To Keep Pace With Company s Growth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          A Recent Decision to Reduce Inspectors at Beech Nut s Canajoharie Plant is Slowing Down Production and Could Hamper Plans for Future Expansion   Senator Requests USDA Immediately Assign a Second Full Time Inspection Shift So Beech Nut can Operate at Peak Performance                                                                                                                              Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that current operations  and the future growth  of Beech Nut Nutrition Corporation  Beech Nut  are jeopardized due to the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  slashing the number of inspectors at the company s Canajoharie plant  Concerned that Beech Nut s recent growth  including last week s announcement that it will open up a new headquarters in Montgomery County  will be stymied by the lack of on site inspectors  today Schumer sent a letter to the USDA requesting that it immediately assign a second full time inspection shift to the Canajoharie plant          The USDA needs to immediately assign a second shift of inspectors to the Canajoharie plant so Beech Nut can continue to run at peak performance   said Senator Schumer   For decades  Beech Nut has helped anchor the Mohawk Region s economy  and with last week s announcement that it will construct a new headquarters in Montgomery County  we must keep this momentum surging   said Senator Schumer        The process by which Beech Nut produces its meat based baby food must be monitored by USDA inspectors  However  USDA recently decided to eliminate all  minimal  and  limited  inspection services   a practice in place since the 1970s   leaving Beech Nut with only one full time inspector and no additional coverage  which could curtail the plant s current operations and plans for future growth        Beech Nut s rigorous baby food production schedule  including preparing  cooking  cooling and packaging it in a sanitary fashion  requires two full time inspector shifts or other equivalent staffing arrangements  Before the recent reduction of inspection services  the Canajoharie plant received inspection over the course of their 20 hour production schedule  The USDA did this by combining a single full time inspector shift with a combination of overtime and  limited coverage    The current arrangement has left them with a single inspector  creating inefficiencies and forcing Beech Nut to drastically alter how their products are made        After surviving competition and floods  Beech Nut is poised for growth and the USDA must do all it can to help that happen  It makes no sense to reduce inspection shifts at exactly the moment when Beech Nut is set for take off   said Schumer        However  this April  the Food Safety and Inspection Service  FSIS  issued a notice suspending its longtime practice of providing roving inspectors outside of the standard business day  While the decision was designed to require more intensive inspection services  Beech Nut is unable to qualify for additional full time shift coverage because it only produces meat based foods three days a week  And USDA has indicated that it would only add a second shift if Beech Nut s Canajoharie plant was active for a full  five day work week        In his letter to the USDA  Schumer wrote   denying Beech Nut s request on this basis reflects an unfortunate failure to understand the unique needs of their facility  With over 100 different products in production  several of which do not require USDA inspections  Beech Nut would have to change their entire business operation just to enter a production schedule that needed inspectors 5 days a week  The company estimates that they will suffer a loss of at least  3 million if they do not have coverage equivalent to its previous level         Beech Nut has been an economic lynchpin for Montgomery County and the entire Mohawk Valley Region since 1891  Last week  Beech Nut announced it will build a 650 000 square foot processing and packaging plant in Florida  Montgomery County  N Y   and relocate its corporate headquarters from St  Louis to the new building  It also announced its intention to add an additional 135 jobs to the 356 who are currently employed at their facility  Over the last several years its production has increased by nearly 50   and in the next several years it is hoping to increase its production by an additional 25   which could create additional jobs and millions of new investment in the region        Schumer has long been instrumental in Beech Nut s success in upstate New York  In the summer of 2006  Schumer worked with Empire State Development Corporation and the U S  Small Business Administration  SBA  to construct an incentives package to save Beech Nut s Canajoharie plant after it suffered severe flood damage  In February 2000  H J  Heinz  Inc  and Beech Nut s parent company  Minot Holding Corporation  announced a planned merger which threatened operations at both the Canajoharie and Fort Plain production plants  Schumer intervened with the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and asked it to delay approving the merger until Heinz completed its review of the local plants  One week later  the FTC began its ultimately successful effort to block the merger  In the winter of 2002  Schumer also helped launch a new product line  called First Advantage  at the Canajoharie Plant
