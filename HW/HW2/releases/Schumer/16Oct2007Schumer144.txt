IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 16  2007 Schumer Reveals  DHS Incompetence Delaying Vital Programs Designed to Prevent Terrorists For Working at Airports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 DHS Still Not Doing Thorough Background Checks on All Airport Employees and Program to Give Tamperproof Biometric ID s to Workers is Years Delayed Schumer Blasts DHS for Again Bungling and Underfunding Programs Designed to Keep Airports and Travelers Safe and Secure Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer blasted the Department of Homeland Security for allowing two vital programs designed to prevent terrorists from obtaining employment at airports in New York and across the country to languish  Schumer said that  had they been up and running  these programs  including measures to fully background check all airport workers and distribute tamper proof biometric identification cards to employees  the member of the Sir Lankan terrorist group Tamil Tigers would probably not have been able to hold down three separate jobs at the airport and dozens of people working on behalf of a massive drug cartel  Schumer today criticized DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff for leaving this gaping hole in aviation security wide open for years and called him to immediately report back to congress on why the programs have been delayed and what steps DHS is taking to get them fully implemented   It is hard to believe that more than six years after 9 11 it is possible for terrorists and people working for a drug cartel to wind up working at an airport  These are gaping holes in our security that the American people demanded we close and six years later DHS is still bean counting and twittling its thumbs  DHS needs to take immediate steps to get these two vital programs fully up and running to prevent another embarrassing and potentially dangerous incident   According to a scathing 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office  DHS still has not addressed its primary goals when it comes to protecting secure areas of airports and air cargo  According to the GAO  in addition to failing to implement systems to adequately screen air cargo  DHS has also failed to establish standards to control access to secured areas of airports in New York and across the country    Schumer also said that there is no standard  tamper proof  biometric identification card for airport workers which would prevent a terrorist from sneaking onboard a flight without a boarding pass  or breaking into secure areas  Last year  TSA began to roll out its plan for a biometric identification card for seaport workers  but there is no plan to extend the Transportation Worker Identification Credential  TWIC  program to the aviation sector any time soon  TWIC is a tamper resistant credential that contains biometric information about the holder which renders the card useless to anyone other than the rightful owner  TWIC can verify the identity of a worker and help prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing secure areas  Airports can employ thousands of people  and it is essential that there be a standard  tamper proof identification card to keep terrorists out of sensitive and secure airports  The program was originally scheduled to be deployed years ago at ports  airports  and transportation facilities across the country  but it had been repeatedly delayed due to political wrangling and mismanagement by DHS   Schumer also said the program was also intended streamline checks of criminal background files  terrorist watch lists and immigration status for truckers  stevedores  rail and airport terminal employees  and other transit workers  among others  The new biometric data would make it virtually impossible for anyone other than the cardholder to use the ID   Management turnover and indecision delayed prototype testing until late 2004  Instead of the 200 000 cards planned for the pilot program  only 4 000 were issued  even as the cost rose from  12 million to  23 million   TWIC has also been held up because of political wrangling and deal making  Rep  Harold Rogers  R Ky    chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the department  insisted that the TSA adopt technology currently used for U S  green cards  which are produced in his district  The TSA paused to complete a study concluding that its alternative to the green card technology was superior  Prototype card production was delayed again in 2005 so it could be moved to the Kentucky plant   When cant even fully trust our federal security officers and airport employees  we have a problem  Schumer said   Schumer today sent a personal letter to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff demanding that he immediately report back to Congress on why the program has been delayed and what his department will do to get them up and running once and for all
