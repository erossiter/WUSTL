                                    Last Week Chairman Arlen Specter and Sen  Bill Nelson Joined Schumer to Introduce Legislation to Criminalize Practice that Was Used Against Gen  Wes Clark and Millions of Others   MoveOn org Civic Action Delivers 39 500 person signed Petition to Lawmakers Urging Passage of Schumer Specter Nelson Bill   Thieves Steal and Sell Entire List of Every Call Cell Phone Owner has Made  Private  Bus Last week U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer introduced legislation to combat the growing black market of cell phone call logs stolen and sold by criminals  The bipartisan Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006  was introduced with Senators Arlen Specter  R PA   Bill Nelson  D FL   and others and it will criminalize the practice of both stealing and selling these records for cell phone  landline and voice over Internet protocol  VOIP  subscribers  Gen  Clark  s personal cell records were purchased online recently and Moveon org Civic Action has collected over 39 000 signatures online for a petition supporting the Schumer Specter Nelson bill  Verizon Wireless and T Mobile have both endorsed the Schumer Specter Nelson bill as well          Stealing someone  s private phone records is absolutely a criminal act and the fact that it can  t be prosecuted as one has got to change     Sen  Chuck Schumer said    Stealing a person  s phone log can lead to serious personal  financial  and safety issues for just about any American          Sen  Bill Nelson stated      This bill is essential to protecting our personal privacy  We must protect Americans   phone records from strangers or we soon will have no privacy left          Gen  Wes Clark said    When my phone records were purchased for less than a hundred dollars I joined millions of Americans who worry about the invasion of their privacy  People should be able to trust that their privacy is being respected and protected by everyone from the government to our internet and mobile phone service providers  Clearly this is not always the case            Legal remedies are required to stop this  Some companies are using the courts to outlaw this practice  Verizon and Cingular have effected restraining orders and T Mobile is suing these online poachers  Clearly this is an example of the positive good government can do  I urge people to contact their Senators and urge the passage of The Schumer Specter Bill to restore integrity to the system and give people back a reasonable degree of privacy     Gen  Clark continued       Adam Green of Moveon org Civic Action said    In Sen  Schumer  the people of New York have someone who cares deeply about protecting their privacy and is willing to step up to the plate when leadership is needed  This is not a Democrat or Republican issue   it is about the non partisan idea that people should be able to talk on their phone without being snooped on      MoveOn org Civic Action is a 501 c  4  distinct from MoveOn s political action committee          As the first wireless company in the U S  to take legal action to protect cell phone customers  private account information from so called online data brokers  Verizon Wireless applauds the efforts of Sens  Schumer  Specter and Nelson to protect our customers  privacy from the crooks and predators who we ve been hauling into civil court  We believe this legislation will give federal prosecutors and others in law enforcement the tools they need to crack down on this despicable practice and help defend the privacy of U S  cell phone customers   said Steve Zipperstein  General Counsel for Verizon Wireless       The Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 will make it a federal offense  punishable as a felony  to obtain customer information from a telephone service provider by false pretenses or access a customer account on the Internet to obtain billing information without authorization  The bill also makes it a crime for phone company employees to sell customer information without proper authorization  The bill applies to cell  landline  and  VOIP  phone records  This bill also ensures that criminal targets cannot find out if informants are working with the police by seeing if they have been in contact with law enforcement       Under Schumer s new bill  it will be a violation of federal law to obtain someone s phone records by   1  Making false or fraudulent statements or representations to an employee of a telephone service provider    2  Making such statements to a customer of a telephone service provider   3  Accessing a customer account on the Internet without the customer  s authorization    4  Providing false documentation to a telephone service provider knowing that the document is false    Cell phone call logs are sought out for a variety of reasons  For years phone records gave been used by law enforcement and private detectives  but with the internet  gaining access to that information has gotten much easier  Websites like www locatecell com offer the service online  and with little regulation it is nearly impossible to stop        All phone records  but especially cell phone records can be of great use to criminals and the information provided through a call log provides whoever is looking with a wealth of personal data  Many call rosters can reveal the names of a cell user  s doctors  their public and private relationships  their business associates and more  While other personal information such as social security numbers which can be on public documents that are found by data brokers  the only warehouse of phone records is at the phone companies themselves       Experts say that these records can be made available through three techniques  The first is having someone that works for one of the phone companies who sells the data  Though strict rules inside most of the phone companies make this practice risky  officials say that finding someone with access to the information desired is not that difficult  The second technique is   pretexting    where a data broker or the like pretends to be the owner of the phone  In doing so  they convince the cell phone company  s employees to release the data to them       Third  as more people manage their cell phone accounts online  thieves can access the accounts on the Internet  Many cell phone companies push account holders to manage their accounts online  many of them set up the online capability in advance  many customers never access their Internet accounts  If someone seeking the information can figure out how to activate the account before the real customer does  they get unfettered access to all of the call records       Though the problem is all too common  federal law is too narrow to include this type of crime  Pretexting for financial data is illegal  but its does not include phone records      Groups that have endorsed the Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006  at press time    Verizon Wireless
