IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 16  2007 Shortage Of Top Notch Math And Science Grads Hampering Rochester Area Business And Job Growth    Schumer Unveils Groundbreaking National Initiative To Promote Math And Science Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Sweeping Legislation Would Complement Senator  s Drive to Make Rochester a National Math and Science Center of Excellence   Standing At JML Optical  Schumer Announces   Math For America   Program To Recruit Best And Brightest To Become Math And Science Teachers   In an Ideas Economy  Rochester Needs Homegrown Math and Science Talent in Order to Attract Next Generation Business    Pla With a shortage of top notch math and science graduates hampering Rochester businesses  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a groundbreaking national education initiative to complement his drive to make Rochester a math and science center of excellence   Schumer  standing with Rochester  s commercial and education leaders said the United States is falling behind other nations in math and science  and said for Rochester  upstate New York and all of America to stay on top  it is essential we improve math and science education immediately   His legislation would essentially create a   peace corps    for teachers by providing incentives for young people to teach in underserved schools         For the first time in generations  a young person in the Upstate New York doesn  t may not have look elsewhere to start a high tech career  There are opportunities right here in the Rochester area but the question remains  Will they have the skill sets necessary to take full advantage of this new economy  Right now our children are lagging behind and we must act quickly before it is the businesses that start to look elsewhere          The U S  National Science Foundation cites that high tech industry employment grew by 50 percent between 1990 and 2002  and the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that U S  demand for science and engineering workers will grow at least three times as fast as the overall economy in the next ten years         Going back to the opening of the Erie Canal  continuing with growth of Kodak  Xerox  and Bausch and Laumb into international technology companies  Rochester has been at the cutting edge of industry in the United States  Today  Rochester is still a major science and technology center and is well positioned to develop into a globally recognized leader in science based industry  Rochester was ranked 1st among 125 cities in the world for patent registration  according to the World Knowledge Competitiveness Index 2003 2004  and 1st for utility patents issues per 1 000 workers according to the New Economy Index       Schumer said that as the workforce economy changes  our education focus must change with it   Ten years ago  23 percent of Rochester area jobs were in manufacturing  Today  it s 14 percent and dropping   During this decline  heavy manufacturing jobs are being replaced by high end technology jobs   In order for Rochester to compete for these new industries  the city must churn out younger workers who have the skills and educations necessary to take on these jobs   Otherwise  growing companies will look elsewhere to start their businesses and grow       Schumer also cited a recent report by the New York State Department of Education as proof positive that the federal government needs to step in and help train better teachers   Rochester  s percentages of courses that are taught by teachers who aren  t highly qualified exceeded state averages at all elementary  middle and high school levels       Schumer said that his federal legislation would perfectly complement his efforts to create a Math and Science Center of Excellence at Nazareth College   While the Center of Excellence would foster math and science education at the local and state level  Schumer  s legislation would divert much needed resources to attract younger men and women to the teaching profession   Schumer  who launched this effort one year ago in February 2006  said that he looked forward to the appointment of the center  s first director and would continue to fight to expand this vital program       Prospective teachers with strong math and science backgrounds  as well as working teachers who have solid expertise in their fields  are often lured away from teaching by more lucrative and prestigious opportunities in the private sector   In exchange for a four year teaching commitment  MSTC will provide teaching certification in a one year master  s program for individuals who are highly skilled in math and science        Retention strategies will include district level mentoring  professional development  and federal financial incentives   Under MSTC  current teachers will commit to teaching for five years and serve as leaders in their school  mentor new teachers and participate in professional development   They will also receive federal financial incentives to keep them from leaving the classroom for the private sector       MSTC is based on three unique tenets       1    National Standards for Participation  All applicants  whether aspiring or working teachers  must perform at a satisfactory level on a National Academy of Science approved standardized test of subject knowledge   In addition to strong knowledge of subject matter  candidates must demonstrate strong verbal skills as well as other attributes that are linked to effective teaching        2    Financial Incentives  During their years in the program  all corps members will receive stipends from the federal government in addition to their regular salaries   New teachers   stipends will begin at  11 000 and scale up to  20 000 during their four year teaching period  while working teachers   stipends will be set at  20 000 per year   Corps members teaching in hard to staff schools may receive enhanced stipends         3    Building Prestige and Respect Through a National Program  As members of a teacher corps  participants will experience a high level of enthusiasm and solidarity   In addition  the highly visible teacher corps will build prestige and respect for the field of math and science teaching       The President  s State of the Union address highlighted this need  but Senator Schumer and Congressman Saxton think Congress needs to go a step further   The President  s program would spend  25 million on math and science teachers  but would primarily aim to bring math and science professionals in to schools as adjunct teachers   MSTC  however  will invest in 20  of the teacher population once it has fully ramped up  and will integrate math and science experts as full time teaching staff who will be an integral part of the school community even as they provide top rate teaching       MSTC is based on a successful program in New York City called the Newton Fellowship Program  which is operated by a non profit organization called Math for America       Schumer will be joined by Mike McCusker  Sr  VP  JML Optical  Matt Hurlbutt  Exec  Dir   Rochester Works  Daan Braveman  President  Nazareth College  Christopher Dahl
