IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 13  2006 Schumer To Ground Zero Insurers  Pay Up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Reports Indicate Some Insurers May be Using New Ground Zero Deal as an Excuse to Wiggle out of Required Payments   Senator Sends Letter to Balking Ground Zero Insurers Urging Them to Make Good on Commitment    Calls on Senate Banking Committee to Investigate As a number of insurance companies that underwrote the World Trade Center have yet to categorically commit to provide the required insurance payouts necessary to rebuild the site  today Senator Charles E  Schumer sent them a letter prodding them to immediately make good on their commitments  Schumer believes that despite changes to the WTC plan under the new agreement between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Larry Silverstein  s companies  the insurers of the Ground Zero site have a legal responsibility to make their payments  citing two prior judicial judgments that say that the Port Authority is in fact an insured entity         Business as usual tactics like talking tough  threatening litigation and stalling are just not acceptable when it comes to rebuilding Ground Zero     Schumer said    The tragedy that begat this situation was an attack on our nation  making the effort to rebuild the site a national  and international imperative for New York and America  We have a plan to move forward  we have committed private and public stakeholders  what we don  t have is explicit certainty from all the relevant insurance companies that they will make the payouts necessary to finance the rebuilding          Though some of the companies have already honored their commitments to the site and others intend to honor their obligations  correspondences from some of the other companies make it clear that they may resort to tactics of delay and evasion that will seriously hamper  and perhaps even derail the rebuilding process       In his letter to the insurers  including  Allianz  Gulf  Industrial Risk Insurers  Royal and Sun Alliance  TIG  Traveler s Indemnity  Twin City  Wausau and Zurich  Schumer wrote    Simply put  without this money New York will be left with giant holes at Ground Zero  so today I ask simply that you will not try to use the new conceptual agreement between the PA and SPI as an excuse or pretext for refusing to pay what your companies owe          Implementing the Ground Zero rebuilding plan relies entirely on the ability of SPI and the PA to utilize replacement coverage proceeds to finance the rebuilding  Unfortunately  many of the insurance companies have taken issue with the new conceptual agreements  claiming that the realignment of interests may exempt them from paying out their policy  However  two prior judicial judgments regarding the World Trade Center insurance policies say that the Port Authority is in fact an insured party       On April 26th  the PA and SPI reached a conceptual agreement on a rebuilding plan for the World Trade Center site  Under this plan  SPI will develop Towers 1 and 5  but will transfer ownership of these buildings to the PA  SPI will also develop Towers 2  3 and 4  but will remain the owner in control of these buildings for the duration of their lease  This agreement was forged after thorough and careful deliberation by both the PA and SPI  and has received the backing of the Governors of New York and New Jersey  and the Mayor of the City of New York        In his letter Schumer wrote    Let me be clear  nothing has changed about the tragedy of September 11th  nor has anything changed about the job that lies ahead to rebuild what was lost at Ground Zero  The new conceptual framework only alters the relationship between the PA and SPI  the buildings that were planned still need to rise and the insurance proceeds are still critical to meeting that goal  New York  and the nation  cannot afford to delay rebuilding at this critical juncture  Therefore  I urge you to immediately commit in writing to make good on your obligations so that the rebuilding can move forward  If  for some reason  you believe this cannot happen  I wish to meet with you to hear the reasons why          Schumer forwarded the letters to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee  Richard Shelby and Paul Sarbanes  and asked them to investigate this matter  He said today that he is hopeful that these issues will be resolved in the immediate future  obviating the need for formal congressional inquiries
