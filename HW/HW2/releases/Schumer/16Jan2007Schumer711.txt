IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 16  2007 Schumer And McNulty Kick Start Renewed Effort To Reopen Competitive Licensing At Cohoes Falls    Both Reintroduce Legislation Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              With FERC Set to Discuss Cohoes Falls on Thursday  Schumer and McNulty Also Urges Regulators to Let Legislative Process Run its Course to Ensure that the Best Project Can Move Forward   Schumer  2007 is a Pivotal Year for Restoring a True Natural Landmark to Its Glory  Re Create A Tourist Attraction and Develop Low Cost Power in The Capital Region                                           Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and Congressman Michael R  McNulty  D Green Island  announced that they are reintroducing landmark legislation to reopen the competitive licensing process for the Cohoes Falls restoration project   This bill would permit the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  to consider other applications of entities interested in rejuvenating Cohoes Falls   The project  that would restore the falls to its natural beauty  protect the aquatic environment  and deliver lower cost energy to Capital Region communities and businesses  has long been stalled as the current license has simply been extended every year       The Cohoes Falls are the second highest waterfalls in New York State  Since 1911  these majestic falls have remained dry on all but the rarest of occasions    When the current power house was built  it diverted the flow of the river through a canal  which leaves a one mile stretch of the Mohawk River  including the Cohoes Falls dry on all but a handful of days a year          It  s time to open up this process  end the bureaucratic wrangling  and allow the bold endeavor of restoring the falls to its original grandeur to finally move forward     Schumer said    Cohoes Falls has the potential to be an environmental gem of the Capital Region   My legislation would break the deadlock and put restoration of the falls on the fast track toward completion  The new license is good for the next 50 years  so we owe it to future generations to get this right           This legislation is a simple  but effective way to allow FERC to consider other projects besides the same antiquated one that our constituents have been dealing with for years   The bill would give FERC the chance to at least consider a project that will produce more hydropower  restore the falls  save more fish  and bring more jobs to the Capital District   McNulty said       FERC s current regulations require it to consider only applications that were filed in 1991 as the former license was expiring   At that time Niagara Mohawk owned the facility and New York s regulated electric industry permitted NIMO to have a monopoly  and no other entity challenged for the license   After the state deregulated the industry  NIMO sold the facility  and now it has been resold several times since  In the intervening years  the Green Island Power Authority  GIPA  has proposed an alternate plan for Cohoes Falls that would completely rewater the falls from bank to bank every day of the year  while more than doubling the amount of energy that is produced at the site    The GIPA proposal would keep most of the power produced in the Capital Region  to help attract businesses and reduce municipal costs    In addition  it would include state of the art fish protection that would make the falls more environmentally friendly and help restore the fishery in the region  Yet despite these sales and the deregulation of the industry  as well as sixteen years of technological advances  FERC maintains that it cannot consider any proposal that was not filed in 1991          The bill states if a hydroelectric plant on the Mohawk River has been operating under annual licenses for 10 or more years  FERC must consider all valid license applications before issuing a new license  This language does not favor any potential applicant  but would allow entities such as GIPA to compete with the current owner  Brookfield Power Corp   a Canadian company  for the license         This relicensure process is well into its second decade   It defies logic to allow exclusive rights to the license for Cohoes Falls  and ignores potentially superior proposals from ever being considered    The new license is good for the next 50 years  so we owe it to future generations to get this right     Schumer said       Given their pending legislation  Schumer and McNulty today also wrote to the Chairman of FERC asking him to not make any irreversible decisions that would prevent the relicensing of Cohoes Falls from going through an open and fully competitive process   Schumer said FERC is expected to discuss the Cohoes Falls project at its meeting on Thursday and he specifically asked the Chairman to not extend the current license in order to allow  the legislative process a chance to resolve itself before making any long term decisions regarding this project
