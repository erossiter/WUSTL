IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 16  2006 Schumer  Joined By Mayor Bloomberg  Police Commissioner Kelly And Others To Unveil New Bill To Let Cities Use Federal Data To Trace Crime Guns On Their Streets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mayor  s Gun Crime Team Lends Full Support to Senator One Day After New York City Launch of Landmark Interstate Federal Lawsuit Against Rogue Gun Dealers   Schumer Legislation Would Give Feds Tough New Tools to Shut Down Gun Dealers Who Supply Criminals    92   of the Illegal Handguns Recovered in New York City from 1988 2003 Were From Out of State Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  joined by New York City Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg  announced his bill to allow localities to use federal data to trace guns used in crimes on their streets  Schumer  s bill gives law enforcement authorities new tools that enable them to better investigate  prosecute  and shut down the dealers that supply guns for illegal activity and allows local law enforcement to access federal gun tracing data and renew the ability of police agencies to share details with one another  allowing them to find and shut down rogue gun traffickers  The bill includes language to increase gun trafficking penalties  end restrictions on the amount of times per year the ATF can inspect gun dealers  allows gun dealers to be prosecuted under RICO    Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act    the same way that a perpetrator of organized crime is prosecuted  and require reporting of stolen guns from every state  a critical step in tracing guns         We shouldn t be tying the hands of law enforcement when they try to stop guns from making their way to our city streets  We should be giving them every available tool to fight crime   said Senator Chuck Schumer  D NY    Ninety two percent of the guns used in crimes in New York City come from out of state  Last November  one of those guns was used to kill New York Police Officer Dillon Stewart  We need to find out where illegal guns are coming from before they are used in crimes          Illegal guns plague the streets of every big city in America and we can  t tell our law enforcement agencies to fight them with one hand tied behind their backs     said Mayor Bloomberg    This bill would reverse the outrageous attempts to deny law enforcement agencies critical gun trace information that would help save the lives of innocent people and police officers in New York City and across the nation    and I want to applaud Senator Schumer for his leadership in introducing it          Gun tracing is the critical tool in shutting down gun traffickers  In addition to being able retrace the history of a gun that is connected to a crime after it is committed  it helps to identify patterns of illegal gun trafficking and shut down rogue gun traffickers who are responsible for running guns illegally from state to state  Through tracing  law enforcement can find trends of multiple sales of firearms to buyers and look for patterns of theft from licensed gun dealers  Multiple traces to the same dealer or buyer can help police find out exactly who is responsible for mass quantities of guns crossing state lines  By looking at the full picture of traces and the patterns that emerge  law enforcement is able to find opportunities to stop gun running on the supply side of the gun market  before they make their way onto our city streets       By tracing guns law enforcement is able to identify buyers  sellers  and possessors of guns and is able to identify a  straw purchaser     someone who can legally buy a firearm and is hired by someone who either is prohibited by law from doing so or does not want to be traced  Straw purchasers are usually linked to gun trafficking and identifying them and stopping them brings down gun trafficking enormously  Both dealers and purchasers of large quantities of guns used in crimes can be tracked over time and stopped through tracing databases        Until 2003  the information in the ATF s National Tracing Center was available to the public and to law enforcement  In 2003 however  Congressman Todd Tiahrt from Kansas slipped a stealth amendment into an appropriations bill to limit access to the tracing information  As a result of this amendment which has been included in House appropriations bills every year since 2003  the ATF is prohibited from releasing information about where guns come from  tying the hands of law enforcement       In an effort to combat the threat of illegal guns on the streets  today Schumer unveiled his bill to give local law enforcement access to tracing information and give them to tools to prosecute and shut down gun traffickers        Schumer  s Bill  the Anti Gun Trafficking Penalties Enhancement Act  S  2629  will            Repeal the   Tiahrt Amendment     which prohibits the ATF from releasing information from its Firearms Trace System database  even to law enforcement in many cases  The bill requires ATF to provide information from the firearms trace database when it is requested by a state or local government or law enforcement agency             Requires law enforcement agencies to report stolen guns and guns used in crime to the ATF for its database  Unlike New York  very few states require that stolen guns are immediately reported to the ATF database    making it easy to move stolen guns from state to state  because they are not tracked  The bill would make reporting mandatory for every state             Give ATF discretion to inspect the inventories of gun dealers when it is necessary  ATF is currently limited to one inspection of a dealer per year and cannot  by law  go back to a dealer if they have reason to be suspicious  This restriction permits some gun dealers  upon inspection to   lose    information and conceal the truth knowing that they wont have to worry about another inspection for at least a year             Increases the maximum penalty for gun trafficking to 20 years  Currently the maximum penalty is 10 years             Makes gun trafficking a predicate offense for a RICO violation  so that law enforcement can use the same tools to fight gun traffickers that it currently has to fight organized crime          The bottom line is  for too long law enforcement has been without the necessary tools to find and prosecute rogue gun dealers     Schumer said    This bill allows law enforcement to stop crime guns before they are used and shut down the bad apple gun dealers that sell them          According to the ATF  there were 5 766 guns submitted to the ATF for tracing in the calendar year 2004 the year for which the most recent data is available  This includes both long and hand guns  and all guns seized by combined state and local law enforcement agencies  According to New York City sources  92  of the illegal handguns recovered in New York City from 1988 2003 were from out of state sources  The top five states for origination of illegal handguns in New York City were Virginia  Florida  Georgia  South Carolina  North Carolina  Shootings and gun arrests have declined in New York City over the last three years  but there were still almost 1400 shootings in New York City in 2004 and 3 826 gun arrests  Between 2002 2004  there have been over 4500 shootings and almost 12 000 gun arrests        Senator Schumer has led the charge in Congress to expose the   Crime Gun Highway    that sends illegal guns to cities like New York from other states  Senator Schumer wrote the original 1994 assault weapons ban which banned the manufacture of 19 types of common military style assault weapons as well as other weapons with characteristics common to military style assault weapons  protected some 670 hunting and other recreational rifles for use by law abiding citizens  and gave police officers and other law enforcement officials the right to use and obtain newly manufactured semi automatic assault weapons  The law had helped protect law enforcement from being outgunned by perpetrators  The 1994 Crime Bill also added 100 000 police officers to our city streets and created the   Three Strikes You  re Out    mandatory sentencing rule       Senator Schumer worked very closely with the Clinton administration to push ATF to not only trace more crime guns  but also to start connecting the dots to identify patterns among bad gun dealers who allow the majority of crime guns out on to the streets  Schumer issued a report that used 1998 trace data to identify 137 dealers nationwide that had sold more than 50 guns traced to crime  The 13 worst dealers were the source of 13 000 traced crime guns that year  He also successfully shepherded passage of the Brady Hand Gun Violence Prevention Act  despite intense lobbying from opponents
