IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 8  2006 Schumer Slams Bush  s Sneak Attack On Social Security  Putting Privatization In 2007 Budget Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Today  U S  Senator Chuck Schumer will slam President Bush  s attempt to undo Social Security by quietly inserting privatization provisions in the massive budget proposed on Monday    Below is Schumer  s statement          Good Afternoon  Unfortunately  and to paraphrase Mark Twain  apparently the rumors of the demise of the President  s proposal to privatize Social Security were premature       About a year ago  President Bush used his State of the Union address to announce his Social Security privatization scheme  He traveled the country for months  but the more people heard about his plan  the more people who agreed it wasn  t for them       Within a few months Congress and most Americans roundly rejected the President  s privatization proposals as reckless       Only a few days ago  the President came back to Congress for his State of the Union address and we didn  t hear a peep about privatization        We were relieved       But  the President  s privatization proposal seems to be alive and well    kicking around as a lone line on page 321 of a multi thousand page budget document        Buried for few to see or question  Unlike last year  no one in the Administration  including the President himself  talked about their Social Security privatization scheme  Even as he traveled the country touting his new budget plans    there was not a word about the privatization of Social Security       This sneak attack on seniors and all those who expect to receive Social Security benefits when they retire is still reckless        While the spending cuts and tax proposals in the President  s budget are getting most of the attention     the President  s discredited and unpopular idea to privatize Social Security is still in his budget        The Administration put this proposal in through the backdoor  without any fanfare  But it  s in there       His plan would allow workers to start diverting some of their payroll taxes to private accounts starting in 2010  and cut benefits via a system called   progressive indexing          And don  t forget the   privatization tax       the President  s plan would require you to essentially   pay back    the government  in the form of a reduced Social Security benefit  for everything that workers put into the account  plus interest        You only come out ahead if your stock picks do magnificently    and most Americans are not experienced investors  There  s real risk there for almost everyone that they will end up with far less than they would get today       Plus  the President frames this as a way to get entitlements and long term deficits under control    but the truth is that his plan would add  5 trillion in debt in the first 20 years  and increase the deficit each year for 45 to 50 years        In terms of restoring solvency  his plan moves us backwards by making the system  s finances worse for decades  We will not allow the President to play retirement roulette and at the same time increase the tax burden on future generations with more borrowing       In the same way that it would be immoral from a generational standpoint for a grandparent to borrow from his grandson  s college fund to buy a big screen TV  it is immoral to borrow more trillions from future generations to finance Social Security reform  We are spending enough of our kids   money       We ALREADY HAVE a system of private accounts that don  t sop money away from Social Security    they are called 401 k s and IRAs and Roth IRAs and SIMPLE plans for small business  and on and on  We need to expand access to these programs so more Americans save for retirement        But taking the guaranteed benefit of Social Security and turning it into a new private account is mixing apples and oranges  We need to reform Social Security  but it shouldn t be turned into a new private pension plan       The President called for a bipartisan commission on Social Security in his State of the Union address  which I recommended he do last year    but if he were serious about it  he would have left Social Security privatization out of his budget        Instead we urge the President to work with Democrats on a non ideological plan to keep Social Security intact and able to serve the coming generations without adding trillions in new debt    and without budgetary sneak attacks like this one
