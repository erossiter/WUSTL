IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 18  2007 With Cases Of Diabetes Up 35 Percent Since 1999 In Upstate NY  Schumer Reveals Millions Of High Risk Patients Still Not Being Screened                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           More than One in Every 20 Upstate New Yorkers Now Battling the Effects of Diabetes  with Type 2 Diabetes  Linked to Obesity  Skyrocketing Among Kids    Improving Screening and Early Treatment Measures Could Save Taxpayers Billions    Medicare and Medicaid Don t Pull Their Weight in Catching Diabetes Early  Schumer Urges Investigation of Lives and Taxpayer Dollars Lost by Focusing on End o With the diabetes epidemic spreading across upstate New York  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed major shortcomings in federal health programs on catching and treating diabetes early on are contributing to a staggering rise in diabetes cases in New York and across the country   Schumer also today released a new  showing that cases of adult and juvenile diabetes are up more than 35 percent in upstate New York since 1999  with the number of kids suffering from Type 2 diabetes  which is often preceded by obesity  skyrocketing   Schumer today called for an investigation on how misguided policies are costing dollars and lives and detailed how the federal government has not done nearly enough to combat the illness despite this startling rise   Health economists estimate implementing an aggressive diabetes program could save  30 billion in health care costs over the next ten years         Hundreds of thousands of New York children are at risk of developing diabetes  yet we  re spending more on costly end of life care than we are on helping prevent our kids from falling victim to this life altering disease     Schumer said     The increase of diabetes in New York is real and it is happening fast  We must step in now to develop prevention plans to stop this epidemic in its tracks          Schumer today released a new report showing that the diabetes epidemic is on the rise across upstate New York   According to 2005 data from the New York State Department of Health  an estimated 473 495 upstate New York men  women  and children are currently battling the potentially debilitating disease   That number is up more than 35 percent from the 311 949 cases reported in 1999    Statewide  more than 1 2 million New Yorkers currently suffer from diabetes       Among teenagers and adolescents specifically  the numbers are particularly staggering   An estimated one in six overweight New York children and teens are considered to have pre diabetes  a condition that puts them at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes  Preliminary findings from an ongoing study by the Centers for Disease Control show that 18  of diabetes cases in juveniles are now Type 2  a stunning increase in a condition that was rarely found in children before   Studies show 15 percent of children in New York are overweight  and more than 680 000 children in New York are in danger of developing pre diabetes symptoms  The rapid increase in Type 2 diabetes in children is considered to be a direct result of the obesity epidemic among children  and experts fear that many Type 2 diabetes cases in children go undiagnosed because symptoms develop slowly   This rapid increase in diabetes in children could present unforeseen health care costs to cover the long term care of diabetes patients  in the past  the average age of diabetes diagnosis was 46        Below is how the numbers break out across upstate New York            Right now  an estimated 54 471 men  women  and children in the Capital Region suffer from diabetes  up 18 584 from 1999   Roughly 519 children in the region suffer from diabetes            Right now  an estimated 50 382 men  women  and children in Central New York suffer from diabetes  up 17 189 from 1999  Roughly 271 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 75 149 men  women  and children in the Rochester   Finger Lakes Region suffer from diabetes  up 25 639 cases from 1999  Roughly 687 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 134 203 men  women  and children in the Hudson Valley  up 45 787 cases from 1999   An estimated 1 170 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 32 245 men  women and children in the North Country suffer from diabetes  up 11 001 from 1999  Roughly 311 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 36 073 men women and children in the Southern Tier suffer from diabetes  up 12 307 1999   Row  roughly 362 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 90 970 men women and children in Western New York suffer from diabetes  up 31 037 from 1999   Roughly 810 children in the region suffer from diabetes        Schumer today said that the government has not done nearly enough to screen for and provide early treatment for diabetes   Millions of high risk patients go untested  leaving them susceptible to diabetic complications if they remain undiagnosed  Experts estimate that only two in three people with diabetes have been diagnosed  leaving millions unaware of their condition   According to a recent study by Diabetes Care  of the estimated 35 million Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older  61 percent or 21 million people  have diabetes or pre diabetes  Of the seven million Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes  between two and 3 5 million are undiagnosed  Virtually all of the 14 million Medicare beneficiaries with pre diabetes are undiagnosed  According to the NYS Department of Health  an estimated 430 000 people in New York have undiagnosed diabetes       The cost of treating diabetes continues to skyrocket as numbers of patients increase   In 2002  the American Diabetes Association estimated that national spending on diabetes care was  132 billion  A 2005 Centers for Disease Control study found that the average cost per year for treating a patient with diabetes was  13 243  compared with  2 560 for a person without diabetes  yet the federal government does not ensure that all its programs cover diabetes screenings and early intervention services        Medicaid especially is frequently cited as a culprit because states are not required to cover many early intervention services such as nutrition education   Private insurance companies are also to blame  many insurers will often cover the more than  11 000 cost of a prosthetic after a diabetes related leg amputation  but not cover preventive consultations with podiatrists that cost less than  100 and could save a patient  s leg      Schumer cited a landmark National Institute of Health clinical trial  the Diabetes Prevention Program  DPP   that showed modest changes in diet and exercise can prevent diabetes in 58 percent of people at high risk for the disease         In response to this growing epidemic  Schumer today announced a three point plan to counter the diabetes epidemic and shift the federal government  s focus toward diabetes screening  early treatment  and prevention            Target Early Screening and Prevention of Diabetes in Medicare patients   Schumer called on Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt to make diabetes screening and prevention for Medicare beneficiaries a top priority  Schumer asked the Secretary to include in his FY 2008 budget proposal an aggressive collaborative effort between the Centers for Disease Control  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  and other key agencies to find and screen the 40 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with pre diabetes             Investigation into Diabetes Service Coverage in the Medicaid program   Schumer today also called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to initiate an immediate investigation and analysis of diabetes and pre diabetes services currently covered by state Medicaid programs   Schumer also asked the GAO to examine diabetes prevalence  per patient spending  and mortality rates in each state s Medicaid program   Health economists have previously forecast that preventive measures introduced on a wide scale could save as much as  30 billion over 10 years              New Bi Partisan Initiative  Schumer today also said he has consulted with colleagues across the aisle about ways Congress could work to increase access to diabetes screening and early interventions
