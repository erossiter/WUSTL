IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 20  2005 Schumer Urges President To Fully Fund Health Services For Rochester Finger Lakes Area Vets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reported Spending Freeze Could Undermine Medical and Other Services for More than 20 000 Veterans in the Rochester Finger Lakes area and at the Canandaigua VA Hospital   Schumer Joins Senators Pushing for Full Funding for VA Hospitals US Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the Bush Administration to fully fund the Veterans Administration  VA  health care system and other services  including budgeting sufficient funding for New York  s VA hospitals and services for more than 20 000 veterans living in the Rochester Finger Lakes area  In light of recent reports indicating the Administration may intend to freeze funding for most discretionary programs  including the VA budget  Schumer warned that with factoring in inflation and population growth  this freeze amounts to cuts funding for veterans services throughout the region         At a time when our men and women are serving so bravely overseas  we all have a duty to make sure they are cared for when they return     Schumer said    This is the time to bolster vets   health care   not gut it  Especially at the Canandaigua VA Hospital   which we worked so hard to keep open so that it will continue to provide critical health services to tens of thousands of New York vets  We must ensure the VA health care system receives the funding it needs so veterans in the Finger Lakes Region get the quality health care they deserve          Recently published reports indicate that the Bush Administration plans to freeze spending in several domestic areas  including veterans health care  When factoring in population growth and the rate of inflation  a freeze could amount to spending cuts  cause higher deductibles and co payments for veterans health care and potentially curtail the eligibility of veterans for elements of their health care        Schumer said that according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs  these programs help to provide more than 260 000 New York Veterans including more than 20 000 in the Rochester Finger Lakes area   with  1 6 billion of medical treatment annually including inpatient and outpatient care at facilities and hospitals throughout the State  Schumer also released the following county by county breakdown showing the number of veterans from the Rochester Finger Lakes area who use the VA medical services every year and the value of the medical attention they receive  Specifically Schumer  s report showed the following       Click  to view chart       To fight any cuts to these critical services for New York  s Veterans  Schumer sent a letter to the President urging him to budget adequate funds for the VA health care system to ensure there is no increase in out of pocket expenses for veterans        In his letter  Schumer wrote    It is imperative that VA is able to provide high quality primary and specialty care in a timely manner  in addition to long term and mental health care for those who require it  It is already apparent that both of these will continue to be in high demand and we cannot ignore them as we shape the future of VA health care  We all have an obligation to the men and women who serve our nation to ensure that VA gets the funding it so desperately needs to meet these goals          Schumer has been a leader in fighting for New York  s veterans hospitals  In 2003  the VA released its CARES Draft National Plan which recommended closing the 70 year old Canandaigua Veteran s hospital and sending roughly 200 inpatients to more distant VA hospitals in Bath  Batavia  Buffalo  and Syracuse  Currently  the hospital administers medical services to an enrolled population of 25 000 area veterans in Canandaigua each year and cares for about 200 severely ill inpatients  In addition  the hospital employs an estimated 800 workers and is one of Ontario County s largest employers       In response  Schumer  the community  and the Congressional delegation mounted a furious campaign to keep the hospital open  Schumer convinced VA Secretary Anthony Principi to come to Canandaigua to see the hospital in person and later to include members of the Canandaigua community in the advisory panel set up to determine the fate of the hospital  Most recently  Schumer pressed the new VA Secretary nominee Jim Nicholson to continue Principi  s commitment to maintain the community panel studying the best solution for the Canandaigua VA Hospital
