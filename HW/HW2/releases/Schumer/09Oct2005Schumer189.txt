IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 9  2005 Schumer  New Finding Shows New York Dramatically Shortchanged In Mass Transit Security Funding    Over Past 3 Years  NY Share Cut In Half                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Since 9 11 the MTA Has Accrued Almost a Billion Dollars in Security Related Expenses  Feds have Paid for Less than a Quarter   Schumer    Recent Threats should be a Wake Up Call for Increased Federal Efforts Transit has become the Terrorist Target of Choice      For Every Seven Dollars Spent on Every Airline Passenger Just Over a Penny is Spent for Every Mass Transit or Rail Passenger Even amid recent reports of the most specific terror threat to New York since 9 11  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed a troubling finding  New York  s share of federal mass transit security funding has shrunk by nearly half over the past few years  Schumer  standing at the Union Square subway station  explained that the recent terror threats  though not at the highest level of credibility should serve as yet another wake up call  With New York City having ramped up their security at subways stations  the Senator discussed how subway and rail stations will require significantly more funding  To combat the scenario Schumer called on Michael Chertoff to increase New York  s share of the funding and to increase the amount allocated for mass transit security for the entire nation         The bottom line is  the soft underbelly of buses and subways and railroads are fully exposed to terrorist attacks  unless we take real steps to beef up mass transit security immediately     Schumer said    The fact remains that New York doesn  t have the resources available to do what it needs to bring our mass transit system up to snuff security wise  Its time that the Feds deliver to New York          Since 9 11  the MTA has accrued  880 million in additional security related expenses  The money is being allocated in two ways  the first is  288 million worth of immediate measures including         Hiring 200 extra police officers  total cost through 2005 is  56 million        Hiring 261 additional Bridge   Tunnel offices  total cost through 2005 is  101 million        Created the MTA PD Emergency Services Unit and Canine Unit  total cost  6 million        Security fencing  lighting  barriers  radios  bio chem detection systems and protective gear     53 million        Overtime for NYPD  MTA PD and Bridge   Tunnel office  deployment of 155 platform conductors  acquiring 10 more bomb dogs    35 in total  total cost     10 million        Installing recording cameras in 100 key stations and a pilot program to put cameras on bus routes     25 million       The MTA can use Federal Mass Transit Security Grants to cover some of the expenses listed above  They cannot use them to cover police overtime and  until Senator Schumer called for a change last month  they couldn  t use them for bomb dogs  They can now       The MTA also has approximately  591 million in long term needs for infrastructure hardening and electronic security in four major categories            Perimeter protection     25 million       Structural hardening     221 million       Electronic Security     265 million       Fire Life Safety     80 million      Over Fiscal Years 2003 2005  the New York City region  s transportation agencies  MTA  NJ Transit  PATH  NYCDOT and SI Railway   have received a total  85 2 million in Federal Mass Transit Security Grants  with approximately  73 7 million going solely to the MTA  s agencies    NYC Subway  LIRR and Metro North  The NYC region  s total share of those grants nationwide has dropped each year       The chart below shows how New York  s share of mass transit security funding has shrunk by nearly half in the past three years  going from 46  of the entire federal pot to 26   The MTA Share has shrunk for 43 2  to 21 6 percent       FY03 FY04 FY05 FY06  Nationwide  65 0 m  50 0 m  141 0 m  150 0 m  NYC Region   30 1 m  17 5 m  37 6 m  NYC Region share 46 3   35 0   26 7        MTA only  28 7 m  15 4 m  30 5 m  MTA share 43 2   30 8   21 6         Includes MTA  NJ Transit  PATH  NYCDOT and SI Railway        The MTA carries about a third of the nation  s transit riders  but last year received less than a quarter of the Mass Transit Security Funds       Schumer today called on the Department of Homeland Security to increase New York  s Share of mass transit security funding when the allocations are announced over the next few months  In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  Schumer wrote   The MTA carries a third of the nation  s transit riders  and year after year these riders are getting shortchanged when it comes to security  I respectfully ask that when you allocate the Mass Transit Security grants this year  that you will give New York at least one third of the nationwide total so that we can keep our riders safe  I do not think it makes sense that the transit system under the greatest threat should loose out year after year           Schumer also called on Chertoff to quadruple the nationwide total for Mass Transit Security for next year          For every seven dollars we spend on every airline passenger we spend just over a penny for every mass transit or rail passenger     Schumer said today    Transit has become the terrorist target of choice and these recent threats should serve as a wake up call           In July  Schumer  with a bi partisan coalition of Senators  offered an amendment to the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill which would have given  1 16 billion total for mass transit security  The amendment was not endorsed by the administration and  though it obtained majority support in the Senate  it was still rejected by a vote of 53 45  which fell short of the 60 votes needed to waive the budget cap  The House passed Homeland Security appropriations bill included  50 million more mass transit security than the Senate passed  100 million  The Homeland Security Appropriations Conference report passed the Senate on Friday and included  150 million for mass transit security grants       Schumer has repeatedly urged the Administration to augment rail and mass transit security  Schumer called for the federal government to accelerate the development of detectors for rail and subway stations  Currently  individual transportation systems in major U S  cities are developing their own detection devices  but Schumer said today that a coordinated effort funded by the federal government is needed to overcome the many technological barriers that face scientists and engineers working on such systems       Schumer is also a lead sponsor of the Transportation Security Improvements Act of 2005  S 1052  109th  which would spend over  750 million over three years for rail bus security  along with billions more dollars to beef up security for all modes of transportation across the county
