IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 15  2007 Schumer Fights To Restore Full Funding To Federal Fire Grant Program   Backs Franklin County s Call To Save Vital Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Grant Program Has Sent Franklin County Fire Departments Over  2 2 Million Since 2002   But Program Gutted In  08 Budget    Assistance to Firefighters Grants  Fund Life Saving Equipment   Training To Departments Struggling to Stay Afloat     Schumer Has Doggedly Pushed For Additional Funding For Fire Departments And First Responders After Annual Budget Cuts                         U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today pledged to fight to restore full funding to the federal FIRE grant program that has sent millions of dollars to Franklin County and North Country fire departments   Schumer has fought tirelessly each year to restore repeated budget cuts by the Bush administration to this essential program  Last week  the Franklin County Legislature passed a unanimous resolution at their meeting to support the restoration of funding to the FIRE grant program  As one of the original creators of the program  Schumer has aggressively lobbied for full funding of the FIRE grants program          New York s firefighters risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe and sound   Schumer said   We must do everything we can to give them the tools they need to protect us and keep our communities safe  We funded this bill because it can cost over  4 000 just to outfit a firefighter and up to  500 000 for a modern fire truck  People in small towns and big towns deserve the most modern firefighting equipment  We need to restore funding to this program and I m going to fight to make sure we do just that          For the fourth year in a row  the Bush Administration budget has slated the Fire Investment and Response Enhancement  FIRE  grant program to be cut   Since 2002  this program has provided over  153 million for over 1 900 grants in New York alone   During this period  fire departments in Franklin County have secured  2 270 210 and bought seven new fire trucks and a vast array of firefighting equipment  For Fiscal Year 2008  Congress has authorized  1 billion for the program   700 million more than the  300 million included in the Administration s budget proposal  This year s allotment is less than half of the  662 million for firefighter assistance grants included in the FY07 DHS Appropriations bill       Last year  Schumer launched a grassroots campaign  sending petitions to every fire department in the state  asking firefighters to join his call to restore funding   At Schumer s urging  fire departments across New York have taken advantage of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  and used funds for specialized emergency response training  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  new fire trucks  and fire prevention programs  These grants are distributed through the Department of Homeland Security s Office of Domestic Preparedness and are a main component of the federal government s efforts to aid local first responders  Schumer said since this is a program that puts life saving equipment in the hands of first responders  mobilizing firefighters across the state could be an effective way to show how critical these grants are to localities that need them         Schumer also joined with Senate colleagues in supporting an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would restore funding for the FIRE grants program  Senator Schumer and some of his colleagues sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee asking for full funding of the Assistance to Firefighter Grant program         Schumer helped create the original Grants to Firefighters Program  co sponsoring legislation in 2001 that led to its establishment  This program was passed with bi partisan support including Senator Chris Dodd  D CT   Senator John McCain  R AZ   Senator Susan Collins  R ME   and many others   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program was established to provide funding to career and volunteer fire departments and non affiliated emergency medical services providers to help with the rising costs of equipment  vehicles and training  However  soon after the program s establishment  Schumer played a central role in preventing the Bush Administration from eliminating funding for the program from the 2001 budget  Schumer also co sponsored the 2004 re authorization  which set full funding levels for the program at  1 billion in FY 2007
