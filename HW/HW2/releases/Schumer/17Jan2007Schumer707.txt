IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 17  2007 Schumer Raises Questions Over Troubling US Air Delta Takeover  Deal Could Lead To Loss Of Flights And Service And Cause New Low Fares To Spike                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With US Air Poised to Take Over Delta  Senator Reveals that Nearly 50 Percent of Flights at Most Markets Would Be Controlled by One Company    Reducing the Very Competition that Brought Down Fares in the First Place   Schumer  who has Led the Fight to Increase Low Cost Service Across Upstate New York  Lays Out Six Specific Questions that US Air Execs Must Address Before Moving Forward      U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today raised serious concerns over the prospect of US Airways taking over Delta Airlines and the effects such a takeover would have on air fares and service across upstate New York   Schumer  who has long fought to increase competition within upstate air service as a way to bring down once sky high fares  sent a personal letter to US Air CEO Doug Parker asking six specific questions about how the takeover would affect service upstate   Over the past eight years  thanks to the introduction of low fare carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest  air fares have dropped significantly and led to a resurgence in air travel at upstate airports  large and small        This takeover could cast a huge shadow over upstate air service     Schumer said    Bringing together two of the largest carriers would give this merged mega company a stranglehold on markets across upstate and we could see fares begin to rise  and flights disappear   Over the past years  with the expansion of JetBlue and Southwest  New Yorkers in droves have realized the benefits of cheap and regular airfares  The US Airways Delta merger could knock New York back onto the slippery slope of higher airfares and poorer service  I am going to take a long hard look at it before I decide how to proceed          Last November  US Air made an initial bid to take over all of Delta Airlines holdings  operations  and infrastructure   Though the offer was originally rejected  US Air raised its offer last week by about 20 percent to  10 4 billion and set a February 1 deadline for the bankrupt carrier s creditors to support its bid  A combination of Delta and US Airways would create the nation  s largest airline by passenger volume       Schumer said that one of the primary factors that leads to an increase in fares is a decrease in competition among airlines in a given market   Both US Air and Delta have had significant presences at most upstate airports for decades   Several markets throughout New York State are serviced largely by both Delta and US Airways  In some cases  the dual market share of these two airlines represents more than half of all flights  For instance  in Binghamton nearly 64  of all flights are Delta and US Airways  The combined market share is similarly high at other New York airports  Syracuse  46 3   Rochester 33   Albany 33 5   Buffalo roughly 31 percent and LaGuardia 44    At some of the smaller airports  US Air may be the only major carrier providing scheduled commercial service       In response to the growing momentum behind the takeover  Schumer today sent a personal letter to US Air CEO Douglas Parker laying out his concerns that the decrease in competition resulting from the takeover would adversely affect air fares and service upstate   Schumer wrote that    When one air carrier dominates a market  fares can quickly become unaffordable  Several carriers in a market gives the flying public more options of when and where to fly and can lower ticket prices           In his letter  Schumer spelled out six specific questions for Parker that relate to upstate air service including  what specific plans the airline has generated  if any  for air routes and ticket pricing in the New York State Air Market  what  if any  routes or flights the airline plans to reduce or increase at New York airports  especially in Binghamton  Syracuse  Rochester  Albany and Buffalo  and whether the airline plans to shrink ground  pilot and or corporate personnel levels as result of this merger   Schumer has long led the effort    which has utterly transformed upstate air travel for businesses and consumers alike    to bring new  low cost carriers like Jet Blue and Southwest to Upstate New York  In 2001  Schumer led the fight to block the merger of US Airways and United Airlines citing the deleterious effect it would have on competition in the upstate air service market   In 2003  Schumer helped to pave the way for new low fare service to Upstate New York by getting the Justice Department to block a hostile takeover of Independence Airline by Mesa Airlines  Schumer  a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  urged the Justice Department Antitrust Division to investigate Mesa s attempt to determine whether the company was engaging in anti competitive behavior  Mesa dropped plans for the takeover upon learning that the Justice Department was considering conducting an investigation  citing regulatory issues
