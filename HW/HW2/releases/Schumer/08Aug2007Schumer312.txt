IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 8  2007 Schumer Reveals  Gaping Hole in Piracy Law Allows Cheap Chinese Imports to Flood NYC Market   Costs New York Fashion Houses And Overall Economy Millions  Threatens Thousands of Jobs                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Copyright Protections Extended to Books  Movies and CDs but Doesn t Apply to Clothing Designs  Giving Chinese Counterfeiters Nearly Free Reign to Profit Off of Direct Copies and Knock Offs Schumer  Nadler  Joined Today By Well Known NY Designers Unveils New Plan to Protect Valuable Designs and Preserve New York s Title as Fashion Capitol To address the recent flood of imitation and knock off designer clothing that drains the New York economy of millions of dollars annually and threatens thousands of fashion industry jobs  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced new legislation to protect fashion designs from piracy  or the copying of unique designs  The sale of direct copies of fashion designs is currently legal as long as the item is sold without the designers label  Schumers bill would change that by extending design protection  similar to copyright protection  to original fashion designs  giving designers control over their creations  and helping protect the fashion business from losing jobs and huge revenues in New York   New York has made strides in reaching the pinnacle of the global fashion industry  and we cant cede that ground to counterfeiters and copycats who are robbing designers of hours of labor and inspiration to turn a quick profit  Schumer said today  Its illegal to copy Harry Potter for sale  and it should be illegal to copy Nicole Miller too  This gaping hole hurts the fashion industry from the top to the bottom  For the large  more affluent designers  Chinese piracy can cost them millions every year  For the young  up and coming designer living in New York  having an original work ripped off can be soul crushing and discourage them from following their dreams   America is a land of innovation and creativity in all fields  and here in New York City  that is certainly true of the fashion industry  said Rep  Nadler  Fashion is the second largest industry in New York  but there are no federal laws to fight fashion design piracy  Every knock off of an original item harms the designer  and more importantly  costs the city over  1 billion in lost taxes every year  It s high time we end this counterfeiting of the ingenuity and originality of our best fashion designers   Right now  there are no laws on the books protecting clothing designs from rampant Chinese piracy  Current copyright law now extends legal protection to many forms of creative work  including music  books  TV shows and movies  However  the same copyright protections for books  TV shows  and magazines are not granted to apparel because under the law  articles of clothing are considered useful articles  as opposed to works of art   Under current law  patentscan protect creative objects  or even ornamentation  but it is virtually impossible to get a patent on an entire article of clothing  Trademarks only protect brand names and logos  like the horseman on a Ralph Lauren polo shirt   but not the clothing itself  As a result  nothing in the law protects truly creative  innovative clothing designs    Schumer said this gaping hole in copyright law leaves New York fashion houses and fashion designers wipe open to having their designs pirated  As a result  it is now perfectly legal for an unscrupulous designer to see a new  innovative design at the Academy Awards red carpet show  and design and sell an identical knockoff the next day  This hurts the designer  and hurts one of New Yorks critical industries   The fashion industry is one of the largest industries in New York  creating thousands of jobs and generating tens of billions of dollars in annual sales  However  while New York has surged to the top of the list in global fashion design  the United States has remained one of the few industrialized nations with no traditional intellectual property protection for fashion designs   Schumer said that piracy remains a booming global business  According to the U S  Department of Commerce  American companies lose  250 billion in sales annually to sales of illegitimate goods  In addition  according to a report by New York City Comptroller William Thompson  New York City is home to a  23 billion annual illegal counterfeiting industry  causing the City to lose more than  1 billion in tax revenues each year   New York Citys Garment District and Canal Street are the two largest counterfeiting centers in the country  In the last month alone  a19 month investigation resulted in the arrest of 29 people with federal officials seizing more than  230 million in allegedly fake merchandise    Raids of warehouses in Queens and Brooklyn turned up hundreds of thousands of pirated goods  from such recognizable labels as Cartier  Coach  Gucci  Louis Vuitton  Rolex  Nike  Prada and Chanel  which were en route to Canal Street and Broadway for sale  The New York City Police Department just last year closed down 75 establishments  made 600 felony arrests  issued 6 000 summonses  and seized  18 million worth of fake goods    To protect New York fashion designers  houses  millions of dollars in economic and tax revenue  and thousands of jobs  Schumer today announced new legislation to impose first ever design protections for clothing designs  Schumers Design Piracy Prohibition Act will protect designs from being directly copied by outside sellers for three years after it comes to the market    Schumers bill will amend Chapter 13 of the Copyright Act to offer design protection for fashion designs  including clothing  handbags  belts and other accessories  The legislation will prohibit copies that are practically identical to the original design  but not those that are simply influenced by existing designs  allowing for the trickle down of designers inspiration that molds fashion and trends    In order to protect their creations  the bill will also allow an owner of a design to seek injunctive relief against infringers  petition for damages of up to  250 000  and to appeal for the destruction of all of the pirated goods  The move to protect designers creations comes as the counterfeit industrys profits are surging  with quick turnaround times allowing pirated goods to reach store shelves more quickly than the original designer wares  and with direct copies of goods appearing in mass market retailers across the country  with no credit or profit conveyed to the original designer    Schumer said the bill will not affect  and will hopefully encourage  mainstream retailers who license designers to create lines at affordable prices  bringing fashion to a wider audience and maintaining the designers control over their creation  such as the highly successful lines at Target  JC Penney and Kohls  He also said that the bill does not target inspiration  only direct copying of othersdesigns   Fashion brings thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to New York  Schumer said  Each dollar of pirated merchandise is a dollar thats taken away from New Yorks economy  It would be foolhardy and short sighted to leave our important businesses vulnerable to piracy here  especially when they could easily pick up and leave for Paris or London for more security   Schumer was joined today at the Fashion Institute of Technology by designers Nicole Miller  Narciso Rodriguez  Jeffrey Banks  Marc Bouwer and Dana Foley  as well as Stan Herman  Past President of the Council of Fashion Designers of America  CFDA   Richard Lambertson  CFDA Treasurer  and Yeohlee Teng  CFDA General Secretary
