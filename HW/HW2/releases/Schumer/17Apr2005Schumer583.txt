IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 17  2005 To Bring Gas Prices Down  Schumer Demands FTC Block Newly Announced ChevronTexaco Unocal Merger  Releases Survey Of Cheapest Gas In 5 Boroughs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Merging two of the ten biggest oil companies will drive gas prices even higher  only four oil companies remain  all in cahoots with OPEC    Schumer calls for FTC review of Exxon Mobil  Chevron Texaco  Amoco BP mergers and others to create competition and examine how to bring prices down With gas prices in New York City breaking every record in the book  as consumers pay 40 cents more now than they were paying last year at this time  and with summer just around the corner threatening to push gas prices even higher  today U S Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the FTC to block the ChevronTexaco Unocal merger and to review the Exxon Mobil merger and the Chevron Texaco mergers to see whether they can be undone  Schumer also released a survey of where to find the cheapest gas in each of the boroughs of New York City         The bottom line is  the price of gas is going way up and competition is going way down     Schumer said    Without regulating the mergers of these behemoth oil companies  gas prices will continue to go full speed ahead and nothing can rein them in          On Friday  the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at  50 49  and crude oil has been trading at above  50 per barrel for half of 2005  In addition  the average price at the pump in New York State has hit  2 33    already 46 cents higher than it was last year on this date  National average retail gasoline prices have increased to 2 25 and analysts predict that prices could increase as the summer driving season rapidly approaches  In New York City  prices average out at 2 34 which is a full 40 cents above what people in the five boroughs were paying last year       Gas prices in New York hit a record this Tuesday when they reached  2 34 per gallon and they have stayed there  This is a 9  increase over prices from a month ago and a 21  increase over prices of last year  If gas prices continues to rise at the rate they did this month  in a month  on May 17th a gallon of gas could cost  2 55  by June 17th   a gallon will cost  2 78  and by July 4th gas will cost   2 93 Just three months from now gas could break 3 00 a gallon       If current prices stayed the same for a year  the average New York driver would pay  234 more a year in gasoline over the next year and the average two car family would pay a whopping  468 more in 2005  In total  New York drivers will pay  390 767 832 more per year       In an effort to create competition to drive these already too high gas prices down  Schumer today called on the FTC to block the newly announced merger between ChevronTexaco and Unocal  The ChevronTexaco Unocal merger  like the Chevron Texaco and Exxon Mobil mergers before it  will further reduce competition in the oil industry by placing the vast majority of production and distribution resources under the control of a handful of corporate giants  Schumer also called on the FTC to look at other oil company mergers including Exxon Mobil  BP Amoco and Chevron Texaco to examine how to bring gas prices down       Today the Senator released the results of a new survey of 50 service stations in New York City today that names the lowest price gasoline in each of the five boroughs  Overall  both the lowest and highest gas prices can be found in Manhattan  The lowest gas price found in New York City as of April 15 was  1 82 at the 145th Street Service Station  232 West 145th Street  The highest gas price was  2 51 at the Mobil Station on 10th Avenue between 14th and 15th streets  The full survey is attached       If ChevronTexaco  which is already the world  s fifth largest oil company  is allowed to acquire Unocal  the ninth largest oil and gas company in the world  the resulting corporate entity would be the world s fourth largest publicly traded oil and gas company behind Exxon Mobil  BP and Shell  Following the merger ChevronTexaco would control 13 billion barrels of oil equivalent proven reserves  and would increase its oil equivalent production to 3 million barrels per day  This amount exceeds the daily production of every OPEC member with the exception of Iran and Saudi Arabia      The merger of these two companies will only intensify the dangerous level of concentration in the oil industry  Consolidation has already seriously undermined competition  leaving American consumers vulnerable to repeated and sustained spikes in the price of oil  Because if the industry  s vertical integration    the five largest oil companies in the United States control almost as much crude oil production as the Middle Eastern members of OPEC  over half of domestic refiner capacity  and over 60 percent of the retail gasoline market       Last year  with crude oil averaging  41 per barrel and working families paying exorbitant prices to heat their homes and fuel their cars  the world  s top ten oil companies made more than  100 billion in profit and in some cases posted record breaking fourth quarter earnings that were in some cases more than 200 percent higher than the previous year  This year  crude oil prices are consistently trading at above  50 per barrel  simultaneously increasing the financial burden of energy costs for working families and oil company profits         New Yorkers are getting burned by gas prices and there is no relief in sight  As we head into the summer gas prices will continue to heat up if the Feds don  t do something now     Schumer said    A shrinking number of huge oil companies not competing with each other translates to lighter pocketbooks all around  We wouldn  t let this happen in another industry and it shouldn  t happen here          Click  to view survey
