IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 11  2007 Schumer Reveals  NYC Airport Control Towers Woefully Understaffed By 30   Could Undermine Passenger Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Record Number of Retiring Controllers in 2007 and Impending New Budget Cuts Will Hurt Safety and Exacerbate Crippling Delays   After a Year Filled with Runway Scares at Airports in NYC and Nationwide  Schumer Calls on Senate to Triple Additional Funding for Air Traffic Controllers in  08 Budget   Schumer Unveils New Plan to Dramatically Boost Controller Recruitment  Training and  Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that air traffic control towers at New York City area airports are 30  understaffed and that record retirements slated for 2007 along with President Bush s new budget cuts will further jeopardize air travel safety and exacerbate crippling delays  To resolve this impending crisis  Senator Schumer today called on the Senate Appropriations Committee to triple funding in the Fiscal Year 2008 budget to boost controller recruitment  training and hiring  He also called for the repeal of new salary reductions imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  that hinder recruitment efforts in the New York City area        Air traffic controllers are the eyes and the ears of airport safety  and in 2006  we saw that a reduction in controllers results in a spike in the number of close calls and even tragic accidents   said Senator Schumer   New York s depleted air traffic control towers will become increasingly overwhelmed when it comes to safely and efficiently directing planes through the city s congested airspace  The FAA needs to stop playing Russian roulette with our air travel safety and give their controllers the first class treatment they deserve        In October  2006  a Continental Airlines Jet carrying 154 people landed on the wrong runway at Newark International Airport  serving as the latest reminder that New York s air traffic controller shortage could result in a potentially disastrous accident  Schumer warned staffing and recruitment problems are expected to only grow worse due to new FAA rules that have slashed starting pay for controllers in New York  In addition  for the Fiscal Year 2008  the Administration just cut its request from  18 2 million to  15 9 million for recruitment  training and hiring  which would only add an estimated 114 controllers nationwide        Senator Schumer today disclosed data detailing how New York control towers are perilously understaffed by 30   impairing controllers  ability to adequately manage runway traffic and prevent more near aircraft collisions  LaGuardia Airport and JFK Airport control towers currently have only 27 and 30 fully trained controllers on staff when 36 controller positions should be filled at both airports  In New Jersey  Newark International Airport and Teterboro Airport control towers have only 29 and 13 controllers when 40 and 26 positions should be filled  The New York Terminal Radar Approach Control  TRACON  in Westbury  which is responsible for controlling aircrafts that arrive and depart from the New York Metropolitan area  one of the largest airspaces in the country  is authorized to have 270 controllers but currently has only 187       A primary reason for the growing shortage of controllers is a spike in the number of retiring air traffic controllers triggered by the FAA s unwillingness to pay controllers overtime for filling in for a coworker  In the past  traditionally between 1  and 2   of the controller workforce became eligible for retirement each year  Recently  however  the percentage has increased to between 3  and 4  annually  and this year it s expected to peak at approximately 10   and then remain above 5  per year through 2011  The FAA has estimated that 7 100 controllers  approximately 45  of its current workforce  will retire over the next eight years       In the New York City area  where the cost of living is among the nation s highest  the following numbers of controllers are eligible for retirement in 2007  40 controllers at NY TRACON  6 at the Newark International Airport  5 controllers at LaGuardia Airport  and 1 at JFK Airport       The controller shortage also contributes to crippling delays at New York s airports  The city s regional airports remain among the worst in the nation in terms of on time arrivals and departures  In December 2006  according to the most recent available data collected by the federal government s Bureau of Transportation Statistics  New York s three major airports ranked 30th  29th and 28th out of 31 airports for on time arrivals at major U S  airports  Newark fared the worst  ranking 30th with a 56 5  on time rate  almost two percentage points worse than in December  2005  JFK  ranked 29th  had a 61 12  on time arrival rate  more than four percentage points worse than in 2005  And LaGuardia  ranked 28th  had a 63 64  on time arrival rate       For on time departures in December 2006  New York s three major airports ranked 29th  27th and 15th out of 31 major U S  airports  JFK  ranked 29th  had the worst on time departure rate at 67   2 5  worse than in December 2005  Newark  ranked 27th  had a 68 26  on time departure rate  And LaGuardia  ranked 15th  had a 73 52  on time departure rate        Unless we take immediate and drastic action to replenish our depleted ranks of air traffic controllers  New Yorkers can expect to spend more time waiting in airport terminals and on runways  and less time on vacation with family and friends   add Senator Schumer       Schumer today called on the Senate Appropriations Committee to triple funding and include  47 7 million in the FAA s budget for air traffic controllers  He also reiterated his call on FAA Administrator Marion Blakey to boost recruitment by increasing training benefits for prospective air traffic controllers  Prior to September 2006  air traffic controller trainees received a  30 000 salary and per diem stipend  However  under the newly imposed contract  the FAA cut their salary to approximately  17 000 per year and eliminated the per diem  Schumer recently sent a letter to Blakey asking her to restore the annual salary to last year s level and restore the per diem stipend  but is still waiting for a response       Senator Schumer has a long track record of championing air travel safety  and on September 4  2006  blasted the FAA for air traffic controller shortages in the New York City area and across the country  Schumer has long believed that continued short staffing and labor strife between the National Air Traffic Controllers Association  NATCA  and the FAA has created a serious safety situation that  with ever increasing air traffic in New York area  could one day have dire consequences       On September 28  2006  Senator Schumer announced that the FAA gave final approval for  62 million for a new air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport which will ease crippling flight delays at the airport and help controllers manage traffic on the runways in order to prevent more aircraft collisions  The current control tower at LaGuardia Airport is dilapidated  leaks water  and is equipped with outdated technology and plagued by visibility problems due to a nearby terminal that partially blocks its view
