IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 22  2007 Schumer Announces New Drive and New Legislation To Derail Disastrous Passport Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Schumer s New Comprehensive Legislation Would Set Tough Convenience and Affordability Standards and Close Loopholes that DHS is Exploiting to Rush Into New Passport Requirements   Legislation Would Create Enhanced Driver s License Pilot Program   Standing with Local Business Leaders  Senator Blasts DHS for Trying to Hurry into a Half Baked Passport Plan that Would Cripple the Cross Border Commerce that WNY Businesses Rely On Standing with Buffalo business and cultural leaders  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced new comprehensive legislation that would ensure that DHS cannot impose the passport requirement before June 2009 and would set tough new convenience and affordability requirements   Schumer said that DHS is trying to use a loophole in the law to act as early as January 2008 to impose a rule requiring travelers to present a passport when crossing the Northern Border  despite a troubling lack of preparation on DHS s part   Schumer said that his legislation will remove this uncertainty in the law and also create pilot programs to test the feasibility of using a Daypass or an enhanced driver s license as alternatives to requiring a passport so the security goals of WHTI can be achieved without slowing down travel and commerce        We need to stop DHS once and for all from rushing headlong into new rules that could well be disastrous   Schumer said   Right now  DHS is trying to do an end run around the will of the people of Western New York  northern border communities across the country  and the intent of the United States Congress  DHS needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a proposal that achieves the security goals of WHTI without crippling cross border commerce for a generation  My legislation will beat back any effort by DHS to rush this rule through and will set vital convenience and affordability requirements for any future proposals        Schumer s new comprehensive legislation would block any effort by DHS to implement a passport requirement before June 2009   Just last year  Congress pushed back the deadline for WHTI implementation from January 1  2008 to June1  2009 due to ample evidence that DHS would be hard pressed to meet the 2008 deadline  But under this amended law  DHS still has the discretion to finalize and impose the WHTI rules earlier if it can make specific certifications relating to the technology  reliability  and security of the system   DHS is known to be exploiting this provision of the law and rushing through development and planning in order to meet these requirements and start demanding passports at land borders in January 2008  a year and half early       Schumer s legislation would minimize uncertainty and mandate that WHTI rules cannot be implemented at land crossings any earlier than June 1  2009   This extra time is sorely needed for DHS to ensure that WHTI can be implemented without disrupting cross border commerce and travel   In addition  DHS would have to certify six months in advance of final implementation that it has met comprehensive efficiency and security guidelines   If DHS fails to meet these standards prior to June 1  2009  then WHTI cannot enter into force until DHS can meet these important guidelines       Some of the requirements include      Economic Impact   DHS and DOS must commission independent evaluations of  1  the economic impact of WHTI on each state with an international border and on the entire US and of  2  the privacy and security risks of their preferred technology for any travel document intended as a documentary alternative to a passport book to be acquired by U S  citizens  These evaluations must be completed  provided to Congress  and made publicly available at least 6 months before WHTI implementation      Enhanced Driver s License   DHS and DOS must complete a pilot project in at least one location to determine whether a state may enhance their driver s license process to meet WHTI requirements  Participation in such a project must be voluntary for individuals obtaining the licenses  DHS and DOS must report to Congress on the results of this pilot project and must incorporate the results into all final rulemakings issued for WHTI      Technology  DHS and DOS must complete and submit to Congress a plan for how WHTI will leverage existing infrastructure and technology that is already installed at the borders or slated for installation  including the technology for use with the ePassport issued by DOS  If the planned method of implementing WHTI will require new infrastructure or technology  DHS and DOS must submit an explanation of why the existing infrastructure and technology is not being used      Smooth Transition   DHS must provide Congress with a plan for transitioning to WHTI implementation in a way that will achieve security objectives while minimizing the disruption to commerce and travel caused by a sudden change in border crossing procedures  This plan must include a public education campaign that begins at least 3 months prior to the implementation of WHTI rules at any land border and must include provisions for a  grace period  during which travelers can return home to the US even if they forget their new documents      Card Readers   DHS must certify that any card readers they plan to purchase meet standards for security and interoperability set by the International Standards Organization    The bill would state that any card or identification document required under WHTI as a passport alternative would cost the user no more than  20 for adults and would be free to children under the age of 18  If children under the age of 18 do not wish to obtain a PASS Card  then they would be exempt from the WHTI documentary requirement       Schumer said that DHS current plan does not effectively balance the needs for improved border security and the need for efficient cross border commerce   I fully support efforts to improve security along our borders  however  we must at the same time protect commerce and the way of life along the border   Schumer added       The United States and Canada have the largest bi national trade relationship in the world  Trade with Canada supports an estimated 350 000 jobs in New York alone  Fully 25  of all New York State exports  accounting for  10 5 billion  go to Canada every year  The impact of tourism and spur of the moment trips is also staggering with Canadians accounting for 2 2 million visits to New York in 2002 injecting  389 million into the local economies       Schumer was joined by Rich Geiger  President  Buffalo Convention Visitors Bureau  Luke Rich  BiNational Tourism Alliance  BTA   Jack Ampuja Chair  Logistics Council for Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Paul Koessler Vice Chair  Public Bridge Authority  Kerry Mitchell  Political Economic and Public Affairs  Canadian Consulate General  Larry Quinn from the Buffalo Sabres  Bill Munson  VP Public Affairs  Buffalo Bills  Ken Woodruff and Barrie Laver  BTA  Louis Grachos  Director  Albright Knox Art Gallery       In January  Schumer submitted a formal comment criticizing the Department of State s proposed rule regarding the new PASS Card and laid out eight steps the State Department should take before any final rule is implemented  In his comment  Schumer said the proposed PASS Card will offer all of the inconvenience and inefficiencies of a standard passport book  while providing none of the security assurances for individuals  private information  Schumer  who added that PASS cards could be cost prohibitive for the average family  specifically asked that the State Department conduct an economic impact study on the economies in upstate New York and other border states and bring in an independent auditor to evaluate the entire program   The State Department has offered the PASS Card as a possible alternative to passports required under WHTI
