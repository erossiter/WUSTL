IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 18  2005 Schumer Demands Roche License Tamiflu Production To 5 U S  Companies In Next 30 Days To Fill Orders Of Bird Flu Treatment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Roche Says They  re Negotiating  but There is No Evidence    Senator Calls on 1st Company to Be Licensed in 2 Weeks   Today  Roche Says Production is the Biggest Hurdle    Yesterday  Roche Said Production by Other Companies Not Possible    Other Drug Companies Say They Can Do it U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer sent another  to Roche today demanding that they license production for Tamiflu to five U S  drug companies in the next 30 days  Tamiflu is the only known effective treatment for the deadly avian flu virus and Roche holds the patent so that the drug can be mass produced but has not licensed it to other companies  which would dramatically increase production  As worldwide concern that this particular strain may soon develop into a deadly pathogen in humans and cause a horrible epidemic in the United States and throughout the world with little ability to treat it  it is imperative that Roche dramatically increase production capability by licensing the patent to other drug makers  Schumer outlined a plan this week for Roche to voluntarily suspend their patent so that other companies can begin to produce the Tamiflu drug  So far  the company has not responded to Schumer  s letters  but has previously denied that other drug companies could produce the drug        Schumer stated    Roche must engage in an active campaign to license Tamiflu production to 5 U S  drug companies in the next 30 days  Roche is putting their own interests ahead of world health  They should not be slow walking this process when we have a potential pandemic that could occur at anytime            Yesterday Roche said production by other drug companies was impossible  today they are saying that production capacity is key  If they don  t begin to actually license the patent for Tamiflu to dramatically increase worldwide production  I am going to pursue a legislative remedy a month from today     Schumer said       Schumer has long been a leader in getting consumers access to more affordable drugs and co authored with Sen  John McCain the 2003 Generic drug law that brought lower cost prescription drugs to millions  Also  after the Anthrax mail attacks on the U S  Capitol and other places around the country in 2001  Schumer called on the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to contract with generic companies to produce Cipro  a drug prescribed to those who were in the vicinity of the deadly substance  Cipro made by Bayer  was in short supply and prohibitively expensive at a cost of  400 per patient  almost twice the cost of manufacturing the drug  After much public prodding and despite claims that they could not significantly increase production  Bayer tripled production and lowered its price        Roche currently holds the patent for Tamiflu    the brand name version of oseltamivir and the only effective known treatment for the Bird Flu    through 2016  As the drug s sole patent holder  Roche is limited to producing as much Tamiflu as its manufacturing plants can handle  Many more countries want to stockpile Tamiflu than Roche is able to supply  and the United States is currently far down on the waiting list  If pandemic flu was to happen this flu season  many countries  including the U S   would be left with no recourse for treatment  Roche has refused to license its product to other companies in order to ease the bottleneck and make sure that each country has enough Tamiflu on hand in case pandemic flu breaks out       Infectious disease experts advise that each country have enough Tamiflu on hand for 40    50  of its population  That would require the U S  to stockpile enough of the drug for over 100 million people  yet HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt has called for a supply for only 20 million  and the U S  has only enough pills right now to treat 2 3 million  Experts say that just over 2 million treatments will barely cover the military and emergency workers  who represent about 1  of the population  Roche has said that producing enough pills to treat 20 million people    let alone the 100 million treatments we actually need    will take years        If we increase the number of manufacturers producing Tamiflu  we can protect many more Americans should a pandemic hit   Schumer said   Knowing we have enough Tamiflu  just in case  would go a long way towards calming the public about potential shortages and hopefully dissuade people from buying  stockpiling or even taking a drug they currently don t need        Though Roche has said it would take any generic company at least three years to ramp up to make the drug  experts in the generic drug industry disagree  Several U S  based companies are already interested and believe their existing manufacturing plants can be ready to produce the drug long before Roche can build more of its own  Companies in India  Taiwan and Thailand are prepared to produce the drug       Schumer said that in order for any of the generic manufacturers to reach agreements with HHS  the U S  would have to agree not to seek indemnification from the generic drug manufacturers if Roche successfully sued  and would also have to agree to indemnify the manufacturers in the event Roche successfully sued them for patent infringement  Federal law permits the United States to purchase products from manufacturers other than the patent holder  but says that the government could be liable for the patent holder s recovery of  reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture   28 U S C      1498  No injunction preventing the generic manufacturers from producing oseltamivir and selling it to the government is available under     1498       Schumer  s  to Roche is attached
