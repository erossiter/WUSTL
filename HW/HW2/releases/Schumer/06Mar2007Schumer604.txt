IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 6  2007 Opening Statement of Senator Charles E  Schumer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Preserving Prosecutorial Independence  Is the Department of Justice Politicizing the Hiring and Firing of U S  Attorneys    PART II   Senate Committee on the Judiciary  March 6  2007  10 00A M     Four weeks ago  this Committee had its first hearing to investigate the unprecedented firing of more than a half dozen Presidentially appointed United States Attorneys        At that time  I said that I was deeply concerned about the politicization of the Department of Justice and about allegations that our top prosecutors were victims of a political purge        Since our last hearing  my concerns have only grown  public confidence has only diminished  and the plot has only thickened       Almost every day  it seems  there is another twist  turn  or revelation that calls into question the Justice Department s abrupt and unprecedented firing of at least eight of our country s top federal prosecutors       Federal prosecutors are supposed to be heroic soldiers in the fight against crime and corruption  not hapless casualties of political warfare         Federal prosecutors are supposed to be bedrock neutral servants of the law  not temporary tools in the service of some political end       Yet it seems all too likely that some in the Administration were seeking to turn U S  Attorneys into political operatives            What are we to think when there is virtually no documentary evidence of any  performance  problem on the part of the fired U S  Attorneys            What are we to think when there are allegations of retaliation based on cold political calculations  leveled by federal prosecutors of unimpeachable integrity            What are we to think when prosecutors appear to have been fired for no reason  or worse  as part of a political vendetta       Our work  it seems  is far from over  and may only be just beginning        Let me take a minute to recap what has transpired over the past month       1  The Deputy Attorney General admitted   in a stunning revelation   that one U S  Attorney  Bud Cummins  had not been fired for any performance related reason  but only to provide an opportunity to an inexperienced former aide to Karl Rove       2  A week after our hearing  we received a closed door briefing from the Department of Justice   That briefing was supposed to put our minds at ease  but instead left us scratching our heads   The argument that all of the remaining U S  Attorneys were fired for performance related reasons simply does not add up       3  Then  a week after that briefing  we finally received the actual performance evaluations of six of the fired U S  Attorneys   Those evaluations showed  unequivocally  that every single prosecutor received an excellent evaluation   That left us shaking our heads       4  Indeed  just last week  one fired U S  Attorney   David Iglesias from New Mexico   was described by former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey  not as an under performer  but rather as  one of the best we had        5  Yesterday  Michael Battle  head of the Executive Office of United States Attorneys and the official who personally called to fire a half dozen U S  Attorneys last December 7th  announced his own resignation   Was he fired  Did he resign in protest   We don t yet know       6  And today  the McClatchy newspapers report that at least one of the fired U S  Attorneys believes he was threatened with retaliation by a top Justice Department Official if he complained publicly or came to testify before Congress       7  Also today  the New York Times reports that another U S  Attorney  in Baltimore  may have been fired for political reasons in 2004       8  Most disturbing  of course  are the shocking allegations that Mr  Iglesias  far from being fired for performance reasons  was dismissed because he didn t  play ball  after two Members of Congress allegedly tried to pressure him into rushing indictments against a local Democrat just days before the November election       We will not rest until we get the answers we seek and the American people get the explanations they deserve            Was any U S  Attorney removed because he or she was bringing too much heat on Republican elected officials  as in the case of Carol Lam            Was any U S  Attorney removed because he or she was not bringing enough heat on Democratic elected officials  as in the case of David Iglesias            Who in the Administration was responsible for this ill advised purge            Was the purge orchestrated solely by the Department of Justice  or was the White House involved       In our effort to get answers to these questions  we have now heard twice from the Department of Justice   Today we begin to hear the other side of the story        We have four extraordinary witnesses here   four of the fired U S  Attorneys       On behalf of the entire Committee  I want to thank the witnesses for coming here today  I know this is neither easy nor pleasant      As all four of you know  the issuance of subpoenas is on the Senate Judiciary Committee agenda for this Thursday   So  refusing to come here this morning would have just been delaying the inevitable          We will get  I trust  important information today  and I expect today s testimony will generate even more questions for the Department of Justice       If so  we will not hesitate to call as many Department officials before us as is necessary to get to the bottom of this       There is one thing  however  we can do right now  without waiting for any more testimony   We must pass Senator Feinstein s bill  which I have cosponsored  to provide a check and balance on the Attorney General s power to name interim U S  Attorneys      Twice now  that common sense reform has been blocked by the other side        I can t understand it  especially since no Senator will admit to even knowing that the change was made in the first place   So  we will keep fighting to get that vital legislation passed        Meanwhile  we will be vigilant in asking questions and conducting oversight       I look forward to all the testimony
