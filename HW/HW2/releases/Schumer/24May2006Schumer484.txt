IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 24  2006 Schumer Reveals Invasive Species Pose Serious Environmental And Economic Threat To Upstate New York    Could Cost  170 Million In Lost Crop Production

Country  13 m  Southern Tier  13 m  Wester On top of an estimated  170 million in crop production at risk  invasive species pose a major threat to the environment and to New York  s tourism industry  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced  Schumer released new figures detailing the possible effects of invasive species on Upstate New Yorker farmers and overall crop production  In every region of upstate New York  farmers  boaters  and businesses are battling some form of invasive species  ranging from zebra mussels invading the Great Lakes  to the Golden Nematode decimating crops in Rochester  to the Japanese Knotweed invading grasslands and highways in the Capital Region  Schumer announced he will cosponsor comprehensive invasive species legislation and calling on the National Invasive Species Council  NISC  to expand research and targeting of invasive species coming in to the United States         You may need a microscope to find them  but their impact is enormous     Schumer said    Farms and farmers are the backbone of upstate New York  s economy and we need to do everything we can to ensure that these pests and plants don  t cripple production for years to come  If there was ever a case where a stitch in time saves nine  this is it          Invasive species are non native plants  animals  insects or other organisms that can cause harm to the environment  farm land  crops  bodies of water  and even human health  Invasive species are a form of biological pollution and are recognized as one of the leading threats to biodiversity in Upstate New York  Invasive species attack all aspects of Upstate New York  s agricultural and environmental sectors and have been around since the beginning of international commerce       There are several species currently threatening Upstate New York  s agricultural sector  For example  the Golden Nematode  a roundworm that arrived on Long Island after World War I  had been primarily eradicated from Upstate New York potato farms  but has recently re emerged in the Rochester Finger Lakes region  Though the worm does not kill the potato  it renders them useless  The Swede Midge  discovered in recent surveys in Western New York  has the potential to decimate Upstate New York  s brocchili and cabbage crops       Since 2004  at least seven new organisms have invaded New York including the Swede Midge from Europe and the Southern Bacterial Wilt from Africa that  if it contaminates the soil in Upstate New York  could reduce yields of tomatoes  potatoes  eggplant  and peppers  Finally  the Glassy Winged Sharpshooter  which has not yet appeared in Upstate New York  is a mosquito like insect that infects grape vines with fatal Pierce  s Disease and could easily infect vineyards in the Southern Tier  Finger Lakes  and across the state       Schumer also said that the threat of invasive species extends beyond Upstate New York farms and agricultural sector  and in to lakes  wetlands  and New York  s overall environment  Zebra mussel infestations have caused significant ecological changes in the Great Lakes and major rivers and lakes across Upstate New York  The zebra mussel s rapid reproduction  coupled with consumption of microscopic plants and animals  places valuable commercial and sport fisheries at risk and clogs vital water intake pipes  resulting in the loss of pumping ability  clogged pipes  obstructed valves  obnoxious smells from decayed mussel flesh  increased corrosion of cast iron pipes and safety hazards if sprinkler systems fail to deliver fire fighting water       Eurasian Watermilfoil is the most widespread aquatic nuisance across North America and is problematic in hundreds of lakes throughout New York State  The beds of this submergent species often support more than 300 stems per square meter  Such high densities harm wildlife and fish populations and make recreational uses difficult or impossible       Schumer today released  detailing how much money each region stands to lose if invasive species continue to spread and afflict New York  s agricultural sector  According to a recent report by the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at Cornell University  pests and or bugs can account for a 13 percent drop in crop yields  In economic terms  this represents about  33 billion nationwide in lost crop production annually       In addition  Schumer said that farmers have to spend millions on pesticides and other chemicals to control and eradicate invasive species from their farm  According to the Cornell report  approximately  4 billion in herbicides are applied to U S  crops of which about  3 billion is used to control alien invasive weeds  In New York  farmers spent roughly  80 million on pesticides and chemicals in 2004       In 2004  Upstate New York farms produced more  1 1 billion worth of crops and  according to Schumer  s analysis  could lose nearly  170 million as a result of invasive species  Specifically       Capital Region farms produced  78 756 000 worth of crops in 2004 and could lose an estimated  12 098 060 due to invasive species        Central New York farms produced  92 458 000 worth of crops in 2004 and could lose an estimated  14 202 886 due to invasive species        Rochester Finger Lakes farms produced  313 254 000 worth of crops in 2004 and could lose an estimated  48 120 343 due to invasive species        Hudson Valley farms produced  149 176 000 worth of crops in 2004 and could lose an estimated  22 915 590 due invasive species        North Country farms produced  84 569 000 worth of crops in 2004 and could lose an estimated  12 991 021 due to invasive species        Southern Tier farms produced  90 302 000 worth of crops in 2004 and could lose an estimated  13 871 693 due to invasive species        Western New York farms produced  294 248 000 worth of crops in 2004 and could lose an estimated  45 200 747 due to invasive species        In response Schumer announced a sweeping 4 point plan to combat this growing epidemic       Schumer announced he is cosponsoring the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act which authorizes more than  165 million over the next five years to combat invasive species in the United States  The bill directs the Aquatic Invasive Species Task Force to establish a priority pathway management program that identifies pathways that pose the highest risk for the introduction of aquatic invasive species  It requires the EPA Administrator to develop environmentally sound  cost effective technology to detect and eradicate invasive species and creates a national grant program for researchers at institutions of higher education and museums to carry out research on invasive species and taxonomy        In order to combat land based invasive species  Schumer wrote to the co chairs NISC asking them to identify the highest risk land pathways for invasive species to enter our nation  Current laws do not clearly address prevention of invasive species across foreseeable pathways  including international land and trade routes  In its July 2005 report  NISC stated the need for enhancing international experts  research and technical support to combat this growing epidemic  Schumer also encouraged NISC to work with universities in New York  Hawaii  Florida  and California to address this problem  The NISC is co chaired by the Secretaries of Agriculture  Commerce  and Interior        Schumer urged the NISC to reach out to the United States Trade Representative to develop strategies and or international agreements to ensure non native species are not transported in to the United States        Schumer asked the Acting Commissioner of U S Customs and Border Protection asking to outline how CBP checks foreign ships  cargo  and passengers at ports of entry for invasive species entering the country  and how they can improve this process       Click here to view
