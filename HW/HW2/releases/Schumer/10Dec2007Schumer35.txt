IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 10  2007 Schumer Reveals  Future Growth At Buffalo s Goodyear Dunlop Motorcycle Tire Plant Threatened By Chinese Trade Barriers   Unfair Regulations Could Put Brakes On Harley Davidson s Motorcycle Sales                                                                                                                                                                                                               Future Growth of Buffalo s Goodyear Dunlop Plant    America s Lone Manufacturer of Motorcycle Tires   Could Be Jeopardized as Harley Davidson is Unfairly Shut Out of the Chinese Motorcycle Market Local Goodyear Dunlop Plant Employs Over 1300 Workers in Good Paying Jobs in the Buffalo Area Standing at Buffalo s Harley Davidson Dealership  Schumer Pushes U S  Trade and Commerce Officials to Seek Removal of China s Remove Trade Barriers Hurting Harley Sales Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that future growth at Buffalos local Goodyear Dunlop motorcycle tire plant could suffer from unfair Chinese trade barriers that are restricting the sale of classic American made Harley Davidson motorcycles in the increasingly prosperous country   Despite the exploding popularity of Harleys among Chinas consumer class  the Chinese government is stifling the companys ability to sell its products in the lucrative market  Schumer today warned that the trade barriers could stymie future expansion at Buffalos own Goodyear Dunlop motorcycle tire plant which produces tires for Harley Davidson and employees over 1 300 local workers    To protect good paying Buffalo jobs and encourage future growth at the local Goodyear Dunlop plant  Schumer blasted the Chinese government and called on U S  trade and commerce officials to seek the removal of trade barriers that are effectively preventing the iconic American motorcycle company from competing in the country   Schumer already sent a letter last week urging U S  government trade officials to raise the issue with their Chinese counterparts in talks that began last week in Beijing    The Chinese market should be a hog heaven for U S  motorcycle companies  but Chinas unfair trade practices are slamming the brakes on Harley sales  which in turn  could jeopardize good paying jobs here in Buffalo  Senator Schumer said  Harley Davidson and Goodyear Dunlop are classic American companies and should be rewarded for keeping manufacturing jobs here in Buffalo  not punished by Chinas attempts to control the market   To ensure the plant here in Buffalo can continue to grow and expand  we need to guarantee that American made motorcycles are not prevented from participating in the Chinese market    Despite a two year presence in the Chinese market  Harley Davidsons sales in the country are virtually non existent due to municipal regulations that limit or even ban heavy duty motorcycle use in urban areas  The rules make it extremely difficult for consumers to utilize motorcycles that they purchase  Furthermore  the rules are just another example of the arbitrary  non tariff barriers erected by China that have the effect of unfairly limiting access to the Chinese market   Such actions call into question Chinas compliance with its obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization    In Buffalo  the local Goodyear Dunlop plant  which employs over 1 300 area workers  is responsible for producing 100 percent of the motorcycles tires for used by Harley Davidson  The giant tire company is the nations sole producer of motorcycle tires  and forty percent of the tires made at Buffalo plant are sent to Harley Davidson    Schumer today emphasized that a financially hampered Harley Davidson company could have a negative ripple effect on future growth at Buffalos Goodyear Dunlop plant  Harley Davidson and Goodyear Dunlop are a match made in heaven and we need to guarantee that foreign trade barriers dont come between them  added Schumer    With U S  government officials meeting with their Chinese counterparts in talks last week in Beijing  Schumer sent a letter to U S  trade officials calling for them to make tearing down the trade barriers afflicting Harley Davidson a top priority     In a letter to U S  Trade Representative Susan C  Schwab and Secretary of Commerce Carlos M  Gutierrez  Schumer said China should take a visible step towards eliminating the barriers at the upcoming meeting of the U S  China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade  JCCT   This round of the annual meetings is set to wrap up this week in Beijing between U S  and Chinese officials    Schumer today pledged to continue pushing U S  trade officials to force the Chinese to open up their domestic market to Harley Davidson in an effort to fuel future growth at both the motorcycle manufacturer  and at Goodyear Dunlop plants  like Buffalos    Milwaukee based Harley Davidson employs 8 500 workers at its plants in Wisconsin  Pennsylvania and Missouri  Last week  Harley Davidson experienced a planned shut down of operations at its plants in those three states due to flat sales
