IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 7  2007 Schumer  Feds Shortchanging Of Returning Troops Extends Far Beyond Walter Reed    Upstate NY Vets  Alone Could Face  100 Million Health Care Shortfall                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           With Walter Reed Scandal Growing  Current Administration s Budget Leaves a Shocking  375 Million Nationwide Deficit Just for New Iraq and Afghanistan Vets  Health Care   Schumer  who Has Called for a Nationwide Investigation of Conditions at Military Health Care Facilities  Says Repeated Budget Cuts at the VA Have Created a Crisis Situation   Senator Releases New Report Detailin With more than 30 000 veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9 11 currently living in upstate New York  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that the current Administration s budget shortchanges those veterans  health care needs by more than  100 million  part of a  2 8 billion potential nationwide shortfall  This weekend  Schumer called for a new commission to investigate conditions at military health care facilities across the country in the wake of the scandal involving outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center        The situation at Walter Reed is the Katrina of 2007   Schumer said   Not only because what our soldiers have endured shakes us to the core  but because we must rise above partisanship to fix the problems that caused it  Far too many veterans fall in to the dysfunctional VA bureaucracy after they leave a military health facility  The bottom line is our VA medical system has been shortchanged creating a nationwide crisis that thousands of vets know all too well  We must ensure the VA health care system receives the funding it needs so veterans get the quality health care they deserve after they leave places like Walter Reed  Veterans have already made one sacrifice for their nation  they shouldn t be forced to make another        As the breadth and depth of the Walter Reed scandal continues to unfold  Schumer emphasized that the government cannot forget that after soldiers leave military medical facilities  like Walter Reed  the VA medical centers become responsible for their care   Unfortunately  the Administration s budget shortchanges VA hospitals  counseling centers  facilities  and operation in upstate New York and across the country  In total  according to the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  the current budget shortchanges all veterans across the country by more  2 845 billion for medical services   The bulk of this shortfall comes from the fact that the number of physicians  nurses  and all other health professionals currently employed by the VA cannot keep pace with increasing demands on the system from current wars abroad       Today  Schumer said that this   could cost upstate New York veterans an estimated  101 4 million in medical services   There are over 637 400 veterans currently living in upstate New York with 263 600 currently receiving VA health benefits   The numbers below were obtained from the New York State Division of Veterans  Affairs which breaks out medical expenditures for veterans in every county in the state  Below is how the numbers break out across the state            Right now  there are 83 273 veterans living in the Capital Region with 34 302 enrolled in the VA health service   The current budget would shortchange these vets by  15 310 020             Right now  there are 73 840 veterans living in Central New York with 30 558 enrolled in the VA health service   The current budget would shortchange these vets by  15 074 826            Right now  there are 93 456 veterans living in the Rochester   Finger Lakes Region with 37 731 enrolled in the VA health service   The current budget would shortchange these vets by  10 478 514            Right now  there are 144 846 veterans living in the Hudson Valley with 63 076 enrolled in the VA health service   The current budget would shortchange these vets by  18 482 346            Right now  there are 53 286 veterans living in the North Country with 21 116 enrolled in the VA health service   The current budget would shortchange these vets by  4 627 917            Right now  there are 58 842 veterans living in the Southern Tier with 24 019 enrolled in the VA health service   The current budget would shortchange these vets by  15 453 877            Right now  there are 129 899 veterans living in Western New York with 52 834 enrolled in the VA health service   The current budget would shortchange these vets by  21 941 399       As the wars continue  Schumer said that the VA has not yet seen the bulk of claims or patients resulting from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and must now take aggressive measures to ensure there are adequate facilities to handle the physical and physiological needs of these new veterans in the short term and over the long term        As of September 2006  more than 50 500 US soldiers have suffered non mortal wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan   a ratio of 16 wounded servicemen per fatality   This is by far the highest ratio of any recent war   In Vietnam  the ratio was 2 6 injuries per fatality   Though advancements in field medicine and overall medical technology  more servicemen and women are thankfully surviving their wounds  however  Schumer said current and past VA budgets do not account for the dramatic new and long term burdens on VA health care  Last year  the Administration came up  2 billion short in funding for veterans and Congress was forced to pass an emergency spending bill to make up the difference   Schumer said that repeated budget cuts have created a crisis situation in the veterans  health care system       Specifically  the budget for the second year in a row dramatically underestimates the needs of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF    Though the budget includes  752 million to provide health care services for returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans represents  it is projected that this allocation will fall significantly short of real demand   According to the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee  the VA s estimates that it will service only 54 000 OIF OEF more new veterans during 2007  for a total of 109 191 could be 60 000 patients short of actual demand        Schumer said the proposed FY 2008 Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  budget does not provide adequate funding for the services and benefits our veterans have earned  nor does it address pressing management and operational challenges undermining VA efficiency and accessibility   In 2000  the Veterans Benefits Association  VBA  had a backlog of 69 000 pending benefit claims   Today  due to the dramatic rise in claims from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  the VBA has a backlog of 400 000 claims with the average claim taking six months to process       In response to this crisis  Schumer  and the entire Democratic leadership  announced their comprehensive effort to get to the bottom of the atrocities found at Walter Reed and overhaul the existing VA medial system to ensure returning veterans receive the care the need and deserve            Eliminate the Shortfall    Today  Schumer called on Chairman and Ranking members of the Senate and House budget committees asking them to include at least  2 85 billion in additional funding for VA medical services to make up for the shortfall   Schumer said this must include  357 million just for health care for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan            VA Investigation   In addition to the commission called for by Schumer to investigate conditions at military health care facilities  Schumer today wrote to VA Secretary Jim Nicholson asking him to conduct his own nationwide investigation in to conditions and backlogs at VA facilities in upstate New York and across the country            New Hearings and Oversight    Schumer said the Senate Armed Services and Veterans  Affairs committees will hold an unprecedented  joint hearing examining the gap between DoD and VA s response to returning servicemembers  As part of this process  Congress will demand transparency from the Administration and real estimates of the cost of the war to our troops   This will include real estimates of the numbers of troops seeking care in the VA system  the types of injuries affecting our troops and amount of money needed to run the health care system our troops deserve              Comprehensive Legislation    In the days ahead  Schumer said Congress will craft legislative solutions to the many problems facing our troops when they return home  including emergency items to be added to the Supplemental Appropriations bill as needed and larger authorizing bills after committee hearings conclude        Schumer is also an original cosponsor of the Fulfilling Our Duty to America s Veterans Act that would reverse existing and future shortfalls in the VA Health Care Budget and eliminate the need for any increases in user fees or prescription drug co pays  The bill would seek to ensure adequate funding for all veterans health care needs
