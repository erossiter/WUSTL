Grants  ESG    Once the Cornerstone of Long Island and the American Dream  Affordable Housing now Endangered by Exorbitant Real Estate Market  Threatening Thousands of Working Class New Yorkers                                        To counter skyrocketing housing prices  as well as exorbitant mortgages and rents that are rapidly reducing affordable housing options for thousands of working Long Islanders  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced  20 278 000 in federal funds for affordable housing in Nassau County  The money awarded by the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  will assist Nassau County  s working families by expanding homeownership options and upgrading low income housing and shelters  The funds were awarded through the following programs  the American Dream Down payment Initiative   51 164   Community Development Block Grant   15 875 525   HOME   3 676 076  and Emergency Shelter Grants   675 727          Affordable housing was the bedrock of Long Island life that created the Long Island we know in the years after World War II   said Senator Schumer   But these days  working New Yorkers know all too well that the exorbitant real estate market is making Long Island less of a place for the American Dream  and more of a place for sleepless nights wondering how to make next month  s rent or mortgage payment  This funding will help those left behind by runaway real estate market and make homeownership a reality for many more Long Islanders          Schumer  a ranking Democrat on the Senate Housing committee  noted that Long Island has among the highest housing costs in the nation  While a robust economy has fueled uninterrupted economic growth on Long Island since the early 1990 s  economic growth is now threatened by the lack of affordable housing for young families headed by parents who are just beginning their careers  In the past five years  Long Island housing prices have increased 81  while incomes have risen only 14   At this rate  the shortage in affordable housing could undermine Long Island  s working class which is crucial to a healthy economy       A long time champion of affordable housing on Long Island  in June 2004  Schumer unveiled a major new federal plan to fight the shortage in middle class housing  Concerned that the spike in housing costs would prevent Policemen  Firemen  Nurses  and Teachers from living on Long Island  Schumer announced a  300 million expansion of an oversubscribed Fannie Mae initiative to let middle class families purchase homes with little or no down payment at Long Island Housing Partnership  He also released a plan to convert one third of vacant federal property on Long Island for middle class housing  and announced new legislation to make the Federal government insure zero down payment mortgages for first time home buyers       This June  Senator Schumer delivered a major policy speech on affordable housing in Long Island where he introduced new legislation that would have the Department of Housing and Urban Development designate areas  where the average price of a new home far exceeds the average median income for workers  as   Next Generation Housing Zones     This would directly target the few  unique areas  like Long Island  where the price of owning a home has become far out of reach for the average worker and where promising young talent have started to look at other places to live and work        Working families are the backbone of America and Long Island     said Senator Schumer    But too many parents juggling multiple jobs still find themselves out in the cold when it comes to getting the housing they need  The lack of affordable housing may be the single biggest challenge facing Long Island        The ADDI encourages homeownership  especially among lower income and minority households  in an effort to restore and stabilize communities that have been hurt by declining wages and rising housing prices  ADDI assists first time homebuyers in purchasing single family homes by offering financial support to assist with down payment and closing costs and renovations  Senator Schumer was influential in creating the American Dream Down payment Act by stipulating that condominium units  cooperative units  and manufactured housing qualify as single family homes under ADDI  This allowed millions of New Yorkers who live in apartments or condominiums to receive the same ADDI benefits as residents who live in single family houses        The CDBG program provides annual grants to State and local governments to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment  and by expanding economic opportunities  principally for low and moderate  income persons        The HOME program helps to expand the supply of decent  affordable housing to low and very low income families by providing grants to state and local governments to fund housing programs that meet local needs and priorities       The ESG program provides annual grants to State  local  and private entities to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters
