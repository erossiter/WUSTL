IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 4  2007 Schumer Blasts TSA For Screener Cuts At Stewart Airport Despite New Service Boom                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 With Passengers and Flights on the Rise at Stewart  TSA Has Inexplicably Cut the Number Full Time Screeners Working at Stewart Nearly In Half Over the Last Two Years   Before New JetBlue and AirTran Service Started  Airport Officials Requested New Screeners to Deal with More Passengers   TSA Denied the Request and Shockingly Announced More Cuts     Senator Calls on TSA to Immedia U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  to immediately beef up the number of screeners Stewart Airport to accommodate increased demand from new JetBlue and AirTran service  Because of a shortage of screeners  airport officials are concerned that screening personnel levels will not be enough to accommodate the new the flights  Despite growth at the airport  the number of full time equivalent Transportation Security Officers  TSOs  has been whittled from 46 in 2002  to 24 today  Staffing levels have been maintained at the previous level of 30 TSO s only through filling the vacant positions with temporary workers and employees from other airports    We just got finished celebrating the fact that JetBlue and Air Tran are bringing more flights to Stewart and the airport is experiencing some real growth   Schumer said   Why TSA would insist on under staffing Stewart when we need more screeners is beyond me  The federal government should be supporting the airport  not holding it back     According to local TSA officials  there are 30 TSA Screening Personnel employed at Stewart on a daily basis  while the original screening program for the airport called for 59 screeners  In 2003  the airport had as many as 48 screeners with 46 working in 2002    In November  Stewart Airport officials asked the TSA to increase their security personnel allocation to 42 full time equivalent TSOs to deal with new volume of air travelers  Instead  TSA informed the airport that its screening staff would be cut down to 24   Stewart officials maintain they need at least 42 screeners  and likely many more  to handle the growth they have been experiencing        TSA  s decision to cut screeners has already had a deleterious impact on the airport  During the holiday season  air travelers experienced unacceptably long delays at passenger screening lines due to under staffed security operations  This is especially unfortunate as Stewart Airport has recently invested in a second screening line to expedite screening   Too often this line has gone unused because there have not been enough operators to staff it   Furthermore  the airports chances of expanding further are hampered by the antiquated staffing levels        Schumer also called the TSA  s screener allocation system   deeply flawed    and said it must be reconsidered immediately  Reducing the number of screeners may lead to onerous delays in the passenger and baggage screening process and the overall security of the airport  Instead of relying on its archaic formulas and modeling  called the Security Allocation Model  SAM   Schumer said the TSA needs to look at the new facts that more flights will surely mean a greater volume of passengers and the need for more screeners     To cut down on long waits and ensure adequate security at the airport  Schumer urged the TSA to fully staff Stewart Airport with the screeners it needs to handle its increasing flight loads and to supply the airport with the necessary equipment to support the new screening lane so that security checks are done thoroughly  In a letter to TSA Administrator Kip Hawley  Schumer wrote   Stewart airport needs at least 42 full time screeners to operate efficiently and as they continue to grow they will likely need more than that  It is imperative the TSA is responsive to the needs of a growing airport like Stewart      In just the last few months  Stewart has welcomed brand new service from two national low cost carriers   On December 19  JetBlue began the first roundtrip flights to Ft  Lauderdale and Orlando  and on January 5 will expand to two round trips  plus one round trip to West Palm Beach  In October  AirTran announced its new service will provide two daily roundtrips to Atlanta  which is AirTran  s hub  and one daily around trip each to Orlando  Ft  Lauderdale and Tampa  Schumer  s announcement will have a major impact on the airport s development and air travel in the Hudson Valley
