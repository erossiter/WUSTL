                                                                                            Schumer  Who Donated Blood This Month  Will Urge Federal  State  and Local Governments to Give Comp Time for Workers Who Donate Blood a With blood in short supply should an emergency occur  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released a detailed regional  of the blood shortage affecting upstate New York and announced a new plan to increase donations  Right now  blood centers across upstate New York have collected less than is needed to fulfill stockpile goals and are stocking less than a three day supply of O negative and O positive blood  the most frequently requested types  Schumer also said that recent flooding in the Southern Tier  Capital Region  and Hudson Valley slowed donations this summer because blood drives had to be canceled  Schumer today called on state  federal and local governments and businesses to start granting comp time this week to employees who donate blood to help replenish depleted supplies  Schumer also urged the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate with New York  s blood centers in a joint public relations campaign to boost donations nationwide         The bottom line is the life blood of New York may well be drying up     Schumer said    We all want to make sure there is a steady  safe supply of blood available for whenever we need it  When the supply of blood is low  it threatens basic patient safety and the public health  The good news is  it is very easy to get our supply back to normal levels and if we all do our small part  we  ll be fine          According to the New York Penn Region Office of the American Red Cross  four of the major blood types  including A   A   O   and O   are stocked at low levels  meaning more donations are urgently needed in order to avoid a blood emergency   Blood centers across upstate New York right now have less than a three day supply of O  and O   the universal and most often needed blood types  far less than the five to seven day supply necessary to weather an emergency       Upstate New York blood centers took in 20 percent less donations this year than they needed to meet demands   From September 1  2005 to September 1  2006  blood centers in upstate New York took in 418 022 units of blood  66 550 units less than is needed to meet demands   Less than five percent of Americans who can give blood actually give blood in a given year       Here is how the shortfall breaks out across upstate over the past year            While blood centers in the Capital Region needed to take in 59 343 units of blood  they came up 11 132 units short  leaving them with only 48 211 units collected  a 19 percent shortfall            While blood centers in Central New York needed to take in 55 795 units of blood  they came up 6 620 units short  leaving them with only 49 175 collected  a 12 percent shortfall            While blood centers in Rochester Finger Lakes Region needed to take in 87 927 units of blood  they came up 10 579 units short  leaving them with only 77 348 units collected  a 12 percent shortfall            While blood centers in the Hudson Valley needed to take in an estimated 60 266 units of blood  they came up 13 499 units short  leaving them with only 46 767 units collected  a 22 percent shortfall            While blood centers in the North Country needed to take in 18 546 units of blood  they came up 2 458 units short  leaving them with only 16 088 units collected  a 13 percent shortfall            While blood centers in the Southern Tier needed to take in 46 147 units of blood  they came up 5 943 units short  leaving them with only 40 204 units collected  a 13 percent shortfall            While blood centers in Western New York needed to take in 89 998 units of blood  they came up 16 319 units short  leaving them with only 73 679 units collected  an 18 percent shortfall       Schumer said these donation gaps were staggering given the everyday need for blood and the possibility of an emergency   According to New York Blood Center  treatment of a traumatic wound requires at least 50 units of blood   A severe burn victim typically needs at least 20 units of blood       On September 1  New York Penn Region made an urgent call for type O  blood donors to help replenish a critically low supply  The Region had to send an emergency shipment of large quantities of type O  blood to one of the hospitals it serves        Last week  the New York Blood Center declared a blood emergency for the New York New Jersey metropolitan area and issued an urgent appeal for donors   In response to that call and to honor a commitment he made to the myGoodDeed foundation  an organization that encourages New Yorkers to do a good deed to commemorate the 9 11 attacks  Schumer donated blood at the New York Blood Center  s Manhattan headquarters        In response to the critical blood shortage and to help the center drum up donations quickly  Schumer urged Governor Pataki to offer comp time to state employees who donate blood during the workday  and called on local businesses to follow suit in an effort to encourage a culture of donation        In addition  Schumer unveiled a comprehensive plan to significantly ramp up federal efforts to increase the blood supply in New York and in the nation  Specifically  Schumer wrote to U S  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O  Leavitt urging him to immediately allocate  10 million to be used for a widespread campaign to promote blood donation  including public service announcements  subway  bus  and commuter rail posters  newspaper ads and billboards  and deploy 10 new mobile donating vehicles to make donating blood as convenient as possible        Schumer also asked Secretary Leavitt to promote efforts to increase donation in the workplace such as its Workplace Partnership for Life program  whose participants educate their employees on the importance of and ways to donate blood and other tissues  by   a  recruiting federal and state employers to participate   b  urging participants to host a minimum of one blood drive per year  and  c  encouraging participants to offer comp time to employees who donate blood        Lastly  Schumer issued a personal appeal to all eligible upstate New Yorkers to take time out to give blood  Anyone 17 years or older  weighing at least 110 pounds  and in general good health may be eligible to donate blood  In New York State  16 year olds may donate blood provided they bring an original  signed New York State Informed Parental Consent form  All current eligible and new donors are strongly urged to call 1 800 GIVE LIFE  1 800 448 3543  or visit www donateblood org  as soon as possible to schedule an appointment to donate blood
