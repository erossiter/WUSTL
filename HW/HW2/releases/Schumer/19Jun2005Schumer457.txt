IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 19  2005 Schumer  New   Cop Killer    Video Game Is All Time Low  Urges New York Retailers  Distributers Not To Stock  Sell In Stores                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Displays Gruesome Graphics from Game    25 to Life     Where Players to Shoot Police  Use Civilians as Human Shields      Senator Calls on Sony  the Maker of PlayStation and Microsoft the Maker of XBOX to End Game Licensing Agreements with Game Manufacturer      Schumer Stands with Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan  and Rose Nemorin  Widow of Detective James Nem As New York Police risk their lives everyday protecting the city  s residents  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed a not yet released video game that will allow players to shoot police  use civilians as human shields and customize characters in gang colors  Schumer today called on New York retailers and distributors not to stock the game or sell it  The Senator also called on Microsoft  the manufacturer of XBOX  and Sony  the manufacturer of PlayStation  to terminate their licensing agreements with Eidos  the maker of the new video game         Little Johnny should be learning how to read  not how to kill cops     Schumer said    The bottom line is that games that are aimed and marketed at kids shouldn  t desensitize them to death and destruction          In a string of violent video games that many have claimed lower the common denominator of decency  such as Grand Theft Auto and Manhunt  the upcoming 25 To Life has violent and gruesome graphics that make it one of the worst  The game is set in a grit caked inner city neighborhood and sets gang members against police and sends them on a mission to fight their way through the streets  killing whatever gets in the way  In choosing a character the player has a variety of customization options including choosing weapons and picking gang colors       The video game goes out of its way to glorify a life of crime  portraying its lead character  Andre  Freeze  Francis  as a  good hearted drug dealer  who reverts to a world of violence when his friend double crosses him  Not only is  Freeze  depicted as a hero  as he attempts to save his son from a similar fate by razing his hometown with one of the forty weapons  guns  bats  etc  available to him  The justice system is portrayed as a game to be played       Perhaps most egregiously  the police are both vilified and brutalized  Gang members are in constant gun fights with police  and the game includes detailed illustrations of gun shot wounds  blood and flying bullets       This glorification of crime and cop killing is worse yet when it is clearly packaged to attract a younger demographic with artists such as DMX  Tupac  and Xzibit featured on the soundtrack  and an interactive website available to anyone willing to claim they are over the age of seventeen  The website can be found at www 25tolife com      To combat this menace  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on New York retailers and distributors to opt out of stocking and selling the game once it is released  Schumer also called on Sony and Microsoft to terminate their licensing agreements with Eidos  the manufacturer of   25 to Life            There is nowhere that the value of the police force is felt more strongly than here in New York  and to sell a video game that denigrates their value is simply unacceptable     Schumer said    You certainly don  t need a degree in criminal justice to understand that when you make sport of behavior that is dangerous and destructive you reinforce it  The last thing we need here in New York is to reinforce a destructive culture of violence and disrespect for the law            This is not a game to the men and women in our police services  but is a dangerous reality to those who put their lives on the line each day combating gang members and the guns and drugs that they peddle  As long as there is a profit to be made  these games will continue to be targeted to our communities  I am calling upon manufacturers and retailers to show some sensitivity to those who have fallen in the line of duty and stop producing and selling these obscene games     said Richmond County District Attorney Daniel M  Donovan  Jr       Video game sales reached  10 billion in 2004  and unit sales were up by 4  from the previous year  Of the top 10 selling video game titles for 2004 Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  a game featuring gun violence  vehicular homicide  and flagrant sexual behavior  was the best seller       Senator Schumer stood with Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan  Rose Nemorin  widow of Detective James Nemorin who was shot and killed while on duty in 2003  Patrick Lynch  President of the Patrolman  s Benevolent Association and Michael Palladino  President of the Detective  s Endowment Association
