Packaging and Insulation Petition will Eliminate Benefits for Brazilian Exports of PET Film  Seriously Harming Terphane s Operations and Giving its Asian Competitors an Unfair Edge in the Market Today U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton urged the Office of the United States Trade Representative to reject a petition that would eliminate preferential benefits for Brazilian exports of polyethylene terephthalate film  PET film   a material used in packaging and insulation  If upheld  this petition would unfairly threaten the only US owned commercial company left in the industryTerphane Holding Corporation located in Bloomfield  NY     With a second facility located in Brazil  Terphane relies heavily on Brazilian products  By eliminating Brazils export eligibility  the petition will give the companys growing Asian competitors an unfair edge in the market  increasing their threat to Terphanes operations and livelihood  In a letter today to Ambassador Susan Schwab  Schumer and Clinton urged her to reject the petition  as it would have devastating effects on production and jobs in the Rochester area     This is a clear manipulation of US trade laws and  if not stopped immediately  will cut the legs out from under Terphane  a company that has become a vital employer in the Rochester region  said Schumer  I will continue to press the Trade Representatives office to reject this unfair proposal and protect a critical industry asset to both Upstate New York and the entire country     This proposal has the potential to undercut a company that is proud of its partnership in the community  and that is continuing to boost the economic growth and vitality of the Rochester area  said Senator Clinton  It is critical that the Trade Representatives office reject this petition that would threaten the Terphane Holding Corporation by providing an unfair advantage to foreign competition     Terphanes domestic operations have been located in Bloomfield  New York since the early 1980s  It has just recently increased its payroll by nearly 40 percent  but just as this small company is starting to grow  it faces a major challenge from aggressive foreign owned multinational companies  mostly in Asia  seeking to manipulate U S  trade laws to gain unfair advantage in the U S  market     Terphane produces PET film at its New York facility  and also at a facility located in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco  U S  imports from Brazil are sent to Terphanes New York operations for further processing and value added work to meet customer needs  According to Terphane  eliminating Brazils eligibility on PET film would seriously harm Terphanes U S  production and the related jobs because such elimination will have the effect of benefiting imports from Asia     In a letter today to Ambassador Schwab  Schumer and Clinton urged her to reject this unfair petition and stand up for the sole remaining US owned producer of PET film     Full text of the letter is below     The Honorable Susan Schwab   United States Trade Representative   Executive Office of the President   600 17th Street  NW   Washington  D C  20508    Dear Ambassador Schwab     We understand your staff and an inter agency committee are currently considering a petition to eliminate preferential benefits for Brazilian exports of polyethylene terephthalate film  PET film  under the Generalized System of Preferences  GSP   Eliminating GSP benefits for PET film from Brazil would seriously threaten Terphane Holding Corporation  Terphane   the only U S  owned commercial company left in the industry  which is located in our state  We urge you to reject the petition     Terphanes domestic operations are located in Bloomfield  New York  The company has been in Bloomfield since the early 1980s  It has been a small  but understandably proud  manufacturer in the region  and just recently it has increased its payroll by nearly 40 percent  Just as this small company is starting to grow  however  it faces a major challenge from aggressive foreign owned multinational companies  mostly in Asia  seeking to manipulate U S  trade laws to gain unfair advantage in the U S  market     Terphane produces PET film at its New York facility  and also at a facility located in a very poor area of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco  U S  imports from Brazil are sent to Terphanes New York operations for further processing and value added work to meet customer needs  According to Terphane  eliminating Brazils GSP eligibility on PET film would seriously harm Terphanes U S  production and the related jobs because such elimination will have the effect of benefiting imports from Asia  These imports include those from the affiliates of the petitioners in this GSP case  U S  subsidiaries or joint venture partners of Japanese and Korean based companies     The GSP program should not be manipulated to damage U S  producers  If the petitioners request is granted to remove Brazils GSP eligibility on PET film  Terphane has told us that the subsequent impact will harm the sole remaining U S  owned producer of PET film  In our view it would represent a blatant misuse of U S  trade laws  We urge you to turn down the request to remove Brazils GSP eligibility for PET film     Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer Hillary Rodham Clinton   United States Senator United States Senator
