IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 21  2005 New Schumer Study  A Year After Haverstraw Derailment  Thousands Still At Risk From Toxic Fumes   Uninspected Freight Trains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator finds Federal government   asleep at the switch when it comes to freight train safety    and says terrorists could easily exploit weaknesses  New Schumer study finds tens of thousands of Rockland County residents live near tracks carrying HAZMAT rail cargo   releases maps of Hudson Valley danger zones  Senator proposes age limits for cargo cars carrying hazardous materials  doubling number of US Senator Charles E  Schumer today warned that the frightening freight train accident that took place nearly one year ago near Haverstraw could happen again with far more devastating consequences because unsafe and uninspected train cars carrying toxic materials travel throughout Rockland County everyday  Just last week  eight people were killed when similar rail cars carrying chlorine gas derailed outside of Graniteville  South Carolina        Schumer said that inadequate safety precautions put hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near rail lines at risk and released a map showing the metro area danger zones  including 23 miles of freight rail lines in Rockland County  Schumer also detailed his new plan to prevent future rail chemical disasters  including tougher penalties for delinquent freight companies  increased railcar inspections and the installation of modern rail safety equipment across the country          The Federal Railroad Administration is not looking out for the people Rockland County    it is more concerned with protecting big railroad companies     Schumer said    The federal government is quite literally falling asleep at the switch when it comes to protecting us from deadly chemicals that are being transported through thousands of backyards every day  Last year  s accident in Haverstraw and last week  s deadly derailment in South Carolina shouldn  t have to be a wake up call for the feds to beef up safety measures  What we need is a real plan to protect our communities and tougher penalties for railroad companies who disregard our safety          In February of 2004  a CSX freight train derailed outside of Haverstraw  resulting in four cars spilling nearly 200 tons of silicon metal  CSX has refused to give a full explanation for the accident  Schumer today sent a letter to CSX President Michael J Ward  demanding a thorough account of the incident        Local safety officials have repeatedly expressed concern that CSX won  t release comprehensive lists of the chemicals that pass through jurisdictions to the local HAZMAT teams  first responders  and State Emergency Response Committees  In his letter  Schumer insisted that detailed lists be released    It is clear to me that those who respond to chemical accidents should be well aware of what chemicals they may encounter in an emergency          Last week  a freight train accident in Graniteville  South Carolina caused a hazardous chemical spill accounting for nine deaths and over 250 injuries   the nation s worst chemical accident from a train crash since 1978  The accident was caused when a manual track switch was left in the wrong position  After moving their train onto a sideline track  operators of the train failed to reset the manual switch so that another train would stay on the main line  Hours later  the train that was supposed to stay on the main line hit the parked train on the sideline and the chemicals were released  The spilled chlorine caused a gaseous cloud which hovered over the city through nightfall  Residents used towels and blankets to tape their doors and windows shut after the accident to keep the greenish yellow gas out of their homes  Officials focused on the chlorine more than the other two hazardous chemicals because of the gas s deadly effects on respiratory and central nervous systems  However  cresol and sodium hydroxide were also released during the accident        Two days later  a similar accident occurred in Bieber  California  forcing the evacuation of 5 400 local residents  The Federal Rail Administration  FRA   which is in charge of ensuring that train cars and tracks are maintained and operated safely  has indicated that it believes improper operation of a manual switch is to blame for this accident as well  The Bieber accident injured two workers and derailed 14 cars and 7 locomotives        Schumer said that current rail safety measures and the prevalence of manual switches along rail lines provide inadequate protection for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near the state  s 3 695 miles of freight rail tracks  According to the National Transportation Atlas Database  more than 2 02 million tons of chemicals are transported on New York  s rail networks every year        Schumer said that manual rail switches are outdated and leave too much room for error when improperly operated  Sixty percent of the nation  s track is equipped with computer operated switches  however the other 40  only have manual switches  In addition  Schumer said that the FRA not only lacks the authority and the manpower to ensure the safe transportation of these toxic chemicals  it also does not come down hard enough on freight rail companies who do not meet the current safety standards        In response to the South Carolina accident  the FRA issued a safety advisory asking that railroads   document when a manually operated switch in non signaled territory is changed from the main track to a siding and returned back to the normal position for main track movements  In addition  these actions should be communicated to all crewmembers and the train dispatcher     However  Schumer said that the advisory does not go far enough to prevent future accidents        To protect New Yorkers from an accident like the one in South Carolina  Schumer today offered a new plan to give the FRA more teeth in going after negligent freight companies and improve safety measure along the rail lines          Re write the books    giving the FRA the authority to regulate the freight rail industry better and impose tougher penalties for each violation  Currently  the maximum fine the FRA can impose per violation is  11 000   a veritable   drop in the bucket    for these billion dollar companies and often railroad companies are not given the full penalty and let off with a   slap on the wrist     From 1990 to 2003  the average per violation fine assessed by the FRA was a mere  2 133  CSX generated  6 2 billion in revenue in 2003  but is only fined an average of  1 million every year  despite its many flagrant safety violations and deadly accidents  Schumer has written to the Administrator of the FRA  Robert Jameson  urging him to inflict maximum penalties and use all that current law allows to crack down on safety violations  In addition  the FRA now has very limited authority with which to investigate and prosecute freight rail companies that refuse to meet safety requirements  To expand the authority of the FRA  Schumer announced plans to introduce legislation giving the FRA increased power to toughen safety standards  and investigate and prosecute delinquent companies       Switch all manual switches to automatic switches  Federal records show that misaligned manual switches represent one of the most common causes of train wrecks  However 40 percent of the track in the United States are still only equipped with manual switches and not automatic switches that run by computer technology  Schumer today called for immediately replacing half of the manual switches to automatic with an ultimate goal of 100  automatic switches along US tracks       mpose Impose a strict age limit for cars carrying HAZMAT  Railcars carrying some of the most dangerous materials on earth should be equipped with the latest safety technology and protective countermeasures  However  according to the New York Times and government safety officials  more than half of the nation  s 60 000 pressurized rail tank cars are not up to federal code  Schumer today proposed that FRA conduct a comprehensive review of and impose a strict 15 year age limit on railcars able to carry HAZMAT       Double the number of inspectors  The National Transportation Safety Board found that of the 60 000 pressurized tank cars operating on US rail tracks  more than half were not built to proper safety standards  Currently there are 400 inspectors nationwide who evaluate the safety of the trains carrying hazardous materials  Schumer today proposed doubling the number of inspectors to 800 so that the FRA could double the amount of random inspections on these cars to ensure that any rail car carrying HAZMAT not up to code is repaired and upgraded immediately       Conduct a full FRA investigation of the safety practices of freight rail companies  Schumer said that it is time for the FRA to take strong action against railroad companies whose safety violations have lead to innocent fatalities  It is clear that major railroad companies do not treat safety regulations and diligent maintenance as a high priority  Schumer proposed that the FRA conduct its own investigations in to any company whose actions have lead to at least one fatality       In his letter to Administrator Jameson  Schumer wrote    In the wake of last weeks devastating crash in South Carolina and a second accident just this week in Georgia  I respectfully ask you to immediately expand safety regulations to protect civilians who live in close proximity to HAZMAT shipping routes  and commit the resources necessary to prevent future accidents
