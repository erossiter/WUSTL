IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 4  2007 Schumer Fights Draconian Medicare Rule That Could Shutter Long Island s Rehabilitation Units  Vital to Serving Local Seniors in Need Of Short Term Medical Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Medicare s New  75  Rule  Threatens to Shutter Local Rehabilitation Units by Drastically Limiting the Number of Local Patients Able to Receive Short Term Treatment  Schumer Blasts Regulation that Cuts at the Core Medical Needs of Long Island s Aging Population   Hip  Knee  and Joint Rehabilitation Patients Could Soon be Denied In Patient Treatment  Endanger Lives and Cost Hosp Standing at Nassau University Medical Center  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today vowed to fight a new Medicare regulation that will drastically reduce the number of patients that hospitals with rehabilitation units are able to serve  The new regulation  set to take effect next year  will require that 75 percent of patients admitted to rehabilitation units in Long Island hospitals and across the nation must have at least one of thirteen pre determined medical conditions  such as a stroke  spinal cord injury  or fracture of the femur  in order for the hospital to receive federal funding  The new rule will drastically reduce the number of patients able to receive high quality  short term rehabilitation care while recovering from common medical procedures such as hip and knee replacements  and pulmonary or cardiac surgery  In addition  with fewer patients to fill these hospital beds  these centers will struggle to fill their patient quotas and stay financially afloat    Plain and simple  this harsh Medicare regulation cuts at the core health care needs of families all across Long Island  This would be a devastating blow to local hospitals with rehabilitation units across Long Island  leaving residents with routine operations like hip and knee replacements devoid of vital short term treatment  said Senator Schumer  Unless we roll back this ill devised rule  these hospitals throughout Nassau and Suffolk will be hard pressed to meet patient quotas and stay financially afloat  But with quick action  well freeze the 75 percent rule in its tracks  giving these medical centers the room to flourish  and allowing patients to take advantage of their unique and high quality services    The 75  Rule is a Medicare requirement established in 1983 that has never been fully revised to capture conditions now treatable due to medical advancements  In 2005  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  proposed the reinstatement of the rule  requiring Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities  IRF  and hospitals with rehabilitation units to prove that at least 75 percent of its patients require services to treat one of thirteen specific conditions  The current threshold is set at 65 percent of patients  but is scheduled to rise to 75 percent in July 2008   The full implementation of the 75  Rule could result in dire financial consequences for hospitals with rehabilitation units like the Nassau University Medical Center  By drastically reducing the number of patients allowed to receive care at the hospital  the rule forces hospitals to turn away patients  including patients who are not Medicare beneficiaries  In addition  non compliance would result in the revocation of Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility  IRF  status  making facilities ineligible to receive reimbursement for services from Medicare  With such a drastic decrease in patient population and Medicare reimbursements  many facilities would be unable to continue to serve rehabilitation patients and may close their units    According to an American Hospital Association  AHA  national analysis  as many as 88 000 Medicare patients lost access to inpatient rehabilitation hospital services in the first two years since the 75  Rule took effect  The impact of full implementation of the rule may be particularly devastating for rehabilitation units in hospitals  AHA estimates that if the 75  Rule is reinstated  as many as twenty three percent of the IRFs in the country would close    Moreover  the rule will also sharply curtail the ability of patients on Long Island to receive treatment from one of these specialized medical units  Schumer noted that today rehabilitation is used to treat a much wider range of injuries than when the rule was first implemented  Long Island residents in need of rehabilitation following knee and hip replacement would not qualify under the pre determined conditions  and would be forced to make up less than 25  of patients at the rehabilitation hospitals   At St  Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson  2 100 patients are admitted annually for rehabilitation in its 110 bed rehab unit  It is estimated that the hospital could lose as much as  7 million per year and be forced to turn away approximately 700 people per year if the regulations are implemented  At Nassau University Medical Center  it is estimated that over 50 patients would be turned away annually at a loss of over  1 million per year    Other Long Island hospitals certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services include Mercy Medical Center  Long Beach Medical Center  North Shore University Hospital at Glen Cove  and Southside Hospital  The implementation of this rule would result in the turning away of thousands of patients and the loss of tens of millions of per year at hospitals throughout Long Island   Schumer is a cosponsor S  543  the Senate bill  Preserving Patient Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals Act of 2007  which will improve Medicare beneficiary access by freezing the rule at the current 60 percent level  Such a freeze protects rehabilitation hospitals from being financially starved by Medicare and guarantees patients across Long Island the access to the treatment and rehabilitation services that they need   Schumer was joined today by Arthur Gianelli  President and CEO of the Nassau Health Care Corporation  Dr  Steve Walerstein  Senior VP for Medical Affairs and Medical Director at Nassau University Medical Center  Dr  Lyn Weiss  Chair of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Nassau University Medical Center  Kevin Dahill  President and CEO of the Nassau Suffolk Hospital Council  Gwen O Shea  CEO of the Health and Welfare Council of LI  and scores of
