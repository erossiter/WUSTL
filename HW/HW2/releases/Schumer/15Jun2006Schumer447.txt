IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 15  2006 Schumer Urges Nuclear Health Advisory Board To Support Nuclear Workers   Claim

                                 Schumer Tells The Advisory Board That Too Many Workers are Still Being Denied Full and Due Compensation   Schumer  Data Used by the NIOSH Does Not Tell the Whole Story U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today submitted written testimony to the Advisory Board of Radiation and Worker Health supporting the claims of former Bethlehem Steel nuclear workers who are still being denied compensation for excessive radiation exposure they endured while working at nuclear weapons facilities during World War II  Schumer argued that the information that National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  is using in dose reconstruction models does not place Bethlehem workers in their correct working environments  and does not accurately estimate the amount of radiation the workers may have been exposed to while working at the plant  Schumer called on the Board and the NIOSH to completely overhaul the current Bethlehem Steel site profile using only the existing Bethlehem data  and not records and data from another plant         We need to give New York  s Cold War heroes the support they need and the compensation they deserve     Schumer said    These former nuclear workers became dangerously ill developing the country s nuclear weapons program  and should not have to wait a minute longer for help  Too many have died already  some of them perhaps from exposure to radiation     Schumer added    Before NIOSH and the Board can make a fair and final decision  they need complete and accurate information  plain and simple          In his testimony  Schumer also asked the Board and NIOSH to work with Ed Walker and the Bethlehem Steel Action Group and allow them to apply for a Special Exposure Cohort  Being added to a cohort means that the former employees do not have to go through a controversial dose reconstruction  Instead  if a person has an eligible cancer and worked at a facility when weapons work was performed  their illness will automatically be considered as caused by workplace exposure       Western New York has one of the largest concentrations of facilities involved in nuclear weapons production related activities in the nation  yet continues to be severely underserved by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  EEOICPA   Schumer suggests that many former nuclear workers have been unaware of the program or were not provided with sufficient information about how the claimant process worked  and that this program was ineffectual in its ability to address their questions and concerns properly  As a result  he feels it is even more important that the Bethlehem Site Profile meeting be held in Buffalo       During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help  Workers at these facilities handled high levels of radioactive materials and were responsible for helping to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War  Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer       Senator Schumer has aggressively worked to get aid for former nuclear workers in Western New York  In an effort to compensate these workers  Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allowed them to file claims with the US Department of Labor for individual payments of  150 000 and other benefits for medical treatments  Workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War were eligible  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history       In November 2004  Schumer successfully secured a mandate from Congress that establishes a resource center intended to provide Western New Yorkers with the support that they need to effectively navigate the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  Senator Schumer s language established a new resource center in Western New York that would help sick nuclear workers with their compensation applications
