Rochester Finger Lakes  80 m  Hudso As New Yorkers   savings rates hit all time lows  U S  Senator Chuck Schumer today unveiled new legislation aimed to help families and young people save through individual investment accounts  Under the America Saving for Personal Investment  Retirement  and Education  ASPIRE  Act of 2005  just introduced by a bipartisan coalition of Senators  every newborn child would have a savings account called a KIDS Account and given a one time  500 contribution to be eventually paid back to the government         This program is like Head Start for your piggy bank     Schumer said    One of the most amazing facts about our economy is that the vast majority of middle  and working class Americans have no real assets beyond the value of their homes  We need to do more to help Americans save  both for continued education and for retirement  and we need to make it happen as quickly as possible for future generations  The ASPIRE Act will help all Americans do that by starting accounts at birth  and it will help moderate income people build assets by providing a government match for part of their annual deposits          According to recent reports  savings rates are at historic lows  The Bureau of Economic Analysis has revealed that the personal savings rate averaged 10 4  as a percentage of disposable income in the 1980s  but in 2003 it average only 1 4   the lowest level since 1938  The average personal savings rate is now less than 2  of income  In addition  average credit card debt per household  according to AmericaSaves org  has increased from about  2 250 in 1990 to almost  9 000 in 2002       KIDS Accounts would be provided to every child born after December 31  2006 and would provide children with a one time  500 contribution  Children in households earning below the national median income will be eligible for a supplemental contribution of up to  500  The accounts will be supported by incentives designed to encourage savings  promote financial literacy  and expand asset building opportunities       Once established  families and others will be allowed to contribute additional resources into these accounts  The Senate bill allows for contributions up to  1 000 a year  These voluntary contributions will be after tax and will not be tax deductible  but account earnings will be tax free  To further encourage investment  children in households earning below the national median income will be eligible to receive a dollar for dollar match on the first  500 contributed to the account  The automatic initial government contribution of  500 must eventually be paid back       Schumer today released a new analysis showing how much New York families in each county stand to earn from the KIDS Accounts over a 10 year period  Specifically  Schumer found that over a 10 year period           Families in the Capital Region could build assets of at least  64 million through KIDS Accounts        Families in Central New York could build assets of at least  60 million through KIDS Accounts        Families in the Hudson Valley could build assets of at least  173 million through KIDS Accounts        Families in the Rochester Finger Lakes area could build assets of at least  80 million through KIDS Accounts        Families in the North Country could build assets of at least  34 million through KIDS Accounts        Families in the Southern Tier could build assets of at least  38 million through KIDS Accounts        Families in Western New York could build assets of at least  92 million through KIDS Accounts         I look forward to working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to make this bill a reality  and help middle class Americans build assets and savings instead of more debt     said Senator Schumer  The ASPIRE legislation  S  868  was also introduced by Senators Rick Santorum  R PA   Jon Corzine  D NJ  and Jim DeMint  R SC  and has been referred to the Finance Committee  of which Senator Schumer is a member       The ASPIRE legislation will establish the KIDS Account Fund within the Department of Treasury  which will be governed by a Board of Directors similar in structure to the Board that oversees the Thrift Savings Plan  TSP   the retirement program for federal employees  As with the TSP  investments will be managed by a private sector firm  After accountholders turn 18 they will be able to keep their accounts with this Fund or transfer them to a private sector Roth IRA provider or a Section 529 plan for post secondary education       Click to view study
