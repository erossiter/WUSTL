IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 30  2005 Schumer Reveals  Safety Gap On Inter City   Chinatown   Buses  Rated Dangerously Low On Safety By Feds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Two Buses Recently Caught on Fire Mid Ride  Passengers Were Lucky to Escape  Lawmaker Urges Feds to Hold More Surprise Inspections  Devote More Staff to Low Fare Carriers  and Disclose Safety Ratings for Shadow Bus Companies U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that cheap   Chinatown    bus services and a number of other bus tour providers are sorely lacking in passenger safety  According to Federal criteria  Chinatown buses do much worse than other companies in several Safety Evaluation Areas  SEA   which rate a bus services   drivers  vehicles  and overall safety management  Recent accidents on a few of these   Chinatown   buses have raised serious questions about the safety of passengers riding to and from New York City to a variety of other cities on the East Coast  An examination of publicly available ratings and statistics show that low cost    Chinatown   buses score dramatically lower than other bus services        Schumer is urging the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA   the federal government agency which is charged with the responsibility for buses nationwide  to fully investigate past incidents  increase the number of surprise inspections  make sure that safety ratings are clearly disclosed on buses for riders to see  and ensure that no bus that does not meet a minimum passing rating can drive out of the station loaded with passengers          Chinatown   buses operate over 350 trips out of NYC a week to Boston  Philadelphia  and Washington  D C  alone  This means that hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are carried to and from New York City every year on these low cost buses         It is good to have low fare competitors  but the low fare means little if the buses aren  t safe     Schumer stated    Passengers who ride low priced buses deserve more than just a cheap ticket  they deserve to know that their families will arrive at their destination safely            The bottom line is that some of these   Chinatown   bus lines have dangerously low safety ratings     Schumer said       After talking with experts at the FMCSA  Schumer  s office learned that the budget has not increased at the federal agency since the advent of these   Chinatown   bus companies and staff investigators are much too overextended and cannot handle such a vastly increased workload  Nationwide  the FMSCA has only 700 federal investigators to monitor thousands of bus companies and hundreds of thousands of buses lines  And with the rise of at least 30 more low cost   Chinatown   fixed route bus companies in the Northeast alone in recent years nearly doubles the previous number of companies that FMSCA inspectors were responsible for  without any increase in staff or resources       Schumer proposed a four step plan to make   Chinatown   buses safer so consumers can have both cheap ticket and a peace of mind   1  Surprise Inspections  Currently the FMCSA generally does not do surprise inspections  The FMCSA  state  and local authorities should do surprise inspections so that the inspectors get a candid look at the buses before they can hit the road    2  More Resources  Right now the FCMSA only has 700 bus inspectors around the country to inspect and monitor 2300 bus lines nationwide running hundreds of thousands of trips each year  Clearly the FMCSA is overstretched and cannot always do adequate inspections  More inspectors would allow for more surprise real time inspections   3  Disclosure  The bus company should be forced to post their last inspection rating along with the national average so the consumer knows what kind of bus he is riding on  This should be in plain English that explains  for instance  that a rating of 98  means 98  of buses did better than this one    4  Prevent Unsafe Buses Drivers from Operating  Ensure that no bus or driver operating a bus that does not meet a minimum pass rating can drive out of the station loaded with passengers        Government safety inspectors use Safety Evaluation Areas  SEA  ratings  which rate a bus services   drivers  vehicles  and overall safety management  to decide which buses should be inspected  The ratings are based on crash history  driver history and safety management experience and are given along a scale of 1 to 100  with 100 being the most in need of safety inspection          Chinatown   buses and other similarly cheap bus services consistently rank worse than higher priced services like Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus Lines  For instance  Greyhound Bus Lines has a rating of 35  which puts it in the  pass  category  meaning no federal inspections are required  Peter Pan Bus Lines currently has an even better rating of 30  The lower the rating for these bus services  the higher the safety  the higher the rating  the lower the safety       The national average score for   Driver   Safety Evaluation Areas  SEA  is 24  the   Vehicle   Safety Evaluation Area score is 23  and Safety Management SEA score is 29        However  Chinatown buses scores 3 times worse than the federal national safety average  The average scores for four   Chinatown   companies show that they score in the 85th percentile for driver rating  22nd for vehicle  and 90th for overall safety management       Fung Wah  one of the largest discount bus lines with service mainly between New York and Boston has an inspection rating of 69    more than twice as bad as the national average  And Dragon Coach has a rating of 73  raising serious questions about its safety  New Century out of Philadelphia has an unimaginably dangerous ranking of 98  putting its buses at the highest priority for federal inspection        Only a few days ago  on August 16  2005  a Fung Wah bus from Boston to New York City caught fire mid ride and was forced to pull over  After evacuating passengers quickly  the bus was consumed by flames  A Dragon Coach bus from Albany to New York caught fire after crashing into a guard rail on I 787 injuring more than a dozen passengers in December of last year        Following this latest accident    Massachusetts state authorities have decided on surprise inspections for some buses  which is a very good first step    but won  t solve the more widespread safety problem for buses that don  t originate in Boston       While first started as a way for Chinese workers to work at restaurant jobs in different cities  i e  work in a D C  restaurant  live in New York City   these   Chinatown   buses are now very popular with college kids and others who may not have a lot of disposable income        Two years ago the FMSCA investigated 16 low cost bus lines on the Northeast  Out of those sixteen  eleven resulted in enforcement cases  Further investigation reveals that the low cost carriers have dramatically worse safety inspection ratings than the national average  A brief survey of some well known carriers between New York  DC  and Philadelphia shows that the average low fare company does much worse than national average on virtually every safety ranking       Schumer stated    It is important to give consumers more choices for low cost travel to and from New York  but we have to make sure that low cost travel from point A to point B is safe and secure          Click here to view
