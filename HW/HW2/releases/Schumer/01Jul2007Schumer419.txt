IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 1  2007 Schumer Reveals  Chinese Product Dangers Go Far Beyond Tires  Seafood And Toothpaste   Both China And U S  Not Inspecting Imports Nearly Enough  Leaving NY Consumers At Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Products Manufactured in China Account for Astounding 60 percent of Consumer Safety Recalls in 2007  Including Vitamins  Chocolate  and Gold Earrings   FDA Only Inspecting 1 percent of Food Imports  No Requirement to Conduct On Site Testing to Prevent Dangerous Products from Reaching NYC Store Shelves   With Half Dozen Fed Agencies Supposedly Monitoring Shipments  Schumer Calls f In the wake of new revelations that tainted seafood and dangerously defective tires were shipped from China and sold throughout New York City and the United States  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that over 100 New York bound shipments of Chinese goods had to be blocked after reaching the Port of New York due to safety and contamination concerns this year alone  Schumer said that a maze of federal regulations and lax safety measures in many Chinese plants have left New York consumers in danger of buying unsafe products  Schumer said that weekly recalls of Chinese goods that had already been sold throughout New   York and the country show that the system designed to keep dangerous products off store shelves is failing   This weeks revelations are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to contaminated and dangerous Chinese goods coming in to the U S   Schumer said  There is no question that too many Chinese manufacturers and food producers put the bottom line ahead of safety  The FDA and other agencies regulating the safety of imported goods need to do much more to address this worsening crisis  We need stricter standards  more thorough inspections  and harsher penalties for Chinese companies and American shippers that turn a blind eye to safety   Schumer said that recent recalls and import blocks of Chinese food and consumer products cover just a small percentage of the dangerous shipments of Chinese goods destined for our shores  Products manufactured in China so far have accounted for more than 60 percent of the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission s  CPSC  178 recalls in 2007  Yet all of these products fall into different agencies jurisdiction for regulation  Recently  the FDA  the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA   and the CPSC have all been called into action over dangerous imports from China    The CPSC  which is an independent agency  has initiated three major recalls this week alone of consumer products  all of which were manufactured in China and sold throughout the U S  The recalled items include  68 000 folding chairs sold nationally at hardware and discount stores that unexpectedly collapse and injure users  2 300 toy barbecue grills sold nationally at Target that have sharp edges that pose a laceration hazard  and1 2 million ceramic space heaters sold nationwide at major retailers that pose a fire hazard due to faulty power cords   Schumer said there have also been three CPSC recalls this June for lead contamination all for products manufactured in China and sold in New York  5 300 units of earrings sold at Kmart coated in lead paint were recalled on June 12  1 5 million units of wooden Thomas the Tank Engine trains were recalled on June 13  and 19 000 childrens necklaces whose clasps were coated in lead paint were recalled on June 19  From January of this year  the CPSC has issued 26 recalls of products comprising over 8 million units due to lead hazards  89 percent of which were manufactured in China with 93 percent of those units sold nationwide  including New York   At the same time  NHTSA  which is a part of the Department of Transportation  was notified of a major safety hazard  As many as 1 million defective Chinese tires were sold in the U S  by a New Jersey based tire company called Foreign Tire Sales and possibly six other distributors identified by FTS  At least 6 847 of those tires were sold in New York by Foreign Tire Sales  Inc  to New  York distributors including Truck and Tire Inc  in the Bronx  and Future Tire in Bethpage    From January to May  the FDA had to reject nearly 100 shipments of Chinese goods at the Port of New  York and New Jersey  with 70 percent of those refusals due to faults with the product that made the products hazardous to health  Reasons for refusal ranged from filthy  meaning the food was unfit for human consumption  to vetdrugres  short for veterinary drug residue that could cause drug resistance to antibiotics or cancer in humans  Vetdrugres was the reason behind the FDA detaining select Chinese seafood earlier this week  The 100 shipments that have been refused by the FDA represents only a fraction of the thousands of shipments from China that pass through New York ports unchecked every year   The fact that every week we have to frantically pull Chinese goods off store shelves shows that our safeguards are failing  Schumer added   China has increased overall its food imports to the United States by over 20 percent in the last year alone  Since 2004  the U S  has doubled agricultural inputs from China  In addition  One third of the world s vitamin A now comes from China  along with much of the supply of vitamin B 12 and many health food supplements  Earlier this year  lead contaminated multivitamins showed up on the shelves of U S  retailers   Despite this surge in food  drugs  and vitamins  the FDA has not done nearly enough to protect consumers in New York and across the country  The FDA normally inspects only 1 percent of all food and food ingredients at U S  borders and tests only about half of 1 percent  In the past year  the FDA rejected more than twice as many food shipments from China as from all other countries combined  Shockingly  the FDA plans to close nearly half of its 13 food testing labs  even though this country cannot afford any more cutbacks    The fact that the FDA is not doing nearly enough inspecting of food shipped from China to the New York area can cause serious consequences  On June 6  2007  Tristar Food Wholesale  located in Jersey City  recalled Chinese made Ferrari Chocolate that was sold throughout the New York area because it contains undeclared peanuts and aflatoxins in excess of the FDAs limits  Aflatoxins are known carcinogens    Recent findings of tainted seafood and toothpaste are just two of the hundreds of shipments of hazardous goods that have come in to New York  that the FDA has been unable to stop  let alone recognize  Tainted toothpaste has been found in discount stores throughout New York  New  Jersey  Pennsylvania and Maryland  It is unclear who manufactured it  but MS USA Trading  Inc  of North Bergen  N J   one of the paste s distributors  has issued a recall of the substance   Schumer today said that  not only are the Chinese government  manufacturers  and food producers turning a blind eye to safety  the federal government has not done nearly enough to keep dangerous Chinese products out of New York stores  In fact  there are more than a half dozen federal agencies responsible for monitoring  testing  and blocking dangerous or tainted shipments to the U S  including the FDA  NHTSA  CPSC  U S  Customs and Border Protection  U S  Department of Agriculture  and the United States Trade Representative    Schumer today said that this maze of federal oversight prevents the government from effectively stopping dangerous goods from getting through to American consumers  This maze includes cabinet level departments  independent agencies  and administrations within executive agencies  all operating with different regulations  rules  and protocols  To protect New York consumers from any more dangerous products from getting through  Schumer today announce a new five point plan to beef up federal safety protections    Creation of an Import Czar    To get control of the wide open U S  monitoring systems  Schumer today called for the creation of an Import Czar that would focus on the rising tide of Chinese goods coming in to the U S  The new Czar would be installed as part of the Department of Commerce and oversee all matters pertaining to consumer protection of imports including coordinating efforts of the other agencies charged with consumer safety related to imports  This Czar would issue a first ever public report on existing gaps in federal safeguards on imported products and the agencies will then have to report back within six months on their progress closing the identified gaps  The Czar would also actively monitor the day to day functions of all of agencies responsible for assuring consumers safety in regards to imported goods     New Labeling Standards  Schumer today wrote to the head of the FDA asking him to immediately implement new rules requiring all food  vitamin  and cosmetic companies to list out the origin of all ingredients that come from outside the United States  Four years ago  Congress passed a law requiring food to be labeled for its country of origin  But that doesn t extend to individual food ingredients  China has become the leading supplier of many food ingredients  such as apple juice  garlic and garlic powder  sausage casings and cocoa butter  China now supplies 80 percent of the world s vitamin C    Overhaul FDA Foreign Food Inspections  Right now  the FDA announces 90  of its inspections on foreign manufacturing facilities weeks in advance  With this advance notice  many facilities can clean up their act in time  In addition  FDA guidance on the inspection of drug manufacturing facilities abroad that said that sample collection is not required during inspections at foreign facilities  Schumer today urged the FDA to stop giving Chinese manufacturers prior notice of inspections and to collect sample products when inspecting foreign facilities    Mandate Overseas Inspections for Other Agencies  Currently  NHTSA and the CPSC do not require that products entering this country  such as tires in the case of NHTSA or toys in the case of CPSC  to undergo inspections in their point of origin  In addition  the plants that these products are manufactured in are not subject to spot checks  Because of this  these Chinese plants have no incentive to clean up their act  Schumer urged the NHTSA and the CPSC to mandate overseas inspections for facilities abroad    More Rigid Food Safety RequirementsIn May  Schumer co sponsored an amendment proposed by Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  that establishes an early warning and notification system for contaminated food  creates a system of fines for companies that dont report contaminated food products in a timely matter  and improves the inspections and monitoring of imported food This amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 94 0
