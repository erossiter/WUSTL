IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 1  2006 Schumer Reveals  Change In Aids Funding Bill Slashes More Than  79 Million From New York  s Fight Against HIV AIDS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New funding formula in CARE Act unjustly punishes New York State for accurately reporting HIV AIDS cases and effectively treating patients  New York HIV AIDS patients to lose critical prevention and treatment services   Schumer  Nadler blast unjust formula and pledge to restore vital funding for New York State  s HIV AIDS patients U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and U S  Representative Jerrold Nadler vowed today to fight a new funding formula in the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency  CARE  Act    the bill that authorizes federal money for cities and states to provide health care services for HIV and AIDS patients   which unjustly slashes at least  79 million in federal funding over the next three years for New York State  s HIV AIDS prevention and treatment programs  While New York State accounts for the highest percentage of HIV AIDS patients in the country  a funding flaw in the reauthorization of the CARE act will redirect funding from New York State to states with fewer HIV AIDS cases          This new funding formula defies every iota of reason  Why should New York State  which has the highest percentage of AIDS and HIV patients in the country  be stripped of its funding that goes to crucial treatment and prevention programs     Schumer asked    Plain and simple  this new formula punishes us for effectively utilizing money allocated by the original CARE act  We  ve reduced the number of HIV patients who eventually develop AIDS but we still have many patients to treat            The Administration s idea of creative solutions is to cut resources where the need is greatest     said Nadler    Health professionals in New York have their hands full caring for the highest concentration of HIV and AIDS patients in the country  yet we re told that  because of their good work  the funding supporting them will now be redirected elsewhere  How is that justifiable  Senator Schumer and I will be working with the congressional delegation to stop this insanity        New York State bears a disproportionate share of the HIV AIDS epidemic  With just 7 percent of the US population  it has 17 percent of all persons living with AIDS  As of December 2004  almost 110 000 New Yorkers were living with HIV AIDS  with approximately 6 000 new HIV diagnoses each year  In 2004  New York State reported more new AIDS cases and more new HIV cases than in any other state  More that 75 percent of New Yorkers living with HIV AIDS are persons of color        New York State is set to lose crucial money in part because of a new funding formula in the reauthorization bill  Previously  CARE Act funding was based only on living AIDS cases  but the current formula in this reauthorization includes both HIV and AIDS cases  New York has diligently tracked its HIV cases and has determined that it has 0 56 HIV case for every one AIDS case  Because some states do not have data as accurate as New York  s  in the funding formula these states are given the benefit of the doubt  and given a much higher estimate of HIV cases   0 9 HIV patients for every one AIDS case  This means that for every 100 AIDS patients in New York  New York will receive funding for 156 HIV and AIDS patients  In a handful of other states  for every 100 AIDS patients the state will receive funding for 190 HIV and AIDS patients  This leads to New York being punished for its own good work  giving it less money for having correctly implemented a new data tracking system and for having strong HIV prevention programs keep new HIV diagnoses lower than other jurisdictions  This one change alone will result in a transfer of  79 million over the next three years from New York to other states        The reauthorization of the CARE Act could diminish the positive force of the CARE Act and deplete resources available for New York  s HIV and AIDS patients  A decrease in funding would likely reduce the State  s ability to provide accessible and quality health care and supportive services for HIV and AIDS patients  In addition  likely reductions in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program  ADAP  funding would result in either fewer drugs provided to patients  more costs incurred by patients  or a greater burden borne by New York State  ADAP not only covers anti retrovirals that treat the virus directly  but also other drugs that are vital to treat other symptoms of AIDS patients such as insulin for diabetics   nutritional support products  and hematology drugs          Unless this ridiculous formula for distributing AIDS and HIV funding is reversed  patients who have come to rely on important treatment and prevention services will see a dramatic decrease and even elimination of these critical services such as housing  mental health  transportation  and nutrition and meal assistance     said Schumer        The Ryan White CARE Act was originally signed into law in 1990  and since 1991 has made federal funding available to both cities and states to provide a number of health care services for HIV and AIDS patients including medical care  drug treatments  dental care  home health care  and outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment  The CARE Act has played a leading role in improving the health and quality of life for New Yorkers with HIV AIDS  HIV and AIDS patients in New York State rely on Ryan White CARE Act funds to support ADAP  home care programs  the extension of primary care services to the uninsured and community based case management and supportive services programs
