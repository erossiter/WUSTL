IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 12  2006 With New York Lagging Behind Most States  Schumer Unveils New Plan To Promote Wi Fi Access Across Upstate    Deliver High Speed Internet To Thousands Of Homes And Businesses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     New York Ranked 31st in Percentage of Households with an Internet Connection  High Speed Internet is the Life Blood of the 21st Century Economy    With Wireless Hot Spots in High Demand  Senator to Propose New Federal Resource for Communities Looking to Create WI FI Networks  New Rules to Protect Wireless Customers from Hackers and ID Theft  Federal Funding for Rural and Underserved Communities In light of the rapid growth of wireless internet access in major cities across the country  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a new plan to bring wireless  including   Wi Fi     wireless fidelity  high speed internet access to homes  businesses  and communities across upstate New York  New York State currently ranks 31st among all 50 states in percentage of households with an internet connection   Dozens of communities across upstate are looking to create Wi Fi networks in public places  and even  covering the entire region   Schumer  s plan includes creating a federal resource for local communities who are looking to create wireless networks and tax incentives for individuals and businesses that purchase broadband or Wi Fi equipment         In an economy that is increasingly reliant on high speed internet  not having high speed Internet access is like not having air to breathe   said Schumer   With broadband technology the lifeblood of the new economy  it is more important than ever to bring high speed access to underserved communities   Wireless networks will connect upstate New York communities large and small in to the 21st Century economy and attract new types of business          Schumer  s report shows that upstate New York residents and businesses do not have sufficient access to high speed internet that is critical to businesses development in the 21st Century economy   According to Federal Communications Commission data  urban and densely populated counties have far more high speed internet providers with the vast majority of rural counties having less than three providers   According to an analysis done by ECC Associates  a internet consulting firm located in the Southern Tier  roughly 12 percent of homes in New York could not have access to a broadband connection  meaning they could not get high speed service  except for expensive satellite service  if they wanted   According to FCC data  there are 2 833 478 residences in New York connected to high speed internet lines       The presence of WI FI networks in cities and towns in upstate New York would give thousands of residents and businesses  which may not ordinarily have access to the web  the ability to utilize high speed internet   In addition  creating wireless high speed internet in rural areas would connect remote town centers to the 21st century economy and attract new types of businesses to the area   Pilot projects and new start ups are popping up across upstate New York with dozens of other communities planning on creating networks   Wi Fi networks are not the only type of wireless networks available  but they are the most prevalent       Right now  most wireless   hot spots    are limited to chain restaurants  coffee shops  and hotels  McDonalds  Starbucks  and Best Western provide Wi Fi access    However  some local governments across upstate New York  as large as Buffalo and Rochester and as small as Tivoli and Oneonta  have contracted with private companies to create wider scoped networks to cover public places and entire communities       There are currently 797 Wi Fi hotspots in all of upstate New York   Schumer today released a  detailing how many hotspots are in each county and the number of high speed internet providers currently serving each county across the state            There are 121 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in the Capital Region   The counties with urban centers typically have Nine high speed internet providers and the more rural counties have 3 or less            There are 93 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in Central New York   The counties with urban centers typically have Seven high speed internet providers and the more rural counties have 4 or less            There are 148 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in the Rochester Finger Lakes Region   The counties with urban centers typically have Eight high speed internet providers and the more rural counties have 3 or less            There are 18 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in the Hudson Valley   The counties with urban centers typically have Seven high speed internet providers and the more rural counties have 3 or less            There are 58 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in the North Country   These rural counties typically only have 3 or less high speed internet providers            There are 37 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in the Southern Tier   The counties with urban centers typically have Five high speed internet providers and the more rural counties have 3 or less            There are 152 wireless high speed internet   hot spots    currently active in the Western NY   The counties with urban centers typically have 11 high speed internet providers and the more rural counties have 4 or less       In order to promote the expansion of Wi Fi networks in communities across upstate New York  Schumer announced a new three point plan to direct federal resources and expertise to help local governments establish wireless networks  and provide broadband service to rural and underserved communities            Create a Comprehensive Federal Resource for Communities Looking to Start Wi Fi Networks  Schumer is calling on Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez to create a series of federal standards and best practices for creating wireless networks so communities who want to create these networks can navigate through any potential problems and can create a system that suits their needs   In his letter to Gutierrez  Schumer asked that there be a full time staffer employed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  NTIA  acting as a federal one stop shop for community leaders and local governments so their questions can be answered         Included in the best practices would be specific recommendations about size and scope of the network  appropriate prices for equipment  whether or not to charge users fees or use advertising based revenue to cover costs  and design specifications tailored to a community  s size  topography  and demography   Schumer also asked that NTIA encourage public private partnerships between communities and service providers to reduce cost and increase access to consumers by creating a comprehensive data based of certified companies   that provide and can create these networks       Schumer also called on the Commerce Department to coordinate with the FBI to craft a set of specific security standards to protect wireless users and prevent criminals from taking advantage of public internet services   Several law enforcement agencies have raised concerns about their ability to track and monitor Wi Fi users who may be using the network for nefarious activities  such as child pornography or identity theft   Schumer said the standards should include methods to trace the identity of users and set up firewalls to protect users   personal information            Tax Breaks for Broadband and Wi Fi Expansion  Schumer is pushing the bi partisan Broadband Tax Enhancement Act  S 1147   led by Senator Jay Rockefeller  D WV   which passed the Senate Finance Committee last week   Schumer  s legislation would permit individuals and businesses to deduct from their taxable income costs associated with the installation and connection of broadband and wireless networks in rural or underserved areas   This could significantly reduce the cost of creating Wi Fi networks and expanding existing broadband networks for consumers and businesses            Federal Funding to Expand Broadband in Rural and Underserved Communities  Schumer announced his going to offer an amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that would increase by  50 million  or a 10 percent increase  funding for the Rural Development Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee Program
