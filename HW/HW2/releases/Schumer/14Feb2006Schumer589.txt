IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 14  2006 Schumer Blasts Cuts To CDBG Program In Administration Budget    Fights To Restore Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Under Proposal  NYS Would Loose  80 Million    Would Have Devastating Effects On Upstate Communities   Schumer  CDBG Helps Our Communities Provide Good Jobs  Affordable Housing And Public Services U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today launched an effort to restore funding for the Community Development Block Grants  CDBG  Program for communities in New York State  which is slashed in the Administration  s budget proposal for fiscal year 2007  The CDBG Program is one of the most important and effective programs for revitalizing distressed communities and funds housing rehabilitation  support services  public improvements  and economic development projects in communities across the nation  The President  s proposal to fund the national CDBG program at  2 9 billion  a 20  reduction from last year  will devastate communities nationwide  Under the proposal  New York alone would be in jeopardy of losing  80 million         CDBG provides critical dollars to cities across New York     Schumer said    This is a program that helps America s most deserving communities create jobs  support local businesses  and keep our streets safe  CDBG is a lifeline to cities because many communities would not be able to find the funding or the flexibility they need without it  I m going to fight tooth and nail to restore this funding          In a personal letter to Senator Judd Gregg  Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget  and Senator Kent Conrad  Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on the Budget  Schumer wrote    CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results  It is vital that New York State retain its level CDBG funding in order to continue the many community development services that its citizens have come to rely upon  Therefore I urge the Senate Budget Committee to fully restore funding to the Community Development Block Grant Program          CDBG funding has allowed communities throughout upstate New York to fund critical community development projects  These cuts would result in mayors and local officials having to cut the staff that facilitates public service and facilitate public works programs and having to eliminate several community development programs altogether        In Rochester  CDBG funding is primarily used for low income housing programs  and for lead paint reduction and economic development  The proposed cuts put Rochester in jeopardy of losing more than  1 million  Monroe County uses CDBG funds to rehab housing  for community service programs  economic development loans and grants for public works and facilities improvements  and will have to scale back project funding as a result of the proposed cuts        Binghamton heavily relies upon CDBG to finance additional police and code officers  and stand to lose well over  300 000 of their funding  Even worse  if the funding to the CDBG program is not restored  Binghamton would have to raise property taxes to make up for its funding loss        The North Buffalo Community Center has a very strong  active senior citizen population that takes advantage of its many programs  which include full lunches  exercise programming  health and blood pressure checks  night events  and a van service which regularly brings in seniors from suburban areas  Over the past four or five years  it has sustained large cuts  resulting in a loss of most of its youth programming  as well as cuts to staff and senior programming  Under the proposed cut  its senior programming will shrink and seniors will find themselves without any other reason to leave their homes  On the East side of Buffalo  Pratt   Willert Community Center has been zero ed out due to the CDBG cuts  The Center serves one of the poorest communities in the city of Buffalo  offering senior and youth programming  and serving as a suspended school reporting site for the Buffalo Public Schools  Buffalo  as a whole  stands to lose  3 million of federal funds       In Onondaga County  CDBG fund many projects including housing  water lines  sewers  parks and libraries  Under the proposed cuts  they could see a 30   reduction in funding  resulting in less projects and staff        The budget cuts equate to a  1 million din lost funds to the City of Albany  This would force the city to reduce services  such as after school programs for inner city youth  housing rehabilitation for low and moderate income families  housing for the homeless and force the city to lay off 4 8 community development staff  Schenectady could get a 29   cut in funds  forcing a reduction in funds for community police officers  drug abuse resistance officers  street paving after winter storms  nonprofit agencies  small business loans  and services for the poor  Troy used some CDBG funding to bring homes up to fire code  These cuts would result in mayors and local officials having to cut the staff that facilitates public service and facilitate public works programs and having to eliminate several community development programs altogether        Plattsburgh relies on the CDBG program and have used  650 000 to renovate housing and commercial units downtown to create affordable rents for low income individuals  Without this program they would have to charge rents that would not be affordable  Since 1990 the city has created the   Street of Dreams    which started as 14 20 units in downtown Plattsburgh and is now all affordable housing  They have also benefited from the first time homebuyers program which renovates dilapidated single family homes so low and middle income families can buy homes  They stand to get no CDBG funding next year  Saint Lawrence County could loose funding for their low income first time home buyers program  for housing rehabilitation projects and economic development packages       Last year  Westchester County was forced to eliminate over  1 million for rehabilitation of affordable housing administered by the county due to cuts to their CDBG funding  Dutchess County uses CDBG to fund senior citizen rehabilitation programs which annually provides up to  15 000 to help income eligible seniors correct code violations in their homes  As it stands now  cuts to Dutchess County CDBG funds would mean this program would most likely need to be shut down  The cuts are just as deep in other parts of the Hudson Valley  with Orange and Rockland Counties receiving approximately 23   less than they did last year          CDBG funds are particularly important to communities throughout New York State     Schumer said    Cuts in CDBG would mean that public service programs  economic development programs and emergency repair housing projects throughout the state would go unfunded  It is unacceptable to force communities to bear this burden           HUD is the federal department principally responsible for community economic development  CDBG is the centerpiece of the Federal government  s efforts to help states and localities meet the needs of low income communities  The CDBG program was established to foster the undertaking of housing and community development activities in a coordinated and mutually supportive manner by federal agencies and programs  as well as by communities  HUD  s community development programs  coupled with HUD  s housing and homeless programs and supportive services  provide our communities with a comprehensive approach to serving the needs of residents  CDBG is the glue that holds other Federal programs serving low income communities together
