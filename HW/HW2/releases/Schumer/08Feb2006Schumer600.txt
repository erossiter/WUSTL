IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 8  2006 Schumer  Saxton Unveil Bipartisan Program To Improve Math And Science Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mathematics And Science Teaching Corps Act of 2006 Creates Federal Fellowship Program To Recruit  Train And Retain Outstanding Math And Science Teachers   Program Will Implement Proven Model To Improve Math And Science Education U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and Congressman Jim Saxton yesterday introduced the Mathematics and Science Teaching Corps Act of 2006  MSTC  pronounced   mystic      MSTC  S  2248 and H R  4705  is bipartisan legislation that creates a federal fellowship program to recruit  train and retain outstanding math and science teachers  The program will recruit aspiring and current teachers with strong content knowledge  and will involve approximately 20  of our nation  s secondary math and science teachers         Math and science are the key to America  s continued prosperity in our global economy     Senator Schumer said    Unfortunately  more and more math and science teachers come to the profession without expertise in the subjects they teach  Those who do have the expertise are offered much more money in the private sector  and make personal sacrifices in order to be in the classroom  We cannot hope to lead the world in mathematics and the sciences on the backs of a handful of highly skilled  self sacrificing individuals  MSTC is a step in the right direction to make sure we stay at the cutting edge of technology and remain the global leader in math and science           Teachers help shape our future work force  and math and science skills are vital parts of that future   said Saxton  Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of the House and Senate  and himself a former teacher   Congress needs to help recruit  train  and retain outstanding math and science teachers  The nation s secondary math and science teachers are critical to producing good students for the hi tech jobs of tomorrow  The Mathematics and Science Teaching Corps Act of 2006 would help cultivate a work force with skills that keep our nation competitive in a global economy  I m pleased to work with Sen  Schumer on this bipartisan approach        Prospective teachers with strong math and science backgrounds  as well as working teachers who have solid expertise in their fields  are often lured away from teaching by more lucrative and prestigious opportunities in the private sector  In exchange for a four year teaching commitment  MSTC will provide teaching certification in a one year master  s program for individuals who are highly skilled in math and science  Retention strategies will include district level mentoring  professional development  and federal financial incentives  Under MSTC  current teachers will commit to teaching for five years and serve as leaders in their school  mentor new teachers and participate in professional development  They will also receive federal financial incentives to keep them from leaving the classroom for the private sector       MSTC is based on three unique tenets       1  National Standards for Participation  All applicants  whether aspiring or working teachers  must perform at a satisfactory level on a National Academy of Science approved standardized test of subject knowledge  In addition to strong knowledge of subject matter  candidates must demonstrate strong verbal skills as well as other attributes that are linked to effective teaching        2  Financial Incentives  During their years in the program  all corps members will receive stipends from the federal government in addition to their regular salaries  New teachers   stipends will begin at  11 000 and scale up to  20 000 during their four year teaching period  while working teachers   stipends will be set at  20 000 per year  Corps members teaching in hard to staff schools may receive enhanced stipends        3  Building Prestige and Respect Through a National Program  As members of a teacher corps  participants will experience a high level of enthusiasm and solidarity  In addition  the highly visible teacher corps will build prestige and respect for the field of math and science teaching       The President  s State of the Union address highlighted this need  but Senator Schumer and Congressman Saxton think Congress needs to go a step further  The President  s program would spend  25 million on math and science teachers  but would primarily aim to bring math and science professionals in to schools as adjunct teachers  MSTC  however  will invest in 20  of the teacher population once it has fully ramped up  and will integrate math and science experts as full time teaching staff who will be an integral part of the school community even as they provide top rate teaching       MSTC is based on a successful program in New York City called the Newton Fellowship Program  which is operated by a non profit organization called Math for America
