IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 23  2007 Schumer Calls on New Delta CEO to Make Beleauguered Syracuse to Atlanta Route Top Priority   Stresses Time is Ripe to Upgrade Air Service That is Plagued by Soaring Fares  Smaller  Crammed Planes                                                                                                                                                                                                              Recent Service Cuts have Shrunk Daily Route Capacity from 630 to Less than 300 Passengers  Sent Ticket Prices Spiraling to as High as  1400  and Left Central New Yorkers Jam Packed on Small Aircraft    At Schumer s Request  Last Week Syracuse Mayor Matt Driscoll  the MDA and Top Delta Management met in Atlanta to Discuss Improving Air Service Between Two Cities and the Overall Relationship bet With Delta AirLinesthis week announcing the appointment of a new CEO in Richard H  Anderson  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on Anderson to make upgrading the beleaguered route between Syracuse  NY and Atlanta  GA a top priority as he settles into his new position  The current route between the two cities is plagued bydecreased capacity and skyrocketing fares  The airlines recent service cuts between the two cities have left passengersfrequentlypayingas high as 1 400 to fly on small  uncomfortable aircraft  and could potentially hamperCentral New York seconomic growth    In a personal letter sent to the new CEO today  Schumer requested that he personally examine the route and pursue options that will improve the affordability and reliability of air service between Syracuses Hancock International Airport and Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport  which serves as a national hub for Central New Yorkers  Schumer also assisted in arranging a meeting held last week betweenSyracuse Mayor Matt Driscoll  officials of the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York  MDA  and executives from Delta AirLines to discuss improvingservice between the two cities andimproving the overall relationship between Delta and Hancock International Airport    I welcome Deltas new CEO Richard Anderson and encourage him to take this golden opportunity to close the chapter on the existing substandard air service between Syracuse and Atlanta that leaves passengers paying outrageous ticket prices just to be jam packed on crammed planes  said Senator Schumer  Today I am calling on the new CEO to make improving the affordability and reliability of air service between the two cities a top priority  Its vital to Central New Yorkers and the regions economic revitalization   Mayor Matt Driscoll said  Delta has been a long standing service provider to the Syracuse airport community  The Atlanta service is extremely important to the Central New York business traveler  It is our intention to continue the recent dialogue and communication with the new leadership at Delta to reduce the fare structure in Syracuse    We had an open and frank discussion with Delta and made it clear that airfares between Syracuse and Atlanta must come down to a reasonable level  said Irwin L  Davis  president and CEO of the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and CNY  We continue our dialogue with Delta executives and expect to see positive results in the coming weeks  If the current exorbitant fares and reduced service levels remain in place  the MDA will work closely with Senator Schumer and Mayor Driscoll to further address this issue   Over the past several years  the quality and frequency ofDelta service between Syracuse and Atlanta has substantially declined  leaving passengers with fewer options and higher ticket prices  In 2005  Delta operated 5 flights a day to Atlanta  four of the flights were served by MD 80 aircraft which have a capacity of 142people  the fifth flight was served by a 70 seat flight regional jet  giving the route a total capacity of 638people per day  Tickets were generally priced between  500 600 roundtrip  a price that  while expensive  fit within budget for business travelers   By 2006  Delta wasoperating5 flights a day  but instead using smaller  less comfortable planes  which reduced the overall daily service between the two cities to 400 people  Today  Delta uses four 50 seat regional jets and one 70 seat plane to fly the route  This new schedule eliminatedthe one MD 80 still making the tripand reduces the total daily capacity to270passengers    Further burdening passengers is the fact that average prices for the route now ranges from  900 to  1400  Senator Schumer added  Its absurd that the short flight between Syracuse and Atlanta can be more expensive than flying to London  Hawaii or Hong Kong    In recent years  job growth in Syracuse has increased faster than the national average due to the strength of the regions budding technology  bioscience and financial services sectors  For many new and existing businesses flying  Hancock airport in Atlanta is a critical business destination  A recent survey by the MDA found that 64  of respondents rated Atlanta as an important or highly important destination for their business  Located just minutes from downtown Syracuse  the airport serves 1 8 million travelers inacatchment area inCentral New York  Today  Schumer stressed the time was ripe to turn over a newleafin air service between Syracuse and Atlanta  arguing the new CEO should make upgrading the quality of service between the two cities a top priority   On Tuesday  Delta named Anderson  the former head of Northwest and a Delta board member  as its chief executive  Anderson  succeeding former CEO Gerald Grinstein  spent 14 years at Northwest  where he was chief executive  before leaving in 2004 for UnitedHealth  Previously  he worked for three years at Continental Airlines   In June  Schumer called onoutgoingDelta CEO Grinstein to reverse the cut backs in service between the two cities and work to provide Central New Yorkers with affordable  regular and quality air service to Atlanta  In his letter to the CEOGrinstein  Schumer wrote  In recent years  thelevel of servicebetween these two cities has decreased  the size of the aircraft flying the routecut back  and the fares raised  These cut backs represent an unnecessary burden to Central New York travelers and have limited economic growth in Central New York
