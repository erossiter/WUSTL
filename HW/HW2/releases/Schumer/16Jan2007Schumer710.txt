                                     Unscrupulous Preparers Target Taxpayers by Disguising High Interest Loans as Immediate   Tax Refunds    and New   Pay Stub Loans    That Don  t Even Require a Tax Return or Credit Check to Get the Loan   Senator Unveils Plan to Regulate Tax Preparers  Require Greater Disclosure of Loan Terms  and Will Call on the IRS and the Federal Reserve to Crack Down on New Scam   Schumer  To Be Forewarned is to be Forearmed    We Must Get the Word Out to Taxpayers to Stay Away from these Scams and Avoid Getting Cheated As tax day approaches  thousands of New Yorkers could be getting cheated out of millions of dollars in tax refund loan scams that have popped up all over New York  In an effort to combat this scenario and a new scam where taxpayers can get refund loans without a W2 form or even a credit check  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer will outlined a new plan to stop these predatory lenders from continuing this unregulated usurious practice  These   instant refunds    or   pay day loans    are actually  short term  high interest loans secured by the recipient s tax refund and advertised as instant tax refunds by lenders  Customers are charged interest rates that can go as high as 700 percent annually to get their own tax dollars back from the government just a few weeks faster than they otherwise would         New Yorkers work hard for every dollar they make and shouldn  t be duped by these wolves in sheep  s clothing     Schumer    This is a scam  plain and simple  and the emergence of these new pay stub loans shows the scam is on the march   The bottom line is  New Yorkers  and people all over the country  are getting ripped off by these so called refund loans  and it  s time to stop them dead in their tracks          Refund Anticipation Loans are high cost loans secured by and repaid directly from the proceeds of a taxpayer  s refund from the IRS  RALs usually run for 7 14 days    the difference between when the RAL is made and when it is repaid by deposit of the taxpayer  s refund  As is often the case with terrible financial deals  RALs are targeted at low income consumers  who are often in need of funds quickly        According to the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project  538 923 New Yorkers took out RALs in 2004  the last year data is available  The NCLC reports that 18  of consumers have taken out a RAL at some point   Of these consumers  two thirds did not realize a RAL is a loan  Consumers paid an estimated  1 24 billion in RAL fees to get quick cash for their refunds  essentially borrowing their own money at extremely high interest rates   Schumer said that  according to an analysis conducted by his office  upstate New Yorkers were bilked out of  30 million in 2003 by these scams       These loans are advertised all over the country as   instant tax refunds    with catchy slogans and colorful advertisements  Generally  a taxpayer goes into a tax preparer and is told that their refund can be made available immediately rather then waiting 10 14 days to get the IRS to process the refund  Loan Fees can range from anywhere from  30 to  150 depending on the combination of costs  which is steep  especially when consumers don  t realize that they are getting a loan  This charge does not include tax preparation fees which average almost  150   Though the charges may not seem extraordinarily high  depending in the size of the loan it means paying an effective annual interest rate of 40 percent to more than 700 percent according to the NCLC       Once a taxpayer decides on receiving their   instant tax refund     the tax preparer then sends a request to the IRS to see whether that person is entitled to a full refund  partial refund  or nothing at all  The IRS tells the preparer what they  re entitled to  the preparer calculates the expected refund  minus the fees  The refund is then processed within 7 14 days and deposited into a dummy bank account set up by the preparer in the name of the recipient  The preparer then keeps the difference       Schumer today also warned of a new scam that makes it even easier to get these high cost RALs   Tax preparers are now offering loans based on a person  s projected tax refund using his or her pay stub   The loans are intended to hook taxpayers in to coming back to get their taxes done during tax season   At that time  tax preparers try to get borrowers to repay their so called   pay stub    loans by taking out a second high cost RAL   Most pay stub loans carry the same triple digit annual percentage rates and mark another sign that usurious refund anticipation loans are spreading rapidly         Last year  pay stub RALs were only offered by a few tax preparers   Now  they have become widespread and are being pushed by the major tax preparers  Tax preparers have already started heavily advertising these loans as   Instant Money Now    and   HELP Holiday Express Loan Programs      What the consumer doesn  t know is that pay stub loans often may have to use a specific debit card  with additional fees  to access their money       To combat the pervasiveness of these scams  Schumer today announced he was going to reintroduce an updated version of the Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act  S  832  that specifically targets RALs   His legislation  which passed the Senate Finance Committee last year  would             Prohibit refund anticipation loans that utilize EITC benefits  Most refund anticipation loans are targeted at low income taxpayers  Nationwide  there were a total of 12 17 million sold in 2004  79  of these were made to low income households and over 50  were made to EITC recipients             Require that the Treasury Department provide the opportunity for low and moderate income taxpayers to open a low cost direct deposit account at a federally insured bank or credit union through the use of appropriate tax forms  Filing electronically and having the refund direct deposited into a bank or credit union account permits taxpayers to receive their refunds in approximately seven to ten days  without paying the high fees associated with RALs             End the Debt Indicator  DI  program which shares taxpayers  personal information   beyond what is necessary   with tax preparers  In the RAL application process  the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  reduces the risk that lenders take on RALs by providing them with a Debt Indicator  DI  on all IRS e file acknowledgments       Schumer today also said that he would send letters this week to government agencies that regulate taxes and personal loans  including IRS Commissioner Mark Everson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernenke  asking them to conduct an immediate investigation in to the rise of the new pay stub loans and make specific recommendations about ways to crack down on them
