IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 4  2006 Schumer To Feds    Don  t Burn New York Twice       Senator Reveals Initial CDC Proposal Slashes NYS  s Bioterror Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               As just last week New Yorkers found out that Homeland Security funding for New York was slashed by 40   today Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that funding for bioterrorism preparedness could also be cut dramatically  Schumer today called on CDC to provide an accounting for this cut and demanded that funding be restored before the figures become permanent       Just this week we heard the administration was slashing our homeland security funding  which abjectly defies reason  but these proposed cuts in bioterror preparedness is like rubbing salt in a gaping wound     Schumer said    This Administration allocates funding like children play pin the tail on the donkey  blindfolded        Schumer learned that the Centers for Disease Control  in their initial proposal for funding for bioterror preparedness is getting ready to severely shortchange New York  Under the current preliminary CDC public health and bioterrorism preparedness grant funding formula  the most populous cities and states in the United States will confront significant losses in grant money  Less populous cities and states  which have a lower risk of bioterrorism attack  will face disproportionately smaller decreases in funding  If the grant distribution for FY 2006 is not altered and CDC  s initial grant estimates hold true  New York State stands to lose 17  of its FY 2005 base funding level and New York City will lose 15    These dramatic decreases in funding will significantly undermine the bioterrorism and public health preparedness infrastructure and workforce capacity that has advanced in New York State in part because of the CDC grants      At the same time that the CDC funds dedicated to New York State  s public health and bioterrorism preparedness are slated for a significant decrease  the CDC is also urging New York State to expand its preparedness activities by adding three to five public health laboratory facilities capable of analyzing chemical agents  The addition of three to five labs without supplemental funding would undercut the work of already well established labs  such as New York State Department of Health  s Wadsworth Center      New York City has leveraged these CDC funds to improve detection of and response potential bioterrorism threat  For example  the City has deployed BioWatch air samplers to detect the presence of an airborne threat in densely populated areas  According to the Congressional Research Service  it costs a city approximately  1 million to install these samplers and  1 million in annual operation costs  The City has also invested in its public health workforce  hiring almost 200 new staff using emergency preparedness dollars  and creating a Medical Reserve Corps of 4600 public health responders  New York has also established efficient communication systems to keep information flowing to staff  responders  and the public  as well as an Emergency Operations Center to coordinate the response to an attack     In his letter to Julie Gerberding  director of the CDC  Schumer wrote    The FY 2006 grant allocation removes funding from established state and city bioterrorism and public health preparedness programs  leaving higher risk states and cities with unmanageable holes in funding  These holes  if left unplugged  will diminish any progress in preparedness these cities and states have accomplished over the previous years of CDC  s public health preparedness and bioterrorism response  I urge you to take immediate action and reconsider CDC  s proposed distribution of public health preparedness and response to bioterrorism grants to appropriately reflect the risk factors of more populous states        Earlier this week  the Department of Homeland Security released funding allocations for its major state and local grant programs  including the State Homeland Security Grant Program  SHSP   and the High Threat Urban Areas Program  UASI  that gives money only to high threat urban areas  Funding for New York State and New York City was cut significantly from FY2005 to FY2006      Specifically for the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI   the high threat money actually given out by the program was cut from  829 7 million in FY2005 to  710 6 million for FY2006  or a 14 percent drop  However  New York City  s allocation was slashed by 40 percent  from  207 6 million in FY2005 to only  124 5 million  In FY2005  New York City received 25 percent of the high threat funding  but for FY2006  New York City will only recieve18 percent of the funding
