                                 Just Weeks Before the Midterm Elections  Renzi s Chief of Staff Called Paul Charlton s Office to Discuss Federal Investigation   Justice Department Did Not Issue Key Approvals in Renzi Corruption Investigation Until After November 2006 Elections  According to Wall Street Journal   Schumer Requests Justice Department Disclose All Contacts with White House and Renzi s Office Relate WASHINGTON  DC   In light of media reports today that describe previously undisclosed contact between Congressman Renzi s office and the office of former Arizona U S  Attorney Paul Charlton  today Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  said that the revelations raise  new and serious questions  about Charlton s dismissal  namely whether Charlton s firing was connected to the ongoing Renzi probe   In a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  Schumer requested that the Justice Department disclose all contacts related to the Renzi investigation with the White House  Renzi s office  or other parties so that the Senate Judiciary Committee may investigative whether improper political motivations played a role in Charlton s dismissal       Specifically  media reports today indicate that   just weeks before the November 2006 midterm elections   Renzi s Chief of Staff called Paul Charlton s office to discuss media reports of a pending indictment related to Renzi s role in a 2005 land deal   According to another report  the Justice Department failed to issue key approvals in the Renzi investigation   approvals requested by Charlton s office   until after the 2006 midterm elections   The next month  in December 2006  Paul Charlton was asked to resign       The full text of Senator Schumer s letter is reproduced below      April 25  2007     The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  United States Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530     Dear Attorney General Gonzales     I read this morning  with grave concern  media reports describing previously undisclosed contacts between the office of Congressman Renzi and dismissed Arizona United States Attorney Paul Charlton   In particular  the Associated Press reports that Mr  Renzi s chief of staff has acknowledged that he called Mr  Charlton s office shortly after learning that Mr  Charlton had opened an investigation into Mr  Renzi s conduct in a 2005 land exchange   Based on preliminary reports  at least  these contacts could potentially be construed as designed to inappropriately affect the timing of charging decisions in a politically sensitive investigation around the time of the November election    Moreover  in another troubling story  the Wall Street Journal today reports that   a s midterm elections approached last November  federal investigators in Arizona faced unexpected obstacles in getting needed Justice Department approvals to advance a corruption investigation  of Mr  Renzi     Taken together  today s reports raise new and serious questions about whether improper political motivations were involved in your decision to force Mr  Charlton to resign just a few weeks after the election   To date  there has not been a compelling case made that Mr  Charlton deserved to be dismissed based on his performance as the chief federal prosecutor in Arizona    I am troubled by the possibility that the practice of having U S  attorneys coordinate with the Justice Department s Public Integrity Section in cases involving lawmakers  which is intended to be a check on politicization  may have been used in this instance for the contrary purpose of influencing a case for political reasons    Given the sensitivity of this matter and the declining public confidence in your handling of the U S  Attorney firings  please provide answers to the following questions no later than the close of business on Friday     o Please explain why the alleged contacts between Representative Renzi s office and Mr  Charlton s  which appear to have been reported to the Department  have not been previously disclosed    o Please describe with particularity any and all contacts that occurred between anyone in Representative Renzi s office and the Justice Department    o Please describe with particularity any and all contacts that occurred between anyone at the White House and the Justice Department about any investigation involving Representative Renzi    o Please describe with particularity any and all contacts that occurred between any third party  including lobbyists  party officials  or other outsiders  and the Justice Department about any investigation involving Representative Renzi    I thank you for your prompt attention to this matter    Sincerely    Charles E  Schumer  United States Senator
