IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 6  2005 Schumer  Spate Of Low Flying Helicopters This Summer Making Life Miserable For Long Island Communities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Schumer says Badly Needed FAA Plan to Redesign LI Airspace   Key to Reducing Low Flying Helicopters Over Long Island   Now Nearly Two Years Overdue      Schumer Calls on FAA to set up Network of Helicopter Lanes to have Pilots Fly over Water and Avoid Residential Areas In the midst of the summer travel season Long Island residents are once again faced with a spike in noise coming from low flying helicopters  mostly those flying from New York City out to the East End of Long Island  In an effort to relieve Long Islanders  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the FAA to complete a long overdue redesign of New York City Area Airspace  and to include helicopter noise considerations as part of its plan  He also called on the FAA to set up a strict network of helicopter lanes that would divert pilots to fly over water and avoid residential areas  Helicopters on Long Island can basically fly anywhere with no true minimum and maximum altitudes  There are predetermined routes in some areas  but for the most part helicopters fly unregulated  Even worse  helicopters in high traffic areas are forced to fly lower  around 600 feet to avoid air traffic         The bottom line is we could have been well on our way to fixing helicopter noise over Long Island if the FAA wasn  t dragging its feet     Schumer said       Helicopters have no minimum altitude requirements when en route  although they must maintain safe clearance from obstructions on the ground  In areas where airspace is congested  especially near commercial airports  the FAA does have some specified routes and altitude requirements designed to keep larger aircraft and helicopters at a safe distance  Helicopter pilots must comply with these prescribed routes or altitudes in certain areas   Helicopter noise has become more than a nuisance to Long Islanders in the summer when traffic to and from the Hamptons is markedly higher than during other seasons with residents of the North Shore of Long Island bearing brunt of it  Particularly the town of Brookhaven and communities that include but may not be limited to Port Jefferson  Poquott  Mount Sinai  Sound Beach  Belle Terre and Centereach  In 2000  the NRDC calculated that more than 140 000 helicopters flew over the New York area yearly  Additionally  local residents have noticed a dramatic spike in traffic over the last two years that they say are now above pre 9 11 levels       Schumer also said today that the FAA s delays on massive New York airspace redesign are hampering efforts to reduce helicopter noise over Long Island  That project is now projected to be at least four years late  Before the project can proceed  the FAA must complete a draft Environmental Impact Statement  which was originally set for release in 2003  After multiple delays  it is now not expected at least until this fall       The FAA has cited the fact that internal agency work is taking longer than expected as a reason for the plan s delays  In strong language  Schumer called on the FAA to complete both the preliminary study and the airspace redesign as quickly as possible to improve safety and efficiency in the entire region and also alleviate the irritation of low flying helicopters over New Yorker  s homes  The goal of the plan is to allow all aircraft  including commercial flights  general aviation and small plane traffic  and all helicopters to fly at a higher altitude longer over the New York City area  Once the plan is implemented  helicopters would be able to fly higher without coming too close with incoming flights       In 1998  the Federal Aviation Agency  FAA  initiated the National Airspace System Redesign program to maintain safety  decrease delays  and reduce congestion in the American airspace  particularly in the crowded airspace between Philadelphia and Boston  Testifying before the House of Representatives in October 1999  then FAA Administrator Jane Garvey promised that the  Redesign is expected to take approximately eight years to be implemented across the entire country  but tangible benefits are expected in the eastern portion of the United States within five years   Schumer said that seven years later the FAA has made little progress and  on the FAA  s timetable  Long Islanders are still a long way from relief       A 1999 Natural Resources Defense Council study on the environmental impact of helicopter noise on the tri state region found that helicopters are inadequately regulated with no minimum flight altitudes or required flight paths in most places  Supervision of the helicopter industry  under the jurisdiction of the FAA  does little to control the harmful effects of helicopter engines on the population  including reduced air quality and disruptive noise  Helicopter routes in the New York City area are essentially voluntary agreements made between the FAA and helicopter operators  so they can be changed at whim  disrupting the quality of life of those below their flight path       In an effort to bring relief to Long Islanders  today U S Senator Charles E  Schumer renewed his call on FAA Administrator Marion Blakey to move quickly to complete the New York City Metropolitan Area airspace redesign plan and implement it as soon as possible  In addition  Schumer asked Blakey to include helicopter noise issues over Long Island as part of the overall airspace redesign  Schumer said the best way to do reduce helicopter noise over Long Island  s residential communities is for the FAA to establish an island wide series of helicopter flight corridors that would divert aircraft away from homes  to preferably over the water  Schumer noted that emergency and news helicopters would certainly be exempt from any rules and regulations in an emergency       In his letter  Schumer said   I urge you to move forward with the redesign plan  and pledge my support in that effort  The problem of helicopter noise over Long Island is getting worse and causing serious disruptions to communities all over the New York City Area  I hope you will work with all due speed to resolve this situation
