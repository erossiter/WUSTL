                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thieves Steal and Sell Entire List of Every Call Cell Phone Owner has Made  Private  Business and Personal Relationships Made Public for a Small Fee  Who your Physician is  Whether you see a Psychologist  Companies you do Business with  Private Personal Relationships Can all be made Public  Federal Trade Commission Ignoring Problem    Schumer Introduces National Legislation to Criminalize Practice While much attention has been called to identity theft in the past months  few know about a growing black market of cell phone call logs stolen and sold by criminals  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today  In an effort to combat this dangerous scenario  the Senator announced national legislation to criminalize the practice of both stealing and selling these records  He also called on the FTC to set up a special unit to fix the problem        Stealing someone  s cell phone records is absolutely a criminal act and the fact that it can  t be prosecuted as one has got to change     Schumer said    This isn  t something that enables financial fraud like identity theft  its personal        Cell phone call logs are sought out for a variety of reasons  For years phone records gave been used by law enforcement and private detectives  but with the internet  gaining access to that information has gotten much easier  Websites like www locatecell com offer the service online  and with little regulation it is nearly impossible to stop      Cell phone records can be of great use to criminals and the information provided through a call log provides whoever is looking with a wealth of personal data  Many call rosters can reveal the names of a cell user  s doctors  their public and private relationships  their business associates and more  While other personal information such as social security numbers which can be on public documents that are found by data brokers  the only warehouse of phone records is at the phone companies themselves     Experts say that these records can be made available through three techniques  The first is having someone that works for one of the phone companies who sells the data  Though strict rules inside most of the phone companies make this practice risky  officials say that finding someone with access to the information desired is not that difficult  The second technique is   pretexting    where a data broker or the like pretends to be the owner of the phone  In doing so  they convince the cell phone company  s employees to release the data to them     Third  as managing cell phone accounts online has become a more common practice  data seekers can access the accounts via the internet  Because cell phone companies push account holders to manage their accounts online  many of them set up the online capability in advance  many customers never access their internet accounts  If someone seeking the information can figure out how to activate the account before the real customer does  they get unfettered access to all of the call records     Though the problem is all too common  federal law is too narrow to include this type of crime  Pretexting for financial data is illegal  but its does not include phone records     In an effort to combat this scenario  today Senator Charles E  Schumer announced national legislation that would close the existing loophole and criminalize phone record theft and use  The bill would make it a federal offense  punishable as a felony  to obtain customer information from a telephone service provider by false pretenses  It would violate federal law to obtain customer information  1  by making false or fraudulent statements or representations to an employee of a telephone service provider   2  by making such statements to a customer of a telephone service provider  or  3  by providing false documentation to a telephone service provider knowing that the document is false        We already have these protections for our financial information  We ought to have it for the very personal information that can be gleaned from our telephone records     Schumer said     Schumer also called on the FTC to set up a special unit to investigate these crimes  The agency has never taken a case like this to court and experts believe that they don  t understand how widespread the problem is  Schumer  s call for a special unit within the agency would study the breadth of the problem and study specific practices on how to ensure that cell records do not get in the wrong hands       Its time we take this problem as seriously as the crime committed is     Schumer said
