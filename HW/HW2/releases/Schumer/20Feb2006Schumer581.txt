IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 20  2006 Schumer To Lead Fight For New Tunnel Under Hudson River    Calls For Stewart Rail Link To Be Included In Regional Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            New Tunnel Would Create One Seat Ride From Orange County to NYC  Cut Typical Commute Time by 25 Percent   Schumer Urges Port Authority To Include Stewart Rail Link Their In Expanded Plan   Schumer  s Position On Senate Banking Committee Places Him In Cat Bird Seat To Move Project Forward  Secure Federal Funding U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled his plan to create a one seat direct connection from New York Hudson Valley International Airport directly into Manhattan  Right now  the project  called  Access to the Region s Core   THE Tunnel  and headed by New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  includes a new tunnel under the Hudson River that would create a one seat Metro North ride from Orange County to Midtown Manhattan  Schumer s proposal would add the long desired rail link that would extend Metro North s Port Jervis Line from Salisbury Mills to the airport in order to create a direct rail connection between the airport and New York City         As the Hudson Valley grows  we need to keep it moving     Schumer said    This plan would not only improve traffic flow  it could mean a big boost for the airport  I want to give 25 minutes a day back to Orange commuters and we can do this by providing a one seat ride between the Hudson Valley and mid town Manhattan  When we add the link to Stewart Airport  it s a double win          Schumer will unveil plans for a new tunnel under the Hudson River that would connect the Pascack Valley and Port Jervis rail lines directly into a new 34th street station in Manhattan  allowing a one seat ride to and from New York City  Currently  Orange County commuters ride the Pascack Valley and Port Jervis lines  but must transfer in Secaucus Junction in order to get in to Manhattan  The Tunnel will cut commuting times from the Orange County by nearly 25   with workers able to make the typical trip in 47 minutes rather than today s average trip of 60 minutes  and they will not have to leave their seats       Today  Schumer also called on the Port Authority and NJ Transit to add the Stewart rail link to their proposal  The link would create a spur off the Port Jervis line from Salisbury Mills up to New York Hudson Valley International Airport and would make one seat rides possible from the airport to the new Manhattan station  The airport s master plan for the airport calls for a rail station opposite the terminal adjacent to a parking garage to be constructed where the parking lot is today  Schumer said that expanding access to the airport  with projects like the rail link and Drury Lane   is critical to attracting new low cost air service to the region        I am committed to the airport s success and this rail link will make New York Hudson Valley International Airport more accessible to more passengers at a reasonable cost   said Schumer   Too often I hear from businesses and travelers that Stewart is too hard to get to  Today  we are here to solve that problem and put the airport on track for long term growth       Orange County residents have too few options to use mass transit and commuters headed in to Manhattan must take an hour long train ride and change trains in New Jersey in order to cross the river  Commuters therefore turn to their cars  and end up stuck in on either the Tappan Zee or George Washington Bridges and then Manhattan traffic  In fact  Orange Rockland counties have the highest percentage of work trips by car from West of Hudson points  including New Jersey  By cutting the travel time by nearly 25  percent each way and not forcing commuters to change trains  Schumer said the new project will make getting to work easier for all Orange county residents for decades to come       Each day almost 30 000 people from Rockland and Orange Counties travel by car to work in Manhattan  Many of these commuters drive over Tappan Zee Bridge or George Washington Bridges  two of the most heavily traveled bridges in the region and the nation  On an average weekday  the GWB handles 160 000 vehicles crossing in each direction  And this traffic will only get worse with 72  expected growth of suburban households between over the next 30 years will occur in Orange and Rockland Counties and New Jersey suburbs  This dramatic growth will only lead to greater congestion on Hudson Valley road and bridges  which are already at capacity and experience delays of 30 minutes to an hour or more during peak periods  According to Schumer  if no action is taken  in just two decades  another 45 000 cars and 70 000 additional people are expected to drive their cars to Manhattan for work       Schumer said today that the Trans Hudson Express Tunnel Project  also known as Access to the Region s Core  will give commuters from Orange and Rockland counties a faster trip time  a one seat ride  and real congestion relief in anticipation of ridership demands over the next 20 years  The improved travel time and convenience is expected to attract substantial numbers of new Orange and Rockland county commuters to rail  with daily trips tripling from close to 8 000 now to over 24 000 in 2030  This will take cars off the roads and will have environmental benefits for the Hudson Valley  which has a serious air pollution problem       Schumer also touted expected job growth from the tunnel project  as the Access to the Region s Core project is expected grow business and create new jobs from New York City up through the Hudson Valley Specifically  the project will generate 2 000 new construction jobs for New Yorkers and post construction jobs are expected to reach nearly 28 000 in New York   Overall  expected business growth from the tunnel will generate  384 million in new government revenue for New York and New Jersey
