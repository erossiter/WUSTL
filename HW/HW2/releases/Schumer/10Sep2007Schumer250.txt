IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 10  2007 Schumer To Introduce Legislation Today To Lift Portfolio Caps And Loan Limits For Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bill Would Devote 50 Percent of Increased Cap Space To Refinancings of Subprime Loans  Also Bring Liquidity to Jumbo Market in High Cost Areas Senator  It s Time to Let Fannie  Freddie Do The Job They Were Designed To Do Washington  D C   Bucking the Bush administrations refusal to bring badly needed liquidity to the mortgage markets  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  introduced legislation today that would significantly enhance the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to bothprovidecapacity for lenders to refinance borrowers trapped in subprime loans and bring relief to the increasingly troubled jumbo market sector   The Protecting Access to Safe Mortgages Act would temporarily lift the limits on the GSEs mortgage portfolios by 10 percent  which would free up approximately  145 billion for the purchase of new mortgages  Schumers bill would require half of this total to go specifically towards refinanced mortgages for borrowers whose existing adjustable rate loans were scheduled for an interest rate reset between June 2005 and December 2009  This provision will ensure that the cap loosening delivers a clear benefit to the subprime segment that first inflamed the mortgage crisis  Up to 80 percent of subprime loans originated in 2006the year that lax underwriting seems to have been the most problematicwere adjustable rate mortgages with low teaser rates that reset to higher rates that induce payment shock on the borrowers   Thiscommon sensemeasure will deliver a shot in the arm that could make refinancings possible for tens of thousands of Americans trapped in the subprime mess  Schumer said  Together with nonprofits  lenders and loan servicers  Fannie and Freddie are the missing ingredient tostemthe rising tide of foreclosures that is about to hit the economy The bottom line is that we should be deploying Fannie and Freddie to do the job they were designed to do    Schumers legislation also lifts the conforming loan limit for the GSEs by up to 50 percent in high cost areas  This will make higher cost loans available for purchase by Fannie and Freddie  bringing liquidity to metropolitan areas where the median home price for a single family home is above the GSEs current conforming limit of  417 000  The increases on both the portfolio caps and the loan limits would sunset one year following the bills enactment    Schumers bill is necessary on account of the Bush administrations refusal to tap the GSEs to play the role they were designed for  In August  Senator Schumer wrote a letter to James B  Lockhart III  the director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight  OFHEO   urging him to consider temporarily raising the limit on purchases of home loans by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in response to increasing concerns of a credit crunch spilling into the broader mortgage market  OFHEO rejected Schumers request  even as it has since become increasingly clear that the deterioration in the mortgage markets has gone from bad to worse  Liquidity is virtually nonexistent for loans that do not conform to Fannie and Freddies portfolio standards  which is hurting current and aspiring homebuyers ability to access lending     This emergency measure is not only important to restore confidence in the mortgage market for current and aspiring home buyers  but it would also provide crucial and necessary financing by Fannie and Freddie to subprime foreclosure relief efforts across the country before the October surprise of subprime resets further shocks the mortgage markets  One trillion dollars worthof adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs are due to reset between now and November of next year  Fannie Mae has estimated that 1 5 million subprime homeowners who face resetting ARMs and potential payment shocks this year and next would qualify for a safe  fixed rate loan backed by the GSEs    Senator Schumer has been at the forefront of Congressional efforts to contain the subprime market crisis and ensure that irresponsible underwriting of this magnitude is not allowed to happen again  In May  Schumer introduced the first major legislation to deal with unscrupulous lending practices this Congress  the Borrowers Protection Act  which would upgrade standards that mortgage brokers must abide by when making new loans to borrowers    Schumer has also helped to secure  100 million in foreclosure prevention funding that was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee for HUD Housing Counseling programs in the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies spending bill  The Senate may approve the bill as early as this week  With these funds  non profit agencies will be able to provide individual counseling by working one on one with borrowers who are in unsuitable subprime loans
