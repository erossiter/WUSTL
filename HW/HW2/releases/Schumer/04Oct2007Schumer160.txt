IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 4  2007 Schumer  With Chief Falkouski s Widow Testifying Before Senate Judiciary Committee  Doj Announces New Protocol And A Review Of All Outstanding Cases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Despite Being Entitled to Federal Death Benefits under 2003 Hometown Heroes Law  Falkouski Family has been Denied Benefits by the Department of Justice DOJ has inexplicably claimed that Chief Falkouski s Response to an Emergency was  Routine   Thereby Making His Family Ineligible for Benefits Before Schumer and Falkouski  DOJ Announces that Responding to a Fire is  presumptively non routine  and will Apply Interpretation to all Claims Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that during a Senate Judiciary Hearing which featured testimony given by Susan Falkouski  the widow of the fallen Rensselaer City Assistant Fire Chief Mike Falkouski  the Department of Justice  DOJ  announced that it had issued a new directive defining what is considered a non routine activity  Included in this new directive is the statement that all responses to emergency call will be considered presumptively non routine  Falkouskis family to date has inexplicably been blocked by the DOJ from receiving the federal death benefits they are entitled to under the Hometown Heroes law  Schumer is an original sponsor of the 2003 law which extends federal benefits to the survivors of career and volunteer firefighters  police officers and other first responders killed by heart attacks or strokes while on duty    However  even though Mike Falkouski  along with Elsmere Fire Chief Kevin Shea  diedfrom such conditions while on duty  the Justice Department earlier this year denied federal death benefits for both their families because it claimed that the firefighters deaths occurred during so called routine activity Schumer  however  has argued that working at the scene of a fire  and the immediate period afterward is inherently non routine and places the human body under irregularly high stress levels  Falkouski and Sheas families are currently awaiting decisions on their appeals    Today  following testimony from Mrs  Falkouski who sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee at Schumers invitation  the DOJ announced that it was receptive to the concerns that were raised  and has released a directive that further clarifies which activities are considered non routine  Among these activities is responding to an emergency call  The DOJ also said it was gather information on outstanding cases so it could better review them    Schumer hailed todays developments as a major break through and hoped it would lead to the Falkouski and Shea families receiving their benefitsin thenear future    Despite wrongfullymisinterpreting the 2003 Hometown Heroes law for months  it seems the Department of Justice has finally seen the light and agrees with us that responding to an emergency  working at the scene  and the immediate period afterward is inherently non routine and places the human body under irregularly high stress levels  said Senator Schumer  Todays development is a huge step forward towards getting the families of Falkouski and Shea the benefits theyre entitled to    Mrs  Falkouski testified that in a letter she received in March from the DOJ  the agency stated that the act of responding at any hour of the day or night to the scene of a fire event is a routine engagement  The letter also said that the below zero weather  high winds and 20 inches of snow had no significance   Before the Senate Judiciary Committee today  Mrs  Falkouski stated  I must tell you  I am not only offended  but angry at this letter  I feel that the Department of Justice trivialized my husbands service  And  it seems to me it was written by someone who has no idea of what its like to respond to an emergency  In fact  I think it is inherently non routine for any human being to race towards a dangerous situation at a moments notice  The firefighters I have spoken to agree   Following comments made by Falkouski and Schumer  Domingo Herraiz  Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance  further described his prepared testimony  which stated  Some people have expressed concern regarding our reading of the Hometown Heroes Act term non routine  Some have been concerned that we may have defined this term too narrowly  While we have mentioned the term non routine in our written determinations  to date no claim has been denied simply because we deemed the activity routine  However  to ensure future consistency in how we consider this term  I have recently provided binding direction to my staff regarding application of this term      this direction makes clear that all responses to emergency calls will be considered presumptively non routine   Chief Falkouski suffered a severe stroke after responding to a fire scene during inclement weather  He furiously cleared ten inches of snow off his car and driveway so he could respond to the crisis  As he was doing so  the first arriving companies reported a heavy fire condition  multiple explosions  and a severely burned civilian Chief Falkouski drove through the bad weatherconditions as quickly as he could  arrived at the scene  got out of his car  and in the process of putting on his firefighting gear  suffered a stroke  He died later that day   In April  Schumer sent a letter to Herraiz andpointed to the 2003 law and arguedresponding to a fire or emergency scene  from beginning to end  is an inherently non routine activityasthat term was intended byCongress and  thus  any stroke or heart attack that occurred while responding would make the families eligiblefor benefits    Chief Sheas family has also been denied benefits by the DOJ  Chief Shea died when the Elsmere Fire Department responded to an odor of smoke in the Good Samaritan Nursing Home  while the infirmed residents were being evacuated from the building by staff  Though the odor was not due to a serious fire  Chief Shea had no way of knowing that  and responded thinking that he was facing a potential mass casualty incident  Determining that the building was safe  Chief Shea returned to the firehouse momentarily and suffered a heart attack in his car  in front of the station  It was less than forty minutes between the initial call and when Chief Shea was stricken   Schumer is an original sponsor of the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of 2003  S 459   introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont  which closed a loophole that prevented families of firefighters and police officers who died in line duty from a heart attack or stroke from collecting federal bereavement benefits  The legislation was signed into law on December 15  2003 and ensured that the surviving families of first responders  who died of heart attacks or strokes in the line of duty  or within 24 hours of a triggering incident while on duty  would be eligible to receive financial assistance  regardless of whether a traumatic injury is present   In May  Schumers office met with DOJ officials in Schumers DC office  Schumer said the initial meeting was an important first step toward reforming the process and securing benefits for these families  The Justice Department needs to carefully re examine their interpretation of the law and their approach to deciding these claims  which is currently at odds with Congress  intent when we passed this law    A study conducted by Harvard University found firefighters face a much higher risk of death from heart attack when battling a blaze  up to 100 times the normal rate  and are more likely to be struck even when they re doing less strenuous tasks  Looking at firefighter heart attack deaths nationwide over a decade  the researchers found that the risk of heart attack is highest when firefighters are working at a fire scene  with increased odds ranging from 10 to 100 times the normal risk of heart attack    Although firefighters spend only 1 to 5 percent of their time putting out fires  32 percent of firefighter deaths from heart attacks occur at fire scenes  the study found  Just as striking  the study found that 40  of firefighter heart attack deaths come while responding to  or returning from  an emergency    The study  published in the New England Journal of Medicine  found that among the approximately 1 1 million firefighters in the United States  of whom about 70  are volunteers and 30  are paid career personnel   about 100 die each year in the line of duty  Nearly half of the deaths that occur while firefighters are on duty are related to cardiovascular events  The study clearly stated that firefighters face an increased risk of illness and death due to cardiovascular disease during periods of intense physical and even psychological stress at work   During his visit to Albany on April 10  Schumer was joined by the families of both the late Chief Kevin Shea of Elsmere and Asst Chief Michael Falkouski of Rensselaer who have had their benefit applications denied  Schumer was also joined by Tom LaBelle of the NYS Assn of Fire Chiefs  David Quinn of the Firemans Assn of the State of NY  representatives of the NYS Professional Firefighters Assn  and numerous local firefighters   Both the Falkouski and Shea families appealed their denial of benefits and had hearings with PSOB officers in early September  They both are awaiting word on the decision
