IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 22  2007 With Record Passport Backlog Gripping NY  Schumer Presses President Bush to Sign His Recently Passed Bill to Speed up Processing   Tells NY ers With Vacations  Business Trips  And Honeymoons Looming That Relief Is on The Way                                                                                                                                                                                 Standing with New Yorkers Who Are Still Waiting for Passports with Pending Overseas Trips  Schumer Calls on President to Quickly Sign Legislation Allowing State Dept  to Hire Hundreds of Experienced Processors to Break Bottleneck Passport Application Deluge Creating Four Month Logjam   Legislation Would Help Speed Up Processing Times for Processing Passport Applications With staggering backlogs at passport processing centers that serve the New York ruining vacations and forcing local residents to wait up to four months to receive their passports  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced the final Congressional passage of his bill that will break the passport log jam  Against a backdrop of confusion and concern over new travel restrictions  the Department of State is receiving more than 1 million passport applications a month  leaving New Yorkers waiting months for their applications to be processed  New Yorkers are experiencing long waits even in cases where theyve paid a  60 expedite fees to have their applications processed within 2 weeks  Schumer said his office has received more than 650 calls in just in the last three months   For the thousands of New Yorkers who are on edge waiting for their passports  relief is on the way  Schumer said  Far too many business trips  vacations  and honeymoons are still in jeopardy  My legislation has sailed through Congress and now I hope the President will sign this bill with equal speed  This bill will give the State Department the authority to hire hundreds of new processors who will get to work and get the process moving again   To ease the record backlog  Schumer introduced the Passport Backlog Reduction Act of 2007  S  966  on March 22  2007  Schumers legislation grants flexibility to the State Department to rehire  on a temporary basis  retired and fully trained passport processors to help existing processors manage the increased demand  Currently  retirees from Foreign Service have little incentive to assist in crises because they lose retirement benefits if they exceed strict wage and hour caps  The State Department has admitted that they have a database of qualified retired adjudicators at the ready who can be called up to help or who can extend their assistance if the Department is granted this new flexibility to respond to crisis situations  The Department of State already had some authority to waive the caps on working  but it was limited to personnel for Iraq and Afghanistan  Schumer s legislation would extend this hiring flexibility so that the State Department can also recruit foreign service retirees in order to meet passport demand caused by new passport rules and to assist with visa processing at overwhelmed consular offices overseas The authority would sunset on September 30  2008 for retirees helping to issue visas and on September 30  2009 for retirees helping to issue passports   Schumers legislation was approved unanimously by the Senate on June 29 and then approved by the House last week  The bill is now before the President awaiting approval  Schumer today called on the President to sign the bill right away so the State Department can get the new adjudicators in place immediately  The State Department hopes to hire back up to 300 passport adjudicators this year alone  some 50 100 of whom could be hired as a direct result of Schumers legislation   Schumer said that his office has received at least 678 calls from New Yorkers whose passports have been significantly delayed  Most of the cases involved major trips that require a passport  where the traveler applied for their passport with plenty of time before their trip  but then had the application delayed for weeks and sometimes months  Many people paid the  60 expedite fee  but did not receive their passport under the expedited timetable  Schumer said that his office has successfully resolved more than 600 cases  with New Yorkers getting their passports in time for their trips   Schumer was joined by nearly a dozen New Yorkers who are still anxiously waiting for their passports  Adam Raczynski was offered a pilot position with American Airlines contingent on his ability to procure a passport before training for the position commenced on July 1  Mr  Raczynski applied for his passport seventeen weeks ago  but has not yet received it  despite a stated wait time of ten to twelve weeks  He has been forced to miss his training date with American Airlines  and the airline may be forced to rescind its job offer if Mr  Raczynski doesnt receive a passport in the next week   Esther Beck worked for three summers to save money for her trip to Zurich to see her brother  and applied in March for her passport for her trip next week  After four months  she hadnt received any word on the status of her passport  and risked losing all of the money she had saved on non refundable plane tickets and hotel rooms  After intervention from Schumers office  Ms  Beck received her passport on Friday  only five days before her scheduled departure date   Schumer said that the current bottleneck has affected all stages of passport processing  from the initial scanning of an application to the adjudication of citizenship  Call centers to assist people in New York City and across the country are overwhelmed with passport processing issues but do not have the staff necessary to address the influx of calls  In response  the State Department has tried lengthening work hours and requiring overtime  but it is still crippled by a lack of qualified personnel who have undergone the background checks necessary to handle sensitive passport adjudications    Against a backdrop of confusion and concern over new travel restrictions  the Department of State is receiving more than 1 million passport applications a month  The avalanche of requests has buried its staff and caused delays of up to six weeks over normal processing times during the peak spring season when many people are preparing to travel   The State Department recently admitted that it underestimated the increased demand that would be caused by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative and other passport policy changes  It takes the Department anywhere between three months and a year to vet and train a new passport adjudicator  but this necessary security precaution leaves the Department with little flexibility to handle surges in demand like the current crisis   According to the State Department  applications for new passports and renewals received between October 2006 and March 2007 rose 44 percent over the same period in 2005 2006  As a result  the Department is warning travelers that routine passport processing will take 10 12 weeks instead of the previous six  and expedited processing could take 2 3 weeks instead of two weeks  About 12 million passport applications were processed in 2006 and as many as 17 million are expected this year  the department said  At a hearing on June 19  the State Department told Congress that 2 95 million passport applications were pending   Shortly after Schumers initial call to break the logjam with this legislation  the Office of Personnel Management agreed on March 30  2007  to grant a similar waiver for the rehiring of civil service employees  This means that the State Department will also be able to tap into the reserve of retired civil service personnel already trained as passport processors  to alleviate the situation  Two weeks ago  after another Schumer call  the State Department admitted that it will refund the  60 passport expedite fee for all New Yorkers who paid the fee and have still not received their passports in an expedited fashion
