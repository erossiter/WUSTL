Timetable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Calls on Mayor to Commit All Liberty Bonds to Commercial Development at Ground Zero   Schumer    To Break Deadlock at Ground Zero  Every Party Must Give Up Something    Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer laid out his plan to break the deadlock at Ground Zero in a major speech at a breakfast sponsored by the Association for a Better New York  ABNY   Schumer called for the Port Authority to lease Freedom Tower and abandon their efforts to take Tower 3  He called for Larry Silverstein to commit to beginning construction on each tower within 60 days of each site being ready  eliminate or at least halve his developers fee for the site  and submit to regular examination by an independent auditor  Schumer also called on the mayor to commit all Liberty Bonds to ground zero       The text of Schumer  s remarks  as prepared for delivery  follow       Good morning  It  s good to be in front of ABNY again  I know all of you share my concern for job creation in New York City  We have regained losses from 9 11 but have not kept pace with other cities in the national recovery  Over the last two years  while New York has struggled to grow jobs by 1  annually  the nation has approached a 2  rate of job growth  During the same period  many of New York City  s gains have been in leisure and hospitality  health care and social assistance  and retail trade  Meanwhile the city has continued to lose manufacturing  information and construction jobs  At the end of 2005 New York City still had 150 000 fewer private sector jobs than it did five years ago        If New York City with all of its strengths cannot grow with the national average  then we must change our policies and make a real and substantive commitment to creating new high  paying jobs that will power our city  s economy through the next century       Over the last few weeks  it has become clear to me that an essential component of our need to create jobs is the current debate over the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan  Four and a half years after the devastating attacks we are at a standstill over rebuilding the World Trade Center site  Negotiations between the Port Authority and Silverstein Properties have thus far produced no tangible results  We have moved from consensus to cacophony        The Port Authority  with the support of the Mayor  wants to build and move to Tower 3  The Mayor wants Tower 4 to have significant residential and hotel space  These two buildings are arguably the two most desirable planned commercial buildings in Lower Manhattan  It  s questioned whether the developer  Silverstein Properties  has the financial capability to fully build out the site  The Mayor and Governor still hold  3 345 billion in unused Liberty Bonds and lack a unified plan for using them moving forward        What we are left with is the appearance of a lack of confidence in downtown and a stalled rebuilding effort  But I do not believe that the logjam is intractable or that the situation is hopeless or unsolvable  To make this happen  everyone    the State  the City  the Port Authority and Larry Silverstein    has to give  Larry Silverstein is a very fine developer and a good New Yorker  but because this is ground zero and because he would be using Liberty Bonds  there are special responsibilities for all parties        I believe that compromise is possible under the following conditions        At the centerpiece  the whole plan cannot work unless the Port Authority moves to the Freedom Tower  The Port Authority must abandon its efforts to take Tower 3  the most desirable commercial space on the site  and agree to move to the Freedom Tower instead        In exchange for this major tenant  Silverstein Properties would first have to agree by contract to set a rigorous construction timetable  Under the contract  if Silverstein Properties does not begin construction on a site within 60 days of it becoming ready  they would be required to turn over the leases of the remaining unbuilt sites to another developer  Second  Silverstein would agree to reduce by at least half the developer  s fee for the site  And third  in order to end the debate on the financial capabilities of Silverstein Properties  they would agree to be subject to regular examination by an independent auditor        In addition  the Mayor should drop his proposal to use Liberty Bonds for any other hotel or commercial project until an agreement at the World Trade Center is reached  Liberty Bonds are intended above all for redevelopment of commercial space at ground zero  no matter the developer  Silverstein Properties  or whoever the developer  should be given the first right to the remainder of the  3 345 billion of Liberty Bonds  upon certification from the independent auditor that they are able to induce those bonds to build commercial buildings at ground zero    Let me be clear that this is not a typical real estate deal nor is it a cut and dry public works project  However  I believe this framework would prevent progress from being caught up in endless indecision and potential litigation stemming from the debate over whether or not  and how  to remove the current developer from part of the site  This framework will allow us to reestablish the job creating commercial space that is so critical for the future of New York City  It also will ensure progress is made in a timely fashion so that ten years from now we have more than just a construction site and big ideas  I will go into further detail on the specifics of this deal in a moment but now I would like to discuss the major principal behind it  and that is creating jobs downtown by building the commercial space lost on September 11th       Creating Commercial Space Very early on in the redevelopment process  I made clear my view that our focus should be job creation and regaining the commercial space that was lost on 9 11  I believe that still must be the goal today  Osama Bin Laden and the 9 11 hijackers targeted the political  military  and economic centers of the United States  They viewed New York City and the Twin Towers as a mighty symbol of our nation  s power and prosperity  While we can put up a Freedom Tower for symbolic purposes  we will not have made a statement about the resilience of our City  and the resilience of our nation  unless we truly rebuild Lower Manhattan as an economic center of the free world  This means restoring commercial space and creating the jobs to fill that space downtown  An empty Freedom Tower would be as bad a symbol as not building a Freedom Tower at all        Before 9 11 the three biggest commercial districts in the country in terms of office space were Midtown Manhattan  the Chicago Loop  and Lower Manhattan  That  s the way it  s been for years  Since 9 11  Washington DC has surpassed Lower Manhattan in terms of commercial space  That is not happy news  News like that ought to grab our attention and serve as wake up call       Prospects for Downtown We have only a limited chance to return Lower Manhattan to its place as a world class business district and we must seize it  Office buildings are factories in the post industrial city  Each new job in commercial space creates a significant ripple effect for the economy  Residential space does not have that kind of multiplier effect and hotel space  while it creates some jobs  does not touch the benefits of major business tenants for a city  s job market  Now that the Goldman Sachs building is going into the ground  the World Trade Center site is the only site in all of Lower Manhattan ready to go for any kind of new commercial space construction  Unlike some  my fear is that the 10 million new square feet of space planned for the site won  t be nearly enough to compensate for the millions of square feet we have lost to residential conversions and to fill the growing demand for office space downtown  Supply of commercial space is shrinking and without new construction at ground zero it will continue to shrink  If we don  t act at ground zero  downtown and our city will be the lesser for it        It  s important to note as well that the office space at ground zero won  t just be any office space  In addition to incorporating state of the art materials and designs  the towers will be served by Santiago Calatrava  s breathtaking transit station  bringing together transportation links that connect two states  four boroughs and millions of people  Through it  more than 250 000 daily commuters and visitors will have access to the Hudson River ferry terminals  PATH trains  14 different subway lines  and  knock on wood  a direct rail link to JFK Airport  We are investing billions in this transportation infrastructure  It does not make sense to sink nearly  10 billion of mass transit funds into downtown  making it one of the premier transit centers of the world  one of the few places where millions of people can move in and out daily  quickly and easily and then make it a residential center  albeit a beautiful one  We would be doing a great disservice to New York City and to its businesses if we did anything but develop world class commercial space at the site        Yet as I  ve said  much of the public rhetoric paints a more doubtful picture  saying that five years from now this brand new  state of the art commercial space will not command more than  35 per square foot  Even today  it is my understanding that the World Financial Center is doing deals in the mid  40 per square foot range  so I just cannot accept that buildings like Towers 3 and 4  which will be twenty years younger and fronting on Church Street above a major transportation hub would go for less than that  I believe that demand for space in Lower Manhattan will be much greater  while still offering a more affordable alternative to other Manhattan locations  Unfortunately  every time we say that space will never go above  35 square foot  we are exhibiting little confidence in the success of downtown and of New York City as a commercial center       I also know that downtown has experienced a rebirth as a residential community  I think it is a wonderful development that thousands of New Yorkers have made new homes in Lower Manhattan  But I have to point out that it is happening naturally on its own  Buildings continue to convert to residential and we should not be giving up the opportunity to create jobs and bring more companies downtown by making a significant part of Tower 4 residential       Moving the Port Authority to the Freedom Tower  I feel very strongly that it is a mistake of great proportions to give up the most desirable building  Tower 3  to a government entity and that doing so could sink the whole project  As I  ve said  Tower 3 will have the advantages of a location on Church Street and being next to a transportation mega hub  Its layout will be designed to attract top notch firms and we should be saving this space for those kinds of tenants  To give the best commercial site at ground zero to a government entity follows exactly the wrong approach       This does not however mean that there is no place for the Port Authority and other government tenants at the site  On the contrary  any major tenant regardless of whether it is public or private will bolster the market        So today  I am calling upon Governor Pataki to move the Port Authority not only back to the World Trade Center site but into the Freedom Tower itself  The Port Authority needs 700 000 square feet and can serve as an anchor tenant  We all know that the Freedom Tower may well be the hardest building to rent  An anchor tenant like the Port Authority not only fills up 1 3 of the space  but sends a signal to the world in the building  s future  safety and viability  The Port Authority as anchor tenant will help attract other tenants to the Freedom Tower  a challenge that many planners perceive as a problem with the present plan  Tower 3 does not need such help  It will attract large tenants on its own  It does not need the kind of boost the Port Authority will give to the Freedom Tower       Tangentially  it will also aid our efforts to bring other government entities  especially Federal tenants like the US Customs office  back to the World Trade Center and the Freedom Tower        I recognize that this is not an easy decision for the Governor and the Port Authority to make  Having lived though both attacks  the Port Authority knows first hand the costs of the 1993 bombing and September 11th  as they tragically lost more than 80 workers  including 37 of their police officers        But as the owner of the World Trade Center and moreover as a major public Lower Manhattan tenant  the Port Authority has the opportunity to show the world that New York and the Freedom Tower are stronger than ever        The symbolism of the building itself as a beacon of American resilience    all of the strength we hope to broadcast when it takes its place in the New York City skyline    will be lost if it sits empty        For those who want to be regarded as true leaders in this effort to rebuild at ground zero  the commitment to the site cannot stop just as soon as the building begins to rise  This means making sure the Freedom Tower is a full and functional building with major tenants  Putting the Port Authority and other government tenants at the Freedom Tower would be a major step towards this goal        Now I  d like to talk about what Silverstein Properties must do in return to make rebuilding a reality       Role for Silverstein Properties Silverstein Properties has an obligation to demonstrate that they have the financial ability to proceed  to build the buildings as quickly as possible and fill the buildings quickly  at the risk of being removed from ground zero and being replaced by another developer  Rebuilding Lower Manhattan cannot be curtailed because one developer does not have the capacity to build quickly and effectively or because he or she wants to wait until tenants willing to pay speculatively high rents come along  We cannot let ground zero be a construction site for the next twenty years       Let me be clear to the development community  and I would ask that he Mayor and the Governor and the Port Authority join me in this assertion  the redevelopment of ground zero is a unique project and with the development rights comes an acute obligation to the public to rebuild with as much speed  grandeur and vision as possible  The stipulations we must put in place surrounding the development of the site should in no way become the norm for the development community in New York  In addition  they should of course be subject to change under extreme circumstances  including unforeseen natural disasters and terrorism        In exchange for being given first right to the remainder of the Liberty Bonds and for the promise of the Port Authority as the anchor tenant  two huge benefits  for the Freedom Tower  Silverstein Properties would submit to the following       First  to put an end to the debate over competing financial analysis from the City and SPI  the developer must subject itself to regular reviews by an independent auditor who does not have an axe to grind  I have examined both the City and Silverstein  s dueling documents and there are assumptions made in both  The City  s financial analysis says that SPI is going to run out of money in 2010  with only two towers built and no capacity or incentive to continue building  SPI maintains that they are in good shape to complete Towers 3 and 4 as well if given the balance of the Liberty Bonds        There is a need for an independent accounting process  removed from politics  to sort through these stalemates  This entity could be easily formed in the same way that we choose arbiters to settle disputes  At regular intervals  this body should be given access to SPI  s financials to determine whether SPI has the capacity to continue to build out the rest of the site  If they determine that SPI  s financing schemes will not allow for continuation or completion  then there will be a simple choice for the developer  change your plans or let someone who can build  build        Second  SPI must commit by contract with penalties to beginning construction on each tower as soon as the site becomes ready  It  s important to note that control over this timetable rests at first with the Port Authority  Without the eastern bathtub slurry wall in place  construction cannot begin on the Towers 2  3  4 and the exterior of the Calatrava transit hub        The City has estimated that slurry wall and site prep will be complete by late 2007  The Port Authority should commit to that date or be required to agree to reduce the ground rent on the site to ease the burden of leaving the developer with an un buildable  empty lot        For its part  SPI must commit to having a shovel in the ground for each building within 2 months of the site  s infrastructure being completed  If this commitment is not met  SPI must agree in advance  through contract  to hand over the site to another developer  If SPI begins Tower 2 according to this timeline  they then have the right to build Tower 3  If SPI begins Tower 3 on time  they have the right to build Tower 4  Conversely if a building is not begun on time  SPI must give up the right to build that tower and all other unbuilt towers planned for the site  So for example  if Tower 2 is on schedule  and Tower 3 does not meet the two month start date  then Towers 3 and 4 would be turned over to another developer        Third  slow movement on renting World Trade Center 7 has given people reason to doubt downtown and the ability of SPI to rent its buildings quickly at reasonable rents  SPI must show New York that they are making significant progress renting out World Trade Center 7 and aggressively finding new tenants for the remaining buildings on the site  The Port Authority and SPI must work together to establish reasonable standards and timetables for filling all the buildings on the site  Yet I am confident that before long  these standards will be met naturally by the market  These are top notch buildings and anchor tenants will beget anchor tenants  If we strategically use the rental incentives enacted by the State  once these buildings begin to fill  the space will go quickly        As I said  it would be part of the contractual agreement between Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority that if these three measures are not met  the Port Authority would have the right to remove the developer from the rest of the site        In addition there should be an immediate commitment from SPI to eliminate or at the very least cut by half the traditional developer  s fees that are now proposed as 5   I am not asking SPI to forgo profit  rather I am asking them to make a demonstration of good faith that I believe will ultimately lead to a more successful and financially viable project        I believe these are the kinds of ideas necessary to reach a fair deal for all parties that is in the best interest of the number one stakeholder at ground zero  the people of New York  I urge the Port Authority and Silverstein Properties to reach a consensus finally that will pave the way for the rebirth of downtown as the vibrant business district and neighborhood New Yorkers deserve        There is one last piece that I need to address that I believe will help us secure a healthy future for the ground zero site  That is the Liberty Bonds  Unfortunately  they have become a chip in the bargaining machinations between stakeholders on the site and that cannot continue  At the very least  we need to hold these bonds in abeyance and not commit them to other downtown sites  before we know if they will all be needed at ground zero       Liberty Bonds Right now  only  3 345 billion from the original  8 billion allocation for the Liberty Bond program remains uncommitted  Without a doubt  giving the City and State flexibility in administering the Liberty bond program was an important tool  When we needed to do a little more to create 4 000 new jobs that Goldman Sachs would bring to downtown   1 65 billion in Liberty Bonds were there to provide the necessary assistance  when we needed to help get 7 World Trade Center off the ground   475 million in Liberty Bonds helped make that a reality   Yet to date  these are the only two commercial projects downtown that have received liberty bond financing       Billions have been committed to residential projects and commercial projects outside of Lower Manhattan but no money has been officially designated to ground zero  Not many bonds are left and many fear that the remainder will not be spent wisely        We are making the easy choices  funding the projects that the market favors instead of helping build the challenging projects the city needs  And today  we are at risk of further depleting the entire pot of Liberty Bonds before we even put a shovel in the ground at the World Trade Center site  These bonds were created to help redevelop ground zero  That was our intent and the intent of Congress and I do not want to have to go back to my colleagues and explain that all of the bonds have been issued and we still have an empty construction site in Lower Manhattan  For only a little of more than  2 billion of the  8 billion of Liberty Bonds to go towards commercial space downtown is not what congress intended when the bonds were passed  We pushed back the sunset of the Liberty Bonds program once  and if we need to do it again to make sure we have a tool for rebuilding ground zero we will do it again  But I will not make these efforts to help construct residential and hotel space at the expense of building job creating commercial space        The governor has done the right thing and committed to pledge his remaining portion to ground zero  Today  I am calling on the Mayor to not commit his Liberty Bonds to other retail  hotel or commercial projects until we know what is needed to rebuild the World Trade Center site  Holding the remaining Liberty Bonds hostage and threatening to use them for other projects either inside or outside downtown throws the future of redeveloping ground zero into doubt and uncertainty  We are also sending the wrong signal about how serious we are in redeveloping the word trade center site       The success of the rebuilding process has always been contingent on the ability of the Mayor  the Governor  the Port Authority and the developer to reach consensus  Our record to this point has been mixed and we are now at yet another moment where all parties must put aside their differences  come together to find a solution that will allow Lower Manhattan to get back on its feet and become an economic engine once again for this great City  In December  the Governor gave the Port Authority 90 days to work out their differences with Silverstein Properties  However  74 days in  there is still no deal  I hope that all of the parties will consider the framework I outlined today and immediately come together to reach agreement so that the true rebirth of downtown can finally get started
