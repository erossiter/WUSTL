157 from the 2007 Assistance to Firefighters Grant  AFG  Program administered by the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS   The North Seneca Ambulance Corp  in Waterloo  Seneca County  will receive a  14 040 grant and the Middlesex Valley Volunteer Ambulance in Middlesex  Yates County  will receive a  33 117 grant  The two grants will be used to improve operations and safety The grants are part of the first round of DHS FY07 AFG program awards to several fire departments throughout the country   This funding will go a long way in supporting the first responders in the Finger Lakes region  said Schumer  Our nation s firefighters are truly America s heroes  Whether fighting a building fire or responding to a terrorist attack  it is essential that we help them to do their jobs safely and efficiently  One of the key ways to do this is to make sure that they have enough firefighters on duty to handle the job and to ensure that they have the training  equipment and resources they need to do their job well This federal money will help make sure that firefighters in Seneca and Yates Counties get the resources they need and have enough people on hand to keep our communities safe  Schumer was among the first senators who recognized the need for the federal government to establish a funding program for local governments and fire departments to help defray the rising costs of equipment and fire prevention  Since its inception in 2001  the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program has delivered over  122 million to New York s fire departments   For Fiscal Year 2008  Congress has authorized  1 billion for the program   700 million more than the  300 million included in the Administration s budget proposal  The FY07 DHS Appropriations bill  signed into law by the President  appropriated  662 million for firefighter assistance grants  of which  115 million will go toward SAFER Act grants   The North Seneca Ambulance Corp  will use the federal funding to purchase an Advanced Life Support full body training mannequin and decontamination equipment  They will also use the funds to send eight members to attend and Airway Management Seminar  The training and equipment will increase interoperability at emergency sites  while the decontamination equipment will ensure the safety of the firefighters when coming into contact with hazardous materials during emergency situations     The Operations and Firefighter Safety Program funds will go towards training  equipment  personal protective equipment  wellness and fitness  and modifications to fire stations and facilities  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  AFGP  assists local fire departments in programs and activities to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations through specialized emergency training for response to situations like terrorist attacks  enhancement of emergency medical services programs  development of health and safety initiatives  establishment of fire education and prevention programs  creation of wellness and fitness programs  and equipment and facility upgrades   These grants ensure that the firefighters in the Finger Lakes region continue to have the basic resources they require to do their jobs  improve safety and save lives  said Schumer  Local fire departments have been strained from budget cuts  rising costs of equipment and stress from being on heightened alert because of the war on terrorism  These funds are truly a life saving investment that will provide local fire departments with essential resources and support  so they can be better prepared for emergencies   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in cooperation with the Department s United States Fire Administration  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to the applicants that most closely address the program s priorities and demonstrate financial need  For more information on the
