IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 19  2006 Schumer Blasts Advisory Board On Poor Decision For Bethlehem Steel    Urges Immediate Reversal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator Calls On Advisory Board To Include Bethlehem Steel On Meeting Next Week As New Data Was Submitted    Schumer  The Time Is Now To Bring Justice To These Cold War Heroes U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today blasted the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  after it made a poor decision regarding the future of the Bethlehem Steel workers ability to access the Nuclear Worker Compensation Program  NWCP   On January 9  the Advisory Board moved to leave Bethlehem Steel off the Board  s agenda next week  neglecting former workers still seeking deserved compensation for years of working in hazardous conditions  In a personal letter to Board Chairman Dr  Paul Ziemer  Schumer urged the Advisory Board to reverse its decision  and include Bethlehem Steel on the agenda for next week  s meeting after new data was submitted by a representative with the Bethlehem Steel Action Group         More delays equal more injustice for New York  s Cold War heroes     Schumer said    This decision was unfair  unwise and lacks compassion  I have heard heartbreaking stories of friends and loved ones dying of cancers at a young age  and everyone involved has become frustrated with this endless process  These former nuclear workers got dangerously ill developing the country s nuclear weapons program  and should not have to wait a minute longer for help  The time is now to bring justice to these Cold War heroes          On January 9 conference call  the Advisory Board determined that the Bethlehem Steel site profile  which is formulated by using indirect data from a similar facility  was adequate for the NIOSH dose reconstruction program  In effect  this decision will prevent the great majority of potentially harmed Bethlehem Steel workers from accessing the NWCP  This decision passed despite flaws found in the site profile review  This action will prevent Bethlehem Steel from being further discussed unless NIOSH feels the new comments raise significant issues to the site profile        On January 10 a representative of the Bethlehem Steel Action Group submitted new evidence to NIOSH  Schumer has asserted that  in light of the new evidence raised  and the lingering differences regarding oronasal breathing  ingestion intakes  and the resuspension model  that the Advisory Board should reconsider their decision and confirm Bethlehem Steel will be discussed at the meeting next week  Further  Schumer urged and that the new evidence should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure the records NIOSH has on Bethlehem Steel are accurate and complete        During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help  Workers at these facilities handled high levels of radioactive materials and were responsible for helping to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War  Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer       Senator Schumer has aggressively worked to get aid for former nuclear workers in Western New York  In an effort to compensate these workers  Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allowed them to file claims with the US Department of Labor for individual payments of  150 000 and other benefits for medical treatments  Workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War were eligible  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history       As of February 1  2004  the number of claims submitted to the Department of Labor under subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 from the Western New York region  including western Pennsylvania  exceeded the number of such claims filed at resource centers in Hanford  Washington  Portsmouth  Ohio  Los Alamos  New Mexico  the Nevada Test Site  Nevada  the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site  Colorado  the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory  Idaho  and the Amchitka Test Site  Alaska  Western New York is home to 14 former Atomic Weapon Employers  AWE  sites and DOE clean up facilities       Even though Western New York has a large number of facilities  the only assistance applicants in the region now receive to wade through layers of red tape is from a traveling resource center that comes to the area infrequently to serve current and former nuclear workers  EEOICPA Section 3631 requires DOL to provide outreach and claimant assistance       In November 2004  Schumer successfully secured a mandate from Congress that establishes a resource center intended to provide Western New Yorkers with the support that they need to effectively navigate the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  Senator Schumer s language established a new resource center in Western New York that would help sick nuclear workers with their compensation applications  Schumer  who has lambasted the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  for only paying out ten percent of claims to New York nuclear workers  said that the resource center was vital to assist local nuclear workers with the application process  Last February  Schumer urged Mr  Shelby Hallmark  the Director of the Labor Department  s Office of Workers   Compensation Programs  for an accelerated timetable in establishing this center  and in July they opened an office in the Amherst Development Park
