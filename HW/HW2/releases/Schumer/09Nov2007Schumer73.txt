                                   Funds Included in Department of Defense Appropriations Bill Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate has approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report  which includes  16 7 million in defense funding for Central New York   The bill  having been approved by both chambers of Congress  will now be sent to the President for his signature   This is terrific news for Central New York and a vital step in the appropriations process  said Senator Schumer  These critical funds will help us ensure that in defending our nation  we are equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our national defense and the Central New York economy  I will urge the president to sign this bill immediately   The Senates approval of this bill is wonderful news for Central New  York  and it is the next step in ensuring that these key projects receive this important funding  As these local companies and institutions continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  Not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in Central New Yorks local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said   The  16 7 million for Central New York in the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes   Rome Air Force Research Laboratory CACI Technologies  CAMEL II    1 9 Million  CAMEL II is a proposed government and industry initiative to provide active defense against Cyber Attacks on government information networks and military command and control  C2  systems and critical infrastructure  This program is designed to complement and leverage Research and Development work being performed at the Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site  AFRL RRS  and commercial industry with a strong emphasis on innovative technology development and transition   Syracuse Research Corporation  Enhanced Multi Mission Radar  EMMR     2 4 Million  The Enhanced Multi Mission Radar  EMMR  is a low cost solution to meeting the long range counter fire radar requirement  The EMMR extends the performance of the already existing Multi Mission Radar  MMR  developed for the U S  Army  and reduces the number of radar sensors required for multiple simultaneous missions  Funding will allow for the building and demonstration of a low cost antenna for MMR to increase the MMR range to detect and locate long range artillery  rockets  and missiles   Cortland Cable  MK 48 Torpedo Post Launch Communications System    1 6 million  An innovative and cost effective high bandwidth post launch communications system is needed to ensure the Mk 48 Torpedo is capable of meeting the Navys new tactical requirements  Studies have indicated that traditional weighted hollow flexible hose and guidance wire communications technologies can not satisfy these new requirements This project will develop a new flex hose concept to meet new submarine and torpedo operating requirements of providing high reliability operation over the entire speed and depth operating envelope of submarines  including shallow water near bottom engagements   Source Sentinel LLC  Detection of Biological Agents in Water    2 million  Funding will be used to conduct research  development  application and commercialization demonstration of basic and applied research to deploy biosensors to protect water and air systems against man made or natural toxin incursion with near real time alertment  information fusion and automatic manual response reaction  This technology will help to assure protection of municipal water supplies  integration of data fusion technologies and mathematical modeling for early warning response systems in water and air environments  and application of biochip microarray  laser and IR technology for anti terrorism and natural pollution applications in air and water for protection of water supplies  buildings  subway systems  tunnels and ventilation systems   GE Inspection Technologies  Inspection Systems for Propulsion Equipment    1 5 million  Navy propulsion systems must be inspected at regular intervals  Currently there is little integration of test protocols and individuals performing inspections lack the hardware and software for guided inspection requirements  Also  there is no capability to transmit in real time the data collected during on board inspections to remote experts who can make the determination of fitness for service of the propulsion system under inspection  Funding will aid development of hardware and software leading to an interactive inspection reporting system that provides inspection guidance and the ability to communicate  in real time via the internet  with remote experts assisting in the fitness determination of the inspected propulsion system  The inspection standardization will help to improve overall inspection quality of propulsion systems and reduce the need to take equipment off line   PAR Government Systems Corp  Multi mission Advanced Sensor System    3 million  Funding will be used to design  build and deploy a small multi mission advanced sensor system  MASS  that will employ a small  low cost multi spectral VNIR LWIR sensor integrated into a 5 inch turret coupled with an onboard processing system and installed on a class II unmanned aerial vehicle  This system will provide an affordable sensor with utility in missions such as unit level military operations  local civil disaster relief and assessment  federal and state law enforcement  and border security   Defenshield  Mobile Defense Fighting Position    3 5 million  The Mobile Defensive Fighting Position  MDFP  is a bullet  blast and fragment resistant barrier  providing force protection for the U S  and Iraqi military  Funding will procure an additional 260 Defenshield MDFP model DS 192 ballistic shields  fully assembled and equipped with ATV tires  ballistic glass and armor certified to 30 06 Armor Piercing    DII Technologies  Interoperability Network to Fuse and Exchange Real Time Information  INFER     800 000  The INFER program seeks to develop a real time information processing system to assist leaders at all levels in making critical decisions in a military environment or during local national emergencies by combining existing and developing information collection and processing technology to create an improved command and control system  Using Liberty Island as a test bed  and taking advantage of the high traffic  complex environment associated with the Liberty Island facility  the INFER program will develop and demonstrate a command and control system capable of providing decision makers with real time exchange and multi level fusion of actionable information
