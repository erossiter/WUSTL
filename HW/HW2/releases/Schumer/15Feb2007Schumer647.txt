IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 15  2007 Schumer Calls On President Bush To End The Deadlock And Bring Shared Border Management To Buffalo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Eleventh Hour Issues Have Brought Recent Talks to a Near Standstill with Fed Agencies Dragging Their Feet   Schumer Calls on President Bush to Immediately Convene a Bi National Summit to Break the Logjam and Resolve Security and Logistical Issues Once and for All   Senator  President Must Step in to End the Jawboning and Bureaucratic Wrangling So Recent Progress is Not Undone     Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer wrote a personal letter to President George W  Bush asking him to take charge in the ongoing negotiations over Shared Border Management and immediately convene a bi national summit between Canadian and U S  officials in order to resolve security issues once and for all  Schumer said that despite recent progress  the Department of Homeland Security  the Department of Justice  and Canadian officials continue to revisit logistical and security issues  throwing up ever changing roadblocks to a final agreement        We need leadership from President Bush to break this logjam  The wrangling and finger pointing have gone on for long enough   Schumer said   From security  economic  land use and common sense perspectives  there is every reason to do this deal  On both sides of the Niagara River  the only thing lacking is the political will and leadership to get to the finish line and the President of the United States is uniquely able to make that happen  The bottom line is that the federal agencies need to come to the table  face to face  and solve the security and logistical issues that have bogged down this process   The President has supported this endeavor in the past and now is the time for him to get back in this game and exert decisive action        In December of 2004  then DHS secretary Tom Ridge and Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Anne McClellan agreed to establish a framework for land pre clearance that would allow for the construction of new border facilities at the New York ports of entry at Buffalo Ft Erie and Alexandria Bay  In Buffalo Ft  Erie  all primary and secondary border operations would occur on the Canadian side of border  while in Alexandria Bay they would be consolidated to the United States side   These pilot facilities  run jointly by the United States and Canada  were intended to be models that would improve security for both nations  deepen trading partnerships and provide for expedited land passage for individual travelers         Though the agencies expressed a strong commitment to progress at the time  bureaucratic wrangling and unresolved security and logistics issues have plagued this project for more than two years   In his letter  Schumer said that the President must direct Attorney General Gonzalez and DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff to come to the table face to face with their Canadian counterparts to resolve the outstanding security issues   I have worked closely over the last several years with officials on both sides of the border to help forge an agreement on the issues involved in these negotiations   Unfortunately  talks have not always proceeded with alacrity  Given the longstanding commitment to this effort on both sides of the border  I strongly believe that a resolution should be possible if there is a sufficient amount of will to succeed         Schumer said that if such a summit with the principals is not scheduled with all due speed  he would explore additional measures to push the parties toward an agreement  Schumer said   Enough already  Our nation has forged agreements to bring peace to Serbia and the Balkans and to reduce the nuclear threat in North Korea  Yes  Shared Border Management is complex  but it is far from insoluble if there is a sincere desire to get to yes with our closest ally and biggest trading partner        Last month  Schumer called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez to come to the table and work with DHS and Canadian security officials to resolve one of the last major remaining issues relating to developing a protocol for travelers coming from Canada who decide not to cross the border after their primary inspection  U S  practice is to require these travelers to be fingerprinted  but Canadian law prevents border guards from fingerprinting these travelers       Schumer also highlighted the importance of reaching a final agreement on shared border management so that progress could proceed with a new signature peace bridge in Buffalo   The Public Bridge Authority has indicated that it needs a decision by May of 2007 to proceed with construction in 2008  Without a decision  this project could be subject to pricey cost over runs        Also last month  Schumer met with Stockwell Day in his Washington DC office and spoke with Chertoff personally  In September 2006  Schumer announced a new deal between U S  and Canadian officials that would allow Canadian officers to carry weapons at the check point  In December 2004  Schumer  along with Former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge  announced the initial agreement between the US and Canada to pursue the shared border management model
