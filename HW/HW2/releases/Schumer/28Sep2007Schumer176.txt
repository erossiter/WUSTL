IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 28  2007 New Schumer Study Reveals  Despite 99  Surge in Staten Island Foreclosures in Past Year  Big Lending Companies Still Pushing Deceptive Mortgages to New York Consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           As Staten Island Tops New York in Rate of Foreclosures  Schumer Urges Alert on Ads Pushing Misleading Loans on Homebuyers In Depths of Foreclosure Crisis Ads Imperil Additional Homeowners as New Figures Place Cost of Mortgages in Foreclosure on Staten Island at Staggering  56 Million   From August Alone Standing With Senators Savino  Klein  Evicted Staten Isla With new numbers released today showing that Staten Island foreclosures have surged over the past year  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that major mortgage lenders  some of whom are in bankruptcy themselves  are still constantly advertising and pushing on consumers the very same loans that have brought on the current crisis  Schumer said that banks should not be offering these loans and sucking more Staten Island homebuyers and homeowners in to taking on more debt attached to a sky high interest rate  Subprime loans  made to borrowers with poor and nontraditional credit histories  have wreaked havoc in the mortgage market as higher interest rates have led to rising defaults and delinquencies among borrowers  Schumer also discussed his Borrowers Protection Act of 2007  which will create stricter standards within the mortgage industry to protect homebuyers   The mortgage crisis has created a perfect storm for homeowners on Staten Island and across the country  Schumer said  It is inexcusable that lenders are continuing to advertise subprime loans as if everything was hunky dory  Unfortunately  instead of working with endangered homeowners  unscrupulous lenders are going out of their way to push high risk loans on unsuspecting homebuyers  We need all hands on deck to stem the rising tide of foreclosures   Schumer today blasted major mortgage lenders for continuing to advertise deceptive and expensive home loans to homebuyers despite the current credit crisis and the collapse of the subprime mortgage market  Over the past few years  thousands of Staten Islanders and millions of Americans have been suckered into taking out subprime loans  claiming to offer low interests rates  but actually attaching large hidden fees and unexpected interest rate spikes  Now  millions of homeowners are facing interest payments that far exceed their initial required payment and are struggling to avoid foreclosure    However  as Schumer revealed today  despite the wave of foreclosures  lenders are still flooding television  newspapers  and the internet with advertisements pushing the very same loans that have caused the current crisis and cost millions of homeowners thousands of dollars and even their homes    For example  on AOL com this week  the Internet based loan company LendingTree offered a Refinance  Lower Payments deal for a  400 000 loan for only  1 875 a month  Schumer also said that constant television advertising by Countrywide and LendingTree makes no mention of the pitfalls and current dangers of taking out subprime  and variable rate loans  leaving unsuspecting consumers thinking that these loans are still safe to take out  According to the Washington Post  even though dozens of lenders have shut down their mortgage operations or laid off employees  many others are trying to generate interest among potential borrowers even if the companies ultimately cannot qualify them for loans   Schumer today released a new report showing that the same subprime loans that are still being advertised have created an unprecedented surge in home foreclosure that has spread across the country and now reached Staten Island  which suffers one of the highest rates of foreclosure in the state  The new study  from Profiles Publications  Inc   a New York company  differs from previous studies in that it tracks individual households in forclosure proceedings  as opposed to tracking foreclosure filings  since one house can have multiple filings  The study found that    The number of mortgage foreclosures initiated against property owners on Staten Island increased 99  to 175 mortgage defaults in August 2007 from 88 mortgage defaults in August 2006  The average dollar amount of a mortgage in foreclosure on Staten Island increased 31  to  319 255 51 in August 2007 from an average dollar amount of  243 517 55 in August 2006  The total dollar amount of all mortgage defaults made on Staten Island increased 161  in August 2007 to  55 869 715 00 from a total dollar amount of  21 429 544 00 in August 2006  Five lenders accounted for 46  of all mortgage foreclosure filings on Staten Island in August 2007  In order  they are  Wells Fargo Bank  24   Deutsche Bank  NT Co   23   The Bank of New York  12   U S  Bank N A   12   Countrywide Home Loans  10   In August 2007  69  of the foreclosures were in just 6 zip codes of the 14 zip codes on Staten Island  10312  29   10303  23   10314  19   10306  17   10305  16  and 10309  16     To protect homeowners and ensure that millions more potential buyers avoid getting scammed  Schumer today announced a two point plan to crack down on potentially false advertising by lenders    FTC Advertising Alert  Schumer today called on the Federal Trade Commission to immediately issue a widespread consumer alert to help potential homebuyers avoid misleading advertising and loans  While the FTC is currently investigating subprime mortgage advertising  it has yet to issue a consumer alert advisory and post information on their website to help the average consumer  Schumer said that during the current crisis  consumers need as much information as possible to avoid trouble    Legislation Creating First Ever Standards to Crack Down on Predatory Lenders  Schumer is also the author of the Borrower s Protection Act of 2007  which requires all lenders to register with the federal government and establishes a fiduciary duty for mortgage brokers and other non bank mortgage originators  The bill also creates a faith and fair dealing standard for all originators and for the first time prohibits steering  i e  brokers may not direct or counsel a consumer to rates  charges and principal amount or prepayment terms that are not appropriate or suitable for the them    Schumer was joined by State Senators Diane Savino and Jeff Klein  as well as Legal Services lawyer Margaret Becker  Schumer was also joined by Ada Diaz  a Staten Island resident and retired hospital bookkeeper who took out a loan with an adjustable rate to finance repairs on her long time home  Though Ms  Diaz is nearly legally blind  an agent convinced her to take out the loan without complete knowledge of its ramifications  and has since been evicted due to the fact that she was unable to make loan payments that amounted to 91  of her monthly income
