IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 12  2007 Schumer Reveals  HUD Dubious Of Starrett City Sale  Vows To Work With HUD To Block Deal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Senator  With a Price Tag at 1 3 Billion  There is No Way the Buyer Can Afford to keep Development Middle Class  Fears Massive Tenant Eviction With This Plan  Schumer  Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee  Vows that the Deal Will Not Go Forward Without an Ironclad Agreement from Any Buyer that Starrett Stays Affordable                                                                                 Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer moved to block the sale of Starrett City  one of New York s largest affordable housing developments located in the East New York and Canarsie sections of Brooklyn  The property is spread across 140 acres and consists of 46 towers  which contain 5 881 apartments and over 14 000 tenants  Schumer revealed today that HUD has the power to forbid the sale of this critically important middle class housing development and urged them to do so immediately  Schumer  who is Chairman of the Senate Housing Subcommittee  vowed today that he would not allow the deal to go through without an ironclad agreement from any buyer that Starrett stays affordable         Anyone who pays  221 000 per apartment pays off the balance of a  243 million mortgage and willingly accepts an additional  8 million a year in property taxes is going to need to charge top dollar for these units   Schumer said   Experts across the board agree  it will be impossible for someone paying this price not to convert the units into high price rentals or ritzy condominiums  Without question  a sale at this price will change the character of Starrett forever         New York City is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis   The continual erosion of affordable homes must be stopped    and we are saying it stops right here  right now   said Christine C  Quinn  Speaker of the City Council   There are many questions about this sale  The new owner s track record includes many unsafe buildings  a cause for great alarm  We have not yet heard about how the new owners will protect affordable apartments for the families that have made their lives here  There has been talk of new luxury development    but can the existing infrastructure support thousands of new apartments  One thing we know for sure    every level of government must work together to make sure this sale is done in a way that protects the current tenants and preserves affordable housing   Any significant new development proposals for the vacant land will have to come before the City Council  We will do a thorough public review that will include looking at whether affordable housing will be maintained        On Thursday of last week  the prospective buyer of Starrett City  Clipper Equity LLC  offered  1 3 billion to purchase the development  This price puts per unit cost for 5 881 apartments at  221 000  Bids for the property began at  600 million and the second closest bid was  500 million below that offered by Clipper Equity  The buyer also announced his intention at that time to withdraw Starrett City from the State Mitchell Lama program by paying the balance of a  243 6 million mortgage  Withdrawing from the Mitchell Lama program would not only put thousands of tenants at risk  but it would also raise the new owners  taxes to  12 million a year from  3 7 million  Many real estate experts believe that the high purchase price of Starrett City and the new financial obligations the owner would face would mean they would be forced to convert large swaths of the development into high priced rentals and or condominiums        The prospective buyer currently holds a sizable New York City property portfolio consisting of 4 768 apartments in 71 buildings  However  last week  the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development last week reported that there were 8 792 outstanding maintenance code violations amongst these properties        Given the magnitude of Federal investment into the project  HUD says they have the authority to accept or reject the deal  According to HUD  property owners benefiting from federal subsidies must demonstrate that they are responsible individuals acting in the public interest  HUD has the further obligation to investigate the prospective buyers other property holdings to assess their ability to manage a large and complex development  Based on Clipper Equity s record of thousands of violations and its lack of plan to ensure Starrett City s affordability  it is well within the jurisdiction of HUD to reject the deal        Over the years  Starrett City has relied on a large pastiche of Federal  State and City subsidies to ensure the developments affordability and upkeep  With a mortgage underwritten by the New York State  the entirety of Starrett City is considered a Mitchell Lama development and as such there are restrictions on the rental prices of units and the income levels of tenants  Approximately 626 units are in the Mitchell Lama program without any additional subsidy        Other subsidies have been added to further underwrite the affordability of other units in the development  2442 of the units are subsidized through the Federal Rental Assistance Program  RAP   In this program  the Department of Housing and Urban Development negotiates long term leases for tenants  paying the difference to the owner between what tenants can afford and the market rate rent for that unit  The RAP contract at Starrett City expires in 2016        An additional 1000  units are kept affordable through the project based Section 8 program  In the 1980 s  then Congressman Schumer introduced legislation that attached section 8 vouchers directly to housing units  keeping them affordable after tenants vacated their apartments  Now a standard program  this project based Section 8 legislation was amongst the first of its kind when it was introduced at Starrett City  Eligible tenants pay 30  of their income towards rent  with HUD making up the difference to what they determine is fair market rent for the unit
