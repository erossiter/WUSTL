IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 5  2006 Schumer  Alito Stonewalling Could Jeopardize Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Supreme Court Nominee Has Greater Obligation to Answer Questions on Presidential Authority  Commerce Clause  and Roe   Every Nominee Has an Obligation to Answer Questions and Be Candid About Their Views  But Even More So When the Nominee Has Already Expressed a Controversial Opinion on a Given Subject   Even Under So Called   Ginsburg Standard    Alito Has an Obligation to Answer These Quest Today  Sen  Chuck Schumer  the top Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  addressed the Center for American Progress and American Constitution Society regarding the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court on the eve of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings next week  Schumer  s speech stressed the greater obligation that Judge Alito has than previous nominees to answer questions at the hearing because many of his known legal views are way out of the judicial mainstream  Schumer also suggested that stonewalling by Judge Alito could jeopardize his nomination to the highest court in the land        Schumer  s speech follows       Judge Alito  s Unique Burden      I would like to thank the Center for American Progress and the American Constitution Society for sponsoring this event       After 11 years without a single Supreme Court nomination  the Senate sits on the eve of considering the second nomination to the High Court in just four months  the third if you count Harriet Miers        People have asked me how this nomination is different from the Roberts  s nomination  how these hearings will be different from the last       As I have been saying for more than four years now  every Supreme Court nominee has a solemn responsibility at his or her confirmation hearing to be candid and forthright  Every nominee has an obligation to answer questions about his or her legal philosophy and method of legal reasoning       In the post Harriet Miers world  when so many on the right were saying the same things about the obligation of a nominee to answer questions  that position is now widely accepted        Only in that way do we honestly fulfill our obligation to give advice and consent  only in that way do the American people get to participate in understanding what type of Justice their elected representatives are voting on       The obligation  however  is greater for some nominees  It is greater when a nominee has taken a clear position on a legal matter        That  I submit  is the case with Judge Alito  While there are many  many questions raised by Judge Alito  s opinions and writings  today I want to highlight several areas that show the need for Judge Alito to answer questions fully and forthrightly at the hearings next week    Judge Alito  s written record on executive power  his written record on Congressional power  and his written record on the issue of personal autonomy and choice  just to name a few       On at least these issues and perhaps many others  Judge Alito has more to answer for than any other Supreme Court nominee in memory       That is because the obligation increases when a nominee has spoken out    in a clear and direct way    on a particular issue  as Judge Alito has       When that nominee has taken a position on a legal matter    particularly when he has done so strongly and stridently  as Judge Alito has    there is a greater obligation to answer questions       The logic of the mantra  repeated by John Roberts at his hearing  that one could not speak on a subject because the issue was likely to come before him quickly evaporates when the nominee has a record on the subject       Thus  even under the so called   Ginsburg precedent       which was endorsed by Judge Roberts  Republican Senators  and the White House    Judge Alito must answer questions on topics that he has written about       1  Executive Power and Warrantless Wiretapping   On the issue of executive power  Alito has defended a radical theory of separation of powers called the   unitary executive    theory  This theory holds that Congress has no power to create any independent commission or law that in any way involves an act that Alito and his supporters think involves any type of execution of law  He endorsed  in writing  a truly vast power for the President       Under this view of separation of powers  the Independent Counsel Act was unconstitutional  the Sentencing Commission is unconstitutional  and the FTC is unconstitutional  The President likely has completely unchecked authorities to act without congressional oversight in the area of foreign affairs despite the fact that the Constitution entrusts only Congress with the power to   declare War          Under Judge Alito s view  the 9 11 Commission may have been an unconstitutional encroachment upon the   unitary executive          The President would seem to have inherent authority to wiretap American citizens without a warrant  to ignore congressional acts at will  or to take any other action he saw fit under his inherent powers        Also  in a 1984 memo to the Solicitor General  Alito examined the question whether the Attorney General and his staff should have absolute immunity from suit even when they blatantly or intentionally violate the Constitution  including the unconstitutional wiretapping of American citizens  Alito wrote that he did   not question that the Attorney General should have this immunity     but noted that   for tactical reasons  I would not raise the issue here          Does he still hold these views  Does he believe in any checks on Presidential power  Does he believe that warrantless wiretapping of Americans is Constitutional  Does he believe the FTC should not exist  We deserve straight answers at the hearing       These issues have never been more important in light of recent revelations about warrantless wiretapping       2  Congressional Power under the Commerce Clause   Similarly  on the issue of federalism  he has taken an extreme view  He ruled in US v  Rybar that Congress had exceeded its power by prohibiting the possession of machine guns       His opinion was a major cutback on Congress  s power to protect the safety and welfare of American citizens  The other judges on his court all disagreed with him  And all five other circuits which had considered the issue disagreed with him       Since his decision in the machine gun case  the Supreme Court has cut back  in a case called Raich  on what the Rehnquist Court tried to do in the 1990 s in a 2004 medical marijuana case       I specifically asked Judge Alito in our private meeting to consider whether that case would have affected his decision in the machine gun case  whether he agrees with the reasoning of Raich  He said he would think about it  I hope he has  and he has an obligation to provide an answer        Does he still hold these cramped views of Congressional power  Does he agree with the reasoning of the recent medical marijuana case  which restored some of the Congressional authority the Rehnquist Court had tried to take away in the 1990 s  We deserve straight answers at the hearing       3  Privacy   And of course  here is what Judge Alito famously said about reproductive rights  In the widely reported job application he submitted to the Office of Legal Counsel in 1985  Judge Alito wrote the following          I t has been an honor and source of personal satisfaction for me to serve in the office of the Solicitor General during President Reagan  s administration and to help to advance legal positions in which I personally believe very strongly  I am particularly proud of my contributions in recent cases in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court       that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion          Let me just repeat what he said in those two sentences         I personally believe very strongly       that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion          Does he stand by those statements  Does he still have the same view of the Constitution  We deserve a straight answer at the hearings       We also now know that in the same year  1985  Judge Alito authored a detailed  17 page memorandum while at the Solicitor General  s Office  setting forth a legal strategy in Thornburgh v  American College of Obstetricians    a legal strategy designed to accomplish the ultimate overruling of Roe v  Wade  This is what he wrote         What can be made of this opportunity to advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v  Wade and  in the meantime  of mitigating its effects             W e should make clear that we disagree with Roe v  Wade and would welcome the opportunity to brief the issue of whether  and if so to what extent  that decision should be overruled          Does he stand by those statements  We deserve a straight answer at the hearings       Does he still   personally believe very strongly      that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion          Or is he going to distance himself from those comments       He may suggest that the views he expressed on Roe were merely personal and so not to be given weight       That argument cannot be taken seriously by any serious person  What Judge Alito articulated in his 1985 job application was a legal view  not a personal one  It may have been a personal legal view    but there is no distinction when one is a judge  That is what judges decide cases on    their personal legal views       A purely personal and non legal view would include being personally against abortion or against the death penalty or against handguns  But  an expressed view that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion or does not permit the death penalty or does not permit the banning of handguns are 100 percent legal views    legal views that necessarily define a judge  s judicial philosophy   It may be the case that one  s personal legal view has to yield to a contrary precedent when one is a lower court judge  but that is a different issue       And  of course  when one sits on the Supreme Court  one  s personal legal view of the Constitution need not yield to anything  In fact  when one sits on the Supreme Court  one  s personal legal view of the Constitution    if joined by four others    becomes the law of the land       This does not mean there is a litmus test on any of these three issues  but it is certainly a factor that Senators and citizens can consider in evaluating the Alito nomination       Let me try for a moment to convey in a different way how astonishing it is that we have a nominee with such a record    in a way that might resonate with some of my friends across the aisle  who might question why I take this so seriously       Imagine if a Supreme Court nominee had put the following statements in writing         I personally believe very strongly       that the Constitution does not protect a right to possess a handgun            I personally believe very strongly that the death penalty can never be applied under the Constitution            I personally believe very strongly that the First Amendment does not apply to the states            I personally believe very strongly that the Constitution does not allow the President to take military action of any kind without prior Congressional approval          What do you suppose would be the reaction from many Senators inside and outside the Judiciary Committee if a Supreme Court nominee had made such blanket statements       And what if the nominee had not only stated this   strong    view  but boasted in a job application that he was   particularly proud    of the work he had done at the highest levels of government to convince the Supreme Court of the correctness of these views       There would be understandable concerns that he would not really have an open mind if the issue came before him on the Supreme Court  unless there were some elaboration or clarification of those previous statements       I dare say  many would be prepared to withhold their votes if he ducked questions about those subjects       So  in Judge Alito  s case  when these questions are asked  I hope we do not hear resort to convenient excuses  false precedents  and tortured logic       The expected excuses for not being open and honest with the American people should not fly this time around        And if he stonewalls at the hearings  that could jeopardize his nomination        His obligation to answer questions is certainly greater than John Roberts  s  because he has spoken out on more issues       He will not be able to use as a mantra the excuse that the issue might come before him on the Court  These issues have already come before him and he has a record on them       That is why we will hold him at a minimum to the Administration  s interpretation of the so called Ginsburg precedent    seemingly accepted by the President  John Roberts  and my friends from across the aisle  He must answer questions on the issues he has already written and spoken about    whether as a judge or a Reagan Administration official        Let me run through four of them and explain why  especially in Judge Alito  s case  they should not be accepted       1  The So called   Ginsburg Precedent      First  will we hear the misused excuse for not answering legitimate questions directly    the so called   Ginsburg precedent          We heard that before during the Roberts hearings  We heard John Roberts say over and over again that he could not answer questions    invoking Justice Ginsburg    on the theory that such issues could come before him on the Court and he did not want to give a hint or prejudgment on how he might rule       As I have said before  that term as used by John Roberts and his supporters was an oxymoron    it neither reflected Ginsburg  nor was it a controlling precedent       However  even under the tortured application of the so called precedent favored by Justice Roberts and his supporters  they had to concede that Justice Ginsburg DID answer questions expansively on issues where her views were known because she had written about them       Therefore  at a minimum  we will hold Judge Alito  s feet to the fire on these issues    executive power  the authority of the Congress under the Commerce Clause  and on Roe  We will hold him to the standard that his supporters have already said is appropriate       Here is Justice Roberts at his September confirmation hearing  talking about Justice Ginsburg  s candor  for example  in discussing the issue of choice         Then Judge Ginsburg  now Justice Ginsburg  explained that she thought she was at greater liberty to discuss her writings  She had written extensively on that area  and I think that s why she felt at greater liberty to talk about those cases      And here he is again         I think it does make sense that she can be questioned about the articles that she had written  because they raised certain questions and she felt at liberty to discuss those          Again  Judge Alito has written on various subjects and should be obligated to discuss them openly and candidly       I hope that Judge Alito will follow THAT Ginsburg precedent  rather than use it as a convenient excuse not to answer a legitimate question about his own prior writings       For example  on the issue of choice    a subject on which Justice Ginsburg was especially open at her hearings    Judge Alito must answer clearly whether he stands by his prior stated view that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion       Just as importantly  on the issue of executive power  Judge Alito must answer clearly about his views of checks and balances  Given that he    at one time at least    believed in absolute immunity for officials who engaged in warrantless wiretapping  he has a particular obligation to be forthcoming at the hearings       Does he still have that same legal view  What are the limits of the power of the President to bypass the Constitution and the Congress        Recent revelations and Judge Alito  s own record  of course  will make these central questions at the hearings       And his answers    or refusals to answer    will be central to the question of whether he should be confirmed       Similarly  on the issue of Congressional power  Judge Alito  s outlier opinion in the machine gun case    Rybar    means that he must answer detailed questions about his views on the limits of federalism       What ability does Congress have to regulate machine guns under the Commerce Clause  Does he agree with the reasoning of the recent medical marijuana case    Raich    which cut back on the movement towards restricting Congress  s power       On each of these issues    to pick just three examples    Judge Alito has a written record  And  according to the Ginsburg precedent and the Roberts precedent  he must answer questions about those views without ducking       2  Ideology and Judicial Philosophy Don  t Matter   Second  will we hear   as we have before    that ideology doesn  t matter  That views on particular Constitutional questions don  t matter  That we should only conduct a rote and robotic review of a resume       That view continues to be wrongheaded for all the reasons I have been discussing for over four years  history shows that the founders did not intend that Senators focus only on credentials  but also on ideology and judicial philosophy  See  for example  the defeated nomination of John Rutledge over his views of the Jay Treaty in 1795       But while remote history demonstrates the argument  s flaws  recent history exposes its hypocrisy       How quickly have some of my friends forgotten the ill fated nomination of Harriet Miers  When she    and not Sam Alito    was the nominee  they practically fell over themselves to argue that she had to provide conservative comfort on her views       Just weeks after stridently asserting that Judge Roberts should be confirmed without any probing inquiry  many of the same people    without any hint of irony    with equal stridency demanded answers from Harriet Miers       While they demanded a coronation for John Roberts  they desired an inquisition for Harriet Miers       Here is one Senator  a member of the Judiciary Committee  speaking about Harriet Miers         But my issue  really  is  how will she rule on cases that come up  How is she going to rule on these key  tough privacy cases  private property right cases      Sen  Brownback  Fox News  10 21 05       Here is another Senator         I look forward to hearing more about her qualifications and judicial philosophy      Sen  Coburn  USA Today  10 4 05       Here is another         She  s going to have to be pretty forthcoming at least about her judicial philosophy       There are people who have bled a lot to get to this point  This is a historic opportunity to finally have the opportunity to get some right thinking people on the Supreme Court  and we don  t want to miss it      Sen  Thune  Boston Globe  10 6 05       Here is yet another         From her background  it looks like she  s qualified to be a judge  but what does that tell me about her  It doesn  t tell me anything      Sen  Bunning  Cincinnati Enquirer  10 20 05       So  when I or other Senators ask Judge Alito whether he stands by his prior statements  I hope we will not hear the excuse that ideology and constitutional views are irrelevant or off limits       3  Avoiding Appearance of Prejudgement and Bias   Third  will we hear from Judge Alito the excuse that answering questions about executive power  or Congressional power  or Roe v  Wade will render him biased on issues that may come before the Court       In this case  that argument is both self serving and silly  In the last example  given that Judge Alito has already made blanket statements about his view of the Constitution and his support for the overruling of Roe  he has ALREADY given the appearance of bias  he has ALREADY given the suggestion of pre judgment of a question that will likely come before the Supreme Court       Similarly  on the issue of executive power  Judge Alito has ALREADY suggested that officials should not be held ultimately accountable for even for willful violations of the Constitution  Therefore  he has an obligation to speak to the issue       And  he has ALREADY ruled to limit congressional power  and must therefore explain his perspective on this crucial issue as well       So  if Judge Alito bases his unwillingness to answer these questions on some ill conceived notion of bias or prejudice  the only thing that will be prejudiced will be the democratic process       4  Merely Advocacy   Fourth  will Judge Alito attempt to sidestep questions about his Constitutional beliefs by dismissing his prior writings as those of merely an advocate    whether for the Reagan Administration or for himself in lobbying for a better job with that Administration       Unlike John Roberts  who could plausibly claim that the positions he advocated did not necessarily reflect his own views  though in my mind they probably did   Judge Alito specifically adopted them as his own         I am particularly proud of my contributions in recent cases in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion          While it is conceivable that a Government lawyer does not subscribe to the view he advocates in a brief or in court  with this telling sentence  Judge Alito revealed that    at least on many if not all issues    his own views and those of the Administration were one and the same       Sometimes lawyers believe what they argue  sometimes they don  t  When it came to affirmative action and the correctness of Roe  he not only believed what he argued but he was   particularly proud    of that work       So  any suggestion that one cannot infer Judge Altio  s views from his government advocacy defies common sense       And  regardless of whether they were merely the arguments of an advocate  rather than the beliefs of the attorney himself  given the record  Judge Alito must tell us what his own views are on these questions       The bottom line is that there is no good reason for Judge Alito not to clarify the record at his hearing  Therefore  I believe Judge Alito must tell us without equivocation and without evasion  whether he stands by his prior statements       The American people deserve direct answers to these simple questions       If Judge Alito refuses to disavow those views or refuses to embrace those views or refuses even to discuss those views  we can be left to draw only one conclusion    that he continues to hold them       If Judge Alito refuses to answer these questions  it will be extremely difficult    if not impossible    to vote for him  Indeed  it could jeopardize his nomination
