                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Despite Sending  5 3 Million to Nassau County and  3 2 Million to Suffolk County Since 2001  Grant Program Now on Butcher Block    Long Island Funding Cuts Imminent   FIRE Grants Fund Life Saving Equipment and Training  Offer Financial Assistance to Departments Struggling to Stay Afloat    Schumer To Detail New Plan To Restore Full Funding                                                     Revealing that New York State fire departments could lose  31 million for equipment  training  and vehicles under a new federal budget proposal  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer unveiled a plan to restore full funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  FIRE grants   Responsible for providing Long Island Fire Departments with  8 5 million since it  s inception in 2001   Nassau County and Suffolk County fire departments received  5 3 million and  3 2 million respectively  the FIRE grants program is now slated for severe cuts  Today  Senator Schumer visited the West Sayville Fire Department  which serves the communities of Oakdale  West Sayville  and parts of Bohemia and Sayville  The West Sayville Fire Department received more than  107 000 in 2005 to purchase 51 new portable radios  Before this grant  only one responding officer was able to carry a radio  Now  all responders are armed with this vital technical equipment to improve communication at a scene  Schumer was joined by a number of other Long Island Fire Departments as he outlined his plan for full restoration of the program       Everyday New York  s firefighters risk their lives fighting fires and protecting our communities from peril     said Senator Schumer    So why should they have to worry about fighting budget cuts too  This program  in jeopardy of being gutted like a warehouse during a five alarm fire  is vital to outfitting Long Island fire fighters with the top notch equipment they need to keep our communities safe  We owe it to them to fight tooth and nail to restore full funding        Despite the statewide success of the FIRE grants program which over the years has delivered more than  101 million to NYS   fire departments  this year the Bush Administration proposed a 46  decrease in funding for the program from last year  s appropriation  from  542 million to  293 million  This is the third year in a row that the Bush Administration has proposed cuts to the program  Congress  however  a longtime advocate of the program  proposed  1 billion this year  and since 2001 has proposed significant annual increases in funding for the program  Last year  the Administration proposed cutting the program to  500 million from  650 million but Congress restored funding to  542 million  still well short of the  950 million they originally authorized  Schumer said that if the federal government fails to fully fund Congress   authorization of  1 billion  already financially strapped fire departments will be seriously affected by the cuts      Under the Administration  s proposed cuts  Nassau County and Suffolk County fire departments could lose  1 5 million and  965 000  Since 2001  FIRE grants have funneled over  8 5 million in the form of 55 separate grants to Long Island fire departments  In 2005 alone   2 9 million in grants went to Nassau and Suffolk counties  and the West Sayville Fire Department  received more than  107 000 which allowed it to purchase 51 additional handheld portable radios  Prior to the purchase  West Sayville fire fighters were forced to share one radio per truck  leaving them deprived of communication when they dispersed at the site of a fire  Franklin Square and Munson Fire Department received  297 000 in 2004  Freeport Fire Department  248 000 in 2004 and the Village of Northport Fire Department received  285 000 in 2005      The loss of funding would be detrimental to Long Island  s fire departments and impede them from hiring additional firefighting personnel  conducting specialized emergency response training and fire prevention programs  creating wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  and purchasing equipment and facility upgrades such as new fire trucks  These grants are distributed through the Department of Homeland Security  s Office of Domestic Preparedness and are a main component of the federal government  s efforts to aid local first responders      In response to the proposed cuts  Schumer is launching a grassroots campaign by sending petitions to every fire department in the state  asking firefighters to join his call to restore funding  Arguing that the program puts life saving equipment in the hands of first responders  Schumer noted that mobilizing firefighters across the state could be an effective way to show how critical these grants are to localities that need them       Schumer also announced today that he would join with Senate colleagues later this year to support an amendment to the budget that would restore the entire  1 billion to the FIRE grants program  Already Senator Schumer and several of his colleagues sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee asking for full funding of the Assistance to Firefighter Grant program  Both the House and Senate Homeland Security Appropriations committees increased funding for the program to  655 million for FY07 up from the President  s Budget request of  293 450 000  The bill is expected to go to the House Senate Conference Committee in the next few months  where Schumer will fight for full funding to the authorized level     Schumer helped create the original Grants to Firefighters Program  co sponsoring legislation in 2001 that led to its establishment  This program was passed with bi partisan support including Senator Chris Dodd  D CT   Senator John McCain  R AZ   Senator Susan Collins  R ME   and many others   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program was established to provide funding to career and volunteer fire departments and non affiliated emergency medical services providers to help with the rising costs of equipment  vehicles and training  However  soon after the program  s establishment  Schumer played a central role in preventing the Bush Administration from eliminating funding for the program from the 2001 budget  Schumer also co sponsored the 2004 re authorization  which set full funding levels for the program at  1 billion in FY 2007
