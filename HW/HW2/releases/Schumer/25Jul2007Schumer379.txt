IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 25  2007 With Historic Niagara Falls Region In Dire Need Of Federal Funding For Revitalization  Schumer Announces Senate Committee Passes Bill To Designate It A National Heritage Area                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Despite its Natural Beauty  the U S  side of Niagara Falls has Seen Tourism Plummet and is Marked by Aging Infrastructure  Blighted Land   Just Across from the Well Developed Canadian Side    Bill Will Give WNY The Federal Expertise And  10 Million in Federal Funding To Make Niagara Falls A Top Tier National Treasure   Bill Folds Local Control  Federal Dollars  and Professional Parks Exper Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that his bill to designate Niagara Falls a National Heritage Area passed out of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  taking a giant step towards receiving up to  10 million in funding and federal recognition  While Niagara Falls is one of Americas natural wonders  it has recently suffered from declining tourism  deteriorating infrastructure and blighted land  The National Heritage Area designation would enable the National Park Service  NPS  to assist local efforts to protect the Niagara Reservation s natural resources  and open up new funding sources while promoting development and tourism in the region   Today Niagara Falls has taken a giant step closer towards receiving the resources and attention it needs to maintain its position as one of the natural wonders of the world  This will reenergize efforts to boost the Falls and let the region tap into the federal government s resources to aid their long term Niagara Falls revitalization efforts  This beautiful sight deserves to be preserved for future generations of New Yorkers and tourists   The Niagara River corridor has played an important role in our nations history  Native American culture  early European exploration  the French and Indian War  the American Revolution  the War of 1812  the Underground Railroad and the development of hydro electric power all have strong connections to the region  Furthermore  the Niagara River corridor abounds with scenic beauty that offers something for recreational enthusiasts of all stripes  With numerous State parks in the vicinity  hikers  fisherman  birders and hunters flock to the region to enjoy its outdoor splendor   Yet despite these strong assets for tourism  visits on the U S  side of Niagara Falls have been on the decline for several years  And all too frequently  visitors spend far more time on the Canadian side of the falls  while barely visiting the New York side  We need to reverse this trend   Schumers legislation  the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area Act  would designate land and thematic sites surrounding the entire Niagara River corridor from Buffalo in the south  to Lake Ontario in the North  as a National Heritage Area  For the first five years of this heritage area  a federal commission would work to implement a management plan to capture the full benefits of the natural  historic  cultural and recreational resources of the entire Niagara Falls region  Establishing this heritage area will allow Western NY to protect the world class natural resources of Niagara Falls  while promoting tourism and economic development in the region   National Heritage Areas are partnership efforts that tie together a mix of private and public lands linked by geography and a set of related themes  The National Park Service will assist local and state organizations in developing a plan to conserve and promote the region s natural  scenic  cultural and recreational tourist attractions   In addition  as a National Heritage Area  Niagara Falls will be eligible for federal dollars each year  Senator Schumer legislation will authorize  10 million in federal fundsfor up to ten years  Thistype offederal funding has also proven effective in helpingleveragematching funds and contributions fromadditionalpublic and private entities   On May 15  2007  the Senator testified on behalf of the bill before the Subcommittee on National Parks stating that the attractions and resources exist for the Niagara River corridor to become a world class destination  But the attractions it offers lack a comprehensive  unifying thread that ties the elements together in a meaningful way for the visitor  Designating the land a heritage area will help us link the existing sites of interest in a coordinated fashion  market the region effectively and attract more visitors  It will promote collaboration among federal  state and local resources and help spur investment and economic development in the region   Schumer also wrote a personal letter on June 12  2007  toSenator Jeff Bingaman    Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman    requesting that the legislation be considered at the committees next scheduled mark up   Schumer legislation would implement the results of the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area Resource Study  released in November  which explored the feasibility of creating a National Heritage Area in Niagara Falls and proposed several options for its management  This was followed by a public comment period in which many Western New Yorkers spoke in support of both the Heritage Area and the establishment of a federal commission to manage it  In June  NPS released its report which supported a federal commission with local control to oversee the park   In 2001  Schumer and U S  Rep  John LaFalce secured  25 000 for National Park Service officials to put together a list of ways the federal government can assist local revitalization efforts  National Park Service officials presented their recommendations to Schumer s Niagara Falls Advisory Panel  a group of elected officials  community advocates and business leaders exploring what the scope of the federal role should be in the revitalization effort  In 2002  Schumer personally secured  300 000 in the Interior Appropriations bill that was used to implement some of those recommendations  which included pursuing a National Heritage Area designation   In 2005 the National Parks Service completed the congressionally mandated study  They found strong local support for the heritage area as well as a need for the resources it would offer  The report wrote that In order for Niagara Falls to fulfill its strategic role as a key regional attraction  it is necessary for it to upgrade the visitor experience to match the expectations of 21st century travelers The study concluded that based on Niagara Falls natural and cultural resources  the evidence of a thematic framework  the potential for effective public and private partnerships  as well asstrongpublic support the region met the criteria for designation as a National Heritage Area
