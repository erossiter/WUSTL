IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 11  2007 As School Districts Deal With New Budget Crunch  Schumer Report To Reveal Upstate NY Schools Shortchanged In Federal Funding By Nearly  210 Million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Administration Budget Would Underfund No Child Left Behind and Special Ed by More than 40 Percent   Could Mean Limited Resources for Teacher Salaries  Books  and Other Major School Expenses   With New Congress  Schumer Announces New Effort to Restore Full Funding Once and for All   New Schumer County by County Analysis Shows that Federal Budget Stiffs Schools in the Capital Regio As school boards across upstate New York finalize their budgets for the upcoming schools year  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released a new  showing that the Administration plans to shortchange those schools by nearly  210 million this year alone  Schumer released a new analysis of the Administration s education budget showing that schools could be shortchanged funding promised under Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act  which was signed into law in January 2002 and is up for reauthorization this year   Schumer said that  with school districts about to or having already finalized their budgets  and already constrained by lack of sufficient federal support for special education funding  the Administration cannot leave upstate New York students and schools in the lurch        All over upstate New York parents are thinking about their kids going back to school  and they re concerned about the quality of their children s education   Schumer said   But right now  schools are strapped for cash and are depending on Washington to keep its commitment to fund computers  books  teachers  and programs for special ed  Stiffing our schools is going to leave big holes in our schools  budgets and with localities already worrying about tax hikes  it couldn t happen at a worse time     Schumer said that  with state education funds already mired in doubt and property taxes sky high  the federal government must keep its promise to fund upstate New York schools  When No Child Left Behind was originally passed by Congress  the bill included specific funding authorizations for Title I grants for every year of the bill        However  the Administration s Fiscal Year 2008 budget freezes funding for the program at only  13 9 billion  well below the levels included in the original legislation  which calls for an estimated  25 billion in Title I grants for FY2008  This means the program would be underfunded by  11 1 billion  Title I grants provide critical funding to local educational agencies to help raise student achievement in disadvantaged communities  In addition  the money is also meant to help schools meet new accountability measures geared toward improving student performance  such as reading and math tests        Schumer s report analyzed the dollar amounts promised to schools in upstate New York under No Child Left Behind and compared those numbers with the amounts the Administration has proposed to send to the schools  According to Schumer s report  the current FY 2008 budget would shortchange upstate New York school districts by  206 626 600 in Title I funding  distributing only  337 293 000 instead of the  543 919 600 promised under the original legislation  Though the school year runs from the beginning of September to June  the Department of Education gives out Title I grants based on the fiscal year  Schumer report reflects grants to be given out during Fiscal Year 2008 which starts October 1st  2007        Below is how the numbers break out across upstate New York             The Administration s proposed budget would send only  32 203 000 to schools in the Capital Region instead of the  49 565 100 promised   a shortfall of  17 362 100             The Administration s proposed budget would send only  63 112 400 to schools in Central New York instead of the  39 645 000 promised   a shortfall of  24 467 400            The Administration s proposed budget would send only  56 473 000 to schools in the Rochester Finger Lakes area instead of the  95 022 000 promised   a shortfall of  38 549 000           The Administration s proposed budget would send only  83 421 000 to schools in the Hudson Valley instead of the  133 868 000 promised   a shortfall of  50 447 000             The Administration s proposed budget would send only  24 616 000 to schools in the North Country instead of the  35 449 000 promised   a shortfall of  10 833 000            The Administration s proposed budget would send only  27 122 000 to schools in the Southern Tier instead of the  41 342 600 promised   a shortfall of  14 220 600             The Administration s proposed budget would send only  73 813 000 to schools in the Western New York instead of the  124 560 500 promised   a shortfall of  50 747 500        To close this gaping shortfall  Schumer announced he will support efforts to restore full funding for Title I grants when it comes to the floor later this year  The Labor HHS appropriations bill  which includes federal education funding for local school districts  is currently being drafted by the House and Senate appropriations committees        Today  Schumer sent a personal letter to Labor HHS Appropriations Committee leaders Senators Tom Harkin  D IA  and Senator Arlen Specter  R PA  asking them to restore the funding  In his letter  Schumer asked the committee to use a significant share of the  6 1 billion increase provided for the Department of Education in the Senate passed budget resolution to provide school districts with the funding they need for Title I and special education programs       Schumer also said that  since No Child Left Behind must be reauthorized this year  the new Democratic majority will make it a top priority to ensure funding for both Title I grants and the NCLB legislation  Schumer said that the Senate Democrats  led by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   are working on comprehensive reauthorization legislation that will improve administration of the program and strengthen the federal commitment to giving schools access to the resources they need
