IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 2  2007 Schumer Announces  As Stewart Airport Ridership Soars  Airport To Receive Major Spike In Screeners To Reduce Crippling Passenger Lines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           With Ridership Tripling at Stewart  Additional Screeners will Speed up Passenger Lines at the Under Staffed Airport Schumer  a Longtime Champion of Stewart Airport  Fought Back Proposed Cuts to Existing Screeners and Persistently Pressured TSA to Provide Additional Screeners Senator  New Screeners will Alleviate Long Lines for Passengers and Allow Airport to Continue  Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that Stewart Airport will receive a major spike in screener personnel with the addition ofnearlysix new screeners  The airport  which has seen its ridership explode over the past year  has been chronically understaffed with screeners  leading to longer security lines and current screeners being overwhelmed by the influx of passengers and baggage coming through the airport    Schumer  who has repeatedly called on the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  to increase the number of screeners at the airport and  in one case  successfully rolled back proposed cuts to their staff earlier this year  today announced that the number of on site screeners will increase from 39 6 to 45 1 full timeemployees    Despite Stewart Airports terrific growth over the past year  adding affordable airlines like Air Tran and JetBlue  it has been plagued by a chronic shortage of screeners  leading to crippling passenger lines at the airport which greatly impeded passenger travel  said Senator Schumer  But today passengers across the Hudson Valley will receive a reprieve from these long waits  For months  Ive been banging on the drum for TSA to provide Stewart Airport with the state of the art equipment and screening levels it needs to accommodate this growth  and today it finally appears that theyve heard us  I will continue to demand that TSA support Stewart in its quest to provide the residents of Hudson Valley with affordable  efficient and top notch airline service   Stewart Airport has recently expanded service with the addition of JetBlue and AirTran service  However airport officialshave beenconcerned thatthe absence of screening machines andthe limited number of screenerswill not be able to accommodate the new flights  Schumer and Stewart officials have worked to ameliorate this problem over the course of the last year by adding additional screeners and new baggage handling machines    Schumer announced that Stewart Airport will be able to hire the six screeners immediately with TSA responsible for providing training  Training the new personnel will take nearly a month  and TSA hopes to have the additional officers in place by the busyholiday travel season  The additional screeners will come in the form of full time and part time inspectors  with TSA offering health benefits for all newly hired employees    Schumer has a long history of fighting to increase the number of screeners at the airport  In January 2007 Stewart Airport officials asked TSAto increase their security personnel allocationfrom 30Transportation Security Officers TSO to deal with new volume of air travelers  Instead  TSA informed the airport that its screening staff would be cut down to 24 Schumer successfully lobbied the TSAto increase the number to over 35 TSOs and continues to press theTSAto furtherincrease the allocation In April of 2007  Schumer also wrote to TSA administrator Kip Hawley to express his concern that although 35 TSO wereallocated to Stewart  only 30 were being deployed Acknowledging the needfor more personnel  in recent months TSA has frequently assigned more than 39 officers to Stewart  Todays announcementthat there will be 46 full time TSOs gives the airport the security they need to keep a strong baseline ofofficers at the Airport    Todays news comes two weeks after Schumer announced that a major deal has been struck between the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  and a leading baggage screening company to provide Stewart Airport with three ultra modern bag screening machines that will ease long waits for passengers at the airports security check points These new CT 80 bag screening machines  manufactured by Reveal  can process up to 120 bags an hour using state of the art technology TSA screeners  using manual wands to detect explosives and contraband  generally process between 30 40 bags an hour   Schumer today announced that the new machines will be installedandput intouseat Stewart on October 18th  19th and 20th  TSO s from Stewartwill travel to Westchester County Airport in the coming weeks to train on their CT 80 machines to ensure that the machines can be utilized upon delivery    Emplanementsat Stewart Airport are expected to triple between 2006 and 2007  with theAirportanticipating thataround 900 000 passengers will board planesat the facility this year Over the past year  Stewart has welcomed brand new service from two national low cost carriers  In December of2006  JetBlue began the first roundtrip flight to Ft  Lauderdale and Orlando  and has since added two additional round trips  plus new service to West Palm Beach  In October of 2006  AirTran announced its new service to Atlanta  their hub  and one daily round trip each to Orlando  Ft  Lauderdale and Tampa
