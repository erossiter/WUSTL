IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 16  2007 Schumer Announces Fema To Send Representative To Tour S  Buffalo And Kaisertown On Nov  2nd To See Firsthand Flood Prevention Upgrades                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Earlier this Month  Before the Senate Banking Committee  Schumer Again Called on FEMA to Withhold Issuing a New Flood Map for South Buffalo and Kaisertown Until FEMA Sees Firsthand City s Flood Prevention Upgrades On November 2nd  a FEMA Rep will Tour Cazenovia Creek and Buffalo River Floodplains  and Hold a Public Hearing Nearby in Cheektowaga so Residents from the Buffalo Area cacan Voice their Concerns Residents from Eight other WNY Communities Included in the Affected Flood Maps will Also Be able to Attend the Public Hearing Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that on November 2nd  2007 FEMA will tour Kaisertown and South Buffalo to see firsthand the citys flood prevention upgrades  before issuing a new flood map for the area  Schumer has repeatedly called on FEMA to visit the neighborhoods  before issuing its new flood map  and earlier this month he ratcheted up the pressure by bringing up the issue before the Senate Banking Committee   Schumer  concerned the outdated flood map currently in use for the City of Buffalo is sticking residents with back breaking insurance fees  also worked with local officials to set up a public hearing in nearby Cheektowaga that will take place on November 1st  The meeting will give local residents an outlet to voice concerns over the current map    This is welcome news for homeowners in South Buffalo  Kaisertown and elsewhere who struggle to make unnecessarily high insurance payments  I have every confidence that FEMA recognizes the flood mitigation efforts the city has implemented in South Buffalo and Kaisertown and will make sure the new flood map doesnt continue to stick neighborhood residents with unjustified and astronomical insurance fees  said Senator Schumer  Although it took some prodding  it s terrific news that FEMA has displayed the willingness to visit the floodplains and hear concerns from the very residents who have financially suffered from this outdated insurance map   Last month  Senator Schumer assured us that we have his cooperation and that he is behind our residents 1000   Council Member Kearns said  The Senators steadfast effort and successful request of FEMA is encouraging proof of that commitment   Earlier this month  before the Senate Banking Committee  Schumer  who had already sent a letter to FEMA on the same matter  called on FEMA to withhold from issuing its new flood insurance map for the City of Buffalo until it sends a representative to the city to see first hand the citys recent flood mitigation upgrades    Currently hundreds of homeowners in the Kaisertown and South Buffalo neighborhoods have been shoehorned into a mandatory Standard Flood Insurance Policy  SFIP  which stipulates the amount of insurance they should pay based on the potential threat of a flood  2700 homes are in the flood plain and though all are not paying premiums now  if they sell their house the new owner will have to ante up for flood insurance  While recent infrastructure investments have dramatically reduced the likelihood of flooding and related property damage  the current Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City of Buffalo does not acknowledge these local flood remediation efforts  and homeowners continue to foot the bill despite the reduced risk   Schumer stressed that the likelihood of future flooding and related property damage attributable to winter ice jams on the Buffalo River and Cazenovia Creek have diminished markedly due to the completion of flood abatement initiatives such as the new West Seneca Ice Retention Structure  designed by the USACE Cold Regions Lab  This project has greatly reduced the prospect of ice jam flooding in the lower basin of Cazenovia Creek and has substantially reduced the flow of large ice that enters the Buffalo River at its intersection with the creek    Schumer pointed to this project as evidence that the time is ripe for FEMA to reassess risk levels  redraw its insurance maps  reduce premiums  and remove many homeowners from the program altogether   Today Schumer announced that FEMA will tour the floodplain in Kaisertown and South Buffalo at 10 00am on Friday  November 2    In addition  a public hearing on November 1st from 7 00pm to 8 30pm will be held in the Cheektowaga Central School Auditorium at 3600 Union Road  Besides South Buffalo Kaisertown other communities that are included in this map and invited to participate in the public hearing are  Grand  Island  City of Tonawanda  Amherst  Williamsville  Wales  Gowanda  Holland  and Collins   In the history of this program  not one single homeowner in Kaisertown and South  Buffalo has ever had to collect reimbursement for flooding  because no substantial flooding or property damage has ever occurred in the area since 1959  Local flood abatement programs since that time have succeeded in preventing future flooding  yet the program in Buffalo has not been changed to reflect existing conditions  Homeowners are now paying hundreds of dollars yearly for flood insurance programs they do not need and will likely never derive any benefit from    Schumer has expressed concern that current sky high insurance fees deter a homeowners ability in South  Buffalo and Kaisertown to sell their homes at market rate  receive grants for home improvements  and attract new investment in the nearby properties  He is currently working with FEMA officials to plan their visit
