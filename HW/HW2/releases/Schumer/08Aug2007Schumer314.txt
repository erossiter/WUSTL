IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 8  2007 In Response To Schumer Ratcheting Up Pressure On The Usda To Assign Beech Nut s Canajoharie Plant A 2nd Inspector  Agency s Under Secretary To Visit Plant On Monday For Firsthand Look                                                                                                                                                                                                                          A Recent Decision to Reduce Inspectors at Beech Nut s Canajoharie Plant is Slowing Down Production and Could Hamper Plans for Future Expansion    USDA Visit Spurred by Schumer s Efforts to Pressure USDA to Assign a Second Full Time Inspection Shift So Beech Nut can Operate at Peak Performance    Senator  After a Firsthand Look  I Expect the USDA to Swiftly Assign a 2nd Inspector so Beech Nut Following months of pressuring the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to assign an additional food inspector to Beech Nuts Canajoharie plant so local operations wont be jeopardized  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today that the Under Secretary of the USDA will be visiting the plant this Monday for a firsthand look  Schumer earlier this summer lambasted the agency for putting at risk the financial welfare of the Canajoharie plant by slashing the number of inspectors at the plant just as it was expanding its operations    In May  Schumer sent a letter pressuring USDA to assign a second full time inspection shift to the Canajoharie plant  In response  today Schumer announced that the Under Secretaryfor Food Safety  Dr  Richard Raymond will be visiting the plant to personally assess the situation    Im thrilled the USDAs top brass heard our voice and will be visiting the Canajoharie plant to inspect its operations firsthand  I expect the Under Secretary to understand why its imperative that the plant be immediately assigned a second inspector  said Senator Schumer  For decades  Beech Nut has helped anchor the Mohawk Regions economy  and with the recent announcement that it will construct a new headquarters in Montgomery County  its essential we keep this momentum surging   The process by which Beech Nut produces its meat based baby food must be monitored by USDA inspectors  However  USDA recently decided to eliminate all minimal and limited inspection services  a practice in place since the 1970s  leaving Beech Nut with only one full time inspectorand no additional coverage  which couldcurtail the plant s current operations and plans for futuregrowth   Beech Nuts rigorous baby food production schedule  including preparing  cooking  cooling and packaging it in a sanitary fashion  requirestwo full timeinspector shiftsor otherequivalent staffing arrangements Before the recent reduction of inspection services  the Canajoharie plant received inspectionover the course of their20 hour production schedule  The USDAdid this bycombininga single full time inspector shift with a combination of overtime and limited coverage The current arrangement has left them with a single inspector  creating inefficiencies and forcing Beech Nut to drastically alter how their products are made   Beech Nut has displayed remarkable resilience in surviving damaging floods and cut throat competition  Now is not the time to trip up its tremendous growth by playing semantics with the number of food inspectors theyre assigned  Its counter intuitive to reduce inspection shifts at exactly the moment when Beech Nut is set for take off  added Schumer    In a letter sent earlier this summer to the USDA  Schumer wrote  denying Beech Nuts request on this basis reflects an unfortunate failure to understand the unique needs of their facility  With over 100 different products in production  several of which do not requireUSDAinspections  Beech Nut would have to change their entire business operation justtoenter a production schedule that needed inspectors 5 days a week  The company estimates that they will suffer a loss of at least  3 million if they do not have coverage equivalent to its previous level    This April  the Food Safety and Inspection Service  FSIS  issued a notice suspending its longtime practice of providing roving inspectors outside of the standard business day  While the decision was designed torequiremore intensive inspection services  Beech Nut is unable to qualify for additional full time shift coverage because it only produces meat based foods three days a week  And USDA has indicated that it would only add a second shift if Beech Nuts Canajoharie plant was active for a full  five day work week    Beech Nut has been an economic lynchpin for Montgomery County and the entire Mohawk Valley Region since 1891 Two months ago Beech Nut announced it will build a 650 000 square foot processing and packaging plant in Florida  Montgomery County  N Y   and relocate its corporate headquarters from St  Louis to the new building  It also announced its intention to add an additional 135 jobs to the 356 who are currently employed at their facility  Over the last several years its production has increased by nearly 50   and in the next several years it is hoping to increase its production by an additional 25   which could create additional jobs and millions of new investment in the region    Schumer has long been instrumental in Beech Nuts success in upstate New York  In the summer of 2006  Schumer worked with Empire State Development Corporation and the U S  Small Business Administration  SBA  to construct an incentives package to save Beech Nuts Canajoharie plant after it suffered severe flood damage  In February 2000  H J  Heinz  Inc  and Beech Nut s then parent company  Minot Holding Corporation  announced a planned merger which threatened operations at both the Canajoharie and Fort Plain production plants  Schumer intervened with the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and asked it to delay approving the merger until Heinz completed its review of the local plants  One week later  the FTC began its ultimately successful effort to block the merger  In the winter of 2002  Schumer also helped launch a new product line  called First Advantage  at the Canajoharie Plant
