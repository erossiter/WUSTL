IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 21  2006 Schumer Reveals At Least 350 000 Upstate NY Vets   Info Stolen During VA Data Theft    Unveils New Plan For All Government Agencies To Keep Personal Data Secure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In Light of VA Data Theft and Security Breaches at Depts  of Energy and Health and Human Services  Schumer Announces New Legislation Mandating New Security Standards for Federal Agencies and Tougher Penalties for Stealing Personal Information from Government Databases      Schumer  We Can t Ask the Private Sector to Put Safeguards in Place While Our Own Government is Asleep at the Switch       An On the heels of new identity theft breaches at the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer unveiled a new report showing at least 350 000 Upstate New York veterans could have had their most sensitive information  including their social security numbers  stolen when a laptop was taken from a Department of Veterans Affairs   employee  s home  In response to this significant data breach and many others reported in the federal government  Schumer  who authored comprehensive identity theft legislation last year  announced new measures to crack down on ID theft and protect sensitive personal information held in government databases           We can t ask the private sector to put safeguards in place while our own government is asleep at the switch     Schumer said    Our veterans have already sacrificed so much for this country  they shouldn  t have to put their financial well being on the line too  Our legislation will close a gaping loophole in the law by focusing on protecting federal databases and punishing the hackers and thieves who try to steal this very sensitive information for financial gain  The bottom line is  what bank robbery was to the Depression Era  ID theft is to the Information Age            On May 22  the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that the personal information  including names  dates of birth  social security numbers  and in some cases  spousal information  of more than 26 5 million active and former military personnel stored on a Department laptop was stolen from the home of a VA employee three weeks earlier  The employee was not authorized to take the laptop containing the information on it home          According to the Department of Veterans affairs  26 5 million identities were stolen from the laptop including  1 1 million active duty personnel  430 000 National Guard members  and 645 000 Reservists  The remaining 24 3 identities were veterans  The data breach potentially affects all veterans who were discharged after 1975 when the VA began automating it records and veterans who ever filed a claim for VA disability compensation  pension  or education benefits  or who have  or had  a VA insurance policy  whether their claim was denied or not         Schumer today released a new report estimating the number of Upstate New York veterans who were affected by the data breach  Schumer used population and duration of service data from the Department of Veterans Affairs to estimate those who were discharged after 1975 or filed a disability claim after the Vietnam War          Of the 652 138 veterans currently living in upstate New York  Schumer estimated that at least 352 000 of them could have had their most sensitive information stolen  Schumer acknowledged that this was a conservative estimate because the VA has not confirmed how far back the records go prior to the Vietnam Era  Specifically          Of the 84 849 veterans living in the Capital Region  an estimated 45 875 veterans   information was stolen during the VA data theft  In 2005  there were 918 ID theft complaints reported to the FTC          Of the 75 591 veterans living in Central New York  an estimated 40 870 veterans   information was stolen during the VA data theft  In 2005  there were 844 ID theft complaints reported to the FTC          Of the 93 332 veterans living in the Rochester    Finger Lakes Region  an estimated 50 462 veterans   information was stolen during the VA data theft  In 2005  there were 1 133 ID theft complaints reported to the FTC          Of the 156 026 veterans living in the Hudson Valley  an estimated 84 631 veterans   information was stolen during the VA data theft  In 2005  there were 2 145 ID theft complaints reported to the FTC          Of the 52 233 veterans living in the North Country  an estimated 28 242 veterans   information was stolen during the VA data theft  In 2005  there were 507 ID theft complaints reported to the FTC          Of the 59 414 veterans living in the Southern Tier  an estimated 32 125 veterans   information was stolen during the VA data theft  In 2005  there were 587 ID theft complaints reported to the FTC          Of the 130 693 veterans living in Western New York  an estimated 70 664 veterans   information was stolen during the VA data theft  In 2005  there were 1 365 ID theft complaints reported to the FTC          Schumer said that federal data security breaches and potential ID theft is not limited to the Department of Veterans Affairs  More than a month ago  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services acknowledged that more than 17 000 seniors were put at risk when an employee for Humana Inc   a health plan that provides benefits to Medicare recipients  left individuals   names and social security numbers on a public computer in a hotel  Last month  the Department of Energy finally acknowledged that information of at least 1 500 Department of Energy employees was stolen by a hacker eight months earlier  Employees were given no notification that their information had been stolen until an Energy Department administrator admitted the theft before a congressional committee         In addition  The Farm Service Agency  FSA  of the Dept  of Agriculture announced on Feb  15  2006  that a contractor had inadvertently released the social security numbers and tax identification numbers of 350 000 participants in a tobacco buyout program         In response to these and many other data breaches within the Federal government  Schumer announced a three point plan to crack down on ID theft and protect millions of American  s information stored in federal databases         Schumer today announced he is offering an amendment with Senator Dianne Feinstein  D CA  to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that requires Federal agencies and their contractors notify individuals when there has been a security breach which has resulted  or could result  in their personal data being compromised  All notices must include   1  a description of the type of personal data which has been  or could have been  compromised   2  a toll free telephone number for individuals to call to learn what type of personal data has been  or could have been  compromised and whether or not that individual s data may be at risk  and  3  toll free telephone numbers and addresses for the major credit reporting agencies          Schumer is cosponsoring the Data Theft Prevention Act of 2006  S  3506   introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka  D HI   This bill prohibits unauthorized removal or use of sensitive  personal data contained in a Federal government database  It establishes federal penalties for anyone who knowingly and without authorization views  uses  downloads  removes  or transfers to another computer  network  database  or other format  any sensitive  personally identifiable information  including health information  that is in a Federal government database  This bill would also establish federal penalties for any person who uses such information in furtherance of a violation of any Federal or State criminal law  The penalty for violating these prohibitions is up to  100 000 fine and or one year imprisonment          Finally  Schumer is calling on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct an in depth inquiry into the causes of the data breach at the VA  the adequacy of the VA  s response  and the impact to veterans and the military community at large  Specifically  the GAO would provide a full and complete assessment of the security breach  the affected personnel  and review the impact of the delay by VA officials to analyze the contents of the stolen data  In addition  the GAO would evaluate the VA  s response  its efforts to strengthen personal information security management  and the overall impact of the data theft on the veteran  active  guard and reserve community  and the efforts undertaken by VA to ensure that the stolen personal information is not misused          Last year  Schumer introduced the Comprehensive Identity Theft Prevention Act  S  768   which would regulate the data broker industry and create an Office of Identity Theft in the Federal Trade Commission to assist consumers  Schumer  s bill would also protect sensitive data maintained by governmental agencies by   1  prohibiting the display of social security account numbers on government employment identification cards and tags   2  prohibiting state and federal prisoners   access to social security account numbers in employment  and  3  mandating the Federal Trade Commission to study the use and publication of social security numbers by Federal  State  and local governments  and to make recommendations to modify those practices in order to reduce identity theft
