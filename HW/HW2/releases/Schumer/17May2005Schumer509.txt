IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 17  2005 Schumer  Graham Urge Action Against China s Unfair Currency Manipulation

                               Long Overdue Treasury Report Is a Contradiction  No Currency Manipulation by Chinese  BUT China  s Poses a Risk to Global Economic Growth    New Bipartisan Measure Will Define Currency Manipulation for Next Treasury Department Report    Schumer  Congressional Intent Is Clear  Administration Must Engage China in Talks to Revalue Currency Immediately  Not Wait to See Today  the Treasury Department submitted its twice annual currency exchange report to the Senate Banking Committee  The report  two months overdue  does not say that China is guilty of currency manipulation  which is contrary to what most economists and the U S  Congress  including Senators Charles E  Schumer  D N Y   and Lindsey Graham  R SC  have argued for years  On the heels of this report  Senators Schumer and Graham will introduce the Currency Manipulation Definition Bill       This bipartisan bill would amend the Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988 to clarify the definition of manipulation with respect to currency  reduce the global account surplus requirement necessary for the United States to take action  only requires bilateral account surplus   and establish additional reporting guidelines for Treasury to include in their bi annual reports to Congress        Teddy Roosevelt once advised that the best negotiating strategy was to   speak softly and carry a big stick    Sen  Schumer said   Taking that advice  Senator Graham and I have relied on the Administration to use quiet encouragement in an effort to help China s leadership see the light            It is clear from this report that something is wrong in our trade relationship with China  but the Treasury Department seems to be unwilling to say that in plain English  While the report states that China  s policies are   highly distortionary    it does not address the protracted time period that the Chinese have been engaging in this anti free trade practice          By rigging its currency between 15 and 40 percent below its appropriate value  China is giving a subsidy to its imports to the United States and imposing a direct cost on U S  exporters to China  This unfair advantage has hurt U S  manufacturers  workers  and farmers and contributed to the U S  trade imbalance with China growing by 50  since 2001  to a record  120 billion       Currency Manipulation Definition Bill Facts   1  This bill mandates a definition for currency manipulation in an effort to reduce the export advantage provided by China and other Asian countries that unfairly and illegally undervalue their currency       The legislation would amend the International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988 by mandating that the Treasury Department use a specific definition for currency manipulation  The bill would define manipulation as   protracted large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange market          2  Requires the Treasury Department to only require a bilateral surplus as a condition to take action against a country that is found to be manipulating their currency       The bill would amend the International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988 by removing the requirement that the US can only take action against a country that manipulates its currency if the offending country is running a material global current surplus in addition to a bilateral surplus  This legislation would only require a country to have a bilateral surplus       3  Requires the Administration to explicitly address the test used to determine currency manipulation and explain the reasons a country was found or not found to be guilty of manipulation       The bill would mandate that the Treasury Department explain in their bi annual reports to Congress  why they were able or unable to find evidence of currency manipulation  The bill would require the Treasury Department to explicitly address this test in its required reports and testimonies before the Congress       4  Co Sponsors  Schumer  Graham  Stabenow  and others to be announced       Another bill  introduced by Schumer and Graham is the China Free Trade Bill  received an overwhelmingly supportive vote as an amendment to the State Department Authorization bill in the Senate on April 6  2005  That bill allows for a 180 day negotiation period between the U S  and China to revalue its currency  if the negotiations are not successful  a temporary across the board tariff of 27 5  will be applied to all Chinese products entering the United States   a penalty that corresponds to their estimated currency advantage  Since economists estimate that China undervalues its currency between 15 percent and 40 percent  27 5  represents the midpoint range  Furthermore  if the President determines that at the end of the negotiation period that China has developed and started actual implementation of a plan to revalue its currency  he may delay imposition of the tariff for another 12 months
