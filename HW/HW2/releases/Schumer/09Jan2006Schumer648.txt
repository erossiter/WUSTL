IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 9  2006 Confirmation Hearing Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E  SCHUMER JANUARY 9  2006 Judge Alito  welcome to you  Mrs  Alito and your two children  I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your nomination to the position of Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court     If confirmed  you will be one of nine people who collectively hold power over everyone who lives in this country  You will define our freedom  you will affect our security  you will shape our law      You will determine  on some days  where we pray and how we vote  you will define  on other days  when life begins and what our schools may teach  and you will decide  from time to time  who shall live and who shall die     The decisions are final  and appeals impossible     That is the awesome responsibility and power of a Supreme Court Justice  It is  therefore  only appropriate that everyone who aspires to that office bear a heavy burden when they come before the Senate and the American people to prove that they are worthy     But while every Supreme Court nominee has a great burden  yours  Judge Alito  is triply high     First  because you have been named to replace Justice Sandra Day O  Connor  the pivotal swing vote on a divided Court  second  because you have been picked to placate the extreme right wing after the hasty withdrawal of Harriet Miers  and  finally  because your record of opinions and statements on a number of critical Constitutional questions seems quite extreme     So  first  as this Committee takes up your nomination  we cannot forget recent history  because that history increases your burden and explains why the American people want us to examine every portion of your record with great care     Harriet Miers  s nomination was blocked by a cadre of conservative critics who undermined her at every turn  She did not get to explain her judicial philosophy  she did not get to testify at a hearing  and she did not get the up or down vote on the Senate Floor that her critics are now demanding that you receive     Why  For the simple reason that those critics could not be sure that her judicial philosophy squared with their extreme political agenda  They seem to be very sure with you     The same critics who called the President on the carpet for naming Harriet Miers have rolled out the red carpet for you  Judge Alito  We would be remiss if we did not explore why     And there is an additional significance to the Miers precedent  which is this  Everyone now seems to agree that nominees should explain their judicial philosophy and ideology     After so many of my friends across the aisle spoke so loudly about the obligation of nominees to testify candidly about their legal views and their judicial philosophy when the nominee was Harriet Miers  I hope we will not see a flip flop now that the nominee is Sam Alito     The second reason your burden is higher  of course  is that you are filling the shoes of Sandra Day O  Connor  Those are big shoes  to be sure     But hers are also special shoes    she was the first woman Justice in the history of the High Court  is the only sitting Justice with experience as a legislator  and has been the most frequent swing vote in a quarter century of service on the Court     While Sandra Day O  Connor has been at the fulcrum of the Court  you appear poised to add weight to one side  That alone is not necessarily cause for alarm or surprise  but it is certainly a reason for pause     Balance is an important feature on the Court  and your nomination must be viewed in the context of the seat you are seeking  in this case one occupied for 25 years by a pragmatic and mainstream Justice    conservative to be sure  but within the broad conservative mainstream     Are you in Justice O  Connor  s mold  Or  as the President has vowed  are you in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas     Most importantly  though  your burden is high because of your record      Although I have not made up my mind  I have serious concerns about that record  There are reasons to be troubled  You are the most prolific dissenter in the Third Circuit     This morning President Bush said Judge Alito has the intellect and judicial temperament to be on the Court  But the President left out the most important qualification    a nominee  s judicial philosophy     Judge Alito  in case after case after case  you give the impression of applying careful legal reasoning  but too many times you happen to reach most conservative result     Judge Alito  you give the impression of being a meticulous legal navigator  but  in the end  you always seem to chart a rightward course     Some wrongly suggest that we are being results oriented when we question the results you have reached  But just the opposite is true  We are trying to make sure that you are capable of being fair no matter the identity of the party before you     Sometimes you give the Government a free pass  but refuse to give plaintiffs a fair shake     We need to know that Presidents and paupers will receive equal justice in your courtroom      We need to know that you will not bypass precedent when it is convenient  Or that you will apply strict rules of construction in some cases  but not in others because of the issues or parties involved     If the record showed that an umpire repeatedly called 95 percent of pitches strikes when one team  s players were up and repeatedly called 95 percent of pitches balls when the other team  s players were up  one would naturally ask whether the umpire was really being impartial and fair     In many areas  we will expect clear and straightforward answers because you have a record on these issues    for example  executive power  Congressional power  and personal autonomy  just to name a few     The President is not a king    free to take any action he chooses  without limitation by law  the Court is not a legislature    free to substitute its own judgment for that of the elected bodies  and the people are not subjects    powerless to control their own most intimate decisions     Will your judicial philosophy preserve these principles  Or erode them     In each of these areas  there is cause for concern  In the area of executive power  Judge Alito  you have embraced and endorsed the theory of the   unitary executive        You have thus endorsed  in writing  a truly vast power for the President  Under this view of separation of powers  the Independent Counsel Act was unconstitutional  and the FTC  the SEC  and all of the regulatory agencies are unconstitutional  Even the 9 11 Commission may have been an unconstitutional encroachment upon the   unitary executive        Your deferential and absolutist view of separation of powers raises other questions  Under your view  the President would  for instance  also seem to have inherent authority to wiretap     American citizens without a warrant  to ignore Congressional acts at will  or to take any other action he saw fit under his inherent powers     We need to know  When a President goes too far  will you be a check on his power  or will you issue him a blank check to exercise whatever power he alone thinks appropriate  Right now  that is an open question given your stated views     Similarly  on the issue of federalism  you seem to have taken an extreme view  substituting your own judgment for that of the legislature  Certainly  in one important case  you wrote in U S  v  Rybar that Congress had exceeded its power by prohibiting the possession of fully automatic machine guns     The other judges on your court all disagreed with you  And all five other circuits that had considered the issue up to that point also disagreed with you     Do you still hold these cramped views of Congressional power  Will you engage in judicial activism to find ways to strike down laws that the American people want their elected representatives to pass and that the Constitution authorizes  Because of your stated views  right now  these are also open questions     And  of course  you have made strident statements expressing your view that the   Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion     In fact you said in 1985  that you   personally believe very strongly    this is true     You also spoke  while in the Justice Department  of the   opportunity to advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v  Wade        It should not be surprising that these statements will bring a searching inquiry    as many of my colleagues have already suggested     So we will ask you  Do you still   personally believe very strongly      that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion        We will ask  Do you view elevation to the Supreme Court    where you will no longer be bound by High Court precedent    as the long sought   opportunity to advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v  Wade     as you stated in 1985     And there are other areas that we will have to explore  From the neutral application of the civil rights laws to the wisdom of the one man one vote rule  your record has given us reason to ask questions     I sincerely hope that you will answer our questions  Judge Alito  Most of the familiar arguments for ducking direct questions no longer apply and certainly do not apply in your case     For example  the logic of the mantra    repeated by John Roberts at his hearing    that one could not speak on a subject because the issue was likely to come before him quickly vanishes when the nominee has a written record  as you do on so many subjects     Even under the so called   Ginsburg precedent       which was endorsed by Judge Roberts  Republican Senators  and the White House    you have an obligation to answer questions on topics that you have written about     On the issue of choice  for example  because you have already made blanket statements about your view of the Constitution and your support for the overruling of Roe  you have already given the appearance of bias  you have already given the suggestion of pre judgment on a question that will likely come before the Supreme Court  So  I respectfully submit  you cannot use that as a basis for not answering     So  I hope  Judge Alito  that when we ask you about prior statements you have made about the law    some strong  some even strident    you will not simply answer    No comment     that you will not dismiss prior expressions of decidedly legal opinions as merely   personal beliefs        That will enhance neither your credibility nor your reputation for careful legal reasoning     In the end  Judge  it is more important that you answer than what you answer  We can have a respectful disagreement on the law  after an open and honest discussion  but we will serve neither the American people nor the democratic process if we learn little about those views     I look forward to a full and fair hearing  And I look forward to learning a good deal more about you  Judge Alito
