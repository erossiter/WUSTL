                                  BRAC Commission Heralded New York  s First Rate Workforce    Senator to Do Same To Bring More Jobs to Mohawk Valley  Western New York  Capital Region  and Hudson Valley  Schumer  New York Turned Possible Closures Into Impressive Expansion  Now It  s Time For More Job Growth US Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced a new plan to build on the momentum of the recent Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  decisions that recognize upstate New York  s first rate labor force and value particular communities poised for job growth  Schumer said that the recent BRAC decisions in Rome  Niagara  Schenectady  and Orange County present an important opportunity to attract more jobs    both governmental and in the private sector         Last week  we saw a national Commission recognize New York as the perfect place to keep jobs and create new ones     Schumer said    Now it  s our turn to build on this momentum and extend the job growth to other industries  both in governmental and the private sector  For the last few years  I ve been making the case to companies  site selectors  and anyone who would listen  that our workforce is ideal for companies looking to relocate or start new businesses  Now we have affirmation that no place is better than New York for expansion  and no workforce is better than ours           Schumer pointed to several BRAC decisions recognizing the potential of expanding jobs in New York  In Niagara  the BRAC Commission reversed the Department of Defense  DOD  recommendations to close Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station  recognizing the high recruitment rate and reenlistment rates in the National Guard  BRAC Commission also consolidated 26 Defense Finance and Accounting Service  DFAS   to five locations in the country  including Rome NY  In addition  Rome Labs lost its sensor mission  but will be gaining an information mission  originally slated by the DOD to go to Hanscom Air Force Base  The BRAC Commission moved a military prep school from Fort Monmouth  NJ to the U S  Military Academy at West Point  bringing as many as 226 military positions and 38 civilian jobs to Orange County  In Schenectady  the BRAC Commission reversed earlier DOD recommendation to remove four C 130 aircraft  and nineteen jobs        Schumer unveiled several initiatives to harness the momentum from the recent BRAC decision and leverage the job growth for additional economic development            Promote labor force and community profiles to site selectors and company CEO  s for companies looking to expand  Because the government recognized the value of workers throughout New York and other factors to accommodate job growth  Schumer believes these same selling points can attract private companies to move and expand in Western New York  Central New York  the Capital Region  and the Hudson Valley  Schumer will specifically point to Watervliet Arsenal  a world class machine shop with available industrial space and convenient access to the interstate and a rail link             Send report to local Industrial Development Agencies  IDAs  outlining how communities sold themselves to BRAC Commission and use as model for private sector  Schumer will compile a report on how communities successfully persuaded the Commission and adopt the approach for New York localities pitching themselves to private companies and applying for governmental grants and expansion opportunities             Lobby Defense Department and other governmental agencies to choose upstate New York to establish new facilities and expand existing ones  Schumer will use the same arguments employed when persuading the BRAC Commission on the merits of upstate New York labor considerations with other government agencies  including Department of Homeland Security  Department of Agriculture  and Department of Energy             Urge Defense Department and local leadership team to fill any vacant positions in Rome with New Yorkers  According to the Department of Defense  15 percent of the DFAS positions in Rome will be filled with workers transferring from other bases  leaving approximately 500 available for new job seekers  Schumer will work Pentagon and Rome officials to ensure that the new accounting positions and positions with the new Information Directorate are filled by New Yorkers  possibly with those recently laid off from Ethan Allen  Oneida Ltd  Schumer will partner the Rome facilities with colleges and universities throughout upstate New York to recruit personnel with the proper training             Assist in transition for sensors employees who choose to stay in New York  Recognizing that Rome has lost the sensors mission  Schumer wants to make sure that these highly skilled workers who choose to stay in New York can find employment that utilizes their experience and training  possibly in private sector companies with similar work            Work with the local officials and business leaders on transitioning workers who choose to relocate to New York  With the Mohawk Valley poised to absorb an influx of accounting and information warfare personnel from other states  Schumer will work with community and business leaders to fully take advantage of new housing needs  and other possible economic ripple effects from the job growth and staff changes       According to local estimates  the job growth in Rome alone could mean an  80 million boost in economic impact  Currently  the Rome Research Site  s Economic Impact Analysis for Fiscal Year 2004 estimated the total economic impact to the Utica Rome NY to be  211 6 million  Schumer said today he wanted to expand this momentum throughout the state  where the BRAC Commission resoundingly praised New York  s first rate labor force
