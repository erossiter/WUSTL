                                Last Month  Waterfront Received New Market Federal Tax Credits That Will Be Used To Clear The Way To Begin Construction Early Next Year  Schumer  This Project Is Innovative And Well Designed  And I Want To See It Move Forward Without Delay U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to approve permits for the Long Dock Beacon Waterfront project  In May  Schumer visited this former Brownfield  which is now the site of a public private partnership that plans to build a 160 room hotel and conference center  17 acre public waterfront park  and two restaurants  The Scenic Hudson Land Trust and Foss Group Beacon  LLC have been working with the City of Beacon  Dutchess County and New York State on this vital project that will transform an industrial site on the Hudson River into a vibrant public park that will meet requirements for the U S  Green Building Council s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold Standard  When completed in Spring of 2008  Long Dock Beacon will employ 300 people         The Long Dock Beacon Waterfront project proves you can have economic growth and protect the environment     Schumer said    Getting these permits will clear the way to begin construction early next year  It will mean new jobs  new energy  new dollars  and will be a catalyst to revitalize the Dutchess County economy and promote development  This is another critical step in making this vision a reality  and I will continue to fight hard to make sure this project gets the federal tools and resources it needs          The Long Dock Beacon project is seeking specific permits from the U S  Army Corps of Engineers that will enable them to accomplish a number of goals including stabilizing eroding shorelines and failing bulkheads  constructing a 22 000 foot public boardwalk and civic plaza overlooking the waterfront  resculpting the shoreline to create additional waterfront areas  constructing a floating dock for visiting boats  and rehabilitating degraded wetlands and creating new wetlands  The project will enhance local wetlands and shorelines by removing invasive plant species and replacing them with native ones  It will employ innovative storm water management techniques that will meet or exceed current requirements       The Long Dock Beacon project will transform a 25 acre former industrial site on the Hudson River waterfront into a stunning public park and hotel  The Scenic Hudson Land Trust  SHLT  owns the property and will develop a 17 acre public park and amenities associated with the project  SHLT has entered into a development agreement with Foss Group Beacon  LLC  and is leasing eight acres for the commercial development  Key aspects of the project include a waterfront park with trails  public fishing pier  boardwalk  and plazas  160 room hotel  conference center and spa  two restaurants  kayak outfitter and harbor for nonmotorized boats  and a boat building program for local youth       In a personal letter to Colonel Richard Polo  Commander of the U S  Army Corps of Engineer District    New York  Schumer wrote    The City of Beacon has worked hard over the last ten years to recover economically  It has attracted new residents  a growing community of artists and small business owners  and the Dia  Beacon Musuem  which has had as many as 140 000 visitors per year  The Long Dock Beacon project represents the culmination of a dynamic partnership among private  municipal and non profit entities  It will transform a deteriorated  formerly industrial brownfield on a spectacular site on the Hudson River into an engine for environmentally sound economic revitalization for the City and the region  I urge you to grant Long Dock Beacon the assistance it needs to move forward as expeditiously as possible          In late April  Schumer called on Arthur Garcia  Director of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund at U S  Department of Treasury  to support the New Market Tax Credits  NMTC  application of the company that will finance the project  saying that Long Dock Beacon will be the   cornerstone of Beacon  s future prosperity     In May  Schumer visited the area  and then last month  the Long Dock Beacon Waterfront project received highly sought after federal tax credits which are awarded for economic development related projects through a nationally competitive process  Schumer also plans to assist the SHLT and Foss Group Beacon  LLC as they seek permits from the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation and the Department of State for development of the park  hotel and related facilities
