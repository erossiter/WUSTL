                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Starrett City Seller Could Drop Out of Mitchell Lama if He Doesn t get the Exorbitant Price He is Asking   New  1 4 Billion Price Would Require the Eviction of Tenants and the Change of Starrett City s Character     Schumer Demands that HUD Reject New Bistricer Proposal and Send Buyer and Seller Back to Drawing Board with New Lower Price   Silver  Lopez Unveil State Legislation  With the impending sale of Starrett City putting thousands of Mitchell Lama tenants in jeopardy  today  Senator Charles E  Schumer  New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Assembly Housing Committee Chairman Vito J  Lopez announced a new campaign to protect this vital affordable housing  Schumer called on the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  to formally reject Clipper Equity s latest proposal to buy Starrett City  citing the undue financial burden it would place on the federal government and the lack of protections it would offer for tenants in the middle class development        Schumer  Silver and Lopez also announced plans to push passage of Assembly bill A  795  legislation that would place all units covered under Starrett City s Mitchell Lama agreement into rent stabilization  In addition  Lopez and Silver unveiled their plan to introduce a state bill specifically designed to protect Mitchell Lama tenants at Starrett City and similarly situated locations       I have looked at the numbers every which way and there is no way that you can pay  1 4 billion for Starrett City and keep it affordable without asking for massive government subsidies   said Senator Schumer   The market alone didn t create Starrett City and the owners should not reap the rewards that come with an infusion of government money  while jettisoning this critical stock of affordable housing  That s why I am asking HUD to reject this latest offer         Our City continues to struggle with a shortage of affordable housing that threatens hundreds  if not thousands  of tenants   said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver   We must act now to protect our affordable housing stock  or this City will become too expensive for the firefighters  police officers  teachers  nurses and so many other valued members of our workforce upon whom we depend  While we all appreciate the  tenets  of capitalism  it is the  tenants  that must remain our number one priority  Now that we have a governor who is committed to preserving affordable housing  we will finally have the partnership we need to stem the tide of Mitchell Lama buyouts         For years I ve been committed to preserving Mitchell Lama housing across New York and today the need for affordable housing is more dire than ever   said Assemblyman Vito J  Lopez  Chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee   This legislation will do just that by ensuring tenants are protected after owners buy out of the program both at Starrett City across the five boroughs        Approximately 90  of the units at Starrett City are subsidized through a pastiche of federal subsidies  including a Section 8 Housing Assistance Program contract  HAP   a Rental Assistance Program  RAP  contract and the Interest Reduction Program  IRP   The remaining 10  of Starrett City s apartments    nearly 700 units of critically important affordable housing    are only subsidized through the State s Mitchell Lama program  and are the most at risk of leaving the affordable housing stock        Clipper Equity  after being selected as the purchaser of Starrett City  promptly announced its intentions to leave the Mitchell Lama program  Since then  none of the group s affordability proposals have provided iron clad assurances that it will remain in the program  leaving thousands of tenants vulnerable to soaring rents  Making matters even worse for tenants is the potential for the current seller to opt out of the Mitchell Lama program if his exorbitant asking price isn t met  This leaves Mitchell Lama tenants at Starrett City in peril whether the current sale goes through or not       To protect the long term affordability of Starrett City  Schumer today called on Secretary Alphonso Jackson at HUD to formally reject Clipper Equity s latest proposal to buy Starrett City   In his letter to Jackson  Schumer wrote   I believe it is critical that HUD urge Clipper Equity to sit down with the seller  Starrett City Associates  and renegotiate a sale price that will allow the needs of tenants to be put first   If a mutually agreed upon price cannot be reached  the bidding process should be re opened to other prospective purchasers             Under their new plan  the buyer is proposing 5 000  units to be subsidized using enhanced section 8 vouchers  These vouchers would cost the federal government at least  10 million dollars more by the second year of the deal  and the subsidies would escalate from there  Once a tenant with a voucher leaves their apartment   it would go right to the market rate rent  With at least 200 tenants leaving Starrett every year  after just a few years a large portion of the development would no longer be affordable        Schumer also joined Lopez and Silver in championing Assembly Bill 795  sponsored by Lopez  which would assist tenants living in Mitchell Lama housing by protecting their units under the Emergency Tenant Protection Act  ETPA   ETPA  often known as the rent stabilization program  disallows owners from charging market rate rents by limiting rent increases to those mandated by the rent guidelines board  Tenants living in Mitchell Lama units constructed before 1974 are eligible for ETPA upon buyout  unlike units that are built after 1974 such as Starrett City   New York City s Department of Housing Preservation and Development estimates that under this bill as many as 19 000 tenants could be eligible for rent protection if the owners chose to opt out of the Mitchell Lama program       The legislation  supported by the City of New York  also provides incentives for the owners of Mitchell Lama units to remain in the program  These incentives include removing the 6  per annum cap on profits and by granting the developments the ability to charge annually  as opposed to periodic  rent increases        Lopez and Silver also unveiled a new plan to introduce a state bill specifically designed to protect Mitchell Lama tenants at Starrett City and similarly situated locations  In the event that the owner makes clear his intention to buy out of the Mitchell Lama program  Speaker Silver and Chairman Lopez will take quick  decisive action to protect tenants at Starrett City            With 5 881 units  Starrett City is the largest HUD funded affordable housing development in the United States  2442 of the units are subsidized through the Federal Rental Assistance Program  RAP   In this program  the Department of Housing and Urban Development negotiates long term leases for tenants  paying the difference to the owner between what tenants can afford and the market rate rent for that unit  The RAP contract at Starrett City expires in 2016        An additional 1000  units are kept affordable through the project based Section 8 program  In the 1980 s  then Congressman Schumer introduced legislation that attached section 8 vouchers directly to housing units  keeping them affordable after tenants vacated their apartments  Now a standard program  this project based Section 8 legislation was amongst the first of its kind when it was introduced at Starrett City  Eligible tenants pay 30  of their income towards rent  with HUD making up the difference to what they determine is fair market rent for the unit         1611 of the units are further underwritten by Section 236 rent concessions  This is funded through Interest Reduction Payments  IRP  administered by HUD that reduces the interest on their mortgage down to 1   These tenants generally have incomes ranging from  40 000    60 000  making them ineligible for RAP or Section 8      Beginning in February of this year  Schumer  the Democratic Chairman of the Senate Housing Subcommittee  has criticized the bidding process around Starrett City  Concerned that certain bidders were forbidden to talk to the federal government about the deal and that Clipper Equity would fail to maintain the developments  affordability  Schumer played an instrumental role in blocking the Starrett City deal after calling on HUD to reject it       Schumer has also pointed out that federal funds sustained the project and built up the owners  equity  in effect making the federal government a full partner in the project that ought to have a say in any sale
