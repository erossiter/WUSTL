IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 18  2006 Schumer  New Evidence Suggests Oil Companies Could Be Intentionally Driving Prices Up For Summer Driving Season                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Big Oil May be Keeping Refining Capacity Low to Jack Gas Prices Up  While Switching to Summer Fuel Blend Always Brings Production Down  For Last 5 Years Production has Been Higher Than it is Now   With Profits as Their Clear Motive  Shorting the Market May be Too Tempting to Avoid   Senator Urges FTC Investigation of Refining Capacity As gas prices jumped 28 5 cents a gallon in the last three weeks alone  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Federal Government to ensure that oil companies don  t intentionally drive up prices before the summer months to increase their bottom line  Today Schumer sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission to urge them to closely monitor refining capacity and prices  which could rise even more as more Americans increase their travel this spring and summer  The Senator expressed concern that some companies may be keeping some of their refineries offline while they switch to the summer fuel blends    making gasoline more expensive  Though production always goes down as oil companies switch to their summer fuel blends  for the last 5 years production has been higher at this time than it is now       In general  after oil companies switch to producing their summer blends refineries typically operate at or above 90   This is a regular occurrence  but for the past five years refineries returned to that level of operation more quickly than they have this year   This year however  refining capacity is still hovering at 85  which leads some experts to believe that the oil companies may be dragging this along to drive up prices         Given the past behavior of the oil companies who take advantage of natural or cyclical occurrences and raise prices even more than has been necessary  this requires scrutiny     Schumer said    Their record profits have continued    and they  re making those profits on the backs of average Americans  Oil companies should be using their maximum refining capacity instead of possibly minimizing it  and the FTC needs to make sure this process is completely transparent so that prices don  t continue to shoot up before the summer driving season gets underway          Last week  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  released a report predicting that gas prices will rise 10 5 percent  on average  this summer  In addition  they predicted that regular gas will average  2 62 per gallon during the summer travel season  up 25 cents from a year ago  Unfortunately for New Yorkers and many other Americans  gas prices have already surpassed the EIA  s estimates       According to AAA the national average price of regular gas is  2 79 per gallon  up from  2 50 a month ago and  2 24 at this time last year  This is a 12 percent increase from last month and more than 25 percent from last year  And premium gasoline is up to  3 06 up from  2 75 last month and  2 47 a year ago       The average price of regular gas in New York State is up to  2 93 per gallon up almost 40 cents from last month and  2 32 a year ago  This is an almost 15 percent jump from last month and 21 percent from last year  Premium gasoline has also jumped to  3 21 per gallon from  2 81 last month and  2 54 this time last year        o In New York State  the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas is  2 93  That is up from  2 57 last month and  2 32 at this time last year  That equals a 15 percent jump in just the last month       o In Buffalo  regular is at  2 87 per gallon  up from  2 49 last month       o In Rochester  regular is at  2 87 per gallon  up from  2 49 last month       o In Syracuse  regular is at  2 90 per gallon  up from 2 50 last month       o In the Utica and Rome area  regular is at  2 91 per gallon  up from 2 50 last month       o In the Capital Region  regular is at 2 91per gallon  up from 2 52 last month       o In Binghamton  regular is at  2 92 per gallon  up from  2 53 last month       In a letter to the  today Schumer called for an investigation to ensure that refining capacity is not being manipulated  The text of the letter follows      April 18  2006      The Honorable Deborah P  Majoras  Chairwoman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC 20580      Dear Chairwoman Majoras       I write to you today to ask the Federal Trade Commission to carefully monitor refining capacity during the summer fuel blend switch to ensure oil companies return to full capacity as quickly as possible  As oil prices and prices at the pump continue to rise  it is essential that our consumers have access to our nation  s full production capacity and that oil companies do not attempt to short the market in an attempt to increase their already huge profit margins       As you know  fuel costs have been rising steadily  and  as of April 17  2006  are currently averaging 278 3 cents per gallon  In the last three weeks alone  fuel costs were up a total of 28 5 cents per gallon  The price of a barrel of crude oil has been hovering at near record levels  and currently sits at just over  69 per barrel  Now  with the summer driving season on the horizon  surging gas prices have become even more critical as Americans will be reaching ever deeper into their pockets to fill up their cars to get to work  take their children to school or visit their families       One of the factors oil companies can directly control is their own refining capacity  Some of that capacity is off line at this point in time as the switch to summer blends for fuel is made  In fact  during the week of March 31  2006 to April 7  2006  refiners were only using 85  of their operable utilization  and finished motor gasoline production fell to 7 8 million barrels per day  While a temporary drop capacity may be appropriate  the FTC should carefully monitor oil companies to ensure they return to full capacity as quickly as possible  Full utilization of refining capacity can help ensure consumer pay the lowest prices currently possible  For example  between April and September 1998 the average operable utilization rate was at 98 1  and fuel prices averaged 106 5 cents per gallon  Although other factors also contribute to fuel prices  we must ensure oil companies are producing at their fullest capability       American consumers will need all the help they can get at the pump as we head into the summer driving season  I urge the FTC to rigorously monitor refining capacity to ensure the industry is producing as the highest level possible and not manipulating the amount of product flowing to the market  I look forward to working with you to ensure your reply       Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer  United States Senator   Click here to view
