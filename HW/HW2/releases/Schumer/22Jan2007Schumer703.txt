IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 22  2007 Schumer  Bloomberg Report  NY In Danger Of Losing Status As World Financial Center  Within 10 Years Without Major Shift In Regulation And Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Stringent Regulations  High Litigation Risk and Immigration Policy Causing New York  s Financial Markets to Lose Business and High Skilled Workers to London and Other Overseas Competitors at Rapid Rate   Governor Spitzer Joins Schumer and Bloomberg in Supporting Sweeping New Plan to Adapt US Financial Services to World Changes and Reaffirm New York  s Number One Position as Financial Capit Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and New York City Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg released a groundbreaking report revealing that New York could lose its status as a global financial market without a major shift in public policy  Schumer and Bloomberg  together with New York Governor Eliot Spitzer  warned that New York financial markets  stifled by stringent regulations  and high litigation risks  are in danger of losing businesses and high skilled workers to overseas competitors  relegating New York to regional market status and adversely impacting the U S  economy  Today  Schumer and Bloomberg  with the backing of Governor Spitzer  unveiled a sweeping plan to revitalize U S  financial markets and reaffirm New York  s position as the financial capital of the world             If New York goes from being the financial capital of the world to becoming only a regional market  as this report predicts will happen within the next ten years  every aspect of New York life will suffer  not just financial services     Senator Schumer said    The fact that Eliot Spitzer has joined us shows a united New York front in fighting hard to keep us where we should be  as number one            Let s be clear  The financial services industry is one reason that the 20th century was the American century and that New York became the world  s capital     said Mayor Bloomberg     We ve outlined a range of practical yet innovative steps to ensure the 21st century is just as bright  This is one of many challenges to our long term economic health and stability that require we move beyond partisanship to find solutions           The financial markets are a cornerstone of New York State s economy yet  as the study illustrates  we are in danger of losing our pre eminence as the financial center of the world     said Governor Spitzer     We must take these recommendations seriously so as to support an economic climate ripe for financial services while continuing efforts to safeguard the market for investors  I applaud Senator Schumer and Mayor Bloomberg for their visionary leadership and look forward to working with them            If we don  t address these problems now  New York is in danger of becoming a secondary city instead of the world capital it deserves to remain     said Deputy Mayor for Economic Development  Dan Doctoroff     This report demonstrates what we suspected    the impact to our economy will be severe and the job cuts and financial toll painful            Senator Schumer and Mayor Bloomberg commissioned the joint report    Sustaining New York  s and the U S   s Global Financial Services Leadership     which sets out a series of recommendations to counter emerging threats to the United States   position as the world  s financial leader  with a two tiered package of national and local measures aimed at removing impediments to financial services competitiveness both domestically and internationally        Left unchecked  today  s trends could significantly negatively impact the U S  economy   The United States would miss out on between  15 billion and  30 billion in financial services revenues annually by 2011   Those revenues  if retained  could translate into as many as thirty to sixty thousand jobs in the U S             The joint report stipulated that while many of the causes are due to improved markets abroad and sophisticated technology that has virtually eliminated barriers to the flow of capital  a significant number of the causes for America  s declining competitiveness are self imposed  For instance  U S  based financial services firms are now unable to attract and retain many of the highly skilled professionals they need because of caps on the number of visas available under U S  immigration rules  A greater perceived litigation risk has also reduced the appeal of the U S  market to many foreign firms  Finally  a complex and sometimes unresponsive regulatory framework has not only prompted many foreign firms to stay out of the U S  markets  but also is forcing more business overseas because of the complexity and cost of doing business in U S  financial markets regardless of where they are located   The joint report offered several recommendations  derived from detailed analyses of market conditions here and abroad  informed by interviews with more than 50 respected leaders drawn from the financial services industry  consumer groups  and other stakeholders    The recommendations focus on near term administrative actions that can signal renewed U S  focus on competitiveness  actions to level the playing field for both domestic and foreign companies doing business in the United States  and longer term initiatives to address more complex policy  legal  regulatory and other structural issues affecting the U S  position as the world  s leading financial center       Identifying access to skilled professionals  a fair and predictable legal environment  and a responsive  market oriented regulatory framework as top determinants of financial services competitiveness  the Mayor and Senator called for a coordinated  non partisan implementation effort to improve America  s performance along each of these dimensions and thereby strengthen the third largest sector of the U S  economy  Forming new public private partnerships at the city and national levels to tackle these issues is an underlying theme of the joint report       Mayor Bloomberg emphasized that policymakers must avoid complacency about New York  s long term future as a world leading financial center    Our capital markets and financial services firms will only enjoy continuing growth    growth that our city expects  needs and demands    if we take seriously the challenges from rapidly expanding competitors in Europe and Asia     said the Mayor        Senator Schumer pointed out that strong financial markets are crucial to the health of both New York  s economy and the nation  s  financial services drive 8 percent of U S  GDP  and create more than 5 percent of all jobs nationwide    This is not simply a New York issue     the Senator said    Seven states  including New York  have more than 10 percent of their state  s GDP derived from financial services  and strong financial services are important to everyone regardless of where they reside or do business            The joint report outlined a number of recommendations intended to improve America  s financial services competitiveness for both the United States and New York  described on the attached Fact Sheet       In its analysis  the joint report highlighted the fundamental importance of the U S  financial services sector to the national economy  Although U S  financial markets lead globally in many dimensions    the U S  is still the world  s largest repository of financial stock and it derives more revenues from financial services than any other country    this leadership is under significant threat as a variety of forces combine to undermine U S  competitiveness         Recommendations to sustain the nation  s and New York  s global financial services leadership            Provide clearer guidance for implementing the Sarbanes Oxley Act        Implement securities litigation reform with particular short term emphasis on leveraging the SEC  s existing authority        Develop a common vision and a supporting set of shared regulatory principles        Ease immigration restrictions facing skilled non US professional workers        Recognize IFRS without reconciliation for listing purposes and promote convergence of accounting and auditing standards        Protect US global competitiveness in implementing the Basel II Capital Accord        Form an independent  bipartisan National Commission on Financial Market Competitiveness to resolve long term structural issues        Modernize financial services charters and holding company structures        Establish a public private partnership to promote New York  s local agenda by acting as the high level liaison between individual industry participants and the city  as well as by driving forward the partnership  s broader strategic plan for New York  s financial services development        More actively managing attraction and retention for financial services        Establishing a world class Center for Applied Global Finance  and       Potentially creating a special international financial services zone
