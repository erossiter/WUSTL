IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 16  2005 Schumer To Feds  Drop Plan That Would Cut Millions To Upstate NY Dairy Farmers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   New analysis reveals NY  s dairy farmers hit hard by Bush budget  upstate dairy farmers stand to lose  27 million even if MILC program is extended  Schumer also urges Ag Secretary to keep Canadian border closed to cattle until Mad Cow safety issues are settled  Schumer to detail cuts dairy farmers in each region face  Capital Region farmers could lose out on  2 7 million  Central NY  3 4 m  Rochest US Senator Charles E  Schumer today vowed to fight to restore funding to the federal budget so that New York dairy farmers do not lose out on  27 million in benefits  Schumer  who has been dubbed the Brooklyn farmer  unveiled plans to restore funding for the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program  that has served as a safety net for dairy farmers  protecting them from wildly fluctuating milk prices  Schumer also announced his lobbying efforts to keep the Canadian border closed to all beef and cattle trade until consumer safety issues surrounding the Canadian Mad Cow cases have been resolved          New York  s dairy farms are critical to its rural communities  and our dairy farmers deserve a helping hand in tough times     Schumer said    We should be standing by our farmers  not cutting the programs that support them  When it comes to the milk market  there are various conditions we simply cannot control  We can  however  help farmers endure the tough financial risks caused by turbulent prices  I will fight tooth and nail to restore funding so that farmers can get the protection they deserve        Under the Administration  s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2006 released last week  New York  s farmers would be subject to a 5 percent across the board cut for all farm payments  including the MILC program  Introduced in the 2002 Farm Bill  the MILC program has helped dairy farms to survive dangerously low prices by providing over  186 million in benefits to New York farmers  The current MILC program provides payments to eligible dairy farmers when the price of Boston Class I milk falls below  16 94 per hundredweight  cwt   Payments are issued for up to a maximum of 2 4 million pounds of milk per dairy operation per year        Currently the MILC program is slated to expire on September 30  2005  Schumer is a cosponsor of a bipartisan proposal to extend the current MILC program  without cuts  for two years and double the annual production cap to 4 8 million pounds  a plan that could mean millions more in relief for New York  s dairy farms  It is estimated that raising the cap from 2 4 million pounds to 4 8 million pounds would increase eligible participation by New York dairy farmers in the MILC program from 72  of production to 84  of production       While the Administration  s proposal does call for extending MILC  payments provided during that time would be cut by 5 percent without increasing the production cap  Schumer today released a new analysis showing how much money local New York dairy farmers in each county stand to lose over the next two years if milk prices fluctuate as they have in recent years and the Bush cuts become law  Specifically  Schumer showed the following impacts for farmers throughout the State             Dairy farmers in the Capital Region would receive approximately  14 75 million under Schumer  s proposal    2 74 million more than they would if the Administration  s proposed cuts become law        Dairy farmers in Central New York would receive approximately  18 11 million under Schumer  s proposal     3 36 million more than they would if the Administration  s proposed cuts become law        Dairy farmers in the Rochester   Finger Lakes region would receive approximately  24 57 million under Schumer  s proposal     4 58 million more than they would if the Administration  s proposed cuts become law         Dairy farmers in the Hudson Valley would receive approximately  5 04 million under Schumer  s proposal     950 000 more than they would if the Administration  s proposed cuts become law         Dairy farmers in the North Country would receive approximately  31 million under Schumer  s proposal    5 75 million more than they would if the Administration  s proposed cuts become law         Dairy farmers in the Southern Tier would receive approximately  19 62 million under Schumer  s proposal    3 63 million more than they would if the Administration  s proposed cuts become law         Dairy farmers in Western New York would receive approximately  32 12 million under Schumer  s proposal    5 9 million more than they would if the Administration  s proposed cuts become law        Schumer said that as Congress begins to debate the budget  he will work with his colleagues to stop the Administration  s cuts and see that his plans to double the production cap are enacted        In addition  Schumer today called for a renewed effort to keep the Canadian border closed to cattle and beef trade due to issues surrounding the recent discovery of two cases of Mad Cow disease in Canada  Mad Cow disease  or bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE  first appeared in Canada in May of 2003 and appeared in the US in December of that year  The US has banned imports of risky Canadian beef and cattle since May 2003  The Bush administration announced on December 29th that it would allow imports of live cattle and beef from cows under the age of 30 months starting on March 7th  However  since this announcement  two new cases of Mad Cow disease in Canada were found early last month  raising questions about Canada s adherence to safety standards put into place to prevent Mad Cow disease       Schumer today said that the US is still not sure that the cattle feed used in Canada is free of the tissue and blood of butchered cows  which causes the disease  and pledged to fight this decision for the safety of New York families  Schumer sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Johanns urging him to reconsider the ruling to open the Canadian border for beef and cattle trade on March 7th         Our first priority must be to protect our consumers  With this in mind  I cannot support resumption of trade with Canada until all issues surrounding cattle feed and are resolved     Schumer wrote in his letter       To view Schumer s analysis click    To view Schumer s letter to Department of
