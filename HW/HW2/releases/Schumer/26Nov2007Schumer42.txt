                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Atlanta Based Federal Home Loan Bank Upped Cash Flow to Countrywide by 77 Percent In Third Quarter  Troubled Mortgage Lender Accounts for 40 Percent of All Advances By Atlanta Bank Collateral Posted By Countrywide Could Include Risky  Option ARM  Loans That Are Experiencing Rapidly Rising Delinquencies Senator Urges Stricter Collateral Guidelines to Reduce Exposure to Risky Mortgages and Encourage Banks to Modify More of Their Unaffordable Loans WASHINGTON  DCWith Countrywide Financial Corp  increasingly turning to the Federal Home Loan Bank  FHLB  system for cash advances to stay afloat as other liquidity sources shun the company  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  urged the overseer of the federally supported bank network to probe the underlying risk of Countrywides collateral and to issue new  system wide regulations to reduce the banks exposure to risky or predatory loans     Countrywide is treating the Federal Home Loan Bank system like its personal ATM  Schumer said  When Congress created these banks  it never intended for them to be used to prop up mortgage lenders that specialized in deceiving borrowers  At a time when Countrywides mortgage portfolio is deteriorating drastically  FHLBs exposure to Countrywide poses an unreasonable risk    As the Wall Street Journal reported Monday  Countrywide has increasingly relied on the FHLB system for cash flow as the mortgage market downturn continues to batter one of the industrys top peddlers of high risk home loans  While other banks have also increasingly relied on the FHLB system  none have done so with more haste than Countrywide  Through the first three quarters of this year  Countrywides advances from the Atlanta based FHLB bank had soared 81 percent  to a total of  51 billion  That represents nearly 40 percent of FHLB Atlantas total advances  according to the banks latest SEC filinga potentially dangerous level of exposure considering Countrywides track record in poor underwriting and predatory lending practices in recent years  Countrywides stock has plummeted 80 percent since the start of the year and just this August  Countrywide had to tap into an emergency  11 5 billion line of credit    To secure its advances from FHLB Atlanta  Countrywide has posted  62 billion worth of loans as collateral  Schumer pointed out that there is adequate reason for worry that Countrywides collateral poses a higher risk than other banks  As of September 30  over one third of the loans held for investment by Countrywide Bank were payment option adjustable rate mortgages  option ARMs   one of the most exotic varieties of risky home loans in the industry  Also  according to published reports  a startling 91 percent of option ARMs the company originated in 2006 and 2007 were low documentation  Moreover  the company reported that 89 percent of their 2006 originations of option ARMs did not conform to the joint banking regulators guidance  which increases the likelihood that Countrywide is pledging loans deemed unsuitable or predatory by the regulators as collateral for FHLB advances   Also  delinquencies on Countrywides option ARMS are skyrocketing  jumping nearly 75 percent in the last quarter alone    In a letter to the chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board  FHFB the regulatory agency for the 12 FHLB banksSchumer urged the agency to study whether Atlantas exposure to Countrywides collateral poses an undue risk to the FHLB system  He also called for the regulator to consider preventing any further or continuing overnight advances based on collateral that does not meet the guidance issued earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Boardand adopted by other federal financial regulators such as the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationconcerning exotic home loans  Incorporating the joint regulators guidance would effectively prevent the FHLB banks from accepting the highest risk varieties of mortgagesincluding the option ARMs that Countrywide made its specialtyas collateral to secure advances   This could provide further incentive for banks like Countrywide to modify their riskiest loans to safe  affordable and sustainable loan products for their borrowers    Earlier this year  FHFB officially informed the home loan banks of the joint federal guidance  but did so on a non binding basis  This has essentially left it up to the individual FHLB banks to determine its own policies on what does and does not qualify as adequate collateral  Schumer said the standards should be tightened and made uniform     The FHLB system was chartered by Congress in 1932 to support neighborhood banks by serving as a lender of last resort  Today  the 12 bank system services approximately 8 000 member institutions    A copy of Schumers letter to FHFB Chairman Ronald Rosenfeld appears below      November 26  2007   Ronald A  Rosenfeld  Chairman  Federal Housing Finance Board  1625 Eye Street NW  Washington  DC 20006   Dear Chairman Rosenfeld    I write to express my serious concern over the lending practices of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta  specifically in regard to the significant volume of advances made to Countrywide Bank   I am concerned that the loans being pledged by Countrywide to secure these advances may pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the FHLB system as a whole   I urge you to conduct a careful review of FHLB Atlantas collateral evaluation policies  as well as Countrywides pledged collateral  in an effort to determine the risk that Countrywides collateral poses to the FHLB system   During the current market crisis  it is important that the FHLB system perform its critical mission safely without imposing additional risks on an already strained market    According to the most recent SEC filings  FHLB Atlanta had made  51 1 billion in advances to Countrywide Bank  representing 37 percent of the Banks total outstanding advances as of September 30  2007 and far exceeding advances made to the next largest borrower   Countrywide had pledged  62 4 billion of mortgages as collateral for the FHLB advances  representing 78 percent of its total mortgage loans held for investment at the bank      I find these numbers alarming as reports continue to emerge about how Countrywides reckless and predatory lending practices were a leading contributor to todays foreclosure crisis   Moreover  it is my understanding that Countrywides loans held for investment at the bank have been far from immune from the credit deterioration that has resulted from unsound lending   Countrywide reportedly held  27 billion of pay option ARMs as of September 30  2007  accounting for over one third of the loans held for investment by the bank   Countrywides option ARMs were  and may still be  often underwritten with less than full documentation  according to UBS Warburg data prepared for the Wall Street Journal  91 percent of Countrywides option ARMs underwritten in 2006 were low doc   It has been reported that delinquencies on Countrywides pay option ARMS are skyrocketing  jumping nearly 75 percent in the last quarter    Given this rapid deterioration in the credit quality of Countrywides option ARMs  I urge you to conduct a review of the loans that are being held as collateral for FHLB advances in an effort to determine if FHLB Atlanta has adequate collateral to secure these advances   I would also like an explanation of how any second lien mortgages during a time of property price declines could be viewed as adequate collateral for large FHLB advances   Furthermore  I believe that you should consider preventing any further or continuing overnight advances based on collateral that does not meet the joint financial regulators guidance on nontraditional and subprime mortgage products  e g   Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks and joint Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending    This quarter  Countrywide reported that 89 percent of their 2006 originations of pay option ARMs did not conform to the joint regulators guidance  which increases the likelihood that Countrywide is pledging loans deemed predatory by the regulators as collateral for FHLB advances   Importantly  Fannie Mae and Freddie Macs safety and soundness regulator has specifically prohibited any new direct or indirect investment in loans that do not meet this guidance  As the mortgage crisis threatens to get worse from here  it is critical that the FHFB do the same     Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter  and I look forward to working with you on these issues in the coming weeks and months  If you should have any questions  please contact David Stoopler on my staff at 202 224 6542     Sincerely      Charles E  Schumer  United States Senator
