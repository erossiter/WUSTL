IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 2  2005 Schumer Blasts Privatization Scheme  New Birth Tax Hits  18k By 2015 For All Americans Prepared Opening Statement Senate Finance Committee Hearing On Social Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Thank you  Senator Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus  for calling this hearing  which I hope will be the first of many hearings on this very important topic     I know my time is limited  so I want to make a very brief statement before I turn to questions for our two witnesses     Every member of this Committee knows that Social Security has been a success story  In 1950  one half of the elderly lived in poverty  That figure is now less than 10 percent  That  s a pretty successful record     But every member here also knows that the program needs some changes in order make sure it  s there for future generations of Americans  The question we have to wrestle with is  what sorts of changes  Does the program need minor tweaking  or does it need to be dismantled and replaced with something else     Almost all of us on the Democratic side believe that the President  s plan to partially privatize the system is a bad idea from the start  whether it  s called privatization or personalization or whatever the buzzword happens to be this week     We have come to this conclusion not because we believe that government does everything right  but because we believe the President  s solution is fundamentally flawed  Ironically  it makes the underlying problem    restoring long term solvency    more difficult to solve  by taking money out of the program at exactly the wrong time  In addition  siphoning payroll tax money into private accounts will add trillions in additional debt that future generations will have to repay  That  s unacceptable     Unfortunately  on this issue  the President is being advised by ideologues who believe that government can  t do anything well  and that the private market is always better  In my view  and the view of many  he is getting bad advice  The President needs to decide whether he wants to take the lead in fixing Social Security  or whether he wants to take the lead in destroying the most successful social program in history     I want to bring some additional focus to the debt issue  which has received little attention in the press thus far     If you take a look at this chart  you will see that the per capita public debt    the amount owed by every man  woman  and child in the country    was just under  12 000 in 2001  Call this the   birth tax     since it was money each newborn American and all Americans will have to pay back  with interest  When President Bush took office  that number was finally on the way down     As a result of the President  s tax cuts  September 11  and the slowed economy  our fiscal situation has shifted 180 degrees  That per capita   birth tax    is now scheduled to grow to over  18 000 by 2015  even with no other changes to spending or tax law     When we add in the Administration  s defense buildup  the ongoing costs of the war in Iraq  and the costs to make all of the President  s tax cuts permanent  the per capita figure grows to over  25 000 by 2015     And here  s where another major problem for the President  s privatization plan lies  According to most estimates  setting aside 4 percentage points of the 12 4 percent Social Security tax for private accounts would require the government to borrow close to  2 trillion over the next 10 years in order to pay scheduled benefits to current and near retirees     Adding this borrowing to these other policy changes would bring each American  s share of the public debt    their   birth tax       to close to  30 000 by 2015  That means that every child born in America will be  30 000 in debt on the day they are born  And this number does not even include any reforms to the AMT  which we all know must be made  or any new debt service costs     For many in my party  this is a moral issue  The President talked a lot about moral issues during the presidential campaign  and I  d like to see him address the exploding national debt in his State of the Union speech tomorrow night  His Social Security reform plan is a nonstarter not only because privatization makes the problem worse  but also because we find these levels of debt unacceptable and unsustainable  and not representative of our values     Speaking personally  I find it absolutely amazing that the President focuses so much attention on repealing what he call the   death tax       a tax that affects only one American in 100    while he is seemingly unconcerned with the rising   birth tax    that every single American is facing  poor and rich  rural and urban  black and white     Simply put  it is immoral to borrow another  2 trillion from future generations to finance Social Security reform  We are already spending enough of our kids   money  When the President gets around to sending us a plan with specifics  he should take whatever steps necessary to minimize any additional increases in debt that our children and grandchildren will have to pay back with higher taxes
