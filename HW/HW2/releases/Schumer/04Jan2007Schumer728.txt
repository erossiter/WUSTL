Lines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      With Norfolk Southern Increasing Train Speeds through Elmira  Schumer  s Legislation Would Aim to Shore Up Infrastructure to Prevent More Accidents   New York  s Freight Rail Infrastructure is Old and Deteriorating    Legislation Calls for Nationwide Structural Review and Creates New Line of Funding for Immediate Improvements   Gang Mills Accident Could Have Been Devastating Had Dan On the heals of last month  s Norfolk Southern train derailment in Gang Mills  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today warned that this week that the potentially disastrous derailment could be just the tip of the iceberg if the federal government doesn  t move quickly to improve freight rail infrastructure in the Southern Tier and across the country   Norfolk Southern has already increased freight train speeds through Elmira and there are questions as to whether or not the older overpasses and rails can handle it   Today  Schumer announced he will reintroduce in the new congress his bi partisan Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  comprehensive rail safety and security legislation  which would direct millions of dollars in new funding to improve rail infrastructure         Increasing train speeds before we upgrade Elmira  s rail infrastructure is putting the cart before the horse     Schumer said    There are still serious doubts out whether or not Elmira  s rails  bridges and overpasses will be able handle the increased speeds and this accident shows we shouldn  t be taking any chances   We need a real plan to protect our communities and tougher penalties for railroad companies who disregard our safety          Two weeks ago  two tanker cars carrying butane derailed in Gang Mills   Though the tanker cars did not leak the hazardous chemicals  local first responders reported that the cars were highly unstable because the gravel that supports the track had been damaged   Several employees were evacuated from the scene   Had the chemicals leaked  the accident could have been very dangerous       Schumer said that inadequate safety precautions put hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near rail lines at risk  According to Federal Railroad Administration statistics  there have been 63 rail accidents  30 derailments  14 casualties and 383 total injuries last year nationwide       In early December  a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailed near the Norfolk Southern Yard outside Buffalo  Three of the 55 cars jumped the tracks and two flipped over   Though none of the cars contained hazardous materials  had there been dangerous chemicals on board  Schumer said the accident could have been a full blown disaster       Schumer also said that current rail safety measures and the prevalence of manual switches along rail lines provide inadequate protection for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near the state  s 3 695 miles of freight rail tracks  Manual switches were to blame for the deadly 2005 Graniteville  South Carolina derailment where chlorine leaked from the rail yard in to the neighboring community   The Gang Mills accident also occurred in the rail yard where the chemical tanker cars were being held       From January to September of 2006  there were three more accidents in New York State caused by problems with the infrastructure than in the same period in 2005  an increase of 17 6   According to the National Transportation Atlas Database  more than 2 02 million tons of chemicals are transported on New York  s rail networks every year        To protect New Yorkers from a potential railroad disaster  Schumer today announced that he is going to reintroduce his bipartisan comprehensive railroad legislation that he wrote after the deadly Graniteville  South Carolina rail disaster in 2004   Schumer  s legislation  the Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  co sponsored by Senator Lindsey O  Graham  R SC  sets tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology   The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and require the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents       Schumer  s legislation would also create a new infrastructure grant program that would authorize  50 million in federal funding for railroad and localities to complete vital infrastructure improvements
