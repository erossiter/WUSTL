                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Current Budget Underfunds Critical Federal Education Programs by 50 Percent   Could Mean Limited Resources for Teacher Salaries  Books  and Other Major School Expenses   Schumer Announces New Effort to Restore Full Funding In Appropriations Bill that Could Come to the Floor This Month or After the Election   New Schumer County by County Analysis Shows that Federal Budget Stiffs S With local children returning to school  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released a new  showing that the federal government is shortchanging upstate New York schools by more than  230 million  Schumer released a new analysis of the Administration  s education budget showing that schools could be shortchanged funding promised under Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act  which was signed into law in January 2002          All over upstate New York parents are thinking about their kids going back to school  and they  re concerned about the quality of their children s education   Schumer said   But right now  schools are strapped for cash and are depending on Washington to keep its commitment to fund computers  books  teachers  and programs for special ed  Stiffing our schools is going to leave big holes in our schools   budgets and with localities already worrying about tax hikes  it couldn t happen at a worse time          Schumer said that  with state education funds already mired in doubt and property taxes sky high  the federal government must keep its promise to fund upstate New York schools  When No Child Left Behind was originally passed  the bill included specific funding authorizations for Title I grants for every year of the bill   However  the Administration  s Fiscal Year 2007 budget freezes funding for the program at only  12 7 billion  well below the levels included in the original legislation  which calls for a total  25 billion in Title I grants for FY2007   This means the program would be underfunded by  12 3 billion    Title I grants provide critical funding to local educational agencies to help raise student achievement in disadvantaged communities  In addition  the money is also meant to help schools meet new accountability measures geared toward improving student performance  such as reading and math tests       Schumer  s report analyzed the dollar amounts promised to schools in upstate New York under No Child Left Behind and compared those numbers with the amounts the Administration has decided to send to the schools  According to Schumer  s report  the current FY 2007 budget would shortchange upstate New York school districts by  231 474 878 in Title I funding  distributing only  320 493 622 instead of the  551 968 500 million promised under the original legislation   Though the school year runs from the beginning of September to June  the Department of Education gives out Title I grants based on the fiscal year   Schumer report reflects grants to be given out during Fiscal Year 2007 which starts October 1st  2006       Below is how the numbers break out across upstate New York        The Administration  s proposed budget would send only  31 3 million to schools in the Capital Region instead of the  51 0 million promised    a shortfall of  19 7 million            The Administration  s proposed budget would send only  41 5 million to schools in Central New York instead of the  70 7 million promised    a shortfall of  29 2 million            The Administration  s proposed budget would send only  52 4 million to schools in the Rochester Finger Lakes area instead of the  96 3 million promised    a shortfall of  44 million            The Administration  s proposed budget would send only  78 6 million to schools in the Hudson Valley instead of the  135 3 million promised    a shortfall of  56 7 million            The Administration  s proposed budget would send only  24 2 million to schools in the North Country instead of the  36 8 million promised    a shortfall of  12 6 million            The Administration  s proposed budget would send only  24 1 million to schools in the Southern Tier instead of the  37 5 million promised    a shortfall of  13 4 million            The Administration  s proposed budget would send only  68 4million to schools in the Western New York instead of the  124 4 million promised    a shortfall of  56 million       To close this gaping shortfall  Schumer announced he will support an amendment to the Labor Health and Human Services appropriations bill  if it comes to the Senate floor as scheduled this month or after the November elections  to restore full funding for Title I grants   The appropriations bill  which includes federal education funding for local school districts  was passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee back in July   Schumer said he will use every available opportunity  including lobbying appropriations conferees if the bill goes to conference  to restore funding to the full authorized level       In April  Schumer sent a personal letter to Labor HHS Appropriations Committee leaders Senator Arlen Specter  R PA  and Tom Harkin  D IA  asking them to restore the funding   In his letter  Schumer asked the committee provide a total of  25 billion in Title I grants
