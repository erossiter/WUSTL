                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            College Tuition Tax Deduction  Which Annually Allows More than 350 000 NY and NJ Families To Deduct Thousands of Dollars in College Costs  Expired This Year   Congressional Leaders Chose Tax Breaks for Big Oil Companies over Extending College Tax Breaks for Middle Class Families    Schumer and Menendez Announce Fight to Restore Critical Tax Break in Upcoming Lame Duck Session     Today  U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Robert Menendez revealed that hundreds of thousands of New York and New Jersey middle class families could lose a critical tax break they ve counted on to help pay the skyrocketing cost of college tuition if Congress doesn  t act by the end of the year  The   College Tuition Tax Deduction    allowed more than 238 000 New York families and 121 000 New Jersey families to deduct up to  4 000 of their kids  tuition from their taxes  Schumer and Menendez said this tax deduction is needed now more than ever as they revealed that between the 2000 2001 school year and the 2004 2005 school year the price of going to a four year college in New York jumped 22  and in New Jersey it jumped 31   In response  Schumer and Menendez will call on Majority Leader Senator Bill Frist to bring legislation to the Senate floor to extend the tax break which was eliminated in May from the tax reconciliation bill in favor of restoring  5 billion worth of tax breaks for the major oil companies         A college education has become a necessity that s priced as a luxury   and it s breaking the bank for students and their families throughout the nation     Schumer said    To hard working New York parents  skyrocketing tuition costs mean debt and second mortgages  They mean lost family vacations and hard choices about how many children can be sent to school  The college tuition tax deduction makes these choices a little easier by saving families thousands of dollars every year            As someone who never could have attended college without federal financial aid  I understand the need to make college more affordable  not less     said Senator Menendez    At a time when the average New Jersey family spends more than a third of its income on tuition expenses  our plan will restore overdue relief to the skyrocketing costs of a college degree and put us closer to the goal of making a college education a birthright for all our young people          The college tuition tax deduction  which was passed into law in 2001 and co authored by Senator Schumer  allowed middle income families to deduct  3 000 from their tax return  The deduction was raised to  4 000 a year in 2004  Last year  single filers who made up to  65 000 a year and married couples with incomes up to  130 000 qualified for the tuition deduction   There was also a smaller   2 000 deduction for those who earned more         According to the Internal Revenue Service  an estimated 238 000 New York middle class families and 121 000 New Jersey middle class families took advantage of the tax deduction during the 2003 tax year  the last year for which data is available  95 013 families in New York City took advantage of the college tuition tax credit in 2003  and across the nation 3 6 million American families took advantage of the deduction  saving them about  4 5 billion      However  in May  language extending the tax break for another three years was eliminated from the tax reconciliation bill in favor of restoring  5 billion worth of tax breaks for the major oil companies       Schumer and Menendez today said that the critical tax break that saves middle class families thousands of dollars every year is needed now more than ever because college tuition costs are continuing to skyrocket  The Senators revealed the following numbers for both states                      In New York  238 000 families took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003  According to the National Center for Education Statistics  between the 2000 2001 school year and the 2004 2005 school year  the average price of going to a 4 year public college including tuition  fees  and room and board in NY increased by 21   rising from  10 254 in 2001 to  12 441 in 2005  The average price of a 4 year private college including tuition  fees  and room and board in NY increased by 23   rising from  25 171 in 2001 to  30 907 in 2005                      In New York City  95 013 families took advantage of the college tuition tax credit in 2003  Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in New York City is up 31 percent  rising from  9 632 in 2001 to  12 731 in 2006  In Long Island  34 746 families took advantage of the college tuition tax credit in 2003  Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in Long Island is up 27 percent  rising from  9 544 in 2001 to  12 153 in 2006                      In New Jersey  121 000 families took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003  According to the National Center for Education Statistics  between the 2000 2001 school year and the 2004 2005 school year  the average price of going to a 4 year public college including tuition  fees  and room and board  in NJ increased by 36   rising from  11 998 in 2001 to  16 349 in 2005  The average price of a 4 year private college including tuition  fees  and room and board in NJ increased by 25   rising from  23 860 in 2001 to  29 751 in 2005                      In New Jersey  families now spend an average of 37 percent of their income on college expenses   According to a new report by the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education  the amount of family income spent on tuition  room  and board has increased steadily since 2000  when families spent 29 percent of their income on college       Because Congress is currently in recess  Schumer sent a personal letter to Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN  demanding that he immediately bring to the floor legislation extending the college tuition tax deduction and other middle class tax breaks that are set to expire this year   In the letter  the Schumer said that   the time for political games is over   This tax break helps middle class families in New York and New Jersey and across the country deal with the increasingly heavy burden of paying to college  and its expiration puts into jeopardy the future of young people everywhere     Today  Schumer and Menendez pledged to fight to restore the tax break for middle class families in the upcoming lame duck session following the midterm elections       Senator Menendez has authored legislation to expand and increase the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit  another important tool that helps families with the cost of college   As the credit has gone unchanged since 1997  Menendez  s legislation would increase the credit to  2 500 to reflect increases in college tuition and would allow families to claim the credit for all four years of college   His legislation  the College Access and Affordability Act  S  2243   would also provide up to  17 500 in loan forgiveness for college graduates who enter high need public service fields        Senator Schumer also authored the bi partisan   Make College Affordable Act     S  759  which would increase the maximum amount of tuition costs that can be deducted to  12 000 each year and passed the Senate Finance Committee last year       In addition  the bill would help college graduates pay off their loans by offering a tax deduction of up to  1 500 for interest paid on student loans over the first five years of repayment  The full deduction would apply to single filers with incomes up to  50 000 and joint filers with incomes up to  100 000  The legislation would still allow parents to choose Hope Scholarships instead of the tax deduction  based on which works best for them
