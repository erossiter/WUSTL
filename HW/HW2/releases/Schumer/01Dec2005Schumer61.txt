Operation Safe Store  which gives over 200 of most vulnerable bodegas in NYC hidden cameras  better alarms to deter robbers   Over 200 assaults in NYC Bodegas in last two  years makes these family stores one of the most dangerous jobs in A Standing at a Washington Heights bodega that has twice been the victim of assault and robbery  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced the installation of surveillance cameras at high risk bodegas throughout the city  The security cameras were funded through a pilot program called   Operation Safe Store    that will install cameras and other theft deterrence technology in over 200 of the most vulnerable bodegas in New York City  Schumer secured  375 000 in federal funds in the 2005 budget for this program        New data from the New York City based Bodega Association of the United States shows New York City bodegas are in dire need of defenses against alarmingly high rates of theft and violence  Over 200 bodegas have been assaulted in the last two years and there have been 12 deaths attributed to crimes assaults occurring in bodegas since 2003         Few things are more uniquely New York than getting just what you need just when you need it at a bodega     Schumer said    But building a family business in what for so many owners is a new city or new country shouldn  t have to mean putting their life on the line  Everyone knows we need to do a lot more to keep bodega owners  customers and workers safe  These funds are a huge down payment to combat the robberies and crimes that sadly have become all too common        There are over 14 000 bodegas selling food and other daily needs in all five boroughs  Because bodegas are often located in high crime neighborhoods and because they typically stay open all day and night  they are often the target of robberies and other crimes  Research by the Bodega Association shows that approximately 3 000 of these bodegas experience alarmingly high risks of threats and violence  which then put owners  employees  and neighbors at risk  One third of these bodegas    or approximately 1 000    are in need of immediate help        The NYPD has analyzed robberies of bodegas and other food related businesses over the eight month period from July 2003 through February 2004 and found that during this period  27 police precincts  one third of the total  accounted for two thirds  66   of the total robberies  It is the bodegas in these areas that will get help from the funds Schumer announced today       The funds Schumer secured will enable the Bodega Association to install security cameras at burglar alarms that include locator devices that help the police pinpoint the sites of break ins and robberies at 300 of the stores that are most at risk  Through   Operation Safe Store     the Bodega Association will be able to equip bodegas with close circuit TV cameras so employees behind the counter can see what is happening throughout the store and  where appropriate  outside  video recorders  and silent hold up alarms that are monitored to contact the NYPD  s 911 emergency call system        The entire system is easy to install and maintain and costs approximately  1 200 per unit with installation  The Bodega Association will install over 200 cameras in high risk areas  So far  twenty cameras have been installed  including the one at the bodega Schumer visited today in Washington Heights  Stores that the Bodega Association has equipped with similar devices since June 2003 have not experienced any new robberies       Schumer today thanked Luis Felix  owner of the bodega Schumer visited on Sherman Ave in Washington Heights  Schumer was joined by Jose Fernandez  President of the Bodega Association   Jose Valdez  owner of Valdez Grocery in the Bronx  and Fausto Lopez  Both men were injured when Valdez Grocery was robbed and Lopez was shot and seriously wounded        The Bodega Association has over 7 000 stores throughout the state in its organization  with the highest concentration of members in New York City  The association works with the NYPD and City Council to ensure that bodegas have appropriate means and devices to secure their location       The Bodega Association  founded in 1996  is a local development corporation that seeks to partner the interests of independent inner city entrepreneurs  government and the non profit sector in a partnership to promote job creation and long term  sustainable economic and capital growth in New York  The association attempts to address the most vulnerable business sectors of the inner city marketplace  with its current constituency rooted in the city s retail food industry
