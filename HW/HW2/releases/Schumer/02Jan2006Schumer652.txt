IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 2  2006 Schumer Warns  Post Holiday Rebate Scams Are Fool  s Gold    Stores Hire Rebate Companies Whose Job It Is To Make Sure You Don  t Get Your Money Back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               400 Million Rebates Offered Each Year  Almost Half are Never Redeemed because Applications are Ignored  Rebates Look Like Junk Mail or Applications Demand Impossible to Obtain Documentation    Senator Outlines Ways for Consumers to Make Sure they Get Rebates  Urges Federal Trade Commission to Regulate Rebate Procedures As the holidays wind down and sale shopping ramps up  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer warned New Yorkers against falling into the traps of store rebate scams  created by companies whose job it is to ensure consumers have a hard time getting their money back  Schumer today called on the Federal Trade Commission to standardize rebate procedures and outlined ways in which consumers can make sure they get their rebates         These rebates are fool  s gold     Schumer said    The promise of cash back quickly turns into frustration for consumers who can  t get what they were promised  The FTC needs to step in and regulate these practices immediately          During the holiday and post holiday season mail in rebates proliferate stores  catching consumers   eyes  as they lure them in with a the promise of a lower price while getting them to buy the product at the regular price  Now  as the New Year begins  many people are starting to send in their rebate applications for products that were purchased around Christmastime  Rebates are extraordinarily popular for the very reason that most of them go unredeemed and provide what is essentially free money to the manufacturers  Very few places offer immediate cash rebates  the most common are those that are done through the mail  Industry figures show that 40  to 60  of rebates go unredeemed  While some of the rebates are not redeemed because consumers don  t bother to send them in  in all too many cases even the most diligent consumer is unable to receive his her rebate       However  many companies contract with rebate processing centers  or fulfillment houses  to pay customers  rebate requests  some of whom market themselves with their low rates of redemption  Many of these companies design complex rules  have very short filing periods or ask for documentation that is nearly impossible to obtain    all in an effort to not give the consumer their money back  The rebate companies will ask for copies of receipts multiple times or delay the rebate check for months  Applications will be ignored and consumers will have to redo the entire process  Many of the companies make the rebate check envelope look like junk mail so it ends up in the trash and consumers are stuck retracing all their steps to get the money again  Oftentimes months after a rebate application is sent in  the customer will be asked for other documentation to get their rebate such as codes off of the products box that was thrown out months before or original receipts that have already been sent away       Rebates make up big business  According to Business Week  nearly one third of all computer equipment is sold with some kind of rebate along with 20  of digital cameras  camcorders and LCD TV  s  The industry estimates that 400 million rebates are offered each year with an estimated worth of  6 billion  The Better Business Bureau has received thousands of complains  in 2001 they had only 964 while last year they received 3 641     This is the post Christmas bait and switch     Schumer said    People go into stores with the promise of getting money back  and months later they still haven  t seen checks           In an effort to combat these deceptive rebate offers today Senator Schumer called on the Federal Trade Commission to implement a standard rebate policy to address the growing challenges of rebate offers          The bottom line is  rebates unfailingly bring in billions in excess profits for companies that offer them  but when it comes to saving the shopper a dime  as rebates claim to do  they fail the consumer more often than not     Senator Schumer said    It really is a combination of scrambling to meet deadlines  reading the extremely fine print  following unclear instructions and then crossing your fingers in hopes that the rebate check ever gets sent          In a letter sent to the FTC  Schumer urged an investigation of company rebate policies  and an overhaul and standardization of the rebate process to ensure that all consumers can participate in a fair rebate process  Specifically  Schumer requested that the following consumer protections are put in place            Companies must provide consumers at least 30 days to redeem their rebates and must fulfill the terms of the rebate within the same amount of time required of consumers but it should not exceed 60 days            Companies must take steps to send the rebate check in a manner which identifies the piece of mail as the expected rebate check            Companies must accept copies of receipts  not just originals            Companies cannot require consumers to write identifying information on the rebate form unless the receipt does not identify the purchased product            Companies offering rebates may not require information that is not necessary to process the rebate  including information other than name  address and phone number            Companies must provide telephone numbers or contact information for rebate inquiries so consumers are able check on the status of their rebates       Schumer also outlines steps that consumers can take to ensure they get their rebates  Schumer today told consumers            Keep all receipts for items you will get rebates for  Companies may make you mail either copies or originals of all receipts             Send in you  re your rebates as quickly as possible Many companies have a period as short as seven days for consumers to send in their documentation            Save the box  A rebate application may require the UPC code off of the packaging that the product came in            Always sort your mail carefully  Many rebate checks are created to look like junk mail  Don  t be fooled            Make copies of every element of your application  Companies have been known to ask for you to resubmit  citing a mistake or loss of an application so copies of everything are a must            Have the appropriate numbers for follow up  You may have to contact the company if the rebate doesn  t arrive as promised
