IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 31  2006 Schumer Reveals Backbreaking And Outdated Regulations Decimating Long Island Fishing Economy  Both Commercial And Recreational Fishermen Hurt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Despite More Fluke in the Waters since the 1980s  Feds Have Cut Fluke Fishing by 21  from 2005 2006 and Considering Another 78  for 2007    Senator Unveils Plan to Curb Devastation of New York Fishing Businesses  Economy  and Recreational Opportunities As the summer fishing season is at its height  the extremely stringent fishing regulations on Long Island are decimating fishing businesses  commercial fishing and recreational fishing which are the life blood of Long Island in the summer  While there are more fluke  summer flounder  in the waters now than ever before Schumer today revealed that the Federal Government is planning to cut the fluke fishery by over 78 percent for next year  killing Long Island  s fishing industry  Schumer today unveiled his plan to curb the loss to the fishing industry and loosen the federal regulations       These fluke regulations defy reason     Schumer said    Long Island fishermen have no choice but to buckle under the backbreaking pressure being placed on them  If we don  t put a stop to this now  fishing as we know it on Long Island will be over        The 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act is driving the overly burdensome regulations  The bill was passed after federal regulators thought that the waters reaching from North Carolina to Massachusetts were being over fished and that the fluke population was in danger  The bill required that the maximum sustainable biomass of fluke  about 200 million pounds  is reached by the year 2010 in the waters ranging from North Carolina to Massachusetts  The deadline for the restoration of fluke was reached arbitrarily  But now  despite steadily rebounding fluke stocks  fishermen have had to cope with poorly targeted  outdated regulations     Each year  the National Marine Fisheries Service assesses how much fluke can be caught  New York fisheries  especially in relation to its nearest neighbors  New Jersey and Connecticut face particularly harsh regulations  For example  the regional fluke quota for this season had been anticipated to be 33 million pounds  however  it was subsequently reduced to the current 23 59 million pound allocation  despite clear indications that fluke stocks are rebounding  Due to an outdated formula based on data from the 1980s  New York receives only a tiny fraction of this potential catch  7 65  for commercial fishermen and 17 6  for recreational fishermen  compared to 16 75  for commercial fishermen and 39 1  for recreational fishermen in New Jersey      Following the regulations put forth by the NMFS  the Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC  works with the Federal government to create regulations for fishermen  This year New York  s recreational fishermen are permitted to catch up to four fluke per day  each fluke cannot be under 18 inches in length  In contrast fishermen in New Jersey are permitted to catch up to 8 fluke per day at 16 5 inches or more and Connecticut fishermen are allowed 6 fluke per day at 18 inches  The size of the allowed fish is significant since smaller fish are more easily caught  and preferable to local recreational fishermen  Schumer said today that the less restrictive regulations in the neighboring states are driving fishermen that are integral to the region  s economy to other states     The DEC also regulates the length of the season based on how many fluke can be caught each summer  This season is far shorter than last summer and is expected to get even shorter next year  In New York  last season the fluke season was from April 29th through October 31st while this year it has been cut significantly and is only from May 6th   Sept 12th  about 7 weeks shorter than last year  New Jersey  s season remains the same  at a full five months and Connecticut has a season that lasts for eight months       It  s clear that our fishing industry is at a disadvantage     Schumer said    When our neighboring states can offer longer seasons and better fluke  the fishermen leave with good reason  We need to make sure our fishing economy stays as vibrant as it has always been        Schumer also revealed today that the Federal Government is claiming that there was a miscount of the fluke fishery data and they are discussing reducing the amount of fluke to be fished in the waters from North Carolina to Massachusetts from 23 59 million to 5 6 million for the entire area for next summer  s season   The 78 5  reduction will virtually close the fishing industry in New York      In an effort to ensure that Long Island  s fishing industry is not decimated by these overly harsh regulations Schumer wrote to the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asking them to reformulate the regulations to build in flexibility  equity and more reasonable deadlines  In his letter Schumer asked NOAA to          Reassess the presumptive 78  cut to the fluke quota and explore alternative methods to keep the fluke stock on the road to recovery           Allow for more flexibility in the 10 year rebuilding requirement that was incorporated into the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act if it can be scientifically demonstrated that over fishing is not occurring           Require an annual analysis of the cumulative socioeconomic impacts to a fishing community when determining timelines  cutbacks  and quotas           Implement and adhere to multiyear management plans to reflect an average of fishing quotas rather than attempt to offset annual fluctuations           Evaluate a new type of data collection to supplant the highly suspect  outdated  and arcane Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey as suggested by a recent report by the National Research Council           Offer incentives to neighboring states to reduce their fluke allocation in return for an expansion of opportunities in New York           Level the playing field for New York by making the following restrictions more equitable with neighboring states  length of season and number and size of fish that can be kept       Senator Schumer today stood with  Dennis Cataldo  President of the New York Sport fishing Federation  Rich Johnson  President of The Fishing Line  a broadcasting and publishing resource for the region  s recreational fishermen and Tom Doheny  owner of Scotty  s Fishing
