                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thieves Steal and Sell Entire List of Every Call Cell Phone Owner has Made  Private  Business and Personal Relationships Made Public for a Small Fee   Who your Physician is  Whether you see a Psychologist  Companies you do Business with  Private Personal Relationships Can all be made Public   Chairman Arlen Specter and Sen  Bill Nelson Join Schumer to Introduce Legislation to Criminalize Practice Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer introduced legislation to combat the growing black market of cell phone call logs stolen and sold by criminals  The bipartisan Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006  is being introduced with Senators Arlen Specter  R PA  and Bill Nelson  D FL   and it will criminalize the practice of both stealing and selling these records for cell phone  landline and voice over Internet protocol  VOIP  subscribers  Schumer is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Specter is the Chairman of that committee  and Bill Nelson is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee          Stealing someone  s private phone records is absolutely a criminal act and the fact that it can  t be prosecuted as one has got to change     Schumer said    Stealing a person  s phone log can lead to serious personal  financial  and safety issues for just about any American            This is a simple matter of consumer privacy     Nelson said    I feel strongly that sensitive personal information  including our cell phone records  should be protected from the eyes of strangers         The Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 will make it a federal offense  punishable as a felony  to obtain customer information from a telephone service provider by false pretenses or access a customer account on the Internet to obtain billing information without authorization  The bill also makes it a crime for phone company employees to sell customer information without proper authorization  The bill applies to cell  landline  and  VOIP  phone records       The following actions will be violations of federal law under Schumer  s new bill to obtain someone  s phone records by   1  Making false or fraudulent statements or representations to an employee of a telephone service provider    2  Making such statements to a customer of a telephone service provider   3  Accessing a customer account on the Internet without the customer  s authorization    4  Providing false documentation to a telephone service provider knowing that the document is false    Cell phone call logs are sought out for a variety of reasons  For years phone records gave been used by law enforcement and private detectives  but with the internet  gaining access to that information has gotten much easier  Websites like www locatecell com offer the service online  and with little regulation it is nearly impossible to stop        All phone records  but especially cell phone records can be of great use to criminals and the information provided through a call log provides whoever is looking with a wealth of personal data  Many call rosters can reveal the names of a cell user  s doctors  their public and private relationships  their business associates and more  While other personal information such as social security numbers which can be on public documents that are found by data brokers  the only warehouse of phone records is at the phone companies themselves       Experts say that these records can be made available through three techniques  The first is having someone that works for one of the phone companies who sells the data  Though strict rules inside most of the phone companies make this practice risky  officials say that finding someone with access to the information desired is not that difficult  The second technique is   pretexting    where a data broker or the like pretends to be the owner of the phone  In doing so  they convince the cell phone company  s employees to release the data to them       Third  as more people manage their cell phone accounts online  thieves can access the accounts on the Internet  Many cell phone companies push account holders to manage their accounts online  many of them set up the online capability in advance  many customers never access their Internet accounts  If someone seeking the information can figure out how to activate the account before the real customer does  they get unfettered access to all of the call records       Though the problem is all too common  federal law is too narrow to include this type of crime  Pretexting for financial data is illegal  but its does not include phone records         We should protect your phone information and call logs the same way we protect your financial information or even medical records  Very personal information can be gleaned from our telephone records and criminals who steal this information should be punished     Schumer concluded
