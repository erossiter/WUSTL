Appropriations bill conference report  which includes  9 2 million in defense funding for the Hudson  Valley and Westchester Regions    The bill  having been approved by both chambers of Congress  will now be sent to the President for his signature   This is terrific news for the Hudson Valley and Westchester  and a vital step in the appropriations process  said Senator Schumer  These critical funds will help us ensure that in defending our nation  we are equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our nations defense forces and the Hudson Valley economy  I will urge the president to sign this bill immediately   This is excellent news not only for the Hudson Valley and Westchester regions  but also for our men and women in uniform  The cutting edge research and development carried out by these local businesses will equip our troops with advanced military technology  At the same time  this funding is a great investment in the regions economy  I applaud the conference committee for approving funds that will allow these important projects to continue  and I look forward to the President signing this bill into law  said Senator Clinton   The  9 2 million for the Hudson Valley and Westchester Regions in the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes   eMagin  Inc   Power Efficient Microdisplay Development for U S  Army Night Vision    2 4 million  Funding will help to develop a power efficient organic light emitting diode  OLED  microdisplay and interface  suitable for inclusion in military thermal imaging devices  providing at least a 3x reduction in power from legacy technologies  The effort will include the incorporation of new  but already qualified  materials  pixel electronics and cell structure to match the latest thermal camera specifications   eMagin  Inc   Ultra High Resolution Display for Army Medicine    3 6 million  Military and civilian medicine relies increasingly on advanced simulation technology to demonstrate procedures and to train medics and physicians in traditional and innovative procedures  The organic light emitting display  OLED  is capable of providing the desired full spectrum instant on temperature range  vibration insensitivity  and operation at extremely low power for ultra portable systems  Funding will be used to design and develop prototypes of an OLED high resolution micro display  HMD  that is compact  lightweight  power efficient and capable of providing a highly realistic display of the virtual world  In addition  a conceptual optics design will be completed in order to provide confidence that a wide field of view  compact and lightweight head mounted display system can be built to meet Army medicine training and simulation requirements  The technology would be ideal for next generation dual use applications which require resolutions higher than SXGA  1024 x 1280 pixels  by enhancing safety  improved situational awareness   productivity  hands free information acquisition  and effectiveness  better coordinated actions    Holographic Optics  Smart Visor    1 6 million  To better equip our tactical pilots with eye protection  while simultaneously improving their situational awareness  Smart Visor develops a single  integrated system  capable of protecting against multiple threats that an array of separate  individual visor systems presently provide  Three difficult issues must be solved in order to assure effectiveness in a future visor system   1  interfacing with sensor displays   2  laser protection  and  3  compatibility with helmet mounted display systems    HYPRES  Inc   Transformational Satellite  TSAT  Communications Upgrade to Navy Multiband Terminal    1 6 million  Funding will help to accelerate development of a prototype All Digital Transceiver  ADT  for TSAT upgrades to the Navy Multi band Terminal  NMT  program  The work seeks to provide significant risk mitigation and cost savings for the Navy and other services satellite communications programs that exploit the commonalities between the Navy  Army  and Air Force terminal programs
