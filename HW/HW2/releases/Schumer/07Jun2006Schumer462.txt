IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 7  2006 Schumer  Updating Ancient  Pollution Belching Northport Power Plant Must Be Part Of Final LIPA  National Grid Deal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senator  This Merger is a Once  in  a  Lifetime Opportunity to Reduce Pollution  Increase Energy and Lower Energy Costs for LI Ratepayers As the negotiations continue between National Grid and LIPA  today Senator Charles E  Schumer called for the repowering of the Northport power plant to be a part of the final agreement  With KeySpan being sold to National Grid  Schumer said today that the pending partnership of National Grid and LIPA presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to repower  or modernize  the Island s largest and dirtiest power plant at Northport  a widely desired and sorely needed action that was left out of the original KeySpan LIPA deal reached last December         I have said countless times that repowering is a triple win for Long Island  It will improve air quality in an area with some of the worst air pollution in the nation  it increases energy output in a place that is desperate for more power  and  perhaps most importantly  it can reduce rates for Long Island s long suffering energy consumers     Schumer said    These are all things that are desperately needed on Long Island and we need to do all we can to ensure that we can make this happen  Northport is the poster boy for repowering    National Grid needs to step up and help the ratepayers of Long Island and everyone who breathes its air          When LIPA and Keyspan reached their original agreement in December of 2005 to continue its partnership  they announced their intention to repower at two of the smaller power plants on Long Island  Barrett and Far Rockaway were the only two plants to be considered  Schumer supports this effort but believes that the sale of KeySpan to National Grid and the concomitant negotiations between Grid and LIPA provide an historic opportunity to take meaningful and overdue action at the plant that most desperately demands attention  Northport       The opportunity to repower is now possible because National Grid is leveraging billions of dollars as part of the proposed merger  The New York Independent System Operator estimates that repowering costs about  1 million MW  Repowering Northport will mean leveraging a few hundred million dollars more which is unlikely to occur in the future if it is not negotiated now as part of the initial fiscal package        In his letter to Michael Jesanis  Bob Cattell and Richard Kessel  Schumer wrote    In essence  if you do not take the necessary actions now  the chance to repower Northport in a significant way may never happen and Long Islanders will continue to suffer as a result          Schumer said today that while he understands the financial and practical hurdles involved with repowering  it  s a critical step in keeping Long Island free from the detrimental effects of Northport on Long Island and its residents  He said today that a staggered approach to repowering Northport will allow National Grid and LIPA to agree upon a long term retrofitting plan for the remainder of the units that would utilize cleaner technology to curb emissions        Schumer believes that before National Grid and LIPA formalize any new agreement  a plan to substantially repower the Northport plant must be made along with a long term pricing and financing plan that will guarantee no impact on the ratepayer  Savings should be realized as a result of the power plant s new efficiencies that will add energy to the grid  an enhancement of National Grid s assets        Schumer wrote   Not only would repowering benefit National Grid by amplifying its newly acquired assets  but a commitment to cleaning up Long Island  s most notorious power plant would certainly engender positive feedback from the region  s ratepayers and residents  With National Grid having very little record of generating electricity  I believe that your emergence into this market will be boosted by the efforts you take to clean up the relics of our past  If the merger is consummated  National Grid will stand to have a long term relationship with LIPA and its customers that could be solidified further  with more power generated and emissions reduced  In turn  this will prove to have a positive impact not only on the bottom line  but also on reliability and consumer confidence          With Long Island ranked among the worst in the Northeast for ozone and smog levels  the National Grid acquisition of Keyspan offers a unique opportunity for corrective action  According to a report by the Center for Management Analysis at CW Post  if the power plants were repowered and operated at their current level of generation  the Northport plant could experience a 90  reduction in NOx emissions  95  reduction in SO2 emissions  86  reduction in CO2 emissions  and 85  reduction in particulate emissions        Moreover  energy capacity would be doubled at each unit repowered  This could translate into another 375 or even 750 MW of energy  With Long Island  s voracious appetite for energy and emphasis on environmental protection  repowering at Northport  s antiquated existing units would translate into increased efficiency and reduced emissions potential
