                                175 000 People Nationally Diagnosed With Fatal Diseases That Cord Blood Can Treat  New Program Would Turn   Medical Waste into Medical Miracles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator Joined by Doctors and Patients   Over the past five years  over 1 600 people in Monroe County have been diagnosed with blood cancer and could be saved by an umbilical cord blood cell transplant  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today  Schumer unveiled a new sweeping federal plan to coordinate the donation of umbilical cord blood  a viable and more accessible alternative to bone marrow  Umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells  which are the building blocks of the immune system and can be used to treat a variety of life threatening diseases  Cord blood has the ability to treat the same diseases as bone marrow but can be used in more situations because its cells are less mature than marrow cells and does not require a perfect genetic match to be used in a transplant         We have an incredible opportunity to turn medical waste into medical miracles     Schumer said    Mothers bringing one new life into the world  can possibly save another one by donating their umbilical cord blood  If we standardize the process  there  s no reason why nearly every healthy mother can  t donate           At least 175 000 people nationwide over the past five years have been diagnosed with fatal diseases that can be treated by a bone marrow transplant  but many die waiting for a donor match  Blood from umbilical cords  a byproduct of birth  is a rich source of hematopoietic  HEM  AT OH POE  ET IC  progenitor cells  The only other place this type of stem cell is found is in bone marrow  Transplants of the stem cells have been used to cure a variety of lethal blood diseases from leukemia to sickle cell anemia  Bone marrow donors are difficult to find for sick patients because a perfect genetic match is usually required between donor and recipient  Cord blood stem cells  however  are less mature than those in bone marrow and can be successfully used even when there is not a perfect match        About 20 public cord blood banks operate in the U S  but none of these are in upstate New York  Public cord blood banks provide free and easily accessible services to a limited number of hospitals in their area  but their budgets are already strained by these services alone  since it costs over  1 000 to bank a single unit of cord blood  Since upstate New York hospitals are not served by any of these cord blood banks  mothers delivering babies are only likely to learn about the option of donating their blood to a private bank   which can only be accessed by the donating family and could cost thousands of dollars  Right now  if a mother wants to donate her baby  s cord blood to save a life  the burden is on her to find a public bank that will work with her to collect the blood  In fact  very few public banks even accept out of state donations  One such private bank will collect cord blood donations for free  by sending the family a kit with instructions for the doctor  but the burden is cumbersome       Cord blood stem cell transplants have saved the lives of roughly 20 000 Americans with fatal blood diseases  Unfortunately  thousands of patients who might benefit from these transplants die every year waiting for a bone marrow match if they have not heard about the cord blood option or if not enough units exist in public banks to provide for a match        Today Schumer introduced a new  sweeping federal umbilical cord blood program  He will            Cosponsor The Cord Blood Stem Cell Act  which would create a network of qualified cord blood banking centers to prepare  store  and distribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the treatment of patients and to support research using such cells            Increase awareness in the public as well as the medical field through education and training  Obstetricians need to be trained in the proper way to collect cord blood  and pregnant women should be informed about the option to donate to public banks before getting to the third trimester             Increase accessibility to public cord blood banks by regions that are not currently served  Each hospital should be served by at least one public cord blood bank that has an established presence at the hospital  Private cord blood banks that restrict the use of collected blood are usually the only option presented to mothers delivering babies at most hospitals across the country            Request that the FDA create a process for licensure of FDA approved cord blood banks  Schumer will recommend that the New York Blood Center  because of its prominence in the cord blood community be the first licensed cord blood bank  which would then be used as a model to set the standards for licensure for other cord blood banks            Establishing the New York Blood Center as a National Resource Center of practices and standards that other cord blood banks can utilize as a model        The bottom line is that there has always been a great deficit of bone marrow  and people find it almost impossible to find a match  By making cord blood more accessible  we  ll be able to help people who are in grave need  We have a bi partisan bill that would do just that          There are approximately 180 000 units of cord blood stored in banks across the country  The Institute of Medicine figures that 50 000 units of the 180 000 currently in inventory are usable  but at least 150 000 usable units are needed to meet demand  The problem is compatibility  which experts say is determined by six surface proteins  or HLA markers  on each cell  The more closely the markers on the donor s cells match those of the recipient  the less likely it is that the patient s body will reject the transplant  Transplant recipients  especially African and Asian minorities  are much more likely to find a compatible donor if the supply of cord blood is tripled  While cord blood has been used in pediatric transplants for several years  it is only now starting to gain traction in the adult community      In addition to patients with leukemia  cord blood is now being used to treat over 60 other fatal immune and blood diseases  These include  severe combined immune deficiency    boy in the bubble syndrome      lymphoma  adrenoleukodystrophy  Lorenzo  s Oil Disease   and Sickle Cell Anemia among others       Cord blood also offers an extraordinary amount of hope for African Americans  who have the lowest success rate of finding non related bone marrow donors  The ethnic diversity of the bone marrow registry is quite low  although African Americans make up 12  of the population  they only account for 6  of the bone marrow registry  Many African Americans also have both European and African ancestry which puts them at a disadvantage because a person with both tissue types has much more difficulty finding a match  Because of the diversity of tissue types  an African American requires three times the number of donors as a Caucasian to have the same chance of finding a match  Cord blood is a particularly good choice for this community because it doesn  t require a perfect match
