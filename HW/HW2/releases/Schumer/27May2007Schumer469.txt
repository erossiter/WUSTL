                               With So Few Controllers and So Much Traffic  Delays are Spiking   From this Time Last Year Delays at Newark are up 20   LGA 35  and a Whopping 140  at JFK    For Nation s 32 Largest Airports JFK  LGA   NEWARK are Ranked Dead Last for on Time Arrivals   Schumer Announces Bill that Would Force FAA Back to the Table with the Union  Hire More Controllers With nearly 21 million people expected to travel over the Memorial Day holiday and experts predicting that June  July and August will be busier than ever  today Senator Schumer revealed that flight delays at the New York metropolitan airports are at their worst due to a dearth in air traffic controllers  With air traffic on the rise  and staffing of control towers at an all time low  due to a flood of aging controllers leaving the workforce and the inability of substandard incentives and work packages to attract new controllers  more flights are delayed now than ever before  Schumer today announced a bill that would bring the controllers union and the FAA back to the table to solve this staffing crisis and ensure that there are enough controllers to monitor the congested New York airspace   Going on vacation is supposed to be fun  instead it has become an exercise in saintly patience with the traveling public waiting and waiting and waiting in airports and on the runway  Schumer said  A failure to negotiate and inability to resolve this problem is causing tremendous delays and endangering airlines passengers  Its long past time for the FAA and the air traffic controllers to get back to the table and hammer out a settlement that leads to staffing sufficient to handle our heavy air traffic   Today  Schumer released a study containing the latest data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics  The study revealed that the 3 New York area airports  JFK  LaGuardia and Newark International  with their nearly 100 million travelers passing through  have the worst records in the nation for getting travelers in and out on time  The study also shows that these records have gotten substantially worse since this time last year  Schumer today said that the drop in air traffic controllers has a direct relationship to the increase in delays  In other words  as air traffic goes up  the number of controllers go down and flights are delayed time and again  Schumer said   Flight delays in the New York metropolitan area have ballooned in the past year  with JFK  LaGuardia and Newark falling to the bottom of the list for on time arrivals and departures  According to the latest figures from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in the Department of Transportation  delays are surging as airlines approach the busy summer season  when 209 million Americans are expected to take to the sky  a 3  increase over last year   Delays at all three airports are up over last year  with JFK and LaGuardia posting higher increases every month  Of the three area airports  JFK is trending the worst  with a 140  increase in delays over the same period last year  Newarks delays are up 20  over last year  but the airport has by far the most delays in the area  with 19 022

over last year highlights the impact the controller crunch is having on skyrocketing delays  Even with a downturn  there arent enough air traffic controllers to manage the tremendous flow of traffic through the New York airspace  According to testimony by a Vice President of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association  given to the New York State Senate Standing Committee on Consumer Protection on May 24  2007  a dearth of air traffic controllers is adversely affecting the rate of flight delays and passenger safety  There is a severe shortage of air traffic controllers in the nations air traffic system due to a flood of aging controllers leaving the workforce and the inability of substandard incentives and work packages to attract new controllers    In 2004  the air traffic control system was staffed by 15 000 controllers who sufficiently met the demands of the system  Since 2004  the system has lost over 1 000 controllers and added passengers  resulting in controller stress and fatigue due to an inability to meet demand  Over the last three months  the staffing crisis has become so severe that some air traffic control facilities have had to temporarily close due to worker shortages    Controllers peg the blame on the FAA  which they claim has not sought their input in staffing studies and has only focused on recommended spending output  not what needs have to be met in order to adequately staff facilities across the nation  They claim the FAA has instituted staffing ranges based on current staffing levels  well below what staffing levels should be  For example  the revised staffing range for LaGuardia Tower is 28 to 34 controllers where before it was authorized 36 controllers  while only 26 of the 33 controllers currently working at LaGuardia are fully certified to staff the facility    Additionally  the FAA claims their controller needs are down 9 26  while air traffic is up system wide  While traffic has boomed at JFK from a low of 301 160 to a projected high of 450 000 475 000 flights this year  controller staffing levels are down 30   In 2006 alone  four controllers left JFK  with two set to leave this year and another eight expressing their desire to leave  representing a 40  loss in only two years  The FAA intends to hire three more controllers for JFK this year  but they will not be fully certified until 2009  The controller crunch is clear across all three area airports         Facility   Authorized Staffing   Staff in Jan 06  Fully Certified    Present Staff  Fully Certified    Expected to Leave in 07     JFK Tower   36   36   29   2     LaGuardia Tower   36   31   26   3     Newark Tower   40   31   29   2       Staffing levels are further stressed by new work rules imposed by the FAA on eleven NATCA collective bargaining units since 2005  and pay rules since 2006 that forced a two tier pay scale system on controllers  The new work and pay rules  imposed on the controllers without a contract and outside of collective bargaining  have led to sweeping attrition across the system  The remaining employees are subject to mandatory overtime to offset understaffing and denial of sick leave and vacation time  resulting in lowered morale and increased stress and fatigue    As problems retaining experienced controllers grow  so do those of recruiting new controllers  as those considering entering the system are now faced with a 30  cut in pay  leading those  like experienced military controllers  to turn down jobs lest they take a large salary cut  Since only 50  of recruitments will eventually become fully certified  the need to retain staffing levels  while finding new employees  is critical  Yet  retirements and total attrition are exceeding the FAAs planned recruitment for a fourth straight fiscal year  The trajectory is so bad that it is estimated that by 2010 40  of the nations controllers will have less than 4 years experience  Not only will there be fewer eyes watching more traffic  but those eyes will be far less experienced than those today   There exists a direct relationship between staffing and safety  one that becomes even clearer over time as the cumulative effect of long shifts  forced overtime  increased time on position and decreased personal time for family  rest and relaxation take a brutal toll on the mind and the body  This in turn affects reaction times  judgment  focus and alertness  Fewer controllers in a facility means a rise in operational errors and runway incursions and a higher risk of safety problems due to the decreased margin of safety and lack of any room for error   In an effort to get the FAA and the air traffic controllers back to the table to solve the staffing crisis and ensure that the flying public can get where they are supposed to  on time  Schumer today announced his legislation to initiate binding arbitration between the FAA and labor organizations once contract negotiations reach an impasse  This bill will send the FAA and NATCA back to the table so that the air traffic controllers have a better chance of a fair and equitable labor contract    Currently  the FAA has been able to impose more mandatory overtime  reduced reimbursements for relocation expenses to be trained as a controller  as well as a smaller per diem during the training period  A new contract  one not merely forced upon NATCA by the FAA  will make the recruitment and retention of controllers more possible so that this crippling shortage can end  The bill would also be retroactive and apply to impasses that have occurred over the last two years
