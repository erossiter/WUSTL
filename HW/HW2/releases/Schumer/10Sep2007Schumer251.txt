IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 10  2007 Schumer  With The City Of Buffalo Sufficiently Meeting All Of Fema s Demands  City Should Be Reimbursed For All Costs Incurred When Removing Tree Stumps Leftover From Last Year s Storm                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The City has Adequately Provided FEMA with all Requested Information and Met with the Agency Firsthand The Cost of Removing the Tree Stumps is Estimated at More than  1 4 million  but the City is Still being Deprived of Reimbursement Funds to Cover Costs Schumer  FEMA must Overturn its Foolhardy Decision and Help  Not Hinder  the City s Attempt to Finally Clean up From  With the City of Buffalo sufficiently meeting the Federal Emergency Management Agencys  FEMA  request for additional information pertaining to the citys ongoing efforts to remove tree stumps from last Octobers freak snowstorm  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Federal agency to approve the Citys appeal for reimbursement for funding to cover the costs of tree stump removal  The cost of removing the stumps is estimated at more than  1 4 million  but FEMA has informed the City that it will not fully cover the costs  The City has appealed FEMAs ruling and has pleaded its case to both the State Emergency Management Office  SEMO  and with FEMA   most recently on August 23rd    Satisfied the City has taken all the appropriate steps towards justifying its appeal  today Schumer sent a letter to David Paulison  Under Secretary of Homeland Security  urging his agency to reimburse the city for funding to cover its tree stump removal costs    The City of Buffalo has bent over backwards  sufficiently making its case why FEMA should reimbursement it for the costs of removing these tree stumps  said Senator Schumer  Today Im calling on FEMA to acknowledge the great pains the City has taken to properly clean up in the aftermath of a devastating storm and to overturn a foolhardy decision by giving Buffalo the funding it needs to finish the job  Plain and simple  FEMA cannot wipe its hands and walk away from the city and its residents   As a result of the freak snowstorm that slammed the Buffalo area in October of 2006  and destroyed thousands of trees  there are 7 000 tree stumps throughout the City that present a lasting danger  if they are not dealt with  According to Schumer  the stumps must be removed for safety  but the City can not finance this project alone  The stumps present a serious threat to those living in and visiting Buffalo  The City is concerned that it is only a matter of time before a pedestrian trips over a stump and injures themselves  The City is further concerned that anyone who suffers an injury from these hazardous tree stumps may hold the City liable  a cost that it can not shoulder    Schumer argued that at a cost of  200 per stump extraction  the Buffalo government estimates that this project will cost nearly  1 4 million  a significant financial burden  In addition to the expense of stump removal  liabilities including hazards to pedestrians and drivers present unknown future costs  as outlined in a letter from the City to SEMO on September 7th  providing further evidence of the urgency of this matter  This Citys appeal  which was filed on March 8  2007  has been acknowledged by FEMA and additional information was requested by the State Emergency Management Office  SEMO   Subsequently  the City met with representatives from SEMO and FEMA on June 5 and again on August 23  Now that Buffalo has provided SEMO and FEMA with the additional information that it requested  Schumer today argued that it has time for FEMA to provide the city with the money that it desperately needs   The City expects to have final bids for full costs of stump removal in by the end of this month  Because of the enormity of the stump problem throughout the City they expect the removal process to take a full year concluding in November of 2008    Schumer in his letter called on FEMA to not only approve the expense for stump removal but to be sure that the approval allows the needed time to complete the project safely and effectively   Through the Public Assistance Program  FEMA provides supplemental Federal disaster grant assistance for the repair  replacement  or restoration of disaster damaged  publicly owned facilities and the facilities of certain Private Non Profit  PNP  organizations  Under this program  FEMA defines debris removal as the clearance  removal  and or disposal of items such as trees  sand  gravel  building components  wreckage  vehicles  and personal property   On October 15  2006  Schumer visited Buffalo immediately following the snowstorm to survey the damage  He successfully urged the President to make a Major Disaster Declaration which released millions of dollars in federal aid for storm victims  Following the storms Schumer was in close contact with FEMA and the SBA to ensure that aid would be available to those whose homes and businesses were damaged
