Includes Schumer Proposed Loan Limit Increase PROMISE Act Would Temporarily Increase Portfolio Caps for GSEs  So Fannie and Freddie Can Target New Financing to Subprime Borrowers Trapped in Unaffordable Loans  Washington  DCU S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY   chairman of the Joint Economic Committee  JEC  and chairman of the Senates Housing Subcommittee  spoke today on the Senate floor in support of expedited passage of two pieces of landmark legislation that will assist borrowers trapped in risky  unaffordable subprime loans  Following Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids unanimous consent requests for the two proposals  Senator Schumer spoke to encourage his colleagues to support the two bills without any further delay   This Administration needs to take off its ideological handcuffs when it comes to helping homeowners and protecting our economy  Schumer said  These bills are a measured  targeted effort to prevent the spread of the subprime mortgage meltdown to more families and into the larger economyand they should be supported by my colleagues and by the White House   The FHA Modernization Act  which includes the loan limit increase originally proposed by Senator Schumer this past spring  allows risk based pricing and lowers down payment requirements from 3  to 1 5   It also includes provisions enhance consumer and fraud protection  These improvements will give FHA greater flexibility to assist subprime borrowers with critical refinancing alternatives that will allow them to prevent foreclosure   The PROMISE Act  introduced by Schumer  would stabilize the current credit crunch and alleviate the predicted wave of foreclosures by providing the government sponsored enterprises  GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Macwith a temporary  six month increase in their portfolio caps  The bill would increase the limitations currently in place by 10   allowing for 85  of the increase to be dedicated to assisting in the refinancing of subprime mortgages at risk of foreclosure    Senator Schumers remarks as delivered are reproduced below   Statement of Senator Charles E  Schumer November 15  2007  I rise today to discuss the subprime lending crisis and the plan we are executing to address the foreclosure wave that threatens homeownership and our broader economy  Rampant predatory lending practices across this nation have left millions of American homeowners stuck in unaffordable and unfair subprime loans    As a result  two million families now face the prospect of foreclosure and the loss of their homes over the next two years unless we take action  The number is going to get worse because the loans that were made in 2006 and this year  2007  usually don t reset until 2008 and 2009  And because so many people who took these loans were taken advantage of  the interest rate will skyrocket for them and many of them will not be able to afford it    Foreclosures entail not only direct costs to the lenders and borrowers but also high spillover costs that are felt by neighboring homeowners  communities  and local governments in the form of lower home values  lost property tax revenue  and increased maintenance costs  A recent report by the majority staff of the Joint Economic Committee  JEC  estimated that each foreclosure can cost  227 000 in direct and indirect costs  That s astounding  The homes on a street or in a neighborhood that has had foreclosures often go down in value  So even if you re perfectly safe  even if you ve already paid your mortgage and have no intention of taking out another one  you are at risk because of this foreclosure crisis in terms of the value of your home  The numbers mean that if the housing market slump continues through the next two years  as many economists estimate  approximately  103 billion in housing wealth will be destroyed as these homes are foreclosed on   103 billion in lost wealth at a time when our families can least afford it    In addition  states and local governments will lose nearly  1 billion in property tax revenue over the next two years as a result of the destruction of housing wealth caused by subprime foreclosures  That is  1 billion less funding for schools and public safety  and that s just the direct property tax loss  Were not talking about the other losses that states and local governments will see as a result of the broader economic impact of the crisis  And we re not talking about the financial burden that cities and towns all over the nation will face to maintain vacant properties and prevent crime near abandoned homes  We re also not talking about the cost to the larger economy   When home values go down because of this crisis  consumers spend less  Consumer spending has been the engine of this economy  It accounts for about 70  of our GDP and the statistics show when home values go down  consumers spend less  So this is ricocheting from one end of the economy to the other  And again  even if you live in a home and you ve paid your mortgage  you will be affected by this    Mr  President  the frustrating thing here is we know what to do here  We can t make this crisis go away  There is no magic wand  It took years of neglect  years of ideological aversion to even commonsense regulation of the now unregulated mortgage brokers  But the frustrating thingfrustrating for this member  who s been talking about this for a long timeis that we know what to do and this Administration  when it comes to the subprime crisis  has remained like an ostrich with its head in the sand  not paying attention    Why  Why don t they see what everyone else sees  The reason is quite simple  Mr  President  We have ideologues that run this Administration  Their view is government should never be involved  Let the homeowner pay the price  Let the economy pay the price  Because to get the government involved is bad  They can t prove that  That s their ideology  And if there was ever a time when we needed some thoughtful  careful  moderate but directed government intervention not to bail out anybody  those people are paying the price  You read it in the financial pages of the newspapers right now  But to help our nation out of this crisis at a time when other things like high oil prices are hitting makes eminent sense    The time to act is now while we still have a chance to save these homes and strengthen our floundering housing market  Well  Im proud to say today that my colleagues  we in the Senate  will have an opportunity to act and take action on two measures that are designed to use the tools of the Federal Government to assist in helping the two million subprime borrowers facing foreclosure with alternatives for loan workouts  refinancings and modifications  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will agree with us that these two actions are urgently necessary    To wait even three  four months will have this crisis grow in problem for those homeowners whose mortgages go up  for those financial institutions that have the mortgages  but to a far greater extent  to our entire economy  neighborhoods affected and consumer spending  So I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us in helping take the urgent action that is needed no now  Not next month  not in February but now    First we ll take action to pass the FHA Modernization bill  This legislation makes several important changes to FHA  including adjustments to down payment requirements  loan limits  and underwriting standards to give the FHA more flexibility to assist subprime borrowers with safe and sustainable refinancing alternatives before their loans reset to unaffordable rates  With these changes  FHA will be able to rescue tens of thousands of American families from the financial ruin of foreclosure  The legislation will also make improvements to FHAs counseling and foreclosure prevention programs to ensure that borrowers who have already faced the specter of the loss of their home will not have to go through the ordeal again  The FHA legislation is modest  It has bipartisan support  It has the support of the Administration  What are we waiting for   Second  we are pushing the passage of the PROMISE Act  a bill to temporarily increase the portfolio caps upon Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by their regulator  legislation I have introduced along with Congressman Frank in the House  The bill will alleviate the predicted wave of foreclosures by giving them 10  more balance sheet capacity  But not just  Do you what you want  we hope you can avoid some foreclosures  We say that 85  of that increase must be dedicated to assisting subprime borrowers that are stuck in risky adjustable rate mortgages    The legislation is based on the premise that in troubled market times like these when private firms are unwilling or incapable of providing financing to help subprime borrowers it is appropriate and necessary for the government sponsored enter prices to step in and provide liquidity this is why we have GSEsquasi private and quasi public  They have a certain and special responsibility when the nation s month is at risk  They are not the same as a private company whose job is to make money for owners or stockholders but at the same time they have the expertise of the private sector and the clout of the private sector to get something done in an efficient and directed way    We ve all heard the GSEs are the only game in town for secondary market trading due to profound distrust of credit quality and rampant uncertainty about the rating agencies  We have to use the liquidity they provide to target those subprime borrowers in a need of saving their home  The frustrating thing is the administration is opposed to this legislation  They just don t like Fannie and Freddie and they say let the markets take care of this in their own way    Mr  President  that s a lesson that was widely accepted in the 1890 s and to some extent in the 1920 s  But this is 2007  We know that thoughtful  well thought out government intervention in a careful way works and what is needed  We also know if we don t have it  the booms and busts of the economy and to individuals will be far greater and starting  really  with Woodrow Wilson and then with Franklin Roosevelt and with Democratic and Republican presidents alike since World War II we have learned that  at times  government intervention is called for  particularly when the private sector is unable to act  In this case  the private sector is clearly unable to act  Over the coming weeks  we also plan to pass  200 million in the transportation HUD appropriations bill for housing counseling  organizations that specialize in foreclosure prevention    Here s another problem  A homeownerand most of the homeowners who are in foreclosure or about to go into foreclosure  these are home owners who could qualify for prime loans but were taken advantage of by greedy mortgage brokers  Now they are stuck  But not really  They have a revenue stream  People I have met  the late subway motorman  Ms  Diaz  a clerk at a hospital for 35 years with a pensionhave the income  Mr  Ruggiero  of Queens  and Mrs  Diaz  of Staten Island  they can refinance but they have no one there to help them  Banks don t do this good part anymore  There are nonprofits able  dedicated  capable  knowledgeable nonprofits who could come right in and fill in    Now  you  Mr  President the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Pennsylvania and Iwere able to persuade Senator Murray who  in her wisdom and always willingness to help  put first  100 million and then  200 million into the appropriations bill for housing counseling organizations who can provide this help  At a cost of as little at a few hundred dollars per borrower  housing counselors can prevents foreclosure that result in economic loss of  227 000  direct and indirect on average  This is a highly cost effective investment  We urge the Administration not to veto this emergency funding when the Senate passes it  If it s vetoed and this crisis gets worse  a portion of the blame  a good portion  will be at the President s doorstep  plain and simple  So I hope the President will not veto it    Most everyone who has looked at this legislation says it s needed  If we can do these three things  FHA reform  temporarily lifting the portfolio caps imposed on Fannie and Freddie  and providing critical funding for nonprofit housing counselors  we can evade the mortgage crisis and we can get our country focused on moving economically and on so many other problems that face us  Mr  President  I yield the floor
