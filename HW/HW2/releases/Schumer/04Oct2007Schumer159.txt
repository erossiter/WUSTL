IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 4  2007 As Advisory Board Convenes To Review Bethlehem Steel Workers  Radiation Exposure Case  Schumer Urges Niosh To Stop Dragging Its Feet And Declare A New Class In The Special Exposure Cohort                                                                                                                                                                                                                      A Vote In Favor Of New SEC Designation Would Finally Compensate Former Workers Governmental Errors Punish Lackawanna s Cold War Heroes by Inadequately Assessing Radiation Exposure  Understating Risks Experienced by Bethlehem Steel Workers Schumer Testifies To Urge Board To Scrap Flawed Compensation Calculation  Add SEC Class To Get Benefits To Former Steel Workers As Quickly As Possible With the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  Advisory Board meeting today to review Bethlehem Steel Workers radiation exposure case  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer submitted testimony to the NIOSH Advisory Board  urging them to declare the workers a new class under the Special Exposure Cohort  Schumer charged that radiation risks experienced by former Lackawanna Bethlehem Steel employees are understated because of flawed methods in reconstructing their exposure to radiation   During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  workers at Bethlehem Steel handled high levels of radioactive materials but were given little or no protection  Years later  many have developed cancer and other radiation related illnesses    some have already died    It is time to acknowledge that the Simonds data cannot provide a sufficiently accurate approximation of the conditions at Bethlehem Steel  said Senator Schumer  Too many Bethlehem Steel employees  our Cold War heroes  have been denied benefits through government errors   Currently  NIOSH compensates former nuclear workers by calculating their exposure to radiation  and using that to decide how probable it is that their diseases are caused by their work for the Department of Energy  However  due to an absence of detailed records on former employees who worked with the radioactive materials  the government has utilized the Simonds data to calculate Bethlehems conditions  The Simonds numbers inadequately assess radiation exposure for Bethlehem employees and may understate risks experienced by Bethlehem steel workers  As a result  lots of men were made sick by the DoE  but are now being denied compensation because NIOSHs system makes it look as if the DoE is not responsible for their cancers   In his testimony submitted to NIOSHs Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  Schumer called for NIOSH to stop dose reconstructions for Bethlehem workers because of the lack of data  and for the agency to declare the site a class of the SEC  like the one being implemented at Rocky Flats  Colorado  Rocky Flats employees petition to become a class was granted because there were inadequate data to perform dose reconstructions   The Bethlehem records do not include length of employment  locations  or duties  let alone details such as the radiation levels in various parts of the plant  the level of uranium powder in the air  or any other critical metrics that are necessary for a valid dose reconstruction  Schumer today argued that accurately replicating all of these factors by using the conditions at Simonds is not possible   Instead  Schumer called on the Advisory Board to declare a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  for Lackawanna Bethlehem Steel employees whose radiation doses would have to be reconstructed with approximate data  The Board has already declared such a cohort in the Colorado case  Previous efforts to reconstruct radiation dose exposures at Bethlehem Steel had relied on proxy data from Simonds Saw and Steel Company in Lockport   During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help  Workers at these facilities  including several in Western  New York  handled high levels of radioactive materials  Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer   Tragically  though their hard work saved our nation from violence  America still has wounded veterans of the Cold War  These sickened energy workers have borne the weight of injury that they spared the rest of the nation  They are fallen heroes of the Cold War  and deserve to be treated with the dignity and veneration that a great nation always affords its wounded warriors  It is the least that we can do to fully compensate them for these terrible illnesses which they have contracted through service to their country  Schumer added   Senator Schumer has aggressively worked to get aid for former nuclear workers in Western  New York  In June  Schumer wrote a personal letter to Paul L  Ziemer  Chairman of NIOSHs Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  calling for a stop in the methods used to analyze health risks  and for the agency to declare an SEC like the one being implemented at Rocky Flats  Colorado  Last month  he wrote to Dr  Julie Gerberding  the head of the CDC  of which NIOSH is a branch  He asked that the process for review applications be made speedier  because many sick workers are dying before their review is complete  In these cases  their families are denied compensation because of the governments slow response   In an effort to compensate these workers  Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allowed them to file claims with the Department of Labor for individual payments of  150 000 and other benefits for medical treatments  Workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease  or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War III and the Cold War were eligible    Finally  many of the men and women who are awaiting compensation from by this program are aging and unwell  Time is  unfortunately  of the essence now  For these workers  justice delayed will be justice denied  Please move with all due haste to establish compensate our fallen heroes  said Schumer     Below is Schumers complete testimony submitted to the Advisory Board    Thank you for the opportunity to address this Board on the petition of the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna  New York  I appreciate this chance share my views with you  and I am going to take this moment to again urge you to add a class to the Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  for these former nuclear workers   At its last meeting  the Board decided to delay any decision on Bethlehems petition until a working group makes its recommendation regarding the appropriate limitations on the use of surrogate data in site profiles  Although I am disappointed by the delay  I remain optimistic that the working groups efforts will bring clarity to a process that until now has felt arbitrary and at times capricious  I firmly believe that a policy that establishes limitations on surrogate data  rather than the current ad hoc decision making process  will lead to a favorable decision on Bethlehems petition  Any reasonable limits on the use of surrogate data would fall well below the excessive level at which it is employed in Bethlehem Steels profile   While I do not dispute the usefulness of surrogate data in limited circumstances  over reliance on it  as in the case of Bethlehem Steel  is unacceptable  As I and many others have expressed repeatedly  the inordinately heavy reliance on surrogate data in Bethlehems site profile renders the profile unusable  It is not a reliable representation of the plants real conditions  Under the circumstances  the Board should void the site profile  release the CDC from its futile attempts at dose reconstruction  and declare the employees of Lackawanna Bethlehem Steel a new class to the Special Exposure Cohort   The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program was established to repay  in some small measure  the America s debt to these former energy workers  Their work was critical to building the nuclear arsenal that brought the Soviet Union to its knees  keeping the Cold War from erupting into a hot war which could have killed thousands upon thousands of people    Tragically  though their hard work saved our nation from violence  America still has wounded veterans of the Cold War  These sickened energy workers have borne the weight of injury that they spared the rest of the nation  They are fallen heroes of the Cold War  and deserve to be treated with the dignity and veneration that a great nation always affords its wounded warriors  It is the least that we can do to fully compensate them for these terrible illnesses which they have contracted through service to their country   Finally  many of the men and women who are awaiting compensation from by this program are aging and unwell  Time is  unfortunately  of the essence now  For these workers  justice delayed will be justice denied  Please move with all due haste to establish compensate our fallen heroes
