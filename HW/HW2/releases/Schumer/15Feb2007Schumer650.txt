IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 15  2007 Schumer  Freshmen Senators Unveil New Tax Cut Package For Middle Class                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Democrats To Focus On Middle Class Tax Cuts Instead of Tax Breaks for Wealthy   Will be Central Issue in 2008   The Middle Class Opportunity Act of 2007 Would Provide Targeted Tax Relief At Key Phases Of A Family s Life   Package Includes Two Years of AMT Relief and Simplification of Education Tax Incentives Today Senators Charles E  Schumer  Sherrod Brown  Bob Casey  Amy Klobuchar  Claire McCaskill  Jon Tester  and Sheldon Whitehouse introduced the  Middle Class Opportunity Act of 2007  which will provide tax relief for middle class families to help them manage the crunch in balancing work and family  save for their retirements  and achieve their aspirations   This legislation is designed to accomplish four primary goals  help parents start a family  help families avoid unfair tax penalties  help families send kids to college  and help families care for their aging parents  The Act would provide approximately  80 billion of tax relief over four years  2007 2010   above the one year of AMT relief in the President s budget        The years of favoring the wealthy and big oil companies are over   said Senator Schumer   This bill makes good on our promise to provide real relief for middle class families  Everyone should be able to afford a house  raise a family  help their kids get ahead with a college education  and care for their elderly parents without having to take on a second job or extra shifts        The Middle Class Opportunity Act has four components      Helping families with young children via a doubling of the child tax credit in the first year and expansion of the dependent care tax credit   Helping families avoid unfair tax penalties by providing relief from the individual AMT   Helping families send kids to college via the simplification  consolidation  and expansion of the various tax benefits for higher education  and  Helping families care for their aging parents through a new elder care credit         Corporate driven myopia on our economic policies has favored the wealthiest one percent for too long  These tax cuts are an important first step toward directing policies in Washington that support our nation s middle class   said Senator Brown        For too long  our tax policy has benefited the top one percent more than the middle class   said Senator Casey    With rising health care costs  energy costs  education costs  and an encroaching AMT tax increase  we must act now to provide much needed tax relief for the middle class         Our proposal offers real solutions that that will make a real difference in the pocketbooks and wallets of working families   said Senator Klobuchar    It puts the interests of the middle class front and center  and it does so in a fiscally responsible and appropriate manner         For the past six years the President has cut taxes for millionaires and as a result  corporate executives are making out like bandits by way of economic growth limited to Wall Street while the rest of us still feel the squeeze   Senator McCaskill said   The middle class is the real engine that drives our economy  It s time we reroute those tax cuts to give the middle class a break in a way that helps fuel our economy for all Americans         The vibrant middle class that made this country great has been abandoned  said Senator Tester   We need legislation that will help folks that are struggling to pay for health care  putting kids through school  taking care of an aging parent  or maybe all three   This bill does just that and it s the kind of policy that the people of Montana sent me here to support            Working American families know they re not getting the help they need to get by   This administration s response   Cut taxes for millionaires   Senator Whitehouse said    We have a better idea   This bill put extra money in middle class families  pockets when they need it the most  when a child is born or starts college  or when a family makes the choice to care for an aging parent   That s common sense tax relief  and I m proud to support it         The engine of the economy is the middle class and when they succeed  America prospers  These tax cuts will help middle class families get ahead and attain the basic levels of wealth and security that they deserve   said Anne Kim of Third Way  who worked with the Senate offices to develop the tax cut package       Middle class families are struggling to get ahead while juggling the expenses of childcare  sending kids to college  and taking care of elderly parents  The following components of the bill are designed to provide middle class families with the tax relief necessary to help them overcome these financial hurdles  achieve their aspirations and manage the balance between work and family      Doubling the Child Tax Credit in the First Year   Middle class families spend an average of  20 000 on a newborn child before he or she turns two  This bill would double the child tax credit to  2 000 in the first year of a child s life  or in the first year after a child is adopted  to help parents defray the expenses of a new baby        Expansion of Dependent Care Tax Credit  DCTC    The bill would extend the Dependent Care Tax Credit to cover 35 percent of qualified childcare expenses for families earning up to  75 000        Relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax   Under current law  families with incomes between  75 000 and  100 000 are in danger of falling under the AMT for the first time in 2008  sticking more than 20 million taxpayers with an average tax increase of  1 000  This bill would extend AMT relief through 2008 to prevent these families from falling under the AMT       Higher Education Tax Relief   This bill will help cut through the confusion that parents face when trying to pay for college by consolidating the three major tax deductions and credits for higher education into one easy to understand tax credit that will cover tuition  fees  and even textbooks   The credit can be used for undergraduate or graduate education  saving middle class families up to  2 500 per student      Caring for Aging Parents   Under current law  only families who have elderly parents living with them are eligible to claim the dependent care tax credits    This bill would allow families to claim the dependent care tax credit or the earnings exclusion under a dependent care assistance program for qualified dependent care expenses paid on behalf of an aging parent who does not live with the family   Given that nearly half of caregivers contribute financially this care  this would save families an average of  200 per month
