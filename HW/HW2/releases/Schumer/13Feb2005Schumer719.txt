                                    Senator Urges Bush to Work with Democrats to Craft   Common Sense Solution for Social Security    In National Radio Address  Schumer Highlights Increase in Birth Tax and New Privatization Tax Contained in Bush Privatization Scheme Schumer Radio Address Text As Delivered Below    Good morning  I  m Senator Chuck Schumer from New York State  I want to take a few moments this morning to talk to you about Social Security       I was born in 1950  Back then  half of all Americans over 65 lived in poverty  Today  that number is less than one in ten  Social Security is the biggest reason for this dramatic turnaround  I think we can all agree that the program has been a great success  Our goal  as Democrats  is to keep Social Security the way it is with as few changes as possible  while still making sure it is there for future generations        For this to happen  some changes will need to be made  The question is  what sort of changes  Does Social Security need fine tuning  as most Democrats believe  or does it need to be replaced with something completely different  as the President wants to do       Unfortunately  the President  s plan to privatize the system is not the answer  In fact  members of BOTH parties   most Democrats and many Republicans   think it  s a bad idea from the start  It actually makes the underlying problems of Social Security more difficult to solve  and it will add trillions to the national debt  which will slow our economy and put future generations in a bigger financial hole       I want to explain a few of the reasons why we believe the President  s plan is the wrong approach       First  the President  s private accounts do nothing to solve Social Security  s long term financial problems  Even Administration officials concede this point        Let me explain why this is the case  According to the Social Security Administration  Social Security will be able to pay full benefits until at least the year 2042  With the President  s private accounts  it would only be able to pay full benefits through 2031  In other words  private accounts shorten the life of the Social Security Trust Fund by 11 years  This is because current payroll taxes that would otherwise go to pay benefits are instead diverted to private accounts  It  s simple math   you can  t use the same dollars for two different things       The second reason that the President  s plan is misguided is that he wants to slash your benefits in two major ways       The first benefit cut involves something called   price indexing     The way it works is that the younger you are today  the more this will slash your initial Social Security benefit  That  s bad news   especially for young Americans who are just entering the workforce       The second benefit cut is far more insidious because it  s more hidden  We call it the   privatization tax     It  s the additional amount of your promised Social Security benefit that you lose as a result of having set up your private account       Now you might say    What do you mean  I thought the private account was mine to keep     And it  s true  you DO get to keep what  s in your account  minus the administrative fees  But what the President doesn  t tell you is this  Your guaranteed Social Security benefit will be reduced by whatever amount you have contributed to your account plus some interest        Another way of saying this is that the private account only helps you if you earn an annual rate of return on your investments that exceeds the rate of inflation plus three percent  If you invest poorly  or the market drops right before you retire   you  ll be far worse off than under the current system       To make up for both benefit cuts  and get as much as you would under current law  you would have to earn a very significant return   which also means taking on more investment risk   and that is a risky proposition       And there  s one more important reason that we  re opposed to the President  s plan  It increases your birth tax   the amount of debt that is laid on the shoulders of each newborn child  The birth tax is already high enough  but the President  s plan adds almost  17 000 to every child  s birth tax  because it adds nearly  5 trillion in new debt over the first 20 years       It is morally irresponsible to be passing such a huge birth tax to future generations  All of this borrowing will eventually have to be repaid with interest  just like a home mortgage or a personal credit card       Democrats are eager to work with President Bush to solve the Social Security problem  We share his goal to make the program financially sound  but the way to do it is not by creating a new privatization tax and increasing the birth tax for every American        If the President wants our support and the support of the country  he should stop advocating change based on ideology  He should scrap his privatization proposal and start working in bipartisan way towards a common sense solution        If he does that  Democrats in Congress will work with him  he  ll be able to pass a reform bill with big bipartisan majorities  And most importantly  Social Security will still be there not only for us  but for our children and grandchildren and future generations       This has been New York Senator Chuck Schumer  Thank you for listening and have a good day
