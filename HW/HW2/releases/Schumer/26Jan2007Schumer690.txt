IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 26  2007 Schumer Calls On US Attorney General To Personally Step In To Resolve Remaining Issues So Shared Border Management Can Move Forward Once And For All                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             With the FBI Having Jurisdiction over Key Law Enforcement Issues at Border Crossings  Schumer Calls on AG Gonzales to Personally Intervene and Meet with Top Canadian Officials to Resolve Outstanding Issues Including Fingerprinting   Schumer  There is Room to Make a Deal that Works for All Sides    But We Must Have Key Leaders Engaged Now U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking him to personally intervene in the Shared Border Management negotiations   Schumer  who has long led the fight to institute shared border management  recently lobbied with both Canadian Security Minister Stockwell Day and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to stay focused until a deal is done  Schumer said that any and all outstanding issues  including fingerprinting at the border checkpoint  must be resolved by the appropriate agencies and that  in order to keep recent momentum going  the talks must stay at the highest levels of the departments involved        The reason we have seen progress these last weeks is because the top dogs have been talking     Schumer said    And the only way to keep the momentum going is if it stays that way   There is no doubt that the remaining issues will be difficult to resolve but there is room to make a deal and the only way to do that is to have key players engaged now   The difficulty getting to the finish line has certainly been frustrating  but the discussions are now at the principal level where they must stay until a final agreement has been hammered out         Schumer said that one of the last major remaining issues concerns developing a protocol for travelers coming from Canada who decide not to cross the border after their primary inspection   U S  practice is to require these travelers to be fingerprinted  but Canadian law prevents border guards from fingerprinting these travelers         Once it was thought that guns were an insurmountable barrier  at other times people felt the same about information sharing and arrest protocols  but as each government has focused on the details  agreement has been forged  Why  Because Shared Border Management will be a boon to both nations  With the ongoing participation from Minister Day and Secretary Chertoff and now Gonzalez  I know we can do the same for the remaining issues     said Schumer        In just the last month  through dialogue facilitated by Schumer  Canadian and U S  officials have successfully resolved issues relating to arming border guards  cooperative policing  information gathering and collecting  and arrest procedures  concerns that had bogged down progress for years  Schumer said that the next month will be a critical time for ensuring that Shared Border Management can become a reality       In his letter  Schumer wrote    To find a resolution  shared border management must be handled at the highest levels of government  and thus I respectfully ask that you both facilitate talks between Secretary Chertoff  Minister Day and any other relevant officials and become involved on behalf of the Department of Justice as necessary          Schumer has led the charge to bring the U S  and Canadian governments together  lobbying them for years to develop a joint customs and border management plan for Northern Border crossings  Last week  Schumer met with Stockwell Day in his Washington DC office and spoke with Chertoff personally  In September 2006  Schumer announced a new deal between U S  and Canadian officials that would allow Canadian officers to carry weapons at the check point  In December 2004  Schumer  along with Former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge  announced the initial agreement between the US and Canada to pursue the shared border management model        The shared border management plan will serve as a model for moving people and commerce securely and efficiently across the U S  Canadian border  Negotiations continue almost two years since U S  and Canadian officials first announced the plans to make shared border management a reality       Under the agreement between the U S  and Canadian governments  it was determined that there would be two pilot sites for the plan at the Peace Bridge and Alexandria Bay  Under a shared border management plan  all of the U S  and Canadian border facilities are located on one side of the border  The pilot at the Peace Bridge will involve the re location of all U S  primary and secondary border operations for both commercial and passenger traffic from Buffalo to Fort Erie  and in Alexandria Bay  Canadian border functions will be moved to the Watertown side of the border
