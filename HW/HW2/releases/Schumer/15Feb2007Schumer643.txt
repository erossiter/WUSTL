IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 15  2007 Schumer Urges NFL to Rework Buffalo Bills 2007 2008 Schedule to Deliver a  No Blackout Season    Rochester Fans Deserve to See the Team They Love Every Week                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Last Year the Bills Accounted for More than Half of All Blacked Out Games  Playing Too Many Games Against Lower Draw Teams Late in the Season Was a Factor   Senator Lauds NFL and Commissioner Goodell for Willingness to Shape  08 Schedule   Schumer  Rochester Residents Shouldn t Be Left Out in the Cold at the End of the Season Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer asked National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell to arrange the 2007 2008 Buffalo Bills schedule so that it will greatly lower the risk of blackouts   Last year  four Bills games were blacked out because the team failed to sell out  preventing thousands of fans in Rochester from watching the end of this season   The NFL blackout rule hurts Rochester residents who would be forced to drive more than one hour each way in the dead of winter just to the see their team if the game isn t televised        Last year  thousands of Rochester area Bill s fans couldn t see the team they love because the last games of the season were blacked out   Schumer said   Rochester fans are just as passionate for the Bills as fans in Buffalo  and they deserve to see the games   It is in the best interests of the Bills and the NFL to have to the widest possible fan base for this team  The NFL needs to do everything it can to prevent blackouts next season        Last month  when Schumer met face to face with Goodell  Schumer raised the issue of blackouts and their detrimental effect on fans in the Rochester area   Goodell responded positively and pledged to work with Senator Schumer and the bills to help shape the schedule to lessen the possibility of blackouts   Last year  four of the seven blacked out games in all of the NFL were Bills games        I am pleased that the NFL and Commissioner Goodell understand the situation and promised to work with the Bills so the maximum number of fans across upstate New York can watch the team they love   Schumer added       Schumer attributed the rise in blacked out games to the fact that the Bills played 4 home games late in the year against teams that turned out to be less than optimal draws   Because the Bills had seemingly slipped from the playoff race and were facing less popular or talented teams  the Bills failed to draw the requisite number of fans in order to have the games broadcast on network television   In order for Rochester fans to attend games  they have to drive one hour plus each way in sometimes inclement and dangerous weather   Meaning  if the games are blacked out and the drive is difficult  thousands of fans cannot watch the game at all  As the Bills slipped from the playoff race  they failed to sell out which triggered the hated blackouts   Schumer noted that the Bills have one of the largest stadiums and one of the smallest markets in the NFL       The Buffalo Bills have a devoted fan base in Rochester and the surrounding area and conduct their training camp in nearby St  John Fisher College      In 2007 the Bills are scheduled to play home games against the New York Jets  New York Giants  Dallas Cowboys  New England Patriots  Baltimore Ravens  Denver Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals  Neither the weeks when the Bills will play at home nor the order in which they will play each of these teams has been determined  The final schedule will be set in April       In his letter  Schumer said  Teams like the Jets  Giant and Cowboys are historic rivals that have strong fan bases throughout the country and in western New York  The Patriots  I don t have to tell you  seem to make it to the Super Bowl every year   If the Bills can play teams like these late in the season  we will better set the stage for them to ensure sell out crowds and prevent blackouts        Schumer has led the fight to keep the Bills in Western New York and is working with top NFL officials to craft a revenue sharing agreement that is fair to the Bills and small market teams across the country   Following an April 2006 meeting with Ralph Wilson in Buffalo  Schumer has spearheaded the campaign to produce fair NFL revenue sharing rules so that the Bills can remain financial healthy and located in Buffalo  Schumer worked closely with Commissioner Tagliabue and is now working with Commissioner Goodell to communicate the small market teams  point of view as negotiations around implementing the new Collective Bargaining Agreement proceed         Last year  Schumer lobbied outgoing NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to ensure the league s Qualifier Committee  which determines many critical revenue sharing issues  included representatives from small market franchises  On April 21  after a meeting organized by Schumer with Tagliabue and Buffalo native Tim Russert  Tagliabue announced that Bills owner Ralph Wilson would serve on the eight team committee that is now determining how league revenues will be split
