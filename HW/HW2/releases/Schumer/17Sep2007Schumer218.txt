IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 17  2007 Schumer Reveals  Thousands Of Section 8 Housing Payments For Upstate Ny Seniors And Low Income Residents Left Unpaid This Summer  Leaving New York s Most Vulnerable Holding The Bag                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Under Project Based Section 8  HUD Reimburses Housing Providers for Operational Costs   Including Mortgage Payments  Staffing  Utilities  Routine Maintenance  and Insurance Schumer  Thousands of Housing Units throughout Upstate NY Have Not Yet Received Their August Checks Schumer warns HUD s Delay in Funding Endangers Livelihood of Thousands of Elderly and Low Income Ne Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  has been financially starving New York State housing providers of reimbursement checks for weeks and will be unable to fully fund them through the rest of 2007  As of September 5th  49 separate buildings across Upstate NY covering 2816 individual units had not received their monthly checks for August  which they are supposed to receive on August 1 as of September 5  The withheld funds  which help pay for mortgage payments  staffing  utilities  routine maintenance  and insurance  have jeopardized living conditions for thousands of the states seniors and low income citizens living under HUDs Section 8 project based rental assistance program  The program is designed to enable low income seniors and families to live in safe  secure housing they could not otherwise afford    Its unconscionable that HUD would be so haphazard in its operations to jeopardize the living conditions of thousands of New Yorks most vulnerable residents  said Senator Schumer  Today  Im calling on HUD to immediately release the withheld funds so housing units across the state will no longer be starved and can provide their tenants with top notch accommodations   Already  HUD has shortchanged New York States senior and low income housing providers  In August  only 48   or 613 out of 1 271 of bills were paid on time to housing suppliers  leaving section 8 buildings to wait weeks before receiving their reimbursements  Furthermore  8 percent of housing suppliers had still not received their checks by the conclusion of August  This spiked from 4  in July when 47 bills had gone unpaid   In total  HUD is currently behind on payments for 49 buildings across Upstate New York covering 2816 units  Including    9 buildings in the Capital Region with 526 units      4 buildings in Central New York with 478 units      3 building in Rochester Finger Lakes with 264 units      14 buildings in the Hudson Valley with 827 units      1 building in the North Country with 50 units      6 buildings in the Southern Tier with 189 units      12 buildings in Western New York with 482 units     HUDs Section 8 project based rental assistance program enables low income tenants  many of whom are seniors  to live in safe and affordable housing  By contract with HUD under the Section 8 program  housing providers receive monthly payments from HUD that allows them to meet operational costs such as  mortgage payments  staffing  utilities  routine maintenance  and insurance  Under the terms of the Section 8 contract  the rental subsidy does not permit eligible housing providers to amass a large financial reserve to cover these costs over an extended period  Therefore  non profit housing providers operate on very tight budgets and have minimal resources to cover their obligations    However  HUD this year underestimated its yearly funding needs for the Section 8 program  leaving senior and low income housing communities to experience either late payments or no monthly payments at all  Schumer today revealed that HUD has been unable to fully fund Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments  HAP  contracts with anniversary dates in the last quarter of FY07    Schumer today warned that that the non payment of subsidies is a disincentive for property owners to continue to participate in the Section 8 program  which provides stable housing to low income families throughout NYS  Schumer also expressed concern thatthe problem will continue throughout the year and could grow worse due to HUD woefully underestimating its annual funding for the program    Its absurd that New York residents should suffer due to HUDs lack of foresight and miscalculations when it comes making sure these buildings receive the proper funding they need to make sure their tenants live in comfort  added Schumer    In a letter to HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson  Schumer and other Democrats on the Banking Committee called on the federal agency to reverse course and find a way to fulfill its financial obligations under the program and to preserve the viability of supportive senior housing and low income communities across New York State    Schumer urged HUD to take immediate action to fund all property owners under their HAP contracts  and to let Congress know as soon as possible if the agency does not have sufficient funds to make these payments  In addition  he called on HUD to provide to the Committee the following   1  the dollar amount necessary to fully fund  12 months  all expiring contracts in FY08   2  the dollar amount necessary to fund all contracts through FY08  and  3  the amount of the shortfall for FY07   Schumer wrote  Such funding disruptions are a serious breach of the commitment to honor the contracts between the federal government and the owners of these properties  More importantly  the intended beneficiaries  low income elderly and families living in these properties   are at risk of losing their homes
