IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 1  2005 Schumer Secures Refunds For Long Island High School Students Left Out In The Cold On Trip To Washington For Inauguration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Virginia travel agent that sold misleading tour packages to at least two LI schools today offered Lindenhurst High  250 student refund and Holy Trinity Diocesan High  180 student   Long Island high school students had worked months to pay for trip to Inaugural  only to be kept out until event was over   Students  teachers and parents from both schools joined Schumer Friday to seek US Attorney inve US Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today that the Virginia based travel agent WorldStridesTM today offered Hicksville  s Holy Trinity Diocesan High School and Lindenhurst High School students partial refunds for their trips to Washington  On Friday  students  teachers and parents of from the two high schools joined the Senator at Holy Trinity to ask the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate complaints that the company charged students for trips to Washington to experience the Inauguration  but did not make provisions to obtain the tickets necessary to actually attend the inauguration         It  s good news that the students are getting some of their money back  but we shouldn  t have had to make a federal case out of it    literally    to get a refund for kids who got ripped off     Schumer said       On Inauguration Day  Schumer personally encountered a group of students from Holy Trinity Diocesan High School in Hicksville on the National Mall  The 48 students were just then getting through security  more than an hour and a half after the start of the Inauguration and long after it was over  After the students told Schumer their story  he was able to work with the White House and arrange a consolation prize of sorts   a White House tour  Unfortunately  the Holy Trinity students could not take the tour because they had to return to New York in advance of last weekend s blizzard       Schumer then became suspicious of a pattern of problems when he learned of a similar story last week from Lindenhurst High students  Last Thursday  Schumer s Long Island office received a call from the Advanced Placement US History teacher at Lindenhurst High School in Suffolk County  He reported that his 38 students had raised money for almost a year to help offset the  800 per student price tag on a  once in a lifetime  trip to Washington to   witness the Inauguration and to hear the Inaugural Address     On Inauguration day  they arrived early to get through the security checkpoint  Two and a half hours later  the students cleared security but were then told by security that they could not enter the National Mall without tickets  Their tour guide did not have any answers  and merely brought the students to stand outside the Canadian Embassy where they neither witnessed the Inauguration  nor heard the Presidential Address  The company has thus far refused the school s request for a partial refund       Schumer  s office quickly investigated and found the same Virginia travel agent sold misleading tour packages to both schools  WorldStridesTM promotional materials say the company is devoted to  Enriching Students  Lives  by extending education into the worldwide classroom and providing the best opportunity for learning through seeing  experiencing  and interacting  They also call themselves   A Company You Can Trust    and the   largest and most trusted educational student travel company in the country      http   www worldstride com mission default asp        Schumer referred the case to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York  Roslynn Mauskopf and to the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission  Deborah Platt Majoras on Friday  Because this Virginia company appears to have wronged students in New York  this interstate matter falls under the jurisdiction of both authorities        Earlier today  the Virginia based travel agent WorldStridesTM offered Lindenhurst High School students refunds of  250 per student  which the student  s teacher said they will accept  The company also offered Holy Trinity Diocesan School in Hicksville refunds of  180 per student  which were also accepted  Both of these offers reflect a refund of 31  of the schools   original per student costs       Schumer also urged any other schools or students affected by this situation to contact his Long Island office at 631 753 0978
