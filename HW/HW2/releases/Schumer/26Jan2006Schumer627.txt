IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 26  2006 Schumer  Salazar Call On Gonzales To Appoint A Special Counsel In Abramoff Scandal

                                   With Abramoff Scandal Reaching Deep into Administration and Republican Leadership on Capitol Hill  a Special Counsel Would Be More Independently Able to Examine Wrongdoing than Bush Appointed Justice Department Officials   Avoidance of the Appearance of Impropriety Crucial in Sensitive Investigation Like This One   DOJ Prosecutor in Charge of Abramoff Case Was Just Nominated to Be a Judge  Makes Appointment of New Special Counsel Even More Timely and Necessary   Revelations of the President  s Recent Photos with Political Friend and Republican Donor Raise More Questions about the Scope of Abramoff  s Reach into Bush Administration Today U S  Senators Charles Schumer and Ken Salazar sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking him to appoint a special counsel to continue the investigation into and prosecution of the Jack Abramoff corruption scandal  Schumer called for a similar special counsel to head the investigation into the White House leak of a covert CIA operative and persisted until Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed in 2003  Sen  Salazar served as the former Attorney General in Colorado from 1998 2004  The scope of the Republican centered Abramoff scandal is still growing  and it is clear that there are so many officials in and around the White House and Congress are involved  Continuing the investigation and prosecution under a special counsel would ensure that it would proceed without favor or fear of reprisal within the Administration        Yesterday the White House nominated Noel Hillman  the career prosecutor at the Justice Department in charge of the Abramoff case  to be a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals  Mr  Hillman  s departure at this time makes the appointment of an independent  special counsel even more necessary and appropriate       Schumer said    With public trust in government at very low levels  it is crucial that we remove any appearance of impropriety from the investigation of the Abramoff scandal by appointing a special counsel who is independent of the Bush Administration and the current Justice Department          Salazar stated    As a former Attorney General I believe in upholding the law and rooting out corruption  The American people deserve an open  unbiased investigation into this matter  Appointing a special counsel will begin the process of restoring America  s faith in government          The letter to Gonzales is below      January 26  2006      The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  United States Department of Justice   950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530      Dear General Gonzales       We write to ask you to appoint a special counsel to continue the investigation and the prosecution of those involved in the corruption scandal surrounding Jack Abramoff  s dealings with the federal government  This scandal has shaken the public  s confidence in our government and all involved must be pursued vigorously  A special counsel will ensure the public  s confidence in the investigation and prosecution and help to restore its faith in our government  FBI officials have said the Abramoff investigation   involves systemic corruption within the highest levels of government     Such an assertion indicates extraordinary circumstances and it is in the public interest that you act under your existing authority to appoint a special counsel        Mr  Abramoff  s significant ties to Republican leadership in Congress  and allegations of improper activity involving Administration officials  reaching  possibly  into the White House itself  pose a possible conflict of interest for the Department and thus further warrant the appointment of a special counsel  Recent news reports confirm that Mr  Abramoff met the President on several occasions and during some of those meetings  Mr  Abramoff and his family had their photos taken with the President  Mr  Abramoff also organized at least one and possibly several meetings with White House staff for his clients  These meetings with the President and White House staff occurred while you were serving as White House Counsel  Given the possible ties between Mr  Abramoff and senior government officials  we believe the appointment of a special counsel is not only justified  but necessary       The Public Integrity section of the Department has thus far pursued this case appropriately  and we applaud its pursuit of Mr  Abramoff and his colleagues  As the investigation turns to government officials and their staffs  both in the Executive and Legislative branches  we have no doubt that if the investigation is left to the career prosecutors in that section  the case would reach its appropriate conclusion  Unfortunately  the highly political context of the allegations and charges may lead some to surmise that political influence may compromise the investigation  This concern is heightened by allegations that Frederick Black  the former acting U S  Attorney for Guam and the Northern Marianas  was replaced  perhaps improperly  as a result of his investigation of Mr  Abramoff       Because this investigation is vital to restoring the public  s faith in its government  any appearance of bias  special favor or political consideration would be a further blow to our democracy  Appointment of a special counsel would ensure that the investigation and prosecution will proceed without fear or favor and provide the public with full confidence that no one in this country is above the law        We know you share our commitment to restoring the public  s trust in our government  We hope you will take the only appropriate action here and appoint a special counsel so we can ensure that justice is done while preserving the integrity of the Justice Department       We look forward to hearing from you on this matter soon        Sincerely       Chuck Schumer   Ken Salazar
