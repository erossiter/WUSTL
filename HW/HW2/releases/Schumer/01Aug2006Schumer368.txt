IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 1  2006 Schumer  Gianaris  Gioia  Vallone  Queens Businesses Must Get Full Restitution From Con Ed

                                 Federal  State and City Loan Programs Cannot Meet Profound Business Losses   Schumer  Who Got Con Ed Tens of Millions to Get Back on their Feet Following 9 11  Says Now Con Ed Must Deliver for New York In light of the crushing losses faced by Queens businesses as a result of last week  s power outages  today Senator Charles E  Schumer  along with Assemblyman Michael Gianaris and Councilmen Eric Gioia and Peter Vallone called on Consolidated Edison to provide full restitution to the businesses effected  Con Ed is only offering up to 7 000 dollars for businesses effected by the blackouts to pay for the loss of perishable goods  such as food  Schumer  who fought to get Con Ed tens of millions of dollars to help pay for infrastructure damage following September 11th  said today that Con Ed should deliver for New York  especially since New York was so helpful to Con Ed when it needed assistance          It  s time that Con Ed prove that they put their customers first     Senator Charles E  Schumer said    For a business that was shut down for 10 days and lost food  equipment and other necessities  7 000 dollars will barely make a dent  When Con Ed was in need  New York and America delivered for them  it  s time they do the same            The economy of western Queens at this moment is hanging by a thread   said Assemblymember Michael Gianaris  D Astoria   Our proposal to Kevin Burke is the least he can do to begin making up for the massive damage caused by Con Ed s blackout  Anything less continues to show that Con Ed is not interested in getting western Queens back on its feet          The people and businesses of Queens desperately need help   said Councilman Eric Gioia  who represents Woodside  Sunnyside  Long Island City  Astoria  and Maspeth in the New York City Council   Small businesses are the backbone of our City s economy  especially here in Queens  and for them  this wasn t just a loss of power  this was a loss of profit  The losses we incurred are nothing short of devastating  and Con Ed needs to step up  do the right thing  and get our residents and our businesses back on their feet  Queens deserves no less           People lost wages  income  equipment  and over a week of their lives  They stood on line like refugees waiting for necessities     said Councilman Peter Vallone Jr   It is laughable that Con Ed thinks 350 dollars for perishables is reimbursement  Both residents and businesses should be fully reimbursed  There are businesses that still haven  t been able to re open  Con Ed must be held accountable           Following the blackout  Con Ed offered business owners 7 000 dollars in reimbursement to cover perishable goods  such as food that spoiled during the outage  which lasted up to ten days in some areas  The reimbursement did not cover any of the other expenses incurred  such as loss of equipment and loss of business  The legislators said today that instead of imposing an artificial cap of 7 000 dollars  Con Ed must allow businesses to take a thorough inventory of how much money they lost as a result of the power outage  and give full restitution to these businesses        Schumer said today these businesses should also take advantage of the available federal loan programs  but that these programs alone will not be able to meet the needs of the businesses who have lost so much  Businesses will be able to apply for Economic Injury Disaster Loans  EIDL  once the Small Business Administration declares the Queens blackout a disaster  For qualifying businesses  these loans can provide up to  1 5 million for businesses who suffered as a result of the power outages based on need and ability to get credit elsewhere  The interest rate on EIDL  s cannot exceed 4 percent per year and the term of these loans cannot exceed 30 years  Schumer said today that while the loans were a start  they would not be able to provide businesses with what they needed to get back on their feet  since they are loans with interest  and not grants          This is Con Ed  s fault  and storeowners shouldn  t face the prospect of more debt because of these blackouts     Schumer said         As part of the  20 billion package that Senator Schumer and others got for New York following September 11th  750 million of it was allocated to rebuild Lower Manhattan s destroyed telecommunications and energy infrastructure  The money was channeled through the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to help utilities like Con Ed rebuild destroyed power facilities  The money was provided to help prevent the utilities from having to pass rebuilding expenses onto New York s rate payers through long term rate increases  Of that allocation  Con Ed has already received  63 million and is likely to get over  300 million
