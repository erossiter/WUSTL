Designation Would Mean More Government Research Dollars  Jobs For Rochester and the Finger Lakes Region U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the Department of Homeland Security to designate Canandaigua  s Infotonics Technology Center as a Homeland Security Center of Excellence  Schumer  who has helped secure more than  25 million in federal funds for the facility  brought Bob Hooks  Deputy Director of the Office of Research and Development for Science   Technology to tour the center and learn first hand how Infotonics is qualified to fulfill the needs of DHS and serve as an invaluable regional  state  and national resource in strengthening homeland security          With scientists at Infotonics performing cutting edge research  Department of Homeland Security and Infotonics are a hand in glove fit     Schumer said    Infotonics specializes in the exact technology that Homeland Security has said is in critical need  This would be a win win for all of us  the nation gets top notch homeland security research and the region gets new jobs       Homeland Security Centers of Excellence are places of multi disciplinary research that bring together the nation  s best experts and focus its most talented researchers on a variety of threats that include agricultural  chemical  biological  nuclear and radiological  explosive and cyber terrorism as well as the behavioral aspects of terrorism        Schumer today touted the research and development by the world class team of academics  scientists and engineers at Infotonics which focuses on technology miniaturization  miniaturization of mechanical  optical  fluidic  and bio chemical systems to create silicon chip Microsystems capable of sensing  analyzing  making decisions  and communicating results  Infotonics is a not for profit Microsystems R and commercialization center with industry  university  and national lab partners  including  18 universities and colleges  Cornell Agriculture   Food Technology Park  three large company founders of the Infotonics Center which are Corning Inc  Eastman Kodak Company and Xerox Corporation  Rochester Regional Photonics Cluster  a consortium of 70

explosive  radiological  and nuclear threats  Furthermore  the Infotonics business model focuses on leveraging manufacturing  science and technology to successfully transition basic research to the marketplace  An investment by DHS in the proposed Center of Excellence for SMART SENSORS at Infotonics would be leveraged by  118M of matching funds already invested by industry   45M   New York State   43M  and federal agencies   30M  and allow Infotonics to further develop and market its Microsystem technology for immediate deployment in the field       Schumer also arranged for tours of Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Rochester  Both universities are performing cutting edge research with top flight scientists  Rochester Institute of Technology presented their current research on remote sensing programs  The University of Rochester promoted their research into bioterrorism  Both RIT and the University of Rochester are partners in the Infotonics Center of Excellence  Currently there are six DHS Centers of Excellence throughout the country  Johns Hopkins University  University of Southern California  Texas A University  University of Minnesota  University of Maryland  Michigan State University       Schumer was an early supporter of the idea that eventually led to the creation of the Infotonics Technology Center  Working with Eastman Kodak  Xerox  and Corning  Schumer promoted the concept and championed the first federal funding for the Infotonics Technology Center  To date  Schumer has helped secure more than  25 million for the center
