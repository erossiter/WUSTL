IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 19  2006 Schumer Reveals Tens Of Thousands Of Upstate NY Seniors Could Fall Into Medicare Drug Plan   Donut Hole       Increasing Their Costs 300 Percent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     At Least 77 000 Upstate New York Medicare Part D Recipients In Danger of Reaching Gap in Coverage  Shell Out Full Price for Prescriptions and Still Have to Pay Drug Plan Premiums   Senator to Push Legislation to Eliminate Premiums for Seniors Who Lose Coverage and Call on Insurers to Provide Coverage in the Gap in the Future   Schumer To Release Number of Medicare Part D Recipients In Each County U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that at least 77 000 seniors could see their out of pocket drug costs suddenly skyrocket by 300 percent because of a coverage gap in the Medicare drug plan   Unlike most other types of health insurance  the Medicare drug benefit was designed with a coverage gap  or   donut hole      Seniors enter the donut hole once their total drug costs have exceeded  2 250  and while in the donut hole they must pay for all of their drugs out of pocket  as well as continuing to pay the full monthly premium   Schumer announced new legislation to fill the gap in coverage  eliminate premiums for seniors while they are in the donut hole  and will call on insurers to provide plans without the donut hole in the future         This donut hole is going to hit upstate New York seniors like a ton of bricks     Schumer said     Seniors should not have the rug pulled out from under them when they are struggling to pay for the rising cost of prescription drugs   We need to do everything we can to ensure that all of upstate New York  s seniors have access to affordable prescription drugs and never have to chose between getting their medication and putting food on the table   This plan is not just a donut hole  it  s a black hole          The Medicare drug benefit s donut hole is one of many features of the new law that many members of Congress including Senator Schumer opposed from the outset   Under the current system  drug plans pay 75 percent of patients  drug costs between  250 and  2 250  but zero percent of the total costs between  2 250 and  5 100  with beneficiaries paying 100  of costs in the   donut hole      Coverage does not resume until the beneficiary s costs reach  5 100  leaving New York seniors to pay  2 850 in direct costs while in the donut hole       Once seniors fall in the donut hole  beneficiaries who had been paying  20 or  30 per month in co pays for their prescription medications will be forced to pay hundreds of dollars more   In addition  Schumer said that seniors in the donut hole get hit twice because they are forced to continue to pay their monthly premiums despite the lack of coverage       Schumer also warned that the donut hole occurs every year  and will likely expand each year   It is estimated that the size of the donut hole will grow from  2 850 in 2006 to  5 066 in 2013   In addition  rising prescription drug prices have compounded the issue of the donut hole  causing seniors to reach the  2 250 spending cap sooner   According to Families USA  a leading heath care consumer advocacy group  the median price increase for the 20 most prescribed drugs was 3 7 percent between November 2005 and April 2006       In a study done by the Kaiser Family Foundation  a non profit health care research organization  one in four Medicare drug plan beneficiaries will reach the donut hole this year  meaning that their total drug costs will be greater than  2 250 this year   Seniors across the country have already entered the donut hole this year  with the average senior who ends up reaching the donut hole hitting it in September        According for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  as of June 11  there were 486 371 upstate New Yorkers currently enrolled in the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit   Of those  at least 77 057 will reach the donut hole and have no coverage for their prescription drug costs   This is how those figures break out across upstate            Of the 162 489 Capital Region seniors currently enrolled in Medicare  45 704 are enrolled in Medicare Part D  of which at least 5 641 will fall in to the donut hole            Of the 153 910 Central New York seniors currently enrolled in Medicare  51 554 are enrolled in Medicare Part D  of which at least 6 940 will fall in to the donut hole            Of the 191 447 seniors living in the Rochester Finger Lakes region currently enrolled in Medicare  77 592 are enrolled in Medicare Part D  of which at least 12 910 will fall in to the donut hole            Of the 342 061 Hudson Valley seniors currently enrolled in Medicare  132 170 are enrolled in Medicare Part D  of which at least 21 108 will fall in to the donut hole            Of the 91 945 North Country seniors currently enrolled in Medicare  32 716 are enrolled in Medicare Part D  of which at least 5 303 will fall in to the donut hole            Of the 118 481 Southern Tier seniors currently enrolled in Medicare  40 795 are enrolled in Medicare Part D  of which at least 5 612 will fall in to the donut hole            Of the 270 235 Western New York seniors currently enrolled in Medicare  105 840 are enrolled in Medicare Part D  of which at least 17 740 will fall in to the donut hole        To protect seniors and close the donut hole  Schumer announced the following three point plan            No Premiums While In The Donut Hole   Schumer announced he was pushing The Prescription for Fairness Act of 2006  S 3647    The bill would waive the drug plan premium for seniors during any month that a beneficiary falls into the donut hole   The provision would last through Fiscal Year 2008 and would provide short term relief to seniors suddenly forced to pay more for their drugs            Provide Coverage In the Donut Hole   Schumer called on America  s Health Insurance Providers  AHIP  to offer more enhanced coverage drug plans for Medicare beneficiaries in 2007 so that seniors can affordably opt to avoid the donut hole   In a letter to AHIP  Schumer asked that starting in 2007 drug plans provide increased options that offer reasonably priced coverage in the donut hole   According to the Kaiser Foundation  only 13 percent of prescription drug plans  PDP  s  in New York offer some type of coverage for seniors in the donut hole  but the plans typically come with higher premiums and only cover generic  not brand name  drugs            Eliminate the Donut Hole   Schumer announced a new push for the Meeting Our Responsibility to Medicare Beneficiaries Act  S 18  which would  among other things  phase out the donut hole over time   By freezing the current catastrophic threshold   5 100   the donut hole would gradually close       Click here to view
