IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 5  2006 Schumer To NYC Park Commissoner Benepe    Don  t Throw In The Towel On Sunset Park Boxing Gym                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Founded and Run By Off Duty NYPDers  Sunset Park Boxing Gym Offers City Youth Exercise  Guidance and Protection from Crime  Drugs and Gangs   Schumer Letter Calls on Parks Department to Either Stop Eviction Orders on Gym or Find it a New Home                                                                                                                                                      Following a recent decision by Commissioner Adrian Benepe of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to evict the Sunset Park Boxing Club from its current home at 4302 7th Avenue  Brooklyn  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the Parks Department to repeal the eviction order and reinstate the valuable after school program at its current location  For the past twenty years  the boxing gym based in Sunset Park  Brooklyn and run by the Police Athletic League has offered neighborhood children a safe outlet to exercise  socialize and develop discipline under the supervision and instruction of New York City Police Officers  Benepe  however  recently ordered the boxing gym to leave its twenty year old home in order to make room for a new program that will be housed there  Concerned that the children of Sunset Park could lose an invaluable after school program that is vital to protecting them from crime  gangs  and violence  Schumer called on the Parks Department to either stop the eviction process or  at the very least  find the boxing gym a new location nearby        No one wins if the Sunset Park Boxing Club is evicted from its current location  and  sadly  it will be a knockout blow for many children who have come to rely on the gym as a place for both exercise and guidance     said Senator Schumer    Therefore  I strongly urge Commissioner Benepe to reinstate the Sunset Park Boxing Club at the address it has called home for the past twenty years        The Sunset Park Boxing Club  founded twenty years ago by retired cop Patrick   Patty    Russo and other police officers determined to contribute to their local community  offers Sunset Park children extracurricular activities in a neighborhood where positive outlets are scarce  The club has trained several Golden Gloves champions and a U S  Junior Olympic champion  and today continues to be managed and financed by police officers and firefighters at virtually no expense to New York City taxpayers      The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation recently announced it will evict the boxing gym in order to make way for an alternative after school program  Despite having enough space to house both programs  the Sunset Park Boxing Club was ordered to leave the address it  s been at for twenty years  While the Senator commends Commissioner Benepe  s efforts to offer additional opportunities to city children who all too often lack recreational activities  he is troubled that the livelihood of the boxing club is threatened under the new arrangement         By introducing an after school program at the expense of an existing one  you will be punishing a program that has been so effective in inoculating our city  s young minds against the temptations of drugs  crime and gangs     said Senator Schumer    Thanks to the efforts of the NYPD and the FDNY  The Sunset Park Boxing Club has been an inspirational archetype for after school programs across the city  We must protect it        Because there is enough available space for both after school programs  Senator Schumer is urging Commissioner Benepe to reinstate the Sunset Park Boxing Club at the address it has called home for the past twenty years  If Commissioner Benepe can offer the Senator and other concerned individuals involved a compelling argument on why the Sunset Park Boxing Club needs to be evicted  the Senator requests he at least find an alternative location for the club nearby     The sport of boxing has long been a celebrated part of Brooklyn athletics and the entire city  s competitive nature  Historically a vital source of opportunity for immigrants and native born alike  boxing has rallied New Yorkers behind homegrown legends including  Rocky Graziano  Riddick Bowe  Jake LaMotta  Mark Breland  Floyd Patterson and Zab Juddah  Boxing is credited with keeping countless numbers of kids out of the streets  teaching discipline and creating a positive outlet for youthful energy      Attached is the letter Senator Schumer sent to Commissioner Benepe
