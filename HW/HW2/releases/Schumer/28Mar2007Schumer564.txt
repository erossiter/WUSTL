IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 28  2007 New Schumer Analysis  Upstate New York At Tip Of Foreclosure Crisis   More Than 50 000 Families Could To Lose Their Homes As Subprime Mortgage Market Collapses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Schumer  The Subprime Market is the Wild West of Mortgage Loans and We Need a Sheriff in Town   Schumer Releases New County by County Foreclosure Estimates for Every Region in the State  6 000 Foreclosures in the Capital Region over the Next Two Years  6 000 Central New York  9 000 Rochester Finger Lakes  14 000 Hudson Valley  2 500 North Country  4 000 Southern Tier  10 000 Western New Y As the subprime mortgage market goes from boom to bust  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today that foreclosures will soar in  over the next two years  with more than 50 000 families in upstate New York at risk of losing their homes by the end of 2008  Schumer today unveiled his plan to ensure that the subprime lending market  which has been able to operate with little oversight from federal regulators   is finally scrutinized on a federal level  Schumer outlined a plan today to regulate these rogue mortgage lenders  eliminate  liar  loans and establish a foreclosure prevention task force        The subprime market is the wild west of mortgage loans and its time we bring a sheriff into town   Schumer said   The first step is making sure that borrowers are protected from these usurious lenders  It s long past time that we ensure that working people are protected from loans that promise them the world and instead give them a mountain of debt and leave them homeless        The impending avalanche of mortgage foreclosures in upstate New York and across the nation can be directly tied to the exploding popularity of costly non traditional mortgage products over the past decade  These non traditional mortgage products  which include hybrid adjustable rate mortgages with intricate interest rate terms and conditions  have been sold to middle and lower income families in record numbers  While they offer attractive and easy lending terms  they also include excessively high interest rates that can sharply spike  leaving new homeowners struggling to meet rising mortgage payments         Over the next two years  nationwide 1 8 million risky subprime borrowers who were  teased  into their loans may be forced to foreclose because they will be hit with steep rate increases that they can not possibly afford   This follows in the wake of more than 1 2 million foreclosures in 2006  According to a report by the Center for American Progress   the number of homeowners who entered into some stage of foreclosure in December 2006 was up 35  from December 2005  These numbers are only expected to soar in the coming years as the interest rates reset       The problem is only magnified in the subprime mortgage market  where borrowers with weaker credit histories and lower incomes have flocked to mortgages that have higher interest rates than prime mortgages  Despite subprime loans being universally more expensive than prime loans  they still remain a main source of capital for millions of low income Americans  especially minorities  who wish to fulfill the American Dream and purchase a house        Subprime loans leave borrowers in an extremely precarious financial state  In comparison to a prime loan  a subprime loan is more costly due its higher than normal interest rates and the borrower being saddled with a high number of points that must be initially paid to obtain the loan   A point is one percent of the amount being borrowed   The interest rate and points charged depend on various criteria  including credit history  income  assets  type of property  loan amount  loan duration and the amount of the down payment  To make matters worse  many of these bor    rowers had to pay costly origination fees on their mortgages  which left them with little cash left to invest in their new homes or to service their mortgages when their adjustable interest rate rises       The most popular  affordable  subprime loans are adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs  that offer an initial fixed rate that is set low   often called a  teaser  rate  The rate resets after an initial fixed rate period  commonly two to three years   to a more onerous rate that leads to a significantly higher mortgage payment that low income borrowers generally have great difficulty affording  These ARMs  commonly known as  2 28s  or  3 27s  represented more than 60 percent of all subprime mortgages originated in 2006    The FDIC estimates that this year alone  one million of these loans will reset to higher rates   Next year  800 000 more will reset to higher rates       Across upstate New York  51 076 upstate New York families could loose their house and foreclose on their subprime mortgages              In the Capital Region  173 238 houses were mortgaged  and 6 194 families are now in danger of losing their homes            In Central New York  164 497 houses were mortgaged  and 5 929 families are now in danger of losing their homes            In the Rochester Finger Lakes region  248 361 houses were mortgaged  and 8 859 families are now in danger of losing their homes            In the Hudson Valley  387 573 houses were mortgaged  and 13 825 families are now in danger of losing their homes            In the North Country  57 560 houses were mortgaged  and 2 680 families are now in danger of losing their homes            In the Southern Tier  98 186 houses were mortgaged  and 3 877 families are now in danger of losing their homes            In Western New York  272 277 houses were mortgaged  and 9 712 families are now in danger of losing their homes        The bottom line here is that the subprime bust is leading us right into a foreclosure boom  and thousands of people will be left in the lurch   Schumer said   We are staring straight into the barrel of the biggest foreclosure crisis ever  and action must be taken now to avoid disaster        In an effort to protect homebuyers from usurious lenders and potential foreclosure   today Schumer unveiled his plans for legislation to stem the tide of subprime mortgages  Schumer s three point plan will            Establish a National Regulatory System for Mortgage Brokers  The subprime lending business has become an unregulated mess and a new authority is needed to regulate rogue mortgage lenders and brokers who operate below the radar of federal regulators  Schumer s plan will fill the gaping void in our federal regulatory structure and create a national system for ALL mortgage brokers and loan officers  including those at non bank companies             Eliminate  Liar  Loans  It has become too obvious too late that for many of these defaulting loans  the borrowers could never have paid them  They were mathematically designed to fail the homeowner and give the lying mortgage broker fat fees  It is not right that families that got  teased  into their house with the promise that they could afford the loans  will all to predictably be kicked out when their loans reset to onerous rates   To prevent this tragedy from happening again  Schumer s bill will establish a suitability standard for borrowers so that they will never issue a loan that the borrower cannot afford  It will also prohibit pre payment penalties  stated income or low documentation loans  and  pick a payment  options that are used to deceive borrowers into signing their dream of homeownership down the drain             Create a NYS Foreclosure Prevention Task Force  Schumer plans to bring together private sector and non profit groups in New York State to keep the nearly 100 000 residents who are standing on the edge of the foreclosure cliff from losing their homes  The focus would be on helping homeowners restructure their individual loans  offer forbearance periods  assist homeowners sell distressed properties for borrowers that choose to no long own  provide credit counseling and negotiate with credit reporting agencies to delete defaults or forecloses for borrowers that are considered to be in failing  predatory loans   The working group would include   elected officials  regulators  financial institutions  and groups  ACORN  Operation Hope  NeighborWorks  Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project  and others
