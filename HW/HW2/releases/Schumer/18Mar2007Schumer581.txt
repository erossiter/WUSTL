IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 18  2007 Schumer  Lautenberg Reveal  Gaping Hole In Maritime Security   Ports Vulnerable To Attack By Terrorist Ship  Coast Guard Refuses To Implement Critical Satellite Ship Tracking System                                                                                                                                                                                                                            With 2 Weeks to Go Before Deadline to Begin Implementation of a Long Range Vessel Tracking System Coast Guard About to Turn a Blind Eye        Schumer Calls for Immediate Implementation at the Port of NY NJ to Ensure that Coast Guard Can ID Friends and Foes                                                                                                                                       Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that the Coast Guard is about to ignore the deadline for implementing a congressionally mandated long range vessel tracking system to identify dangerous ships approaching our country  The Coast Guard is required by law to implement such a system for all ships in U S  waters by April 1   but the Coast Guard is poised to let this deadline pass without implementation  though the technology is readily available  Schumer today called for the immediate implementation of this system at the Port of New York and New Jersey so that the Coast Guard can identify any danger approaching our waters         Despite scores of ships from every corner of the globe entering the New York port every year  we still don t have a comprehensive tracking system in place to closely monitor whether it s a friend or a foe coming to our shores   said Senator Schumer   That s why it is baffling that the Coast Guard is so reluctant to incorporate readily available technology that will give us this system immediately and allow us to keep a vigilant watch over our ports  By failing to take advantage of this technology  the Coast Guard is poised to turn a blind eye toward the threat of terrorism on the high seas            One of the most important jobs of our government is to protect this nation from a terrorist attack   When it comes to port security  the Bush Administration has fallen down on the job   Senator Frank R  Lautenberg said   Every day we fail to protect and secure our ports is another day we leave our country vulnerable to attacks   It s time the Administration address this threat with the urgency it deserves         The SAFE Port Act  which passed in the fall of 2006  requires the US Coast Guard to implement a long range vessel tracking system for large ships by April 1 of this year  Long range vessel tracking is a component of the Coast Guard s planned National Automatic Identification System  NAIS   the final phase of NAIS would include a state of the art  long range  system that uses satellites to track ships as far out as 1 000 2 000 miles from the U S  coast  But despite the desperate need for this system to monitor busy ports and the fact that New York City is a known terrorist target  the Coast Guard has not even started New York implementation of the long range portion of its system with the deadline only two weeks away  In fact  the Coast Guard does not expect to complete the full NAIS until 2014        The NY NJ port is the first point of arrival for the majority of ships traveling from Europe  the 3rd largest port in the U S   and the largest port on the East Coast  Yet the U S  Coast Guard at the Port of NY NJ currently has no long range tracking capability  The Coast Guard in NY NJ uses a radio based system  not a satellite system  to follow ships up to 12 20 miles out  Twelve nautical miles is only about one hour of traveling time  Thus  if a hostile ship disobeys the  96 hour rule  and fails to inform the Coast Guard when it is 96 miles out of port  the Coast Guard would not be able to track it on the local Automatic Identification System until it is too close to organize a response to a threat  By June  the Coast Guard expects to provide some satellite tracking for the Port of NY NJ  but this information will be updated only twice a day  Not until the end of 2007 will the Port have constant tracking of up to 50 miles out on a radio based  not satellite  system         With approximately 8 000 deep draft vessels calling on U S  ports each year  the Coast Guard is inadequately equipped to track every incoming vessel without implementing the long range satellite technology  Terrorists traveling by ship could target local commercial and recreational boats like the Staten Island Ferry and oil tankers  as well as landmarks and the city s busy port facilities themselves         A long range system would simply tell ships to activate their emergency beacon  global distress signal  so that it can be tracked by satellites  Information would be gathered by satellite and then plotted using specialized software  Ships can turn off the distress beacons  but the long range of satellite tracking makes it difficult for a hostile ship to  go dark  in this way without being spotted  Ships already have these beacons due to an international mandate  but the Coast Guard provides little incentive for ships to turn them on because the Coast Guard cannot currently pick up their signals  However  at least one nonprofit organization  Maritime Information Services of North America  MISNA   has piloted this type of long range system with voluntary participation by ships  In Alaska  through a local Coast Guard agreement with this nonprofit  many ships are voluntarily participating in a hybrid radio and satellite system that provides long range tracking capabilities for ships in Alaskan and Pacific waters  The U S  Coast Guard is empowered under the SAFE Port Act to  use existing maritime organizations to collect and monitor tracking information  in order to implement the long range vessel tracking system  and a 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office found that the Coast Guard could partner with local organizations in order to reduce costs and speed development of the NAIS        The Port of NY NJ is not the only location that is vulnerable due to the Coast Guard s slow movement on the tracking effort   the lack of a long range vessel tracking system can have disastrous consequences for the entire country  By the end of this year the Coast Guard expects to provide radio based tracking up to a radius of 50 miles outside each of the nation s top 55 seaports  However this leaves gaping holes in Coast Guard s ability to monitor thousands of miles of shoreline        To ensure that the Port of NY NJ is secured  Senator Schumer called for the Coast Guard to implement a long range satellite tracking system in NY NJ right away  In a letter to the Commandant of the Coast Guard  Admiral Thad W  Allen  Schumer wrote that the Coast Guard should either devote the necessary resources to implement its own tracking system by the April 1 deadline or should take advantage of Congressional authorization to work with non profit maritime groups to get information immediately
