                                 Rove Told the Senate Republicans  There Should Be No Compromise    Schumer Calls On Republicans to   Stand Tall  Stand Firm  Don t Change the Rules In The Middle Of the Game And Protect the Sacred Checks and Balances      Floor Statement by Senator Schumer on White House Intervention in Favor of Changing Senate Rules delivered this morning at 10am  I rise under morning business to discuss some recent events that occurred overnight  Most importantly  there is a story in today s USA Today based on a direct interview that Karl Rove has    quote     rejected a compromise with Senate democrats Monday on long stalled nominations for the federal judiciary and strongly defended President Bush s choice of John Bolton          I m going to talk about the first matter  Mr  President  it is disconcerting and surprising to see an aide to the president    an important aide    tell the Senate how to conduct itself  The Senate has conducted itself by its own rules for decades and centuries  Those rules  by the design of the founding fathers  written into the constitution  talk about the Senate as being a preserve of minority rights  The founding fathers called it the cooling saucer       It is clear  if you read  The Federalist Papers    and look at the history of this republic  that when a Senate minority of 45 rejects 10 out of 215 judges and supports 205 out of 215  that that is the very way the founding fathers wanted the Senate to behave  After all  one of the very earliest nominations of President Washington    John Rutledge    was rejected by the Senate for the Supreme Court  Rejected by the Senate  And in that Senate  where I believe it was eight founding fathers    the people who wrote the constitution   rejecting the president s choice       We have in a certain sense people way out of the mainstream  way over  a small group telling the Republican Party in the Senate and telling the President that they must have all the judges  including the most extreme  because after all  it was only the most extreme that we rejected   judges who believe  for instance  that the New Deal was a socialist revolution and should be undone  Judges who believe that zoning laws are unconstitutional  Judges who believe the purpose of a man    of a woman should be to be subjugated to a man  Judges who believe that slavery was God  s gift to white people       These are some of the judges that we ve rejected  not based on any one particular issue  People say  well  this is all code for abortion  It s not  I have voted for  I believe it is about 190 of the judges  the overwhelming majority don t agree with me on abortion  But believe that they met the ultimate test that they would interpret the law  not make law  And thus  even though they had strongly held beliefs on their own that they would be a good judge  The ten we rejected failed that test       They feel so passionately that they have to impose their views  One of them  Priscilla Owen of Texas  was criticized repeatedly by conservative members of her own court    the Texas Supreme Court    for placing her interpretation of law ahead of the standard interpretation  the interpretation that everybody accepted  And so we were proud to do our constitutional duty and reject these judges  judges we were not consulted with  judges who were way out of the mainstream  And now because of the demands of a few way over  way out there  it seems that the Majority leader is pushing the so called nuclear option       But the problem is that a large number of    a good number of people on the other side really don t want to do the nuclear option  They know that it would change the rules in the middle of the game  You don t change the rules in the middle of the game just because you can t get your way on every single judge  Our constitution  our system of laws is too hallowed  is too important to do that  These wavering Republican senators know that the Senate has been the repository of checks and balances       And that s why we haven t done the nuclear option yet  I have to say  I wish the Majority Leader would not be moving it  He should stand up as senator for the rights of the Senate  He should stand up as an American for the rights of the American people  But that is not happening       But yesterday they had a call the heavy guns in  Karl Rove  a member of the executive branch  told the Senate there should be    told the Senate Republicans  there should be no compromise  It s quite natural  by the way  that the White House wouldn t want a Senate with checks and balances  This is not simply true of Republican presidents       It s true of all presidents  whether they be Democrat or Republican  They want to just have their way  They regard the legislature sort of  and particularly the Senate  as sort of a pesky obstacle to getting their way  But the wisdom of our Republic has shown that when the Senate does slow things down  when the Senate does invoke checks and balances  that the republic is better off  But now we have Karl Rove telling the Senate how they ought to act  how we ought to act to change a tradition of 200 years  Senator Reid has said publicly that the President told him that the white house would stay out of this       It s clearly not the case  The White House is not staying out of this  And they are trying to aggrandize executive power  The American people  though  aren t buying it       There s this story today in The Washington Post that shows    quote     by a 2 1 ratio     that s pretty stunning  more than the filibuster amount   the public rejected easing the Senate rules in a way that would make it harder for Democratic senators to prevent final action on Bush s nominees  Even many Republicans were hesitant to abandon current Senate confirmation procedures  Nearly half opposed any rule changes   joining eight of ten Democrats and seven of ten political independents        The American public may not follow us  Mr  President  minute to minute  day to day on what we do on this floor  but they ve got a pretty good nose to smell what s going on  And what they smell is a whiff of extremism  a whiff of I can t get my way  so I change the rules in the middle of the game  A whiff of not simply a fight at the moment over a particular judge  but rather  a desire not to live with the traditions of this body and this Republic  which involves compromise and mediation       Honestly  Mr  President  when I recommended to our caucus early on that we filibuster a few of the judges and then later that we prevent and stand up to the nuclear option  no matter what it took  I thought we would lose politically  I thought the argument  well  have 51 votes on everything would prevail  But the American people s wisdom is large  deep  and hard to fool  And the American people have said they understand what s going on  When the republicans were in charge  they didn t allow judges to come out  We re not in charge now  and the filibuster is a way of mitigating the president s desire to put whomever he wants on the bench  And that the filibuster is appropriate       So I don t believe some on the other side say  well the public s with the democrats because they ve gotten their message out ahead of us  Please  the public is with the Democrats in this case not because they re democratic and not because they may agree with the stand of each of the judges or disagree with the stand on each of the judges we have rejected    although I expect that would be the case if they knew  The public is with us because they understand fundamentally the checks and balances that are so important in this republic  And that because a president gets 51 5  of the vote  he doesn t always have to get his way  particularly when it comes to choosing the third unelected  only unelected branch of government       So  Mr  Rove can order Senators not to compromise  I hope and pray that the senators will not take example    not take direction from the White House on something where the white house s interests  whatever party the president might be  are different than the senators and  frankly  different than the republic s  And I believe they won t  The wisdom of the American people is strong  I let my colleagues know if they should try to invoke the nuclear option and it you can    and it succeeds  we will have no choice but tone force the Senate rules and try to bring up issues that matter to the American people       We will bring up  the high cost of energy and gasoline  health care  education  We don t usually do that because of comity in the Senate  After all the other party is the majority party  But if they re not respecting the rights of the majority as    the rights of the minority  then as a majority they don t deserve that same deference  And so what we will do is not shut down the Senate  not   not show up  We will rather use the remaining rules at our disposal to bring up issues that the America people care about  Again  my plea to my colleagues on the other side  I know many of them have doubts about this nuclear option but are under tremendous pressure  Resist the entreaties of the executive branch  in this case  in the per son fiction of Mr  Rove  Stand tall  stand firm  don t change the rules in the middle of the game and protect the sacred checks and balances that is at the core of the republic by rejecting this trampling on the rules  the so call nuclear option              With that  Mr  President  I yield
