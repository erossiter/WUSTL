IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 16  2007 Schumer Blasts Loophole In Key Federal Milk Program That Unfairly Leaves Upstate Ny Dairy Farmers Footing The Bill To Promote Foreign Competitors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dairy Farmers across Upstate NY and the Nation Contribute  270 Million Out of Pocket to Promote Dairy Products  but Foreign Competitors and Importers Share these Benefits without Contributing to Program s Cost Schumer Today Calls on Senate Committee to Close Technical Loophole So that Foreign Dairy Producers Can Be Forced to Pay into Marketing Program It is Estimated that for Every Dollar an Upstate Farmer Contributes to the Program  Their Net Farm Revenue Increases By  4 33 Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer blasted a technical glitch that allows foreign competitors of Upstate NYs dairy farmers to benefit from a key federal dairy program without contributing any funding to it  Each year  U S  dairy farmers contribute  270 million out of their own pockets to promote dairy products through the Dairy Promotion Program  DPP   However  a loophole in the program allows foreign competitors and importers to avoid financing any of its expenses  but still benefit from the success its had in expanding Americas rapidly growing dairy market   To level the playing field for Upstate NYs farmers  Schumer today called on the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry to tweak the program so every domestic and international milk producer that does business in the U S  also financially contributes to the Dairy Promotion Program   This program helps NY dairy farmers sell more product  but it suffers from a fatal flaw that leaves Upstate New York dairy farmers footing the bill to promote foreign competition in the U S  marketplace  said Senator Schumer  It makes no sense why foreign competitors should benefit off the backs of our upstate dairy farmers  which is why Im fighting for a provision that will bring much needed equality to this program by guaranteeing that everyone who benefits from this program must also contribute to this program   Currently under the Dairy Promotion Program  farmers in 48 states are required to pay into the program that promotes and advertises dairy products in the U S  marketplace  It is estimated that on average  a farmer with 500 head of dairy cattle will produce approximately 960 000cwt of milk annually The Dairy Promotion Program charges that farmer 15cents per cwt  which would mean a total of  144 000 annually into the program  In 2006  New York States dairy farmers  which produce approximately 6 625  of the U S  milk  contributed an estimated  18 million to the Dairy Promotion Program   The program has been successful for farmers in Upstate New York and across the country  According to a 2006 study conducted by Cornell University  the Dairy Promotion Program increased the value of milk by 2 7   It is estimated that for every single dollar a farmer contributes to the Dairy Promotion Program  net farm revenue increases by  4 33   However  foreign competitors and importers currently arent required to pay into the program  but because they sell dairy products within the U S  marketplace  they benefit from the Dairy Promotion Program that is expanding the domestic milk market and increasing the value of their products  In the 2002 Farm Bill  Congress passed a provision that would require the Dairy Promotion Program to be applied to imported dairy products  However  because of USDAs objections to the structure of the program  the provision was never implemented   Today  Schumer called on the Senate Committee to finally fix this loophole  When the loophole is fixed  the 2002 law can be implemented   Schumer noted that with foreign importers forced to participate in the program  the additional funding would expand the promotional campaign  benefiting all domestic farmers by further increasing the price of milk   Upstate New Yorks farmers are already having a hard enough time making ends meet without paying to promote foreign competition  New York farmers have faced this unfair playing field for far too long and its time we fix this glitch  added Schumer   This correction would extend the Dairy Promotion Program to the small fraction of U S  producers not currently covered  which represent only 0 44  of US milk production in 2006  specifically those in Alaska  Hawaii  the District of Columbia  and Puerto Rico  Furthermore  once this technical adjustment to the program is made  the U S  can level the playing field for the vast majority of dairy farmers and begin applying the assessment to imported dairy products  as Congress sought to do five years ago   Dairy imports are a significant and growing share of the U S  marketplace  From 1989 to 2006  worldwide imports of dairy products into the U S  increased in value from  830 3 million to  2 335 billion
