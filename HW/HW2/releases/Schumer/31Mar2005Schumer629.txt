IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 31  2005 Schumer  Shortage Of Volunteer Firefighters On Long Island Looms   Unveils New Plan To Boost Recruitment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Nearly 3 Million Residents of Nassau and Suffolk Counties Rely on Nearly All Volunteer Fire Fighting Force Potential For Fire Fighter Deficit Leaves Long Islanders Unprotected    Senator Stands with Local Firefighters  Announce New Proposal That Would Give  1 000 Tax Credit to Volunteer Firefighters and EMS    Recruitment and Retention of Volunteer Firefighters Problem for Nassau and Suffo As a shortage a volunteer fire fighters threatens departments in Nassau and Suffolk County who rely on a nearly all volunteer fire fighting force  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a new proposal to support volunteer firefighters and emergency medical support  EMS  providers on Long Island  Standing with volunteer firefighters who shared their recruitment struggles  Schumer announced his legislation  the Supporting Emergency Responders Volunteer Efforts  SERVE  Act  which offers a  1 000 tax credit for active members of volunteer firefighting and EMS organizations  Schumer will specifically address the retention problems that are plaguing Long Island  Enrollment of volunteer firefighters has dropped 28 percent statewide over the last ten years  leaving many departments thinly staffed        New York s firefighters serve on the front lines of the War on Terror everyday   Schumer said   We must do everything we can to stand by them and give them the support they need to protect us and keep our communities safe  Departments across Long Island and across the country are at risk of suffering from severe staffing shortages  and we must act immediately  I can think of no better way to show our gratitude for their sacrifice and address this crisis than by offering a  1 000 tax credit to each of these heroes        Schumer was joined by Nassau and Suffolk County firefighters who shared their personal stories of service and discuss the importance of offering incentives to get people to come into the voluntary fire and emergency services  The tax credit would provide a  1 000 tax credit that would serve as an important recruitment tool for local groups to boost enrollment numbers  Most importantly  it is a way for the Federal government to express the country s enormous gratitude for the sacrifices they voluntarily make each day       Many communities around New York State rely on volunteer firefighters and EMS providers for much needed public services  especially Nassau and Suffolk counties where the firefighting force is nearly all volunteer  Fire departments are finding it harder and harder to find people to fill the slots because middle class families have increasing demands on their time  or financial concerns that preclude their participation  The SERVE Act is designed to offer an incentive for people to get involved in their communities in this vitally important way       On Long Island  both Nassau and Suffolk Counties report about 10 000 volunteer firefighters respectively  After 9 11  both Nassau and Suffolk county firehouses saw a spike in volunteerism as the tragedy touched every community on the Island and many people viewed firefighting as a way to give back  Although they report more volunteers today than they had ten years ago  both counties report the numbers of volunteers have plateaued  But  between 2003 and 2004 there were 4000 more ambulance calls and 3000 more fire calls on the Island        We can not have a situation where the number of calls keeps going up and the number of responders is staying the same  or worse  declining   said Schumer      In addition to the numbers of new volunteers leveling off  another problem both counties face is retention of current volunteers  Many younger people who train to be firefighters or EMTs leave the area for college and do not return due to rising property costs  There are more single parents which make it harder to find extra time for volunteering  And now there are more two income families than before  leaving very little extra time for volunteering       However  enrollment problems have reached a crisis stage in many areas of New York State  According to the Firemen s Association of the State of New York  FASNY   fewer young people are joining the ranks  Many departments are having a hard time filling crews  especially during the day when most people are working  According to FASNY  enrollment of volunteer firefighters has dropped statewide 28 percent over the last ten years  leaving many departments thinly staffed  If this trend were to continue  many municipalities could find themselves without adequate fire protection in the near future       While many local governments understand the need for a recruitment initiative  most simply do not have the resources to implement one  At the same time  firefighters are often on the front lines of the War on Terror  and essential to our homeland security  Moreover  every single day volunteer firefighters are relied on to save residential and commercial property  and to clean up accidents and reopen our highways  all of which protects the economic prosperity of many of our communities       If enacted  the Schumer Hinchey bill  S  625  H R  934  would provide a  1 000 federal tax credit to individuals who are active members of volunteer fire departments and emergency service crews to reward these brave men and women who risk their lives for little or no compensation  The SERVE Act would promote staffing at these emergency organizations to maintain the proper services needed to protect New York s communities       Under the SERVE Act  any taxpayer who is a volunteer firefighter or EMS worker for the full year is entitled to a refundable federal tax credit of  1 000  if they work for part of the year  they are entitled to a pro rated amount  A refundable tax credit means that  if the credit exceeds their federal tax liability  they would receive the remainder as a tax refund       Schumer has long been an advocate for firefighters  In October 2000  Congress enacted the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  FIRE  Act to make federal grants available to fire departments to provide much needed firefighting equipment  training and fire prevention education programs  Last October  Congress reauthorized the legislation thru FY2009  Between FY2001 and FY2003   New York State received  53 026 million in FIRE grant funds   the third highest level in the country behind CA and PA       According to the National Fire Protection Association and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  which promulgated standards for the minimum number of fire fighters needed to safely and effectively respond to emergencies  an estimated 2 3 of all jurisdictions do not currently meet their safe staffing levels  In response to this concern  Congress enacted the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters  SAFER  Act to create a federal grant program to address the need of adequate staffing within the fire service  The goal of the SAFER Act is to hire up to 75 000 new firefighters over a seven year period       Schumer supports full funding of both the FIRE Act at  950 million and  1 billion for the SAFER Act in FY06  He cosponsored Senator Dodd s amendment to the Budget Resolution  which would have fully funded both the FIRE and SAFER Acts
