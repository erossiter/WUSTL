IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 4  2007 Schumer Introduces Plan To Require Buildings Across The Nation To Dramatically Increase Energy Efficiency Following Proposal That Bloomberg Introduced In NYC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Schumer and Bloomberg Announce Coordinated Federal and Local Initiatives to Drastically Reduce the Amount of Energy Wasted in Buildings by 30    Increasing Energy Efficiency in Buildings is One of the Quickest and Most Effective Ways to Reduce Greenhouse Gases and Energy Consumption   Buildings Account for 40  of All Energy Used in US   Schumer Amendment will Require Nation to Me Today Senator Charles E  Schumer  standing with Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg  announced his federal plan to increase building efficiency by 30  across the nation as Mayor Bloomberg has proposed for New York City  Increasing energy efficiency in buildings is one of the quickest and most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption  Today s announcement marks the start of a coordinated effort to require states and municipalities to update their residential and commercial building codes  Schumer said today that he would offer these new emissions standards as an amendment to the Senate energy bill that will be on the Floor next week    Not only is my plan the right thing to do  it is a win win for everyone  energy efficient buildings save consumers money and protect our environment  Schumer said  They make sense and it s high time that the Federal government moves forward  My amendment will take the rest of the country in the same direction that cities like New  York and states like California are heading  The best way to reduce greenhouse gases is conservation even though alternative fuels get most of the attention  As one environmentalist said  alternative fuels are the sizzle but conservation is the steak   One of the key goals of PlaNYC is reducing New York Citys greenhouse gases By setting a national standard for building energy codes  Senator Schumers amendment to the Senates proposed energy efficiency bill will help us begin to meet those goals today  said Mayor Bloomberg  Facing the challenges of climate change and energy consumption is integral to our future  and we simply can no longer just sit back and hope that these problems will go away  Every level of our government must do its part and take steps now that will allow us to begin making progress toward effective change for the future    One month ago  Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg andNew York City Buildings Commissioner Patricia J  Lancaster introduced a landmark modernization of the New York City Building Code  the first since 1968  fulfilling a 2001 promise to update the City s arcane and antiquated existing code Thenew proposal overhauls all aspects of the City s construction codes  including the Building Code  setting new standards and rules in order to emphasize safety  efficiency and sustainability  The proposal  to be called the NYC Construction Codes  draws on suggestions and input from hundreds of stakeholders the Bloomberg Administration brought together for this effort  simplifies construction standards and fosters long term  environmentally friendly growth  This new model building code has begun the process of greening the code by requiring cool roofs  rewarding green building practices  and streamlining the approval process for new technologies   Schumer s plan addresses a critical energy issue at a time of rising gas prices and the looming threat of climate change  Buildings across the US account for about 40 percent of all energy used in the United States  and more than two thirds of electricity generated in the United States  goes to heat  cool  and power buildings  Unfortunately  most homes and commercial buildings are highly energy inefficient   forcing consumers and business waste money on high energy costs  At the same time  these outdated buildings pump out tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  a major cause of global warming   When  in 1999  we finished the first green high rise office tower  4 Times Square  we thought that the era of sustainable construction had begun  We were wrong  Today  thanks to the vision and courage of Senator Schumer and Mayor Bloomberg  green buildings are quickly becoming the norm  This legislation and PlaNYC is the environmental leadership that our country and our planet so desperately needs  said Douglas Durst  co president of the The Durst Organization  The Central Labor Council heartily endorses Senator Schumers federal plan to significantly improve building efficiency and create a more sustainable and healthy work environment and new opportunities for our workforce  Investments in retrofitting existing government buildings and supporting environmentally responsible new construction will generate tens of thousands of new construction  manufacturing  design  and maintenance jobs  High performance  green  buildings will also create new vocational opportunities for our workforce in an ecologically responsible building trade  such as installing solar panels and weatherizing buildings  Ed Ott  Executive Director of the New York City Central Labor Council said   Ashok Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council added  With today s announcement  Senator Schumer and Mayor Bloomberg are taking the lead in shaping how every new building will be constructed  The proposed strengthening of building energy codes will mean that more energy efficient windows  lighting  and heating and cooling systems will be installed and this will result in lower energy bills and reduced global warming pollution   Most U S  homes are highly energy inefficient  Within US homes  heating and cooling alone account for nearly 50  all energy consumed in residential buildings  Water heating accounts for an additional 14  in these homes  In commercial buildings  like supermarkets  the percentage of energy consumed for just refrigeration often approaches 50  of total energy consumed by the building  These high energy demands put onerous burdens on residential and commercial building owners  hitting their wallets even harder as the prices of oil continues to rise    Furthermore  inefficient buildings strain over utilized electricity grids  as more than half of the total energy is used in buildings for heating  cooling  ventilation  refrigeration  and water heating is generated by electricity  Air conditioning by itself is the single leading cause of peak demand for electricity  Increasing the efficiency of residential and commercial buildings  will immediately lower demand for energy and alleviate peak capacity    Current building codes are set on a state by state basis  and most states have failed to implement modernized building codes that would require builders and developers to use cost saving  energy efficient designs  Most current building codes are outdated and were written long before global warming and energy independence became important issues to America  Unfortunately  the U S  Department of Energy  DOE  has failed to produce a model code that takes strong steps to reduce the energy demands of commercial and residential buildings  Schumer s plan would force DOE to update their system so that new building codes take into account high energy usage rates of homeowners and commercial buildings  and the detrimental effect on consumers and the environment    Schumer and Bloomberg said today that new buildings represent a unique opportunity for energy savings  Efficient buildings reduce demand on the power grid and stress on natural gas supplies  improve local air quality  do not contribute to global warming  and save consumers money  By increasing the energy efficiency of buildings  consumers and businesses will spend less on heating  cooling  and powering their buildings  At the same time  reducing the energy demand of buildings will allow them to emit less carbon dioxide  a major greenhouse gas  into the atmosphere  Reducing greenhouse gases is an essential step in fighting global warming    While Schumer believes that the Senate s energy bill is a solid first step in addressing America s most challenging energy needs by increasing the use of renewable fuels and reducing the government s operating expenses by increasing the energy efficiency of government buildings  the Senator s amendment will solidify these improvements by strengthening codes for commercial and residential buildings as well  further reducing America s energy dependency while saving consumers billions in energy related expenditures    Schumer s amendment will spur major improvements in building energy codes by setting national targets and requiring states to meet them  Specifically  it will   Set a target for both national model residential and commercial building energy codes of 30  energy efficiency improvement by 2012 and 50  improvement by 2022  with interim and subsequent targets  as well  from proposed model codes created by the International Energy Conservation Code  IECC  and the American Society of Heating  Refrigerating  and Air Conditioning Engineers  ASHRAE   with input from the Department of Energy  DOE    Require states to adopt codes within 2 years that save at least as much energy as the national models  similar to commercial code requirement today   Require states within an additional 3 years to achieve 90  compliance with the codes verified by inspections of a sample of buildings   Provide DOE assistance to the states and to the national organizations to implement the codes  and retain a 2005 EPA act provision for grants to states for implementing plans to achieve high rates of compliance with the codes   Provide an additional  125M for states to implement the national model codes   Provide states with one year waivers if they are unable to implement the national codes and or be within 90  compliance   Provide carve outs for localities municipalities that are in compliance  but which are within states that are not  The impact on the economy and the environment from Schumer s amendment would be remarkable  If states hit both efficiency targets  cumulative cost savings for home and business owners would be  435 billion  nominal 2003 dollars   The amendment would lead to the equivalent reduction of roughly 890 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere  These greenhouse gas emissions reductions are equivalent to taking 32 million cars off the road for 20 years    According to the American Council of Energy Efficient Economies  in 2030 alone with these new standards in place  America could eliminate 5  of its total energy use  saving consumers  50 billion a year  Greenhouse gas emissions would be cut to a level equivalent to taking as many as 70 million cars off the road that year alone    Schumer s plan will ease the burden of implementing new building codes on cities like New York that are already working hard to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gasses  by providing federal funding to help states and municipalities implement new model codes  And Schumer s plan will require other cities and states to take the steps that New   York City is already taking  Schumer s amendment will be offered on the Senate leadership bill  which will be on the Senate floor starting next week  On Earth Day  Mayor Bloomberg outlined PlaNYC  a series of 127 proposals aimed at helping New York meet the challenges of adding nearly one million people to the City s population between now and 2030  while at the same time reducing the City s greenhouse gas emissions by 30  It aggressively targets energy efficiency in the building sector since almost 80  of the city s CO2 emissions come from energy use in buildings  In addition reducing energy consumption will improve air quality and help bring energy prices down  PlaNYC earmarks the next three year revision of the building code to go much further  with certain priority items  such as reducing CO2 emissions from concrete production  increasing the recycling of construction and demolition waste  and energy efficiency measures
