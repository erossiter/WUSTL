Role in Case Brought By Milwaukee U S  Attorney Stephen Biskupic Washington  DC    Today  Senators Leahy  Schumer  Kohl  Feingold  Feinstein and Whitehouse sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales seeking documents relating to the Wisconsin prosecution of a member of the Democratic governor s administration   In light of the ongoing probe into the U S  Attorney firings  the Senators are concerned that politics may have played an inappropriate role in the case brought by Stephen Biskupic  the U S  Attorney in Milwaukee    Last week  the aide  Georgia Thompson  was released from prison and her conviction immediately overturned after a federal appeals court found insufficient evidence to sustain the charges    Below is the text of the letter  and a pdf version is attached       April 10  2007    Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  United Stated Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC 20530    Dear Attorney General Gonzales     As you know  the Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating the circumstances surrounding the replacement of a number of United States Attorneys last year   One of the central issues in our investigation is whether the Department of Justice or the White House has improperly encouraged United States Attorneys to pursue  or to refrain from pursuing  politically sensitive cases     We are concerned whether or not politics may have played a role in a case brought by Stephen Biskupic  the United States Attorney based in Milwaukee  against Georgia Thompson  formerly an official in the administration of Wisconsin s Democratic governor   The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals was reportedly so troubled by the insufficiency of the evidence against Ms  Thompson that it made the unusual decision to issue an order reversing Ms  Thompson s conviction and releasing her from custody immediately after oral arguments in her appeal      Evidence obtained in the course of the Committee s investigation indicates that voter fraud cases may have played a role in the consideration of Administration officials about whether to dismiss or retain United States Attorneys   Among the documents of former Chief of Staff to the Attorney General D  Kyle Sampson produced by the Department of Justice on March 19  2007  is an approximately 30 page report concerning alleged voting improprieties in Wisconsin in 2004  OAG 820 47    According to a press account  this report was prepared at the direction of the executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party to be delivered to Karl Rove   In addition  White House Counselor Dan Bartlett said on March 12  2007  that the White House had received complaints that federal prosecutors were not vigorously pursuing complaints of voter fraud in Pennsylvania  New Mexico and Wisconsin   He said the president discussed these concerns with you last October   Mr  Sampson testified on March 29  2007    I do remember learning   I believe  from the attorney general   that he had received a complaint from Karl Rove about U S  attorneys in three jurisdictions  including New Mexico   And the substance of the complaint was that those U S  attorneys weren t pursuing voter fraud cases aggressively enough    Subsequently  Mr  Sampson added David Iglesias  the United States Attorney from New Mexico  to the list of those to be dismissed     Given the relevance of these matters to the ongoing investigation by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary  we ask that you provide the following documents to the Committee     1  All documents in the control  custody or possession of the Department of Justice regarding the case against Ms  Thompson or the United States Attorney s handling of that case    2  All communications between the Department of Justice and the White House regarding the case against Ms  Thompson or the United States Attorney s handling of that case      3  All communications between the Department of Justice and any other outside party  including political party officials  regarding the case against Ms  Thompson or the United States Attorney s handling of that case      4  All documents in the control  custody or possession of the Department of Justice regarding possible voter fraud or other election related cases in Wisconsin following the 2004 elections or the United States Attorney s handling of those matters     5  All communications between the Department of Justice and the White House regarding possible voter fraud or other election related cases in Wisconsin following the 2004 elections or the United States Attorney s handling of those matters     6  All communications between the Department of Justice and any other outside party  including political party officials  regarding possible voter fraud or other election related cases in Wisconsin following the 2004 elections or the United States Attorney s handling of those matters  and   7  All documents relevant to whether the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin was considered for dismissal and replacement at any time since President Bush s reelection  including any evaluations of his performance by D  Kyle Sampson or other Department of Justice officials     We ask that you provide the requested documents as early as possible and no later than the close of business on Friday  April 13  2007     Sincerely     Patrick Leahy                                                  Charles E  Schumer  Chairman                                                         United States Senator   Russell D  Feingold

  United States Senator                                       United States Senator
