IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 10  2005 As Tax Day Nears  Schumer Warns  Tax Refund Scams Are Cheating Hundreds Of Thousands Of New Yorkers Out Of Millions Of Dollars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Taxpayers should beware of instant  too good to be true tax refunds that can cut actual IRS refund in half  Unscrupulous preparers target tax payers by disguising loans as immediate   tax refunds    and then gouging taxpayers with sky high interest rates and outrageous administrative fees  Senator unveils sweeping plan to shut down predatory operations  keep public informed of risks As tax day approaches  thousands of New Yorkers are getting cheated out of millions of dollars in tax refund loan scams that have popped up all over New York  In an effort to combat this scenario  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer introduced a new plan to stop these predatory lenders from continuing this unregulated usurious practice  The   instant refunds    are actually tax refund loans or Refund Assistance Loans  RALs   short term loans secured by the recipient s tax refund and advertised as instant tax refunds by lenders  Customers are charged interest rates that can go as high as 700  to get their own tax dollars back from the government just a week or two faster than they otherwise would         The bottom line is  paying your own money to borrow your own money is a terrible idea     said Schumer    New Yorkers  and people all over the country  are getting ripped off by these predatory lenders  and its time to stop them dead in their tracks  The Feds haven  t done enough to expose these wolves in sheep  s clothing  we have got to do more to expose them and stop them          Refund Anticipation Loans are high cost loans secured by and repaid directly from the proceeds of a taxpayer  s refund from the IRS  RALs usually run for 7 14 days    the difference between when the RAL is made and when it is repaid by deposit of the taxpayer  s refund  As is often the case with terrible financial deals  RALs are targeted at low income consumers  who are more likely to take the bait   Generally low income workers live paycheck to paycheck and the   instant refunds    hold promise of getting extra money fast to bridge any potential gaps   Nationwide  6 92 million low income filers paid  1 74 billion in RAL and tax preparation fees in 2003  according to the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center  NCLC        These loans are advertised all over New York and all over the country as   instant tax refunds    with catchy slogans and colorful advertisements  Generally  a taxpayer goes into a tax preparer and is told that their refund can be made available immediately rather then waiting 10 14 days to get the IRS to process the refund  Loan Fees can range from anywhere between  30 to  150 depending on the combination of costs  not including tax preparation fee  but including a loan fee and an application fee  which is steep  especially when consumers don  t realize that they are getting a loan  Though the charges may not seem extraordinarily high  depending in the size of the loan it means paying an effective annual interest rate of 40 percent to more than 700 percent according to the NCLC  If you add on the  28 to  59 administrative fee charged by the preparer the interest rate can range from 70 percent to over 1700 percent  according to the same report         This is the worst refund ripoff of all time     Schumer said       The NCLC reports that 18  of consumers have taken out a RAL at some point  Of these consumers  two thirds did not realize a RAL is a loan  Consumers paid an estimated  1 billion in RAL fees  plus an additional  389 million in  administrative  or  application  fees in 2003 to get quick cash for their refunds  essentially borrowing their own money at extremely high interest rates      Once a taxpayer decides on receiving their   instant tax refund     the tax preparer then sends a request to the IRS to see whether that person is entitled to a full refund  partial refund  or nothing at all  The IRS tells the preparer what they  re entitled to  the preparer calculates the expected refund  minus the fees  The refund is then processed within 7 14 days and deposited into a dummy bank account set up by the preparer in the name of the recipient  The preparer then keeps the difference       In New York the problem is especially pervasive  According to a recent study by Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  ACORN   over 320 000 people got RALs in 2002  which is the last year complete data is available  Those RALs fees cost New Yorkers almost  40 million       During his press conference  Schumer presented the following breakdown for the five boroughs       County Total RALs Estimated Cost of RAL To Taxpayers      New York 49 548   5 648 472       Bronx 95 735   10 913 790       Queens 60 617   6 910 338       Kings 10 6181   12 104 634       Richmond 9101   1 037 514       Total 321182   36 614 748      For the 2005 filing season  the Consumer Federation of America estimates that the implicit APRs on RALs will range from about 40  for a loan of  9 999 to over 700  for a loan of  200       For filers at Liberty Tax  the fees stack up as follows       REFUND AMT Finance Charge Account Set Up Fee Application Fee APR Total  500  7  28  49 737   84  1000  17  28  49 378   94  2000  47  28  49 241   124  4000  77  28  49 146   154      In an effort to combat this menace  today Senator Schumer unveiled his new sweeping plan to stop lenders and tax preparers from duping tax payers into paying for refund anticipation loans        Specifically Schumer  s will be working to pass legislation with his colleagues on the Senate floor that will            Prohibit refund anticipation loans that utilize EITC benefits  Most refund anticipation loans are targeted at low income tax payers  In New York  there were a total of 321 182 RALS sold in 2002  77  of these were made to low income households and 59  were made to EITC recipients            Require that the Treasury Department provide the opportunity for low and moderate income taxpayers to open a low cost direct deposit account at a federally insured bank or credit union through the use of appropriate tax forms  Filing electronically and having the refund direct deposited into a bank or credit union account permits taxpayers to receive their refunds in approximately seven to ten days  without paying the high fees associated with RALs             End the Debt Indicator DI  program which shares taxpayers  personal information   beyond what is necessary   with tax preparers  In the RAL application process  the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  reduces the risk that lenders take on RALs by providing them with a Debt Indicator  DI  on all IRS e file acknowledgments        The D I  informs the lender whether or not an applicant owes federal or state taxes  child support  student loans  or other government obligations  and this assists the tax preparer in ascertaining the applicant s ability to obtain their full refund so that the RAL is repaid  The vast majority of refunds are remitted to the preparer as prepared  Thus  interest rates for RALs that vary from 97 percent to more than 2000 percent are not justifiable when the IRS lowers the risk of the loans by providing the D I  service             Prohibit mandatory arbitration clauses for RALs to ensure that consumers have the ability to take future legal action if necessary       Additionally  Schumer plans to introduce a bill when the Senate reconvenes this week that will require RAL facilitators to disclose  That taxpayers have the right to file an electronic tax return without applying for a RAL  all fees and interest charges associated with the loan  the expected time within which tax refunds are typically paid based on different filing and whether the refund anticipation loan agreement includes a debt collection offset arrangement  Schumer  s bill also permits the Treasury Secretary to impose penalties on RAL facilitators who fail to meet the registration or disclosure requirements          RALs are bilking New York taxpayers out of millions and without federal regulation  these usurious lenders will continue to figure out ways to cheat the system     Schumer said       According to the NCLC  RAL  s seem to exist primarily as a product for  and fee generator from  low income households  Over half of RAL consumers are recipients of the Earned Income Tax Credit  EITC  even though EITC recipients comprise only 17  of taxpayers  In 2002 RALs drained  740 million in loan fees  administrative fees and application fees from low wage workers who are recipients of EITC  45  of these recipients used check cashing fees adding another  158 million dollars to the total for a total of 1 73 billion dollars that the working poor spend to access this government benefit       In New York  out of the total of 321 182 RALS sold in 2002  77  were made to low income households and 59  were made to EITC recipients  According to the IRS  79  of RAL recipients in 2003 had incomes of  35 000 or less  HBSC Household reported that the majority of their RAL customers have an average household income of  17 800  Jackson Hewitt reported that 73  of the company s customers make less than  30 000 annually  The nationwide survey found about a quarter of respondents with incomes under  50 000 had taken out RALs  as compared to only 10  of those who made over  75 000      In New York in the 2002 tax year 248 443 low income households received their tax refund through a RAL  Using the same calculation means that low income New York families lost  32 297 590 to these products        The NCLC survey also found racial and educational disparities in RAL usage  28  of African American and 21  of Latino taxpayers responded that they d received RALs  compared with 12  of white consumers  RALs were used more often by consumers with a high school education  23   or less  30   than by college graduates  12         Though there is a way for low income workers to get free help with tax preparation there aren  t enough centers to handle the flow  VITA  Volunteer Income Tax Assistance  sites are set up by community based organizations  with guidance  training  and support from the IRS  to help low income taxpayers prepare and electronically file their returns free of charge  The Tax Counseling for the Elderly  TCE  Program offers free tax help to individuals who are age 60 or older  Like VITA  these sites are run by non profit or local government agencies
