                                   Long Island high school students worked months to pay for trip to Inaugural  only to be kept out until event was over  Same Virginia travel agent sold misleading tour packages to two schools   countless unknown other schools across region may also have fallen prey  Students  teachers and parents from both schools joined Schumer today to seek federal investigations by US Attorney and Federal Trade US Senator Charles E  Schumer today asked the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the Virginia based travel agent WorldStridesTM after he received multiple complaints from high schools in Nassau and Suffolk County that the company charged students for trips to Washington to experience the Inauguration last week  but did not make provisions to obtain the tickets necessary to actually attend the inauguration         From out east in Lindenhurst to here in Hicksville  we  re together today to say one thing   if you promise to   enrich students   lives    you better not be just enriching yourself     Schumer said    If an out of state company is going to try to rip off students in Nassau and Suffolk  they  re going to learn fast we won  t hesitate one minute in applying federal law to stop them          On Inauguration Day  Schumer personally encountered a group of students from Holy Trinity Diocesan High School in Hicksville on the National Mall  The 48 students were just then getting through security  more than an hour and a half after the start of the Inauguration and long after it was over  After the students told Schumer their story  he was able to work with the White House and arrange a consolation prize of sorts   a White House tour  Unfortunately  the Holy Trinity students could not take the tour because they had to return to New York in advance of last weekend s blizzard       Schumer then became suspicious of a pattern of problems when he learned of a similar story this week from Lindenhurst High students  Yesterday Schumer s Long Island office received a call from the Advanced Placement US History teacher at Lindenhurst High School in Suffolk County  He reported that his 38 students had raised money for almost a year to help offset the  800 per student price tag on a  once in a lifetime  trip to Washington to   witness the Inauguration and to hear the Inaugural Address     On Inauguration day  they arrived early to get through the security checkpoint  Two and a half hours later  the students cleared security but were then told by security that they could not enter the National Mall without tickets  Their tour guide did not have any answers  and merely brought the students to stand outside the Canadian Embassy where they neither witnessed the Inauguration  nor heard the Presidential Address  The company has thus far refused the school s request for a partial refund       Schumer  s office quickly investigated and found the same Virginia travel agent sold misleading tour packages to both schools  WorldStridesTM promotional materials say the company is devoted to  Enriching Students  Lives  by extending education into the worldwide classroom and providing the best opportunity for learning through seeing  experiencing  and interacting  They also call themselves   A Company You Can Trust    and the   largest and most trusted educational student travel company in the country      http   www worldstride com mission default asp        Schumer yesterday referred the case to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York  Roslynn Mauskopf and to the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission  Deborah Platt Majoras  Because this Virginia company appears to have wronged students in New York  this interstate matter falls under the jurisdiction of both authorities  A copies of Schumer  s letters are attached         I was shocked to hear the same company was involved with the Hicksville and Lindenhurst cases   We do not yet know how many other schools were similarly treated by this company  but I expect we will hear of more cases in the coming days     Schumer wrote to Mauskopf and Majoras       Schumer was joined by students  parents  and teachers from both Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville and Lindenhurst High School at Holy Trinity       Schumer also urged any other schools or students affected by this situation to contact his Long Island office at 631 753 0978
