IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 4  2005 Schumer  Feds Must Speed Up Creation Of Resource Center For Western New York Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Resource Center Would Help Nuclear Workers Suffering from Cancer to Cut Through Layers of Red Tape and Receive Federal Compensation  Center Could Take Months to Open  Schumer Urges Feds to Act Quickly US Senator Charles E Schumer today urged the Department of Labor to expedite its establishment of a resource center in Western NY to help nuclear workers secure compensation from the federal government  The Center  mandated by a Schumer provision in the 2005 Spending Bill  could take as long as nine months to open  In a letter to Mr  Shelby Hallmark  the Director of the Labor Department  s Office of Workers   Compensation Programs  Schumer pushed for an accelerated timetable         The first step was to get the Resource Center included in last year  s spending bill   Schumer said   But the next step is make sure it is opened as soon as possible  New York  s Cold War Heroes got dangerously ill from helping develop the country s nuclear weapons program  and should not have to wait any longer for help  I want to make sure they get the assistance they need  so they can get the compensation they deserve        In November 2004  Schumer successfully secured a mandate from Congress that establishes a resource center intended to provide Western New Yorkers with the support that they need to effectively navigate the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  Senator Schumer s language will establish a new resource center in Western New York that would help sick nuclear workers with their compensation applications  Schumer who has lambasted the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  for only paying out ten percent of claims to New York nuclear workers  said that the resource center was  vital to assist local nuclear workers with the application process       During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help  Workers at these facilities handled high levels of radioactive materials and were responsible for helping to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War  Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer       In an effort to compensate these workers  Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allowed them to file claims with the US Department of Labor for individual payments of  150 000 and other benefits for medical treatments  Workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War were eligible  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history       As of February 1  2004  the number of claims submitted to the Department of Labor under subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 from the western New York region  including western Pennsylvania  exceeded the number of such claims filed at resource centers in Hanford  Washington  Portsmouth  Ohio  Los Alamos  New Mexico  the Nevada Test Site  Nevada  the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site  Colorado  the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory  Idaho  and the Amchitka Test Site  Alaska  Western New York is home to 14 former Atomic Weapon Employers  AWE  sites and DOE clean up facilities  see below        Even though Western New York has a large number of facilities  the only assistance applicants in the region now receive to wade through layers of red tape is from a traveling resource center that comes to the area infrequently to serve current and former nuclear workers  EEOICPA Section 3631 requires DOL to provide outreach and claimant assistance       Schumer said that a permanent facility is needed in Western New York  not only to increase awareness of the program among area residents  but to help serve workers throughout the clamaint process  A resource center assists workers in filing claims  gathering information about their work history  and other work related records necessary to file a claim for review  Eleven resource centers have been set up by DOE and the Department of Labor  DOL  near DOE facilities across the country to help workers file applications       People affected
