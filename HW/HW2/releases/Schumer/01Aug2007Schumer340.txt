                                 After Months of Industry Scandal  Sunlight Must be Shed on Private Loan Industry to Protect New York Students and Families    Private Student Loan Reform Bill Would Require a  Schumer Box  to Detail Loan Amounts  Interest Rates and Other Payment Terms in Simple  Easy to Read Table                                                                                                                     In light of recent scandals within the private student loan industry and the general lack of transparency in the student loan application process  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  today announced that the Banking Committee passed significant provisions of his bill  the Private Student Loan Disclosure Act of 2007  The provisions were passed as part of the Private Student Loan Transparency and Improvement Act of 2007  offered by Senator Dodd and passed by a Banking Committee vote  Modeled after successful credit card disclosure legislation that Schumer passed as a U S  Representative in 1988  the student loan disclosure bill would create a Schumer Box on loan documents  a simple  easy to read table outlining key loan terms that are often buried in fine print and pages of text  The disclosures  which will be provided on applications  approval documents  and closing documents  will contain information such as loan amounts  interest rates  maximum monthly payments and payment terms  They will explain in a concise and clear way exactly how much a student will owe including interest  in order to pay off the loan  The Schumer legislation also provides a 30 day shopping period for borrowers after they have been approved for a loan  During this time  the lender cannot alter the terms of the loan  allowing students and their families to comparison shop between various lenders to ensure that they are obtaining the loan that is the best deal and the best fit for their needs   Instead of getting a full ride  far too many students are being taken for a ride when it comes to the private student loan industry  Schumer said  Students are often unaware of the terms of their loans  and wind up boxed into paying back their tuition at steep and unaffordable interest rates  With an increasing number of college students and their families using private student loans to pay for their college expenses  we need to make sure that students and their families get complete and unbiased information on all of their options  Including a Schumer Box at various stages in the loan process will allow students to better compare their options  and fully understand the agreements they sign   Earlier this year  news stories began to emerge implicating university administrators in a kick back scandal involving stock options and even direct gifts in exchange for steering students towards certain lending agencies  New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has spearheaded the investigation into private student lending companies and their practices  In response  many universities have entered into a voluntary student loan code of conduct agreement  but there is still no federal legislation that regulates private student loan agencies  Just last month  Attorney General Cuomo and Senator Schumer both spoke about this issue before the Senate Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs   Nearly 2 out of every 3 students nationwide have student loan debt  up from less than one half in 1993  And  the actual amount of debt from undergraduate loans has also skyrocketed  Over the past decade  debt levels for graduating seniors more than doubled from  9 250 to  19 200  a 58  increase after accounting for inflation   Student loan debt can affect a students livelihood for decades after graduation  Outstanding loans can limit post collegiate career options  delay the purchase of a home or a car  and discourage graduates from starting a family  In the most extreme cases  burdensome debt can cause some students to default  resulting in lifelong ruined credit   The Schumer Box originated as a provision of the Fair Credit and Credit Card Disclosure Act of 1988  which Senator Schumer authored while a member of the House of Representatives  It was the first law to mandate that credit card agreements include a simple table or box of important information such as APRs  transaction fees  annual fees and grace periods
