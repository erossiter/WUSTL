IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 18  2007 In The Wake Of New Upstate NY Freight Rail Accidents  Schumer Announces He Will Reintroduce Comprehensive Rail Safety Bill  Calls For Nationwide Overhaul Of Degrading Infrastructure                                                                                                                                                                                                                            With Four Rail Accidents in Upstate NY in Less than a Month  Senator Finds Federal Government Still Asleep at the Switch When It Comes to Freight Train Safety    Will Renew His Push in the 110th Congress   New York  s Freight Rail Infrastructure is Old and Deteriorating    Legislation Calls for Nationwide Structural Review and Creates Strict Age Limits for HAZMAT Rail Cars   East Ro On the heels of Tuesday night  s freight train derailment in East Rochester and a recent rash of accidents across upstate New York  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today warned that the potentially disastrous accident could be just the tip of the iceberg if the federal government doesn  t move quickly to improve freight rail infrastructure in the Rochester area and across the country   Today  Schumer announced he will reintroduce in the new congress his bi partisan Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  comprehensive rail safety and security legislation  which would direct millions of dollars in new funding to improve rail infrastructure         The federal government is quite literally asleep at the switch when it comes to protecting our communities from deadly train derailments     Schumer said    This incident reminds us that there are thousands of gallons of extremely dangerous chemicals rumbling through Rochester area communities   What we need is a real plan to protect our communities    and tougher penalties for railroad companies who disregard our safety          Thirteen cars on a CSX train left the tracks last night in the village of East Rochester  No one was injured  but at least two motorists were nearly hit by falling trailers that were dislodged from their train cars   After another freight train derailed on Tuesday in Kentucky  hazardous chemicals aboard caught fire  sending 11 people to the hospital       Earlier this month  a CSX tanker car carrying more than 20 000 gallons of methanol caught fire in the CSX rail yard in Selkirk  The tanker car was being held adjacent to more than two dozen other cars carrying the dangerous and highly flammable chemical  but thankfully the fire did not spread   More than 50 homes within a mile radius of the accident were evacuated         This is one of three major accidents on upstate New York  s freight lines in less than a month   Two weeks ago  two tanker cars carrying butane derailed in Gang Mills in the Southern Tier   Though the tanker cars did not leak the hazardous chemicals  local first responders reported that the cars were highly unstable because the gravel that supports the track had been damaged   Several employees were evacuated from the scene   Had the chemicals leaked  the accident could have been very dangerous       In early December  a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailed near the Norfolk Southern Yard outside Buffalo  Three of the 55 cars jumped the tracks and two flipped over   Though none of the cars contained hazardous materials  had there been dangerous chemicals on board  the accident could have been a full blown disaster       The Rochester area has a long history of freight rail accidents  In 2001 a CSX train crashed in Rochester  derailing 23 cars  three of which spilled thousands of toxic chemicals into the Genesee River  Sixteen months after the accident  Schumer made a direct appeal to CSX President and CEO Michael Ward  asking him to stop delaying and pay to clean up the spilled chemicals and remove all the toxic sediment from the river  Currently  the clean up is in its final phase as CSX contractors have removed more than 2 000 tons of contaminated sediment from the river  However  this accident could have been far more tragic had the chemicals spilled in to a neighborhood or a crowded community area       Schumer said that inadequate safety precautions put hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near rail lines at risk  According to Federal Railroad Administration statistics  there have been 63 rail accidents  30 derailments  14 casualties and 383 total injuries last year nationwide       Schumer also said that current rail safety measures and the prevalence of manual switches along rail lines provide inadequate protection for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near the state  s 3 695 miles of freight rail tracks  Manual switches were to blame for the deadly 2005 Graniteville  South Carolina derailment where chlorine leaked from the rail yard in to the neighboring community   The Gang Mills accident also occurred in the rail yard where the chemical tanker cars were being held       From January to September of 2006  there were three more accidents in New York State caused by problems with the infrastructure than in the same period in 2005  an increase of 17 6   According to the National Transportation Atlas Database  more than 2 02 million tons of chemicals are transported on New York  s rail networks every year        To protect New Yorkers from a potential railroad disaster  Schumer today announced that he is going to reintroduce his bipartisan comprehensive railroad legislation that he wrote after the deadly Graniteville  South Carolina rail disaster in 2004   Schumer  s legislation  the Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  co sponsored by Senator Lindsey O  Graham  R SC   sets tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology   The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and require the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents       The bill sets strict age restrictions for cars carrying hazardous materials by requiring every car be inspected and upgraded every fifteen years   In addition  all rail cars fifteen years or older currently in use must be inspected and brought up to federal code within one year  Schumer  s legislation would also create a new infrastructure grant program that would authorize  50 million in federal funding to complete vital infrastructure improvements
