IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 14  2006 Schumer Announces Banking Committee Unanimously Passes Bill To Protect Military Service Members From Predatory Sales Practices And Bogus Insurance Plans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Legislation Tightens Restrictions on Insurance Agents Investment Advisers  and Other Financial Service Providers to Prevent them from Pushing Disadvantageous Plans on Military Bases in the US and Abroad   Schumer  Original Sponsor of Bill  Secured Three Additional Provisions to Prevent Insurance Companies from Raiding Soldiers   Savings Accounts and Require DOD  SEC and Others to Update Financials U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today that the Senate Banking Committee unanimously passed comprehensive legislation to protect military service personnel and veterans from abusive and predatory sales practices  investment advisers and insurance agents who push disadvantageous or misleading plans  The bipartisan bill would mandate clearer disclosure for brokers on military installations  create a database of investment advisors who operate on bases  and requires the Defense Department to establish standards with state regulators to provide protections for service members         The bottom line is we need to ensure that our military families   finances are protected  plain and simple Schumer said    Servicemen  women  and their families have an enormous burden to bear and they shouldn  t have to worry about a salesmen knocking on their door and selling them something that could empty their pockets  This legislation will give the federal government the tools it needs to crack down on these predators and scam artists       The Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act  S  418   originally sponsored by Schumer and Senators Hillary Clinton  D NY   Michael Enzi  R WY   Chuck Hagel  R NE   protects military personnel and veterans who live on military bases in the United States and abroad from insurance agents and investment advisors who push harmful financial services  Specifically  the legislation bans the issuance and sale of periodic payment plan certificates    a product that has virtually disappeared from the civilian market since the 1980  s because of excessive sales charges        The bill also requires strong disclosures regarding offers or sales of securities and insurance on military bases    these bad actors will no longer be able to act as though their products are recommended  sanctioned  or encouraged by the federal government  They will now have to clearly disclose that they are not  Furthermore  the agents wishing to sell insurance products must disclose the types of subsidized insurance available from the federal government  including the amount of coverage and the costs to service members  The bill will also encourage the State  s to join with the Department of Defense  DOD  to create standards to protect members of the Armed Services from predatory insurance sales practices on military installations       The Securities and Exchange Commission and National Association of Insurance Commissioners would be required to create a comprehensive database of all investment advisors and insurance brokers that operate on military bases  particularly those that have been sited for inappropriate sales practices to ensure that the Department of Defense can monitor their activity on their respective bases        Schumer personally secured three o additional provisions that were included in the final version of the bill  First  his language would combat the negative effects posed by   automatic premium payments    by requiring full disclosure to the military service member and dependents on any financial products that contain automatic premium payment clauses  These payment clauses allow insurance companies to pay off unpaid insurance premiums automatically from a service member  s savings account that is linked to their insurance without their authorization  Although these insurance plans with a savings component sometimes can yield high interest rates  it was found that most military personnel do not benefit because any savings accumulated on these products can then be used to pay the premiums on the insurance if service members ever decide they no longer want their policy and stop making payments and fails to request a refund of their savings        Schumer  s second provision would improve oversight of the sale of financial products  securities and insurance  by calling for coordination between the Department of Defense  SEC  and state insurance regulators  The language requires that these departments and agencies meet at least twice a year to coordinate their activities to implement legislation and monitor enforcement       Schumer also filed an Amendment to create a suitability standard for the sale of life insurance products on military bases  The Committee did not accept the amendment  but agreed to a compromise that would require the Department of Defense Inspector General to conduct a study on the suitability of insurance products being offered and sold to military consumers
