IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 14  2007 In Wake Of Massive Mattel Toy Recall  Schumer Plans Legislation To Create Import Czar  Lax China And U S  Inspections Leave Consumers And Children At Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Millions of Popular Children s Toys Recalled in August all Manufactured in China  Excessive Levels of Lead Paint  Choking Hazards  and Faulty Magnets Threaten Child Safety    With Half Dozen Fed Agencies Supposedly Monitoring Shipments  Schumer Calls for Import Czar      Products Manufactured in China Account for Astounding 60 percent of Consumer Safety Recalls in 2007  Including Vitamins  Chocola Washington  DCIn the wake of massive recalls of popular childrens toys  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced he will introduce legislation to create an import czar to monitor shipments and coordinate the efforts of agencies charged with consumer safety related to imports  A maze of federal regulations and lax safety measures in many Chinese plants has left consumers in danger of buying unsafe products  and weekly recalls of Chinese goods that have already been sold throughout the country show that the system designed to keep dangerous products off store shelves is failing    The fact that every week we have to frantically pull Chinese goods off store shelves shows that our safeguards are failing  Schumer said  There are more than a half dozen federal agencies responsible for monitoring  testing  and blocking dangerous shipments to the U S  It appears as though the phone lines between them are down  because there has been a system wide failure to communicate to protect consumers  We need an import czar to ensure the necessary coordination  and I am drafting legislation to create the post  It is time we brought order to this chaos and protected American consumers from dangerous products   Agencies charged with monitoring  testing and blocking dangerous or tainted products include the FDA  NHTSA  CPSC  U S  Customs and Border Protection  U S  Department of Agriculture  and the United States Trade Representative  Schumer said that this maze of federal oversight prevents the government from effectively stopping dangerous goods from getting through to American consumers  This maze includes cabinet level departments  independent agencies  and administrations within executive agencies  all operating with different regulations  rules  and protocols    As one step in a plan to beef up federal safety protections  Schumer will introduce legislation creating an import czar to focus on the protection of American consumers from tainted and dangerous imports  The Import Czar would   Be installed as part of the Department of Commerce and oversee all matters pertaining to consumer protection of imports including coordinating efforts of the other agencies charged with consumer  safety related to imports    Issue a first ever public report on existing gaps in federal safeguards on imported products and the agencies will then have to report back within six months on their progress closing the identified gaps     Actively monitor the day to day functions of all of agencies responsible for ensuring consumers safety in regards to imported goods   In July  President Bush established a joint task force to investigate import safety  However thetask force is insufficient to tackle this problem and lacks the power to enact any major changes to the failing system because it is charged with merely providing a report andis made upof the same administratorswho are responsible for protecting US consumers now  Schumer s import czar would be a permanent  fully funded post  charged with monitoring the activities of all the agenciesresponsible forscreening and inspecting imports   Schumer also announced that he is writing to the head of CPSC  the Chinese Ambassador  and the major American toy company CEOs to ask what steps they are taking to prevent moretainted toys from reaching the shelves    There is no question that too many Chinese manufacturers and food producers put the bottom line ahead of safety  The CSPC and other agencies regulating the safety of imported goods need to do much more to address this worsening crisis  Schumer said  We need stricter standards  more thorough inspections and harsher penalties for Chinese companies and American shippers that turn a blind eye to safety   The CPSC  which is an independent agency  has initiated three major recalls of childrens toys in August alone  All of those toys were manufactured in China and sold throughout the U S  The recalled items include  967 000 Sesame Street  Dora the Explorer  and other childrens toys imported by Fisher Price and 253 000 Sarge die cast toy cars imported by Mattel that may contain excessive levels of lead  220 stuffed horses and 1 300 fairy dolls on which plastic button eyes and pom pom noses easily detach and create a choking hazard  345 000 Batman and One Piece action figure sets  1 000 000 Doggie Day Care play sets  683 000 Barbie and Tanner play sets  and 7 300 000 Polly Pocket play sets with faulty magnets which can fall out and be swallowed   The latest toy recalls are part of a surge in faulty and hazardous Chinese imports  On June 13  1 5 million wooden Thomas the Tank Engine trains were recalled  On June 19  19 000 childrens necklaces whose clasps were coated in lead paint were recalled  Since January of this year  the CPSC has issued 26 recalls of products  comprising over 8 million units  due to lead hazards  89 percent of which were manufactured in China with 93 percent of those units sold nationwide   In July  Schumer also called for    New labeling standards  Schumer wrote to the head of the FDA asking him to immediately implement new rulesrequiring all food  vitamin  and cosmetic companies to list out the origin of all ingredients that come from outside the United States  Four years ago  Congress passed a law requiring food to be labeled for its country of origin  But that doesn t extend to individual food ingredients  China has become the leading supplier of many food ingredients  such as apple juice  garlic and garlic powder  sausage casings and cocoa butter  China now supplies 80 percent of the world s vitamin C     Overhaul FDA Foreign Food Inspections  Right now  the FDA announces 90  of its inspections on foreign manufacturing facilities weeks in advance  With this advance notice  many facilities can clean up their act in time  In addition  FDA guidance on the inspection of drug manufacturing facilities abroad that said that sample collection is not required during inspections at foreign facilities  Schumer urged the FDA to stop giving Chinese manufacturers prior notice of inspections and to collect sample products when inspecting foreign facilities    Mandate Overseas Inspections for Other Agencies  Currently  NHTSA and the CPSC do not require that products entering this country  such as tires in the case of NHTSA or toys in the case of CPSC  to undergo inspections in their point of origin  In addition  the plants that these products are manufactured in are not subject to spot checks  Because of this  these Chinese plants have no incentive to clean up their act  Schumer urged the NHTSA and the CPSC to mandate overseas inspections for facilities abroad    More Rigid Food Safety Requirements  In May  Schumer co sponsored an amendment proposed bySenator Dick Durbin  D IL  that establishes an early warning and notification system for contaminated food  creates a system of fines for companies that dont report contaminated food products in a timely matter  and improves the inspections and monitoring of imported food This amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 94 0
