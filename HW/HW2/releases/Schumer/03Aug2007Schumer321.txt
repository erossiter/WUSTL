                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          New Fellowship Will Recruit the Best and Brightest to Serve in an Elite Teaching Corps  Encourage More Young People to Study Math and Science    Bill Helps Pioneering New York Program Go National  NYC Program Alone Will Support at Least 440 Teachers By 2011    Program Will Foster a New Generation of Math and Science Students to Help America Compete in the Global Economy                        Today  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that the National Science Foundation  NSF  Teaching Fellowship program  based on his Math for America model  is one step closer to becoming law  Yesterday  both the House of Representatives and the Senate passed the bills conference report which included two programs  the National Science Foundation  NSF  Teaching Fellows program and the NSF Master Teaching Fellows program  both based on Schumers Math for America  a proposal to improve high school math and science education by encouraging recruitment and retention of talented and dedicated math and science teachers  The President is expected to sign the bill into law   This bill is about paving the way for the future  Schumer said  The advance of technology means that increasingly  our children will be competing for jobs with people from all over the world  Our biggest problem is that students in the U S  are lagging behind in math and science  and the needs of the high tech  math and science based industries are expected to continue to grow over the next decade  The best way to ensure that we will be able to meet these needs is to recruit top math and science talent to teach in our schools  This fellowship will provide incentives to the best and brightest scientists and mathematicians to teach in our public schools  and encourage a new generation of students to learn the skills they will need to compete globally   In 2003  a PISA math assessment comparing 15 year old students in the U S  to those in 28 other countries showed disturbing results  out of the 29 participating countries  the U S  ranked 24th  Furthermore  according to the U S  National Science Foundation  employment in the high tech industry grew by 50 percent between 1990 and 2002  and the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that demand for science and engineering workers in America will grow at least three times as fast as the overall economy in the next ten years  The U S  currently does not have enough science and engineering specialists to fulfill the needs of the high tech industry  Prospective teachers with strong math and science backgrounds  as well as working teachers who have solid expertise in their fields  are often lured away from teaching by more lucrative and prestigious opportunities in the private sector  As members ofthis national initiative  participants will create an environment of enthusiasm and solidarity  enhanced by the prestige of their fellowship and the financial incentives it will provide   The goal of the program is to create a corps of highly qualified math and science teachers  ensuring that studentsacross the country receive the best preparation possible in these most vital fields   Math for America is the brainchild of Dr  James H  Simons  an MIT and Berkeley trained mathematician who has conducted research and taught at SUNY Stony Brook  Princeton  MIT and Harvard  Modeled after Dr  Simons successful New York based program by the same name  Schumers bi partisan proposal as included in the COMPETES Act would create two programs  NSF Teaching Fellows program and the NSF Master Teaching Fellows Program  The first fellowship is available to math and science professionals  while the second is designed for existing teachers who already hold a masters degree in math or science education  Both fellowships require applicants to go through a highly rigorous application process to demonstrate their expertise   If selected to the NSF Teaching Fellows program  professionals receive a scholarship to attend a one year Masters degree program in education that results in certification  They then commit to teaching for four years in a high need school  and receive bonus payments on top of their salaries  Existing teachers receiving fellowships will get the bonus payments in return for serving for at least five years and acting as leaders in their schools  Schumer s provisions in the COMPETES Act are based on his bipartisan Math and Science Teaching Corps Act  which he introduced last year with Congressman Jim Saxton  It is modeled after a highly successful program in New York City called Math for America  which currently operates a similar program at a local level
