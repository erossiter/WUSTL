IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 9  2006 Schumer Reveals  In Simple Steps Terrorists Can Forge Boarding Pass And Board Any Plane Without Breaking The Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Simple Way to Change Boarding Pass Allows ANYONE to Board Airplane Undetected   Schumer to Unveil Bill to Make Forging  Buying  and Using a Fake Boarding Pass a Federal Offense As checking in online and printing boarding passes at home has become a preferred way for airplane passengers to get their travel documents  today Senator Schumer revealed that terrorists can board planes in simple steps by forging their boarding passes and that forging those documents is not a federal offense  Schumer today unveiled a bill that will close this gaping hole in aviation security by making it a federal crime to alter or fake a boarding pass or other travel document in order to deceive the travel agencies into letting one on a plane or train        The fact that the Feds can teach dogs to sniff bombs  but hasn  t even noticed that forging boarding passes isn  t illegal is beyond the pale     Schumer said    We have spent millions of dollars upgrading equipment  staffing airports and train stations and improving our intelligence capabilities  We have upgraded our homeland security efforts to the Nth degree and terrorists can still board planes  fly among the masses and never be prosecuted        The no fly list was created to keep terrorists and even suspect individuals off of planes but by taking a few simple steps in a home computer anyone can evade that watch list and get on any plane they want   Schumer  s legislation will make it a federal crime  generally punishable by up to three years in prison  to alter or fake a boarding pass or other travel document in order to deceive the travel agencies into letting one on a plane or train     A recent J D  Power and Associates study found that more than half of airline passengers are taking advantage of time saving check in options  with 38 percent currently using self check in kiosks and 17 percent checking in online through airline websites  In New York that translates to about 20 million people between Newark Liberty  LaGuardia and JFK     Last year  Schumer also raised concerns about loophole in security procedures at commercial airports that allow a potential terrorist to board a plane without being noticed by airport personnel or being flagged by the terrorist watch list  He outlined the following scenario     1  Joe Terror  whose name is on the terrorist watch list  buys a ticket online in the name of Joe Thompson using a stolen credit card  Joe Thompson is not listed on the terrorist watch list     2  Joe Terror then prints his   Joe Thompson    boarding pass at home  and then electronically alters it  either by scanning or altering the original image  depending on the airline system and the technology he uses at home  to create a second almost identical boarding pass under the name Joe Terror  his name     3  Joe Terror then goes to the airport and goes through security with his real ID and the FAKE boarding pass  The name and face match his real drivers license  The airport employee matches the name and face to the real ID     4  The TSA guard at the magnetometer checks to make sure that the boarding pass looks legitimate as Joe Terror goes through  He she does not scan it into the system  so there is still no hint that the name on the fake boarding pass is not the same as the name on the reservation     5  Joe Terror then goes through the gate into his plane using the real Joe Thompson boarding pass for the gate  s computer scanner  He is not asked for ID again to match the name on the scanner  so the fact that he does not have an ID with that name does not matter   Since Joe Thompson doesn  t actually exist it does not coincide with a name on the terrorist watch list  Joe Terror boards the plane  no questions asked       The bottom line here is that  currently  anyone forging a boarding pass  including a terrorist  is treated like a 19 year old who makes a fake ID to buy a 6 pack of beer  My bill will make sure they are treated like what they really are  federal criminals        Schumer  s bill to close this loophole will be introduced after the Easter recess     One year ago Schumer wrote to the TSA and asked for them to clear up this problem  but there has been no change  In another letter to TSA Administrator Kip Hawley  the Senator renewed his call on the TSA to require another identification check to the boarding pass scan at the gate to ensure that the name on the scanned boarding pass  the passengers identification  and the person boarding the plane are the same  This proposal would replicate the security precautions taken immediately after September 11th  but are no longer in practice  Anybody trying to board a flight would present their boarding pass and identification together two times  upon going through the security line and then again when boarding the plane  foiling the   Joe Terror    scenario outlined above
