IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 5  2007 After Massive China Toy Recall  Schumer Pushes Legislation to Ban Unsafe Toys From NYC Store Shelves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator Backs Bill to Ban Imported Children s Products if They Aren t First Tested and Certified by an Independent Group          New Recall Includes Nearly 1 Million More Lead Contaminated Toys Comes on the Heels of Dozens of Other Chinese Manufactured Toy Recalls         Schumer Blasts Administration for Crippling Consumer Protection Agency   More Spent to Check Animal Feed than Children s Toys Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced his support for new legislation to ban imported childrens products from being imported and sold in the United States if they arent first tested and certified by an independent group  Late last night  Mattel Inc   the world s largest toymaker  announced its third recall in five weeks after finding about 848 000 Chinese made Barbie and Fisher Price products with paint that may contain excessive levels of lead  It is the latest in a wave of recalls that has heightened global concern about the safety of Chinese made products  In addition to this new legislation  earlier this year Schumer called for the creation of an Import Czar to overhaul the U S  food and consumer import safety system   There is no question that these recalls call in to question our ability to keep dangerous toys out of the hands of our kids  Schumer said  The fact that every week we have to frantically pull Chinese goods off store shelves shows that our safeguards are failing and we need to act fast to fix them  Too many Chinese toy manufacturers put the bottom line ahead of safety as their government continues to look the other way  We need to beef up our safety inspections and standards before more kids and their families are put in danger   Right now the U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  allows manufacturers to inspect and OK their own childrens products  The Schumer backed legislation  authored by Senator Bill Nelson  D FL  would require third party testing of imported and domestic toys and goods for children five years of age or younger  Called the Children s Products Safety Act of 2007  the bill would require all toys or products intended for use by children 5 years of age or under to have a certificate of compliance with consumer products safety standards issued by an independent  third party testing agency and ban uncertified imports from entering the U S   In addition to this latest recall  Schumer said there have also been three CPSC recalls just this June for lead contamination all for products manufactured in China and sold in New York  5 300 units of earrings sold at Kmart coated in lead paint were recalled on June 12  1 5 million units of wooden Thomas the Tank Engine trains were recalled on June 13  and 19 000 childrens necklaces whose clasps were coated in lead paint were recalled on June 19  From January of this year  the CPSC has issued 26 recalls of products comprising over 8 million units due to lead hazards  89 percent of which were manufactured in China with 93 percent of those units sold nationwide  including New York   A large and diverse number of consumer products were recalled during the first eight months of this year  many involving children s products  There were 247 recalls involving 48 7 million units from 1 January through 24 August 2007  with imported products accounting for a commanding 83 0 percent of the recalls issued  205  and 75 6 percent of the total number of recalled products  36 8 million units   Imports from mainland China accounted for approximately 62 percent of all recalls issued during this period  with a total of 154 recalls covering 33 6 million units   A recent Chicago Tribune analysis of all lead recalls in the past 30 years since lead paint was banned in the U S  found 133 recalls  the vast majority of which involved Chinese manufactured products  The items range from baby cribs and children s furniture to children s clothing and boys  toys  Of the 65 recalls for items containing lead paint  more than half of them have occurred since January 2004  More than 80 percent of the items came from China  There have been another 68 recalls for products containing lead itself  totaling more than 175 millions items  primarily children s jewelry   Schumer today also blasted the Bush Administration from severely limiting the budget of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  the supposed agency in charge of keeping childrens toys safe  The CPSCs budget this year is only  62 million  a far cry from the  which spends nearly twice as much monitoring and inspecting animal feed and drugs than the Consumer Product Safety Commission spends to ensure the safety of toys  tools and televisions used every day by millions of Americans   Schumer also said that Mattel Inc  is regarded as an industry leader with respect to the safety of its products and the oversight of its plants and that if such a mistake occurs at a Mattel plant  problems could be far worse at plants owned and operated by less diligent companies
