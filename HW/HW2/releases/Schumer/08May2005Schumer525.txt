IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 8  2005 Tens Of Thousands Die Each Year Waiting For Bone Marrow Donor  Schumer Announces New Federal Umbilical Cord Blood Program  Will Save Lives Of NY  ers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Program will Turn   Medical Waste into Medical Miracles       Senator to be Joined by Cord Blood Recipients Whose Lives Have Been Saved  Donors  and Doctors Because at least 20 000 people are diagnosed each year with fatal diseases that require a bone marrow donor and most die waiting for a match  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a new sweeping federal plan to coordinate the donation of umbilical cord blood  a viable and more accessible alternative to bone marrow  Umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells  which are the building blocks of the immune system and can be used to treat a variety of life threatening diseases  Cord blood stem cells have the ability to treat the same diseases as bone marrow with a much better rate of success  Cord blood stem cells are the perfect alternative because they are less mature than marrow cells so they do not require a perfect genetic match to be used in a transplant         This is exactly as it sounds  turning medical waste into medical miracles  What a wonderful gift to call for on Mother  s Day  Mothers bringing one new life into the world  can possibly save another one by donating their umbilical cord blood     said Schumer    If we standardize the process  there  s no reason why nearly every mother can  t donate          Blood from umbilical cords  a byproduct of birth  is a rich source of hematopoietic  HEM  AT OH POE  ET IC  progenitor cells  The only other place this type of stem cell is found is in bone marrow  Transplants of the stem cells have been used to cure a variety of lethal blood diseases ranging from leukemia to sickle cell anemia  Bone Marrow donors are difficult to find for sick patients because a perfect match is usually required between donor and recipient  Cord blood stem cells  however  are less mature than those in bone marrow and can be successfully used even when there is not a perfect match       About 20 public cord blood banks operate in the US  but there are no government standards to ensure that the cells are collected  processed and stored properly and the system for obtaining cord blood is fragmented  In addition  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  classifies cord blood transplantation as an experimental therapy rather than a licensed therapy  Finally  with no single registry for cord blood  searches can be tedious and even impossible       Cord blood stem cell transplants have saved the lives of roughly 20 000 Americans with fatal blood diseases  Unfortunately  thousands of patients who might benefit from these transplants die every year waiting for a bone marrow match unaware of the cord blood option  and possibly unable to access it  Experts say it offers a more effective form of therapy than stem cells derived from bone marrow       Cord blood is not being utilized to its full potential to treat life threatening diseases for several reasons  One reason is that the public does not know enough about the possibilities of cord blood treatment and its life saving potential  As a result of the lack of public awareness  cord blood donations do not occur as frequently as they could and this leads to a limited availability in the cord blood banks  Right now that number is about 50 000 units  an amount that does not give doctors enough options in finding compatible matches for patients most in need       Today Schumer introduced a new  sweeping federal umbilical cord blood program  He will           Cosponsor The Cord Blood Stem Cell Act  which would create a network of qualified cord blood banking centers to prepare  store  and distribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the treatment of patients and to support research using such cells           Request that the FDA create a process for licensure of FDA approved cord blood banks  Schumer will recommend that the New York Blood Center  because of its prominence in the cord blood community be the first licensed cord blood bank  which would then be used as a model to set the standards for licensure for other cord blood banks           Increase awareness in the public as well as the medical field through education and training  Obstetricians need to know more about how to collect the blood  and pregnant women should be informed about the option to donate before getting to the third trimester            Establishing the New York Blood Center as a National Resource Center of practices and standards that other cord blood banks can utilize as a model        The bottom line is that there has always been a great deficit of bone marrow  and people find it almost impossible to find a match  By making cord blood more accessible we  ll be able to help people who are in grave need  We have bi partisan bill that would do just that  By next Mother  s Day we should have a National Cord Blood Network up and running  helping to save thousands of lives          There are approximately 180 000 units of cord blood stored in banks across the country  The Institute of Medicine figures that 50 000 units of the 180 000 currently in inventory are usable  with 62  from Caucasian donors  But  at least 150 000 usable units are needed to meet demand  The problem is compatibility  which experts say is determined by six surface proteins  or HLA markers  on each cell  The more closely the markers on the donor s cells match those of the recipient  the less likely it is that the patient s body will reject the transplant  Transplant recipients  especially African and Asian minorities  are much more likely to find a compatible donor if the supply of cord blood is tripled  While cord blood has been used in pediatric transplants for several years  it is only now starting to gain traction in the adult community      In addition to patients with leukemia  cord blood is now being used to treat over 60 other fatal immune and blood diseases  These include  severe combined immune deficiency    boy in the bubble syndrome      lymphoma  adrenoleukodystrophy  Lorenzo  s Oil Disease   and Sickle Cell Anemia among others       Cord blood also offers an extraordinary amount of hope for African Americans  who have the lowest success rate of finding non related bone marrow donors  The ethnic diversity of the bone marrow registry is quite low  although African American  s make up 12  of the population  they only account for 6  of the bone marrow registry  Many African Americans also have both European and African ancestry with puts them at a disadvantage because a person with both tissue types has much more difficulty finding a match  Because of the diversity of tissue types  African Americans would require three times the number of donors as a Caucasian to have the same chance of finding a match  Cord blood is a particularly good choice for this community because it doesn  t require a perfect match       Schumer was joined today by Anthony Dones  who was saved by a cord blood transplant  and his mom Tracy  Romona Shih  a mother who donated her Cord Blood  Dr  Pablo Rubenstein  the Founder and Director of the New York Blood Center  s National Cord Blood Program and Dr  Cladd Stevens  the Medical Director of the New York Blood Center  s National Cord Blood Program       The New York Blood Center  NYBC  is home to the National Cord Blood Program  the world  s first and largest not for profit public cord blood bank  More than 27 000 mothers have donated cord blood to its program  making possible over 1 700 cord blood transplants so far at more than almost 200 Transplant Centers in the United States and 67 other countries  This represents nearly one third of the total number of transplants of nonrelated cord blood in the world thus far
