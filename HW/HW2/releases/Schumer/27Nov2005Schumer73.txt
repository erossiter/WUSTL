IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 27  2005 New Schumer Study  Stores Luring Unsuspecting Consumers To Sign Up For Sky High Interest Rate Credit Cards   Up To 24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As the holiday shopping season heats up  Schumer asks New Yorkers not to fall prey to   too good to be true   store credit card deals   Reputable retail stores routinely tempt shoppers with modest one time discounts that are quickly erased by shockingly high interest rates As we rush into the intense holiday shopping season  U S  Senator Charles Schumer released a  today showing that interest rates charged by store credit cards in New York City are significantly higher than those charged by bank issued credit cards  Schumer is calling for increased vigilance by shoppers to make sure they are not being lured by   too good to be true   deals in a broad range of stores around the city        A store credit card is like a wolf in sheep s clothing   Schumer said   You might think you re getting a real bargain at the register but just wait until the bill comes  Consumers could be in for an unwelcome New Year s surprise if they fall prey to these high credit card rates  As the holiday shopping season revs up  shoppers must beware of the pitfalls of these high rate cards         According to the Schumer   several retail stores in New York City offer consumers a modest discount at the register in order to lure consumers into accepting store credit cards  Typically  these retailers knock off 10 to 15 percent on the first purchase  Those savings can quickly turn into a big loss if the customer does not pay off the credit card balance in full each month  or if payments are made late  which results in additional fees        Schumer s  of 23 New York retailers includes data on store credit card interest rates and grace periods  including stores selling men  s and women  s clothing  electronics  furniture  and house wares  Almost all of the stores charge rates over 20   well above the average bank issued credit card rate of 10 13        The highest rate in the  was found at Sears  which charges 24 15   on all purchases on its store issued credit card  Six different stores    Ann Taylor  Express  Victoria s Secret  Lane Bryant  Abercrombie and Fitch  and Lerner New York    each offer credit cards at 22 8   Only four of the 23 stores surveyed offered an interest rate below 20     Banana Republic  Crate   Barrel  Filene  s Basement  and Kohl  s       Schumer s  showed that  over time  consumers who make purchases on store issued credit cards can easily pay hundreds of dollars more in interest payments  A shopper who spent  300 using a retail store credit card with an annual percentage rate  APR  of 22 8  and only paid the minimum monthly payment on their Ann Taylor credit card would pay up to  115 28 over 39 months  The average APR for these store issued credit cards is almost 22   Shoppers who charged on their regular bank credit card would pay far less in interest         You don t need to be Albert Einstein to know that higher interest rates mean bigger bills   Schumer said   Consumers should be wary of deals that seem too good to be true  When you sign up for a store credit card because you  re getting ten percent off your first purchase    after the bill comes it can turn into a ten percent additional cost if you don  t pay it off right away         Schumer said that consumers must beware of the high rates and urged shoppers to take steps to protect themselves            Shoppers should avoid using store issued credit cards whenever possible            If a consumer is interested in signing up for a store credit card  the consumer should be sure to ask the sales representative about the details of the credit line s interest rate and fees            Bills should be paid in full and on time if customers are to avoid paying exorbitant interest        Schumer will send a letter tomorrow morning to the Federal Trade Commission  FTC   urging the agency to examine the lending practices of retail credit cards  In the letter  Schumer will ask the FTC to formally recommend specific steps that retail stores could take to protect their customers            Retail store promotional material should advertise the store s credit card interest rate and terms as prominently as they display the initial discount            Sales representatives should inform consumers verbally of the credit card s interest rate  and explain that the rate is higher than a typical bank issued credit card             Retailers should avoid luring college students and young adults who do not have established credit ratings into accepting store credit cards        Click here to view
