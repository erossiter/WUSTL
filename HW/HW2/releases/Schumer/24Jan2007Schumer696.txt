IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 24  2007 Following State Of The Union  Schumer Reveals Raise In Cafe Standards Could Have Saved Upstate NY  2 4 Billion    Announces New Energy Policy Overhaul                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Had the Feds Mandated Higher Mileage Standards for Cars and Trucks in 2001  Upstate New Yorkers Would Have Consumed One Billion Fewer Gallons of Gasoline by 2012  Saving Drivers At Least  2 4 Billion     With New Leadership in Congress  Schumer Announces Push for Long Overdue National Energy Policy Overhaul    Legislation to Raise CAFE Standards  Increase Domestic Production  and Repeal A On the heels of last night  s State of the Union Address  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced his plan to overhaul national energy policy in the 110th Congress and released a new  showing that  had the federal government gradually increased Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards starting in 2001  upstate New York drivers would have consumed nearly one billion fewer gallons of gas  saving them more than  2 4 billion by 2012   After this summer  s dramatic spike in oil and gas prices  Schumer said that the federal government is years behind in improving fuel economy standards  as the average vehicle on the road had better gas mileage in 1986 than it does now   Today  Schumer announced new legislation to raise CAFE standards  increase production  and repeal all big oil company tax breaks and direct the savings toward alternative energy research and development         The failure to overhaul America  s energy policy not only threatens our national security  but it  s put a deep hole in our wallets     Schumer said    The fact that CAFE standards have remained basically level for more than two decades shows that we have not done nearly enough to promote conservation in this country   In the age of sky high prices  we need to aggressively find ways to wean ourselves off foreign oil  for our environment  for our security  and for our bottom line          During last night  s State of the Union Address  President George W  Bush announced a goal of slashing gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 by increasing the amount of ethanol and other alternative fuels the federal government mandates must be produced  The rest of the reduction he said will come from raising fuel economy standards for passenger cars       Schumer said that while support for an increase in CAFE standards is very important and a welcome announcement  actually raising the standards significantly is long over due   Schumer today released a new report showing that had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001 up to 36 1 miles per gallon by 2012  upstate New York drivers would have consumed 972 million fewer gallons of gasoline  saving drivers  2 353 billion total in the age of sky high gas prices  Below is how the numbers break out across upstate            Drivers in the Capital Region would have consumed 138 546 658 fewer gallons of gasoline from 2001 to 2012 had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001  This would have saved drivers  335 282 913            Drivers in Central New York would have consumed 122 596 864 fewer gallons of gasoline from 2001 to 2012 had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001  This would have saved drivers  296 684 412            Drivers in the Rochester    Finger Lakes region would have consumed 155 682 646 fewer gallons of gasoline from 2001 to 2012 had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001  This would have saved drivers  376 752 004            Drivers in the Hudson Valley would have consumed 228 867 783 fewer gallons of gasoline from 2001 to 2012 had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001  This would have saved drivers  553 860 035            Drivers in the North Country would have consumed 72 295 562 fewer gallons of gasoline from 2001 to 2012 had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001  This would have saved drivers  174 995 261            Drivers in the Southern Tier would have consumed 87 430 219 fewer gallons of gasoline from 2001 to 2012 had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001  This would have saved drivers  211 581 131            Drivers in Western New York would have consumed 167 294 384 fewer gallons of gasoline from 2001 to 2012 had CAFE standards been raised incrementally starting in 2001  This would have saved drivers  404 852 409       Studies show that the technology is readily available to easily and safely increase fuel efficiency to at least 35 miles per gallon in passenger cars and light trucks  but the federal government has not mandated increases to CAFE standards for passenger cars in decades  In 2006  CAFE standards for light trucks were adjusted for the first time since 1979 to apply a 21 6 mpg to SUVs  pickup trucks and Minivans  but standards for passenger cars have not changed since 1986   CAFE standards for cars are currently 27 5 mpg         The quickest  most efficient way to reduce gas imports and bring down prices is to increase fuel economy standards     Schumer added       Schumer today also said that in order to stabilize oil and gas prices and reduce America  s dependence on foreign oil  the federal government must overhaul its energy policy toward conservation  development of alternative fuels  and tax breaks given to major oil companies       A preliminary study by the RAND Corporation found that the current pace of renewable energy development could reduce projected oil consumption by only 10 percent by 2025  The study says that raising the use of renewables to 25 percent of all U S  energy consumed would reduce U S  reliance on oil by double that or roughly the equivalent of imports from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela        Schumer said that at the same time that American consumers are suffering under high gasoline prices  especially during the summer months  oil companies continue to reap record breaking profits with their executives receiving multi million dollar retirement packages  There is no reason to continue tax policies that provide further tax windfalls to these companies   Moreover  investments in renewable energy production and efficiency have higher returns in terms of jobs created than investments and subsidies for in natural gas production  According to the Apollo Alliance  investing in renewable energy creates four times as many jobs per megawatt of installed capacity as natural gas generation   Apollo also reported that every  1 million invested in energy efficiency creates an estimated 21 5 jobs  compared to 11 5 new jobs for new natural gas generation   In response  Schumer today unveiled his energy priorities for the 110th Congress in order to overhaul the nation  s energy policy            Increase CAFE Standards Incrementally of the Next 10 Years and Promote Domestic Production at the Same Time  Schumer announced he will introduce new legislation that will increase CAFE standards for passenger cars and trucks  while actively working to utilize domestic sources of oil and natural gas   The legislation would increase CAFE standards for all cars from roughly 25 miles per gallon  mpg  right now to 35 mpg for all cars by model year 2017  Senator Schumer  s legislation will also allow for additional exploration and drilling of energy resources in domestic areas  along with significantly increased environmental protection for these areas to encourage new production            Repeal Oil Company Tax Breaks and Direct Savings Toward Alternative Energy Research  Schumer announced new legislation that would repeal all oil company tax breaks and direct the money saved toward the development of alternative fuels in upstate New York and across the country  The new Schumer legislation would eliminate all tax breaks for the major integrated oil companies with revenues in excess of  1 billion including  1  repealing the domestic production tax deduction   2  eliminating the last in  first out inventory  LIFO  accounting method that allows oil companies to low ball the value of their inventory  and  3  denying the foreign tax credit when the major oil company received an economic benefit from a tax paid to a foreign government   All of these changes and other tax breaks in the bill could raise  3 4 billion annually with the savings directed toward new research into alternative energy  or energy R           Promote Ethanol Production in Upstate New York  Schumer announced he is going to reintroduce his Ethanol Stimulus Act that would create a new tax credit designed to spur ethanol production in states that consume more than two percent of U S  gasoline  but produce less than two percent of U S  ethanol  For new production facilities in these states  this bill would give new producers in these states a tax credit of 20 cents per gallon on the first 50 million gallons produced a year  as long as the plant  s total annual ethanol production does not exceed 150 million gallons   The legislation would give tax breaks to companies looking to build ethanol plants in New York California  Texas  and Florida
