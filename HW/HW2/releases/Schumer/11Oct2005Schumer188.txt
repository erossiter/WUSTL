IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 11  2005 Schumer Releases New Survey Of Central New York Gas Prices    Proposes Excess Oil Company Profits Go To Victims Of Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hurricane Related Gas Price Gouging Escalating Costs in Onondaga County  With No Decisive Action  Could Continue For Months    Senator Also Announces   Gouge Watch    Where Citizens Can report Dramatic Increases and Huge Fluctuation in Gas Prices to Website Linked to FTC In light of high gas prices in Central New York  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called for temporary windfall profit levy on oil companies  Schumer released a survey that shows the range of gas prices throughout Onondaga County  and expressed serious concern that people could be profiting in the wake of the devastation caused by recent hurricanes  Schumer  s bill would impose a levy on big oil windfall profits and get revenue to victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita relief efforts  forcing companies to share some of the burden with taxpayers         Once we started to finally understand the breadth of the tragedy of Katrina  Rita came our way     Schumer said    Now  big oil is reaping enormous  excessive profits from consumers who already feel like they need to beg and borrow just to fill up their tank  A windfall profit levy on big oil that produces revenue that will go exclusively to hurricane relief will share the burden and save taxpayer billions of dollars           Schumer released a survey of gas prices throughout County  The survey  which was done on Monday  showed prices as high as  2 99 per gallon  According to AAA  New York gas prices are up 41  since last year  New York State has the high gas prices throughout the country  except for Hawaii and Washington  DC  Though some of the increase in gas prices can be attributed to the interruption in oil and refined gas supplies  and the uncertainties of such an unprecedented and unpredictable event as Hurricane Katrina  Schumer expressed fear that some of the fluctuation and inconsistencies in gas prices are a result of price gouging at the pump        The major oil companies are reaping  7 billion a month in windfall profits resulting from the enormous surge in oil prices  which have gone up over  30 dollars a barrel in since 2004  Experts say the biggest oil companies stand to make  80 billion in windfall profits in the next year       This year  Exxon Mobil  the world s largest publicly traded oil company saw a 2nd quarter profit increase of 32   Royal Dutch Shell PLC  the world s third largest publicly traded oil company had a second quarter profit increase of 34 percent  to  5 24 billion  BP PLC  the second largest  had a second quarter profit that rose 29 percent  to  5 59 billion  ConocoPhillips  the third largest U S  oil company saw profit for that quarter rise 51 percent  to  3 14 billion        Oil companies who are making excessive profits because of Katrina and perhaps Rita should  at the very least  shoulder a fair share of the burden with the taxpayers     Schumer said       Schumer announced his proposal today  which was introduced as the REPAIR Act  Recapture Excess Profits and Invest in Relief  S  1809   The Senator s proposal would impose a 50  excise levy on oil company windfall profits  His plan would put the revenue directly into a Hurricane Rita relief fund that would save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars        Schumer today also unveiled his new  Gouge Watch  where he asked New Yorkers to report all dramatic increases and large fluctuations in gas prices to his webpage that will link their complaints to the FTC  Since complaints of possible gas gouging have not abated Schumer is setting up his website to receive complaints and then send them directly to the Federal Trade Commission  The website is now available at www schumer senate gov        Across the Northeast  gas prices have surged from pre Katrina levels  Market forces have certainly played a role in these prices  but the variety of prices at gas stations and the fact that profits continue to flow to big oil indicate improper pricing  There are currently no federal laws that specifically address price gouging  The state laws that do exist regarding price gouging are usually only triggered in situations arising from a declared emergency       Last month  in an effort to crackdown on any possible price gouging  Schumer called on the Federal Trade Commission to launch a top to bottom investigation to make sure that oil companies and gas station owners and the pipeline in between them are operating ethically and within the law  Though the Federal Trade Commission already monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust violations in the petroleum industry  Schumer called for the immediate formation of a task force to promptly identify the many cases of price gouging being reported across the country  and asked that the task force formulate a process by which price gougers are swiftly prosecuted
