                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Floor Statement  as delivered  of Charles E  Schumer On the Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     January 31  2006    In a few minutes  we will vote on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court  And in just a few hours  we will hear the President tell us about his view of the State of the Union     Without doubt  Judge Alito today has the votes to win confirmation  And  without doubt  the President will tonight boast of his nominee  s victory in this vote     But  I must say that I wish the President was in a position to do more than claim a partisan victory tonight  The Union would be better and stronger and more unified if we were confirming a different nominee  a nominee who could have united us more than divided us     Had he chosen such a person  the President could have taken the lectern this evening and rightfully claimed the mantle of leadership over the United States of America     Instead  this is not a day of triumph for anyone except the conservative minority who caused the President to capitulate to their demands when Harriet Miers was not to their liking     There will be more votes against this nominee than any since Clarence Thomas  who was hardly a unifying figure     Tonight  when the President announces    to applause    the fact of Judge Alito  s confirmation  what he should really hear  because of the partisan nature of his choice  is the sound of one hand clapping     While some may rejoice at Judge Alito  s success  millions of Americans will come to know that the lasting legacy of this day will be ever more power for the President and ever less autonomy for the individual     While some may exult at the packing of the Court with yet another reliable extreme voice in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas  millions of Americans will be at risk of losing their day in court when they suffer the yoke of discrimination     While some may celebrate the elevation of a Judge with a cramped vision of Congressional authority  millions of Americans will suffer the consequences of a jurisprudence that would strip Congress of the power to make their lives better in countless ways     Why then  with so many Americans at risk  with so many rights in jeopardy  will Judge Alito win confirmation today  And what does his confirmation mean for future Supreme Court nominees     I have been thinking long and hard about this important question  I don  t have an easy answer  but several things  I think  are clear     For one thing  even though Judge Alito has a demonstrated record of being well out of the mainstream on a host of issues  my friends from across the aisle have dutifully marched in rigid lockstep when their President nominates even someone who does not share their values and vision     That is why even Republican Senators who should be aghast at Judge Alito  s endorsement of vast executive power and who should be alarmed at his rejection of a woman  s right to choose are nonetheless voting aye     The road will be tougher when the nominee evades    as Judge Alito did    answering questions about his core judicial beliefs  All of the evidence points to the fact that he will still hold his constitutional view that the right to choose is not protected by the constitution  that he still believes the federal government does not have the power to regulate machine guns     And all the evidence supports the conclusion that he will turn the clock back on civil rights  privacy rights  and workers   rights  But he was clever enough not to say so directly  So that  too  has been a factor     In the end  perhaps there is one more thing at work here  The American people have grown accustomed to the umbrella of protections they have under the Constitution  they are loathe to believe that those rights could    with one nominee    evaporate into thin air     Who can believe it  Who wants to believe it     Even though no nominee since Robert Bork has such a clear record in opposition to so many things that the American people hold dear  the public doesn  t want to believe that Judge Alito will remove those protections despite the fact that the record is clear     Who wants to believe that  after 40 years  a single nominee to the Supreme Court could   eviscerate Title VII     one of the most important civil rights laws of our time  And yet that is just what his colleagues on the Third Circuit accused him of attempting to do in one of his dissents     Who wants to believe that a single nominee to the Supreme Court could  with a stroke of the pen  take away average Americans   rights to their day in Court  And yet that is just what his record on the Third Circuit indicates he will do on the Supreme Court     People naturally do not want to believe the worst  People perhaps think of the examples of Earl Warren and David Souter  who defied their presidents and did not strike as hard a line as their benefactors might have hoped     But the days of Warren and Souter are over  The days of stealth nominees whose views might not match the President  s are over  That became clear when a small minority pushed the President to withdraw Harriet Miers     In the coming months and years  Mr  President  we will be watching the Court  We will be watching the votes  We will be watching our two newest Justices     And  make no mistake  we will make sure the American people understand the implications of these votes today     Elections may have consequences  Mr  President  but votes like these also have consequences for future elections  and I believe when the American people see the actual decisions that are rendered by the new court  they will have a strong and countervailing reaction     So  again  I wish that President Bush could tonight claim to lead a united country  but  with this nominee and with this vote  sadly he cannot
