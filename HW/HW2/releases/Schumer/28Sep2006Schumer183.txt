                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Current Control Tower at LGA is Outmoded  has Decades Old Technology and Views that Are Blocked By Nearby Terminal   When Funding Designated for a New Air Traffic Control Tower Was Set to Expire  Schumer  Lowey and Crowley Aggressively Lobbied for Congressional Approval of Funds                                                                                                                 Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  Congresswoman Nita Lowey  and Congressman Joseph Crowley announced that the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  has given final approval for  62 million for a new air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport  Schumer  Lowey and Crowley said the new tower will help ease crippling flight delays at the airport and help controllers manage traffic on the runways in order to prevent more near aircraft collisions  The current control tower at LaGuardia Airport is dilapidated  leaks water  and is equipped with outdated technology and plagued by visibility problems due to a nearby terminal that partially blocks its view  The Senate Appropriations Committee weighed in on the need for the reprogrammed funds for the tower in the Senate TTHUD Appropriations bill report this past July  The House Appropriations Committee sent a letter to the FAA this past week requesting that funding be approved for the LaGuardia control tower  The project  s funding was set to expire by the end of the fiscal year       This funding for a new air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport is now more important than ever     said Senator Schumer    Growing at an unprecedented rate and serving 26 million passengers  LaGuardia is a critical transportation hub  and now it can make the necessary upgrades to guarantee that every step is being taken to provide the best possible airport safety and efficiency measures        The current tower at LaGuardia presents many safety concerns and limitations  and I am pleased that funds in the Aviation Trust Fund will be allocated to get this project started     said Congresswoman Lowey    With dramatic increases in air traffic  this new tower is essential to help ease crippling flight delays at the airport and manage traffic on the runways more efficiently           This funding to replace the outmoded and deteriorating air traffic control tower will greatly improve air safety at LaGuardia Airport for the millions of passengers and neighborhoods around the busy airport     said Congressman Crowley    This badly needed modernization will not mean additional flights  and I will continue working with the Federal Aviation Authority in designating new flight patterns so fewer jets fly over populated neighborhoods  I thank Senator Chuck Schumer and Congresswoman Nita Lowey for their consistent work in helping to secure funds for this critical project to improve safety at LaGuardia        The LaGuardia tower project has been in development for the past 15 years  but with dramatic increases in air traffic projected for the near future and the current air traffic tower physically falling apart  the new tower is needed now more than ever  This past July  the Senate Appropriations Committee weighed in on the need for the reprogrammed funds for the tower in the Senate TTHUD Appropriations bill report  Last week  the House Appropriations Committee sent a letter to the FAA requesting that the funding be approved for the LaGuardia control tower      The final plan for the new air traffic control tower includes a replacement of the aging 42 year old control tower and the ability to install a Category II Instrument Approach  which allows aircraft to land during periods of inclement weather  Overall  the new tower is essential to reduce delays and improve safety on the ground and in the skies  In November 2005  the last month for which data was available  only 62 percent of flights in to LGA arrived and 77 percent left on time      The current tower at LaGuardia is plagued by many safety concerns and limitations including visibility problems due to the US Airways terminal obstructing its view of certain taxiways  Not having an aircraft in sight visually from the tower compromises the efficiency and the safety of the airport  The size and capability of the current tower are also major liabilities as they make it very difficult to install new technical equipment  depriving air traffic controllers of the best available equipment for aviation safety  In addition  the constant installation and removal of equipment from the tower  s roof and the decrepit state of the tower  s structure have caused leaks to develop inside the tower itself  Over the past 2 years  leaks have forced air traffic controllers to install tarps directly above their heads  On numerous occasions  water has leaked onto the equipment and the controllers  interrupting operations and compromising the safety and efficiency of air traffic operations
