                                Report Shows Long Island Ratepayer Will Pay  2 000 Merger Tax on Gas Alone   National Grid s Buyout Is All Risk  No Reward for Long Island Residents    Deal Should Favor Long Island Ratepayers Not National Grid Shareholders    National Grid Takeover of Niagara Mohawk has Already Burned Upstate New Yorkers With High Bills and Unreliable Service  Now Long Island Residents in Compa Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the NY Public Service Commission to reject National Grid s proposed buyout of KeySpan Energy unless there are significant changes to the proposed deal  The acquisition is likely to lead to higher electricity and gas bills and a lower quality of service and may also lead to the elimination of hundreds of jobs on Long Island  Schumer also discussed how Long Island ratepayers must be a priority  not an afterthought  particularly since they already suffer from high rates        Long Island residents  who are already saddled by some of the nation s highest energy bills  need price relief and energy reliability  not skyrocketing monthly bills and shoddy service   said Senator Schumer   Unfortunately  this merger makes profits the priority and Long Island customers an afterthought  Unless there are sweeping changes to the proposed deal  PSC must reject it        Long Island households already suffer from some of the highest energy costs in the nation  which are likely to only grow worse under the proposed merger  A June 2006 New York State Comptroller report documented the crushing energy costs shouldered by Long Island ratepayers  Electric prices have risen every year since 2000  with a 21 9  spike between February 2005 and February 2006  The report speculated that in 2006  Long Island households would pay on average  2 000 for electricity  a  300 increase from 2005  In addition  Long Island households face rising natural gas costs  Newsday recently reported that in the month of March residential customers will pay 9 3  more per therm in gas than it did a year ago       Schumer today issued a comprehensive report detailing the potential pitfalls Long Island residents could face if the National Grid and KeySpan merger is approved in its current form  Incorporating the findings of the PSC experts  and with the assistance of the Public Utility Law Project  Schumer s report concluded that the  11 8 billion deal favors shareholders over ratepayers  and could have disastrous impacts on already high rates and the quality of service across Long Island  The report stipulated that the deal is inherently plagued by a flawed 10 year gas rate plan  a meager synergy savings package  a threat of market manipulation to artificially increase prices  a heavy reliance on debt financing  and the likelihood that National Grid s uneven record in Upstate New York will be replicated on Long Island       First  Schumer s report revealed that because National Grid has taken on a staggering  11 4 billion debt to finance the deal  it will make it difficult for National Grid to maintain its promise to restrain rates and make much needed investments in KeySpan s infrastructure  Making matters worse  National Grid is misrepresenting its debt load to the regulators in order to justify the collection of higher rates to the benefit of shareholders       Second  Schumer s report concluded that rates are guaranteed to rise by at least  2 000 on average per ratepayer due to National Grid s flawed 10 year rate plan for gas prices  Shocking rate increases have already been reported in Upstate New York following National Grid s acquisition of Niagara Mohawk  While delivery rates were projected to remain fixed for Niagara customers  the rate plan s deferral account provisions produced unexpected rate increase       Third  Schumer s report found that National Grid s synergy savings package is inadequate and will fail to give Long Island ratepayers an immediate break  The highly touted  1 64 billion package will  in fact  be spread throughout New England and New York  leaving local Long Island ratepayers with a minuscule part of the package  The PSC report noted that the validity and veracity of the synergy savings calculations was  dubious  and the expectation any money would flow to local ratepayers as  problematic        Fourth  Schumer raised serious concerns about the potential for market abuse by National Grid  The company s stranglehold on New York and the Northeast will only be strengthened by acquisition of KeySpan s downstate assets  National Grid already owns extensive transmission and distribution lines across Upstate New York and in the Northeast  The PSC recently concluded that there is a real possibility for manipulation to increase profits at the expense of consumers  This could also discourage Grid from building and investing in the region s energy infrastructure       Finally  a buyout of Keyspan could result in the elimination of between 624 and 1 600 jobs  a crushing blow to Long Island s local economy  and a negative impact on the local environment  The merger fails to adequately address significant issues of energy capacity  public health  and the environment  In fact  the proposal offers scant evidence that National Grid is committed to repowering Long Island s dirty  antiquated  and inefficient power plants at sites like Northport and Port Jefferson  cleaning up contaminated manufactured gas plant  MGP  sites to improve the environment  or significantly investing in energy efficiency will ultimately reduce consumer bills and air pollution       Today  Schumer  concerned that the merger in its current form will be disastrous for Long Island consumers  called on PSC to reject the deal  He stated that the deal should only be approved if real guarantees are given to Long Island residents that will result in lower rates  cleaner and more efficient energy  reliable service  and an ample workforce with a positive effect on the economy       New York State Assemblyman Marc Alessi  a sharp critic of the National Grid deal  echoed Schumer s concerns    I join Senator Schumer and many other local officials in opposing this merger  With ratepayers already facing enormous economic pressure  I urge National Grid to offer a real reduction in rates  as well as a framework for reliable service  a commitment to repowering  and the cleanup of manufactured gas plants        Schumer had previously written letters to National Grid and KeySpan regarding the merger s potential negative effects on Long Island  On March 6th  2006  Schumer requested that National Grid and KeySpan address a list of nine major areas of concern  including rate relief  reliability  job cuts  repowering  and widely reported problems relating to Grid s takeover of Niagara Mohawk about four years ago  Nearly one year later  the PSC report confirmed that Schumer s apprehensions were well founded       In February of 2006  the London based utility company National Grid  PLC  National Grid  announced it would buy New York based KeySpan for  7 3 billion and the assumption of approximately  4 5 billion of debt   KeySpan  headquartered in Brooklyn  has 2 6 million natural gas customers in New York City  Long Island  and New England   The company also operates the electric system of the Long Island Power Authority under a long term management contract  serving 1 1 million Long Island customers  With 4 million U S  customers  National Grid already controls considerable transmission and distribution lines  electricity and gas  in upstate New York  Niagara Mohawk  and the in the Northeastern United States  Massachusetts  Rhode Island and New Hampshire         Today  Schumer visited the home of ratepayer Nelson Horchak  He was joined by Ben Wiles of the Public Utlity Law Project which helped in drafting the report  as well as Matthew Cordaro  the Director of the Center for Management Analysis at CW Post  Jason Babbie of NYPIRG  Lisa Tyson of the Long Island Progressive Coalition  Gordian Raacke of Renewable Energy Long Island  and Adrienne Esposito of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment
