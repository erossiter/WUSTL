IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 11  2005 Schumer Statement For Local Advisory Panel On Montrose VAMC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Schumer Successfully Lobbied to Maintain Inpatient Domiciliary and Rehabilitation Services U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today testified via phone to the CARES Local Advisory Panel  outlining the importance of the community advisory board and his commitment to maintaining the critical services provided at Montrose VA hospital  Schumer  who visited the Montrose VA hospital and testified to the CARES Local Advisory Panel in 2003  successfully lobbied to maintain impatient domiciliary and rehabilitation services       Statement of Senator Charles E  Schumer for the CARES Local Advisory Panel for the Montrose VAMC       I thank the CARES Local Advisory Panel for allowing me to present this statement  and to express the hopes that I share with the Hudson Valley  s veterans about the role that the proceedings of this panel will play in the development and implementation of a master plan to carry out the final phase of the CARES process       Under the final CARES decision this panel  in cooperation with Price Waterhouse Coopers  PWC   has been charged with developing alternatives to facilitate the Secretary  s final CARES decision in regard to the Montrose campus  The decision improved upon the initial Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  plan  which would have moved all inpatient medical services from Montrose to Castle Point  Under the decision  Hudson Valley veterans would still be able to access outpatient  domiciliary  post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and residential rehabilitation services at the Montrose Campus  However  it still calls for acute psychiatric  long term psychiatric  and nursing home care to be transferred  While some of the unnecessary barriers to quality healthcare were removed in the Secretary  s decision  I believe that this panel and PWC must continue to work closely with the community to ensure that the final result of the CARES process in Montrose is not just to maintain  but enhance the quality of veterans   healthcare       Despite the improvements in the Secretary  s final decision  I am still deeply concerned that if not executed properly the plan to transfer services from Montrose will still sacrifice the ability to provide quality healthcare to those who have earned it through service to their country for the sake of cost cutting  For example  the families and friends of veterans who still require inpatient psychiatric and nursing home care would be forced to travel to Castle Point in Dutchess County  which is difficult for many from veterans from Westchester  Rockland  and Putnam Counties       After the initial CARES plan was released  I talked extensively with local veterans and met with veterans   leaders who had been heavily involved in developing CARES recommendations  I learned that the initial plan overruled the recommendations developed with local stakeholders  which called for keeping mental health outpatients  substance rehabilitation and PTSD residential care at Montrose  These programs have outstanding reputations at Montrose  It would make little sense to move them to Castle Point  which would have to construct new buildings to house them  and I am glad that the Secretary  s decision largely recognized this       The veterans I spoke to also recognized that some changes in service at the Montrose campus were needed and could be beneficial to veterans  In striving to make such changes and meet the goal of enhancing veterans healthcare in the Hudson Valley  I believe that this panel should continue to work with the community to address key unresolved issues before moving forward with any changes in service  These issues include        1  What steps will be taken to guarantee that the Castle Point facility will have adequate space and financial resources to absorb the patients that would be transferred from Montrose  This question is especially relevant in light of the Administration  s under funding of veterans   health care and the negative impact that the Veterans Equitable Resources Allocation  VERA  formula has had on New York     2  Does the VA intend to expand services at Castle Point and Montrose  including long term care and nursing home services  in order to address the aging veteran population in the Hudson Valley  which has one of the oldest population in the veterans healthcare system  Will there be sufficient services for the new generation of veterans returning home from Iraq  Afghanistan  and other theaters in the War on Terror     3  Will veterans   outpatient clinics in the Hudson Valley expand their services to include x rays  increasingly sophisticated testing  and light surgery  The opening this month of the clinic in Pine Plains  located in rural Dutchess County  was a positive step taken by the VA to expand its system of outpatient clinics  which make simple health care more easily accessible to our veterans  These clinics serve an important function  and they must continue to be expanded and enhanced under any CARES implementation      I posed many of these questions in my previous testimony to the CARES Commission  and continue to strongly believe that they need to be definitively answered before moving forward       Reducing services at Montrose may have a significantly detrimental effect on veterans   healthcare in the Hudson Valley  particularly at a time when the population is expected to increase  It would be impractical  and unfair  to force some veterans and their families to travel greater distances and experience longer waits to receive care  and I am afraid that is what will occur with the transfer of inpatient services from Montrose to Castle Point  I am also greatly concerned by the reliance on estimates regarding the cost to renovate Castle Point in anticipation of its new responsibilities  The current Administration has made significant cuts to spending on veterans   healthcare  creating an unpredictable climate in which funding for capital construction projects is unsure and there is no identification of which construction projects will receive priority consideration       In order to prevent the establishment of barriers to veterans   healthcare  I believe it is crucial that this panel work to adequately answer the question of how the much smaller Castle Point facility will accommodate the patient load it is slated to assume from Montrose  If these factors are not addressed the renovations and changes in service that a transfer to Castle Point would require could severely compromise the quality of patient care  Such an outcome would be unacceptable       Another missing piece of the puzzle concerns the future of the Montrose property itself  There is a dire need in Westchester and the region for affordable housing for veterans  The Montrose campus is well suited for such use  However  veterans are concerned that housing might be built only for middle and higher income veterans  leaving behind the lower income veterans who already are struggling to stay in the area  Some veterans have raised the concern that Montrose  s beautiful waterfront campus on the Hudson River might be sold off by the VA instead of being used for veterans   housing and medical care  I believe that Montrose should remain a facility dedicated to serving the needs of veterans  and would oppose any effort by the VA to sell the property  The Secretary  s final CARES decision included the consideration in the master plan of enhanced use leasing to develop an assisted living complex on the campus  I urge you to give this type of proposal the utmost consideration and make sure it addresses the increasingly acute housing crisis facing low income veterans in the Hudson Valley       This nation made a pact with the generations of brave men and women who have served in the armed forces  In return for their service  we would take care of them when they got back       We need to make good on this promise by providing the highest quality health care to our veterans  That means ensuring that the master plan for the Montrose campus does not move forward until all outstanding issues are resolved and the enhancement of veterans   healthcare in the Hudson Valley has been guaranteed       I thank the Panel for the opportunity to present testimony at today  s hearings
