IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 27  2007 Schumer Backed Amendment to Secure Purchases of Chemical Used in World Trade Center   Oklahoma City Bombings Clears Senate  First Ever Fed Regulations on Sale of Ammonium Nitrate                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In May  Schumer Revealed Feds Had No Regulations Governing Sale of Ammonium Nitrate   A Common Fertilizer That Can Be Easily Turned Into a Powerful Explosive Amendment Requires Buyers   Sellers to Register With Department of Homeland Security  Names Are Checked Against Terrorist Screening Database Devotes  45 Million to Keep Chemical Out of the Hands of Terrorist Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  announced that legislation that would for the first time ever have the federal government regulate the purchases of the chemical Ammonium Nitrate  which can easily be made by terrorists in to a bomb  was approved by the United States Senate late last night  Ammonium nitrate is a commonly used fertilizer that can be combined with fuel oil and a detonator to create a powerful explosive  More than a decade after the first World Trade Center attack and the Oklahoma City bombing  a key ingredient in those explosions  ammonium nitrate  has been left largely unregulated by the federal government  leaving a gaping hole in our nations homeland security   Ammonium nitrate has legitimate uses  but its the illegitimate uses that should keep us up at night  Sen  Schumer said  Its too easy for people bent on doing harm to get a hold of this chemical  This legislation will for the first time attempt to close this gaping security hole   Schumer has long advocated for legislation to require all ammonium nitrate producers  buyers and sellers to register with the Department of Homeland Security  Under the new provisions  in order to register  ammonium nitrate purchasers identities must be checked against the terrorist screening database to ensure that the potentially explosive ingredient doesnt fall into the wrong hands  Any entity that sells ammonium nitrate to someone who is unregistered faces up to  50 000 in civil fines  Ammonium nitrate facilities are also required to report any theft or unexplained loss to federal law enforcement officials within one day    The legislation would also require buyers to provide identification at the point of sale and mandate that sellers keep sales records for at least two years  Currently  any individual can purchase ammonium nitrate without presenting any identification throughout most of the United States  The bill authorizes  45 million over five years to administer the program and appropriates  2 million to get it started   Schumer is a cosponsor of the ammonium nitrate amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 DHS Appropriations bill  The amendment was authored by Senators Mark Pryor  D AR  and Thad Cochran  R MS  with Schumers strong support and cosponsorship  and is nearly identical to a bill that Schumer has been pushing with the same senators    In June  a Staten Island man was arrested after local and federal authorities uncovered about 3 000 pounds of potentially explosive potassium nitrate stored in a Graniteville home and nearby storage facility  Potassium Nitrate is similar to ammonium nitrate as it can easily be used as an explosive  Authorities were able to locate and arrest the man who purchased the chemical only because potassium nitrate is regulated and tracked by the federal government  However  similar purchases of ammonium nitrate are not tracked at all   Last September  in testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee  Richard Falkenrath  the NYPDs top counterterrorism official  outlined just how easy it is to secure the materials to make an ammonium nitrate bomb  In an undercover operation dubbed Operation Kaboom  NYPD officers purchased over a ton of ammonium nitrate  mixed a small amount of fuel oil with the fertilizer to render it combustible and detonated it on the NYPD firing range   The NYPDs sting was not the wake up call it should have been  said Sen  Schumer  There s an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  Ammonium nitrate is available  it s easy to get  and it s relatively easy to make into a bomb  We shouldn t be stopping people from selling it  but it shouldn t be so easy to get either   Instructions for turning ammonium nitrate fertilizer into a bomb are widely available on the Internet  It is suspected that ammonium nitrate was used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the truck bomb that destroyed the Alfred R  Murrah Oklahoma City federal building in 1995  killing 168  Ammonium nitrate was also used in the 2002 bombing of a nightclub in Bali
