IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 28  2006 Schumer  In Light Of New DOT Study Showing Bus Lanes Barely Used By Buses  SI Expressway Must Be Open To Carpoolers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              When Bus Lanes Open to HOV  3 Vehicles  Congestion on Traffic Heavy Staten Island Expressway Will Decrease   Senator Stands with Borough President Molinaro and Councilman McMahon and  Calls on State DOT  to Immediately Extend Bus Lanes and Make them Open to Car Poolers  Calls Delaying Project till 2012  Unacceptable                                                                           In light of a new Department of Transportation study showing that the bus only lanes on the Staten Island Expressway are not being used to their full potential  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the New York State Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration to allow carpoolers with three or more passengers to access it as a High Occupancy Vehicle  HOV  lane  Schumer  joined by Borough President James Molinaro and City Councilman Michael McMahon  today took steps to ensure the project is completed quickly and effectively  They asked NYSDOT to immediately begin work on reconstructing the existing bus lane to be compatible for cars with 3 or more passengers and to also begin work extending the Bus HOV lane the entire length of the Staten Island Expressway  from the Verrazzano Bridge Toll Plaza all the way to the Goethals Bridge  Schumer also pledged to help clear Federal regulatory hurdles and called for new enforcement mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that non HOV drivers don  t use the lane illegally          It  s no secret that the Staten Island Expressway faces enormous traffic woes  and anything we can do to relieve the terrible congestion will help commuters enormously     Schumer said    With at most 53 buses per hour in the bus only lane  it  s crystal clear that these lanes are not being used to their full potential  By better utilizing them  we have a terrific opportunity to make commuting less of a hassle for carpoolers  All that NYSDOT needs to do is read their own reports and they ll see that starting work on this project immediately should be a top priority             The DOT study shows us that bus lanes are underutilized and could be used effectively for vehicles with at least 3 passengers  This change should be implemented right away  We all know that the rush hour traffic on the expressway is absolutely unbearable  It is imperative that we find alternative ways to alleviate the rush hour crush for commuters   said Councilman McMahon         I look forward to working with Senator Schumer as we move forward to establish the best possible use for the new lanes on the Staten Island Expressway     said Borough President Molinaro    According to NYSDOT s study  an HOV3  arrangement is feasible as long as drivers don t use the lane illegally  To ensure its proper usage  we need to develop provisions for enforcement that are no nonsense and without exception  This could mean building stationary patrol posts for the NYPD and increasing fines for traffic scofflaws              In September 2005  Schumer and McMahon joined forces to call for the NYSDOT to open the newly constructed bus only lanes to cars with 3 or more passengers  NYSDOT agreed to study this proposal and its findings  which have not been fully released to the public yet  show that it is both operationally and economically feasible        Opened in November 2005  the bus lane runs both eastbound and westbound for 2 6 miles between Slosson Avenue and the Verrazzano Bridge Toll Plaza  Given NYSDOT s plans to extend the bus only lanes the entire length of the expressway  from the Verrazzano Bridge Toll Plaza to the Goethals Bridge  Schumer called for the construction of this new lane to be compatible and accessible for HOV cars with 3 or more passengers  HOV 3    This proposed model has already eased congestion in Brooklyn where bus only lanes on the Gowanus Expressway are accessible to cars carrying at least 3 passengers  Extending the bus lane the length of the Expressway is estimated to cost  75 million  making the necessary upgrades to ensure that carpoolers could use that lane would cost an additional  15 million       The new report compiled for NYSDOT by the consulting firm Parsons Brinkerhoff revealed that during peak rush hour  around 50 buses use the bus only lane and 90 cars carrying 3 or more passengers use existing car lanes  Traffic congestion will be reduced if these cars with 3 or more passengers are allowed to share the bus lane and use it as a High Occupancy Vehicle  HOV  lane  This option will also encourage more Staten Island residents to carpool  cutting down on congestion  pollution and gas expenses  The report concludes that expanding access to the bus only lanes to cars with 3 or more passengers would increase the transportation value of these lanes for commuters  while not diminishing their intended usage as express lanes for buses  Although the NYSDOT report does not officially endorse any plan  it concludes that converting the bus only lanes to HOV 3   would work from on operational standpoint and enhance the value of the priority lanes         Given the feasibility and the value in opening the lanes which is documented in the report  Schumer  Molinaro and McMahon today condemned NYSDOT  s recent comments that work would not begin until 2011 or 2012  NYSDOT originally planned to have all work done on extending the bus express lanes completed by 2008   In the last 18 months  that target date has moved back at least 4 5 years         These delays are unacceptable  Every time traffic on the expressway is stalled while a brand new lane sits empty  the collective blood pressure of Staten Islanders skyrockets  We started this project  Now it  s time to finish it     said Senator Schumer        Schumer today also renewed his commitment to work with the Federal Highway Authority  FHWA  to help this project clear all the regulatory hurdles  Last year  the FHWA assured Schumer that they would be open to taking steps to increase the capacity of these lanes and made a commitment to work with his office and NYSDOT as the plan proceeded  Schumer  Molinaro and McMahon also called on NYSDOT to work with the NYPD and to develop enforcement mechanisms to ensure the scofflaw drivers didn t use the lane illegally   In particular  they requested that NYSDOT build permanent stationary enforcement patrol posts where the New York City Police Department could ensure only HOV 3  cars were using the lane  They also called for an increase of the  90 fine currently in place to penalize drivers violating this rule       Senator Schumer noted that Staten Island was the fastest growing county in New York State from 1990 to 2000  with significant population and economic gains expected over the next 30 years  At the same time  Staten Islanders have the longest average commute in the nation  averaging 43 8 minutes each way and endure the most frequent   extreme commutes    of 90 minutes or longer in the nation
