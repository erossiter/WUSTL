IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 23  2006 In Wake Of National Body Part Transplant Scandal  Schumer To Unveil Critical Legislation To Regulate Tissue Transplants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Stands With Patricia Battisti Who May Have Been Exposed to Infected Tissue   FDA Response to Problem Inadequate Last week  amid reports of the growing scope of an under regulated tissue transplant industry  Senator Schumer wrote to the Food and Drug Administration calling for stronger regulatory oversight for tissue transplants and an accounting of how exactly contaminated tissue was transplanted into otherwise healthy patients  Since the FDA has not adequately responded to this problem  today Schumer unveiled legislation to properly regulate the tissue transplant industry  Schumer stood with Patricia Battisti  a Long Island resident who may have been exposed to infected tissue         In this real life version of the body snatchers  healthy people are getting sick when they are supposed to be receiving life saving tissue transplants     Schumer said    Instead of getting better they are being implanted with contaminated tissue that was acquired illegally from corpses  And  to add insult to injury  there isn  t any accountability  It  s time for stronger regulations in the tissue transplant industry to become law          Patricia Battisti underwent surgery in early 2005 to alleviate back pain from a prior car accident  Nearly a year later she found out that many body parts from a New Jersey Tissue bank  Biomedical Tissue Services of Fort Lee New Jersey  were used in surgeries between 2003 and 2005 and she subsequently received notification that body parts sold to tissue banks from a NJ company may not have been tested properly        Upon further investigation  the FDA found the tissue that may have been used in Battisti  s surgery and others was originally from a funeral home in Brooklyn  where police allege that bodies were exhumed and bones were stolen  That tissue went to Biomedical Tissue Services in Fort Lee  where it seems that records were altered  The tissue was then sent to tissue banks where it may not have been tested for contamination and went to hospitals for transplant implant procedures       Tissue transplantation is similar to organ transplantation  but the industry is regulated much more loosely  While organ donors are only identified by doctors in hospitals  tissue donations can come out of funeral homes or morgues  Although the companies that test and sterilize tissue must be registered with the FDA  they are not subject to any regular inspections or audits  but are only inspected when the FDA decides there has been a risk associated with the bank  And worst of all  tissue transplantation is used by some companies as a profit making machine  turning materials desperately needed by patients into money       Under the current system  there are many links in the chain from donor to recipient  with each link creating another potential opening for improper behavior  First  a donor is identified  The cause of death must not be one  like cancer  that would make the tissues less strong or healthy  Donors can be identified at hospitals  morgues  crematoria  and funeral homes  From there  tissue is purchased by a tissue bank  which is responsible for retrieving  processing  storing  and distributing the tissue  These banks can be non profit or for profit  and may receive already processed tissue from one of 58 federally designated organ procurement organizations  which operate under the strictest standards in the business  Tissue banks may distribute their goods to other companies before they finally reach a hospital  which is not required to do any further testing of the tissue  but trusts the tissue bank to have been a proper gatekeeper       Federally designated organ procurement organizations  such as the New York Organ Donor Network  receive a phone call every time there is a death in a nearby hospital  They apply several strict screening processes  including talking to the family of the donor  to ensure that the tissue is safe  They recover the tissue in a sterile operating room before selling it to a tissue bank  for a price determined by a federally overseen formula that determines how much money it cost them to recover the tissue  This keeps costs low and appropriate  but once the tissue is sold to a tissue bank  the strict regulations end        In his letter to FDA Commissioner Eschenbach last week  Schumer wrote    On examining these particular cases  it appears that there were clear warning signs that stricter oversight could have picked up on  For example  BioMedical Tissue Services was registered with the FDA and had been cited for several violations in 2003  not by the FDA but by the New York State Department of Health  Was the FDA aware of these citations  did it follow up with its own inspection  and did it see the warning signs that BioMedical Tissue Services would act improperly     Schumer also asked the FDA to provide a full accounting of where the breakdown in the system occurred in each of these cases       The FDA expanded its regulations in 2004 and does not appear to recognize the gaping holes that still remain  To combat this ever growing problem from becoming larger  today Senator Schumer unveiled legislation to regulate the tissue transplant industry  His legislation would specifically           Make it illegal for tissue banks to buy tissue from funeral homes and morgues  with an exception for types of tissue deemed to be in short supply         Require the FDA to do surprise inspections of tissue banks every year         Require the FDA to conduct periodic audits of the documentation that shows where the tissue has come from  Identifying false phone numbers  medical information  or family consent information can help investigators reveal problems         Require FDA to define the term  reasonable processing fee   It is currently illegal to buy and sell tissue  but it is legal to charge  reasonable processing fees   This term has never been defined  and can be used by for profit tissue banks to make money off of body parts
