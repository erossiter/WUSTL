IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 9  2006 Schumer Asks New York Insurance Department To Investigate Allstate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Newly Revealed Allstate Plan is Second Strike to the Heart of New Yorkers   Allstate plans to Increase Policy Cancellations  On Top of No Longer Writing New Coverage in Downstate New York   Senator Pushes State Insurance Department to Immediately and Publicly Investigate Allstate  Look for Link to Effort to Create New Federal Law  Asks Mills to Get Documents from Allstate that are Linked to Pulling With news that Allstate will be increasing policy cancellations    on top of its recent announcement that they will not write any new homeowners insurance policies in Westchester  Long Island and New York City    today Senator Chuck Schumer called for the State Insurance Department to thoroughly and publicly investigate Allstate  s actions  Though the State Insurance Department has called for a hearing on the matter in general  today Schumer asked Insurance Superintendent Mills to use his broad regulatory powers to instigate a more pointed investigation that requires Allstate to turn over documents regarding its decision to pull back on coverage and explore any link between Allstate  s new policies and any effort to create a federal  taxpayer   financed catastrophic fund     Schumer commended the State Insurance Department  SID  for calling a hearing for later this month  but indicated that given the assumptions upon which Allstate  s actions are based  more must be done     One of the reasons that may be behind Allstate  s actions is the desire by insurance companies to build pressure to create a catastrophic fund that would indemnify them from costs of devastating natural disasters  like major hurricanes  A catastrophic fund would make the Federal government  and in turn taxpayers  responsible for paying for catastrophic hurricanes  While Schumer has not yet reached a policy conclusion on this issue  he said    I am extremely concerned about the manner in which some companies like Allstate may be using these innocent residents to achieve their larger goal         In his letter to Insurance Superintendent Mills he wrote    In this instance  I fear that Allstate is perhaps using New York  s insurance consumers as pawns in an effort to create a an environment that lends momentum to their effort to pass federal legislation that seeks to create a catastrophic insurance fund financed by the American taxpayer    The company  s actions are particularly galling in light of the facts that they received an 8 5  rate increase from the SID  and the firm  s bottom line remains healthy  It is my strong belief that the company  s policy should be better tailored to reflect the realities of the weather patterns of downstate New York        He asked that the investigation specifically ask Allstate to provide  All documents they have that has led to the decision to pull back on coverage  as well as any document they have in which the idea of pulling back on coverage is linked to their effort on behalf of creation of a federal catastrophic fund  In addition  he asked the Department  s review to examine the market impact Allstate  s decision will have on the cost of insurance and homeownership in the region  and the appropriateness considering the company  s profitability and superior   loss ratio    score in the state of New York      On the first of this year  Allstate announced that it would not write new homeowner policies in New York City  Long Island and Westchester as a part of an overall   hurricane risk management strategy    that it implemented at the start of 2006  Now Allstate says that in addition it will increase the number of policies that are cancelled each year at the end of their three year expirations  According to state Insurance Department Policy  Insurance companies are prohibited from not renewing more than 4  of their existing homeowners policies  Estimates indicate that would leave Allstate with the ability to cancel about 18 000 policies      Allstate  s reach in the markets that it has pulled out from is wide  It has an 18  share of the homeowner  s market in New York  and 25 9  of the market in the eight affected counties meaning that there is far less competition and prices for homeowners   insurance could go through the roof  Schumer said    If these policy changes stand  insurance coverage will become more difficult to secure  the market will become less competitive and insurance may become increasingly more expensive  In the extraordinarily expensive downstate New York housing market  Allstate actions have the effect of erecting further hurdles on the already burdensome path to the American Dream for many New Yorkers  This change would not only unduly burden over half a million residents of downstate New York  but will also negatively impact the local economy which is closely linked to its vibrant housing market        Recent statistics from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  show that the odds of a category four or higher hurricane hitting New York City is once every five hundred years and on Montauk Long Island once every 130 years  Miami  by contrast is once every 15 years  The risk of a hurricane hitting Miami is 900  greater than on Eastern Long Island and 3300  greater than in NYC     Schumer  s letter also said    The insurance industry has a responsibility to guarantee a financial cushion for those in a time of need  particularly as policyholders have continued to pay their premiums year after year  Regrettably  despite healthy profits  Allstate is attempting to walk away from that responsibility  I know you care about the effect these actions have on our consumers and our economy  and I hope we can work together to reverse this misguided effort  and to deal with any harmful reverberations that may occur in the meanwhile
