                                     Schumer Authored College Tuition Tax Deduction  Which Allows More than 100 000 Upstate NY Families Every Year To Deduct Thousands of Dollars in College Costs  Expired This Year   New Schumer Study Finds College Tuition in NY has Gone Up More than 35  Over Last 5 Years    New Schumer Study Shows Tuition Up In Every Region of the State  Capital Region Colleges are up 37   Central N Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that hundreds of thousands of upstate New York middle class families could lose a critical tax break that helps pay for the skyrocketing cost of college tuition if Congress doesn  t act by the end of the year   The Schumer authored   College Tuition Tax Deduction    allowed more than 102 000 upstate New York middle class families to deduct up to  4 000 of their kids  tuition from their taxes   Schumer said this tax deduction is needed now more than ever as he will release a new  showing that  since the 2000 2001 school year  the price of going to college in upstate New York has jumped more than 35 percent   In response  Schumer called on Majority Leader Senator Bill Frist to bring legislation to the Senate floor to extend the tax break         A college education has become a necessity that s priced as a luxury   and it s breaking the bank for students and their families throughout the nation     Schumer said    To hard working New York parents  skyrocketing tuition costs mean debt and second mortgages   They mean lost family vacations and hard choices about how many children can be sent to school  The college tuition tax deduction makes these choices a little easier by saving families thousands of dollars every year          The college tuition tax deduction  passed into law in 2001 and based on bi partisan legislation written by Schumer  originally allowed middle income families to deduct  3 000 from their tax return   The deduction was raised to  4 000 a year in 2004   Last year  single filers who made up to  65 000 a year and married couples with incomes up to  130 000 qualified for the tuition deduction   There was also a smaller   2 000 deduction for those who earned more         According to the Internal Revenue Service  an estimated 102 737 upstate New York middle class families took advantage of the tax deduction during the 2003 tax year  the last year for which data is available    In 2003  3 6 million families took advantage of the deduction  saving them about  4 5 billion      However  in May  language extending the tax break for another three years was eliminated from the tax reconciliation bill in favor of restoring  5 billion worth of tax breaks of the major oil companies       Schumer today said that the critical tax break that saves middle class families thousands of dollars every year is needed now more than ever because college tuition costs are continuing to skyrocket   In his report  Schumer revealed that the average price of going to college in upstate New York is up more than 35 percent since the 2000 2001 school year   Five years ago  the average price of tuition  not including room  board  and books  was  9 151   Now  it is up to  12 334   This includes tuition at both public and private colleges and in state and out of state tuition   Below is how the numbers break out across the state            12 576 families in the Capital Region took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003   Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in Capital Region increased by 37 percent  rising from  9 037 in 2001 to  12 343 in 2006             11 563 families in Central New York took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003   Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in Central New York increased by 47 percent  rising from  10 808 in 2001 to  15 927 in 2006             15 542 families in the Rochester Finger Lakes region took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003   Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in the Rochester Finger Lakes region increased by 33 percent  rising from  11 603 in 2001 to  15 382 in 2006             29 381 families in the Hudson Valley took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003   Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in the Hudson Valley increased by 30 percent  rising from  8 606 in 2001 to  11 222 in 2006             6 937 families in the North Country took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003   Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in the North Country increased by 36 percent  rising from  6 238 in 2001 to  8 470 in 2006             8 031 families in the Southern Tier took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003   Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in the Southern Tier increased by 24 percent  rising from  9 168 in 2001 to  11 411 in 2006             18 707 families in Western New York took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003   Over the past five years  the average price of going to college in Western New York increased by 35 percent  rising from  8 596 in 2001 to  11 584 in 2006        Though Congress is currently in recess  Schumer today sent a personal letter to Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN  demanding that he immediately bring to the floor legislation extending the college tuition tax deduction and other middle class tax breaks that are set to expire this year   In his letter  Schumer said that   the time for political games is over   This tax break helps middle class families in New York and across the country deal with the increasingly heavy burden of paying to college  and its expiration puts into jeopardy the future of young people everywhere          Schumer is also the author of the bi partisan   Make College Affordable Act     S  759  which would increase the maximum amount of tuition costs that can be deducted to  12 000 each year  and make the deduction permanent       In addition  the bill would help college graduates pay off their loans by offering a tax deduction of up to  1 500 for interest paid on student loans over the first five years of repayment  The full deduction would apply to single filers with incomes up to  50 000 and joint filers with incomes up to  100 000  The legislation would still allow parents to choose Hope Scholarships instead of the tax deduction  based on which works best for them
