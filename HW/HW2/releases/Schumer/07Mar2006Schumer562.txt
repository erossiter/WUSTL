                                 DHS Secretary Should Investigate Misleading Statements by Dubai Ports World Chief Assure American People by Thoroughly Vetting Port Deal Before It Can Be Approved by Feds   Bipartisan Effort Continues to Ensure that Port Security Will Not Be Compromised By Allowing a Dubai Government owned Company to Operate Some of the Largest Ports on the East Coast including the Port of New York New Jersey Today  Senator Chuck Schumer  D NY  and Rep  Peter King  the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee  sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff urging him to examine the comments made by the CEO of Dubai Ports World  Mohammed Sharaf  Sharaf suggested that port operators have no security responsibilities  he was unaware of various security procedures in Dubai and the United States and didn  t know how much cargo was even screened in Dubai  s port  and he indicated that the deal was going to be completed  regardless of U S  security concerns  because British investors were waiting for their money  Sharaf  s statements raise serious questions about DP World  s suitability to operate major U S  ports  The two New York lawmakers have repeatedly asked that Congress is fully informed as the 45 day investigation progresses  and notified about how security concerns are being addressed       Schumer said    The CEO of DP World is putting the cart before the horse  We believe that whether or not a financial transaction is on the way to being completed that national and homeland security must trump trade  It is clear as day that a thorough investigation must be finished before Dubai takes control of port operations here in the United States          King stated     Very simply  security concerns must dictate this transaction  Nothing less           Dubai Ports World  a Dubai Company that is owned and operated by the United Arab Emirates is about to complete a  6 8 billion deal  which was briskly approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  last month  The approval allows the UAE  s government owned company to take control of significant operations at six U S  ports including  New York  New Jersey  Baltimore  New Orleans  Miami and Philadelphia  Except for cargo screening functions performed by the Department of Homeland Security  the port operator is responsible for securing cargo coming in and out of the port  the port facility itself  and the hiring of security personnel        Last week a bipartisan group of senators  led by Schumer introduced legislation to suspend the Dubai port deal immediately  King introduced a companion bill into the House last week with over 90 co sponsors  Since Schumer and King first criticized this deal  a litany of homeland security professionals have also come out questioning the deal including former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge  former DHS Inspector General Clark Kent Ervin  Republican and Democratic senators and representatives  and governors and mayors around the nation       The letter sent today is below       March 7  2006      Hon  Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Nebraska Avenue Complex  3801 Nebraska Avenue  N W   Washington  DC 20528      Dear Secretary Chertoff       We write to express our strong concern regarding the comments made this weekend by Dubai Ports World CEO Mohammed Sharaf  which raise serious questions about DP World  s commitment to security at ports in the United States and thus the proposed takeover of U S  port operations by DP World  As you know  DP World is set to close the deal sometime this week to take over terminal operations at major ports up and down the East and Gulf Coasts  Members of Congress  on a bi partisan and bi cameral basis have questioned the breadth and depth of the Committee on Foreign Investment in United States  CFIUS  initial security review of the takeover  Our key concern has been  and remains today  the national security implications of allowing a commercial venture owned by a nation with a nexus to terrorist activity such enormous control and access to our ports  Mr  Sharaf  s comments and his view that this is simply a run of the mill economic transaction  merit further investigation to ensure that DP World  its leadership and employees share our commitment to security       In an interview yesterday  Mr  Sharaf made three comments that are very disturbing  Mr  Sharaf confidently proclaimed that   The deal has been made      The matter is basically waiting for the money to be transferred to the investors  If they don t  big losses are going to be there for the investors     While Mr  Sharaf focused on the economics of this deal  we can assure you that our concern for security of Americans and our ports far outweighs our concern for a few investors in Great Britain  It was our understanding that while the company may officially close the deal this week  the transfer of U S  operations has been put on hold until CFIUS completes the new 45 day investigation  It appears Mr  Sharaf does not realize how important the investigation is to addressing security concerns that were left unexplored by the first CFIUS review  and that any findings made during the investigation that expose possible security vulnerabilities at our ports  could lead to the Congress taking action to block the deal  We ask that the Department of Homeland Security make sure that Mr  Sharaf and all of DP World realize the seriousness of the new investigation  Additionally  we hope that you are working under the same understanding as we are    namely  that this deal may be rejected by the Committee on Foreign Investment or the United States Congress if security concerns are not met        Second  when asked what percentage of containers at the port of Dubai is physically inspected  Mr  Sharaf did not have an answer  This information is critical because  as your department has said time and again  one of DHS  s primary security countermeasures against a terrorist smuggling a nuclear weapon on to a ship bound for the United States is that customs officials  both from the U S  and the home country  physically inspect more containers abroad that they do in the United States  It is essential that port authorities in the United States are absolutely confident that containers coming from new DP World ports receive the same high level of scrutiny as before the takeover  We realize the sensitivity of such information  but would like evidence that DHS has received this information and will ensure that the maximum numbers of containers possible are thoroughly inspected at ports owned or controlled by DP World  Finally  the lack of knowledge about such a critical security fact by the CEO of this company raises even more questions about the company  s commitment to ensuring that ships bound for the United States do not represent a threat to our nation or its people       Third  Mr  Sharaf stated that   there  s a misconception about port operators  Port operators don  t control security at the port     This statement is patently incorrect  The terminal operator is responsible for security at its own terminal and the area within the port where cargo is loaded  unloaded or transferred  according to the Homeland Security Department  In addition  Mr  Sharaf had very little idea of what kind of security checks were done in Dubai for DP World employees seeking to get visas to work at U S  ports  All of these comments raise serious concerns about Mr  Sharaf  s level of engagement with the security issues surrounding this takeover       Mr  Sharaf is a businessman and we understand his focus on his shareholders and the economics of this deal  Nevertheless  our primary duty    and yours    is to ensure the safety of our citizens  When it comes to this takeover  security must not take a back seat to profit  If Mr  Sharaf  as now appears clear  will be focused only on profits  our government must be that much more vigilant in efforts to examine and ensure that this deal does not endanger our national security       This is why we believe it is vital that Congress be kept apprised of the progress of the new 45 day investigation and DP World  s willingness to cooperate with CFIUS investigators  In addition  Congress must be given a final report and full briefing on CFIUS  s findings  and we respectfully request that you highlight the company  s cooperativeness as it will be a critical factor in weighing the quality of investigation and the viability of the takeover       We appreciate your consideration to this timely security issue and pledge our full support in the effort to make sure our ports are as secure as possible        Sincerely       Senator Chuck Schumer   Rep  Peter King
