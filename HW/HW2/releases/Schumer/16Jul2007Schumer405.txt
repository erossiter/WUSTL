IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 16  2007 With Area Vets Still Waiting For A Decision On Future Of Canandaigua VAMC  Schumer Announces Support For Option 9 And Calls On VA Secretary To Give Local Community And Vets Update On Decision Making Process                                                                                                                                                                                                   Option 9 will Integrate New Outpatient Clinic and Nursing Home into the Heart of Canandaigua VA Medical Center    Senator Joins Canandaigua Community  School District  Local Veterans and Officials to Support the Plan    Schumer Calls on VA Secretary to Give Veterans and Residents of Canandaigua an Update on When Decision Will be Reached                                               Building on his successful effort to keep the Canandaigua VA Medical Center open for area veterans  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to adopt Business Plan Option 9 for the construction of new facilities at the Canandaigua VAMC  Schumer also called on the Secretary to improve the transparency around the decision making process by giving local residents and veterans an update on the current status of the proposal  Option 9  one of three options sent by the Local Advisory Panel to the secretary for his consideration  benefits veterans and the community by integrating new facilities into the heart of the medical campus  while reusing existing buildings and preserving open space used by the community   Schumer  arguing that Option 9 would make the greatest headway towards improving VAMC services for local veterans in need of care  today sent a letter to VA Secretary James Nicholson expressing his support for it and calling for a detailed updated on when a decision will be reached    After extensive review  its crystal clear that Business Plan Option 9 provides what veterans want and need  top notch health care facilities on a beautiful campus that promotes healing and peace of mind  said Senator Schumer  This plan provides the necessary balance between existing facilities and future facilities to guarantee that patients at the Canandaigua CA Medical Center will be well cared for  Its also essential that we pull back the curtain on the decision making process so local residents and veterans can have a better idea when and how a decision will be reached   The Local Advisory Panel recently put forth three plans for the construction of new facilities at the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  In October of 2006  the VA announced they would continue to study the best way to provide inpatient and outpatient services  and that they expected to have a final plan completed by the spring of 2007 It promised that they would receive additional input from the local advisory panel as they finalize plans for the Canandaigua campus  Business Plan Option 9 is one of the three final plans being considered by the VA for implementation at the Medical Center   Schumer today stressed that Business Plan Option 9  which enjoys wide community support  has several advantages over the other two plans for both veterans and the community   First  the new facilities  which include a new multi specialty outpatient clinic and a nursing home complex  will be integrated into the heart of the existing campus  Keeping services on campus is very important to veterans and local residents  The new nursing home would be located in Courtyard 2 whilethe outpatient facilities and administrative space would be located in renovated buildings around Courtyard 1   Second  the plan offers an opportunity for appropriate reuse of existing buildings  Reusing the existing Canandaigua VA campus buildings for veterans services is a goal for all of the stakeholders involved  and this option goes a long way toward meeting that challenge   Third  this option maintains valuable open space  which is important for the use and enjoyment of veterans and the community alike  This is a particular advantage to Option 9 because one of the alternatives  Option 7  negatively affects the children of Canandaigua by taking away fields that are currently used by the school district and local organizations for a variety of sports and activities   In a personal letter to R  James Nicholson  Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Schumer wrote  As I have maintained throughout this process  the VA must work closely with the community to ensure that the final decision on the medical center enhances the quality of veterans healthcare With this in mind  the community of Canandaigua has clearly voiced its support of Option 9  Please add my voice to the chorus of support for this plan    Schumer today joined forces with local leaders and stakeholders in the Canandaigua community in supporting Option 9  The City of Canandaigua  the County of Ontario  the Chamber of Commerce  the Canandaigua School District  and most importantly  area veterans have all voiced unequivocal support for this course of action   Schumer also called on the VA Secretary to give local residents and veterans an update on the decision making process  The VA is currently examining three different proposals for the VA campus  However  while residents and veterans have been patiently waiting for an update  they have been left in the dark over when a decision will be reached  Today Schumer wrote in his letter   Veterans and people of Canandaigua are eagerly anticipating the decision on where these new facilities will be located on the medical centers campus  However  the timeline for that decision remains vague  I ask that you clarify the process and timeline for selection of the options that have been presented  added Schumer   Schumer has long advocated that the Canandaigua VA stay open and offer top quality services for New   York veterans Schumer has called former Secretary Tony Principi and R  James Nicholson numerous times over the past three years  lobbying to save Canandaigua VA  and its services on the current campus  On October 20  2003  Schumer testified before the CARES committee  stating that closing the facility would create a crisis in health care for area veterans and an economic crisis in the community   Schumer also presented the commission with a large box with 80 000 signed petitions by state residents opposed to the shutdown plan  When Secretary Nicholson took over the VA in 2005  Schumer pressed him to support the community advisory board  and to not make changes to the board  Nicholson assured Schumer that he would continue to support the local advisory panel examining Canandaigua  Last year  in March 2006  Schumer urged President George W  Bush to visit the facility  Following the VA announcement about the future plans for the medical center in October of 2006  Schumer wrote a letter to Nicholson  urging to keep the Canandaigua VA Medical Centers Acute Psychiatric Unit open  and he requested a personal meeting with the Secretary to discuss the future of the campus
