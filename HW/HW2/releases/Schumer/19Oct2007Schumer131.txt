Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumerurged theinclusion of the hate crimes legislation in theconference report of the Department of Defense Authorization Bill  and for the President to sign the Bill when it hits his desk  The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act will strengthen the ability of federal  state  and local governments to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race  ethnic background  religion  gender  sexual orientation  disability  and gender identity  It will strengthen state and local efforts by enabling the Justice Department to assist them in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes  The legislation has passed the Senate as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill  and is currently being considered in the joint House Senate Conference on the Bill  Schumer said will write a letter to the conferees of the Bill  urging them to adopt the Senate language that includes the Matthew Shepard Act   Hate crimes shake our communities to the core  Schumer said  This rash of hate crimes and intimidation flies in the face of the best inclusive and diverse traditions of New York and America and needs to be stopped immediately  The NYPD does a phenomenal job and has worked diligently to catch the hatemongers who perpertrate these terrible crimes  but more help is always useful  The Matthew Shepard Act  named for a brave and exceptional young man  puts the federal government squarely behind the NYPDs efforts to ensure that they have every possible resource at their disposal   The Schumer backed legislation is designed to eliminate gaps in federal authority to investigate and prosecute bias motivated crimes  The bill would provide grants to help state and local governments meet the extraordinary expenses involved in hate crime cases  At the federal level  the Matthew Shepard Act will eliminate the outdated federally protected activity requirement in current law that prevents the Justice Department from working with state and local officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes  It will allow the federal government to step in when needed  but only after the Department has certified with state and local officials that a federal prosecution is necessary   The Matthew Shepard Act will provide technical  forensic  prosecutorial and other assistance to state and local law enforcement officials for hate crime investigations and prosecutions  The bill authorizes Justice Department grants of up to  100 000 to state  local  and Indian law enforcement officials who have incurred extraordinary expenses associated with investigating and prosecuting hate crimes  It will also authorize the Office of Justice Programs to award grants to state and local programs designed to combat hate crimes committed by juveniles  including programs to train local law enforcement officers in identifying  investigating  prosecuting  and preventing hate crimes   In 2005  the most current data available  there were 7 163 reported bias motivated criminal incidents  and many hate crimes never are reported Of the 7 163 total incidents  3 919 were motivated by racial bias  1 017 by sexual orientation bias  944 by ethnicity national origin bias  and 53 were reported to have occurred against disabled individuals  1 227  17 1   of all reported crimes were motivated by religious bias  as compared to 1 374  18   in 2004  Of the incidents motivated by religious bias in 2005  848  69 1   were directed against Jews and Jewish institutions   The Matthew Shepard Act will also give the Justice Department jurisdiction over crimes of violence committed because of a persons actual or perceived race  color  religion  national origin  gender  sexual orientation  disability  or gender identity  Existing law only covers race  color  religion  or national origin based hate crimes  where the victim was engaging in one of six federally protected activities  For crimes based on gender  sexual orientation  disability  or gender identity  the Justice Department must show a connection to interstate commerce  i e   that the defendant or victim crossed state lines or the defendant used a firearm that traveled through interstate commerce    A broad coalition of nearly 300 law enforcement  religious  civil rights  and civic organizations supports this legislation  The measure has also been endorsed by twenty six current state Attorneys General  former U S  Attorney General Dick Thornburgh  and virtually every major national law enforcement organizations in America    While serving in the House of Representatives  Schumer was the author and lead sponsor of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1997  He worked alongside Senator Edward Kennedy  who authored the Senate version of that hate crimes law  the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998   Although the Act was never passed in the House  it was one of the first attempts by Congress to enact federal hate crimes legislation  Schumer fought and pushed for hate crimes legislation for the following decade  and was instrumental in getting the Matthew Shepard Act passed in the Senate over ten years after the original effort began    Schumer also authored the Hate Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1992  which passed the House and sought to amend the sentencing guidelines for hate crimes  Additionally  Schumer was an original sponsor of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act when it was first introduced in the House in 1985  Introduced every year until its passage in 1989  the Act organized data on crimes of bigotry and allowed federal authorities to monitor and track these crimes  This was the first time these crimes were tracked  and it was the first time the government recognized sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes
