IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 3  2005 At Crain  s Speech  Schumer Warns  Culture Of Inertia Threatens To Derail Downtown Development    Lays Out Comprehensive Strategy For Revival                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Says  2 Billion Will be Lost if More Time is Wasted on JFK Downtown Rail Link  Sets Deadline for Concrete Plan to be in Place    Calls for Making Governor  s Island an International Biotech Center  Create Apron Park for Surrounding Downtown Waterfront  Build Other Parts of Ground Zero Before Freedom Tower Starts As the redevelopment of Ground Zero slows  and 2 billion dollars of federal money earmarked for transportation projects remains unspent  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer outlined a comprehensive strategy to revive downtown development  and set a deadline for a plan for the transportation money to be in place  In a major address at Crain  s Business Breakfast Forum  Schumer also discussed his plans for Governor  s Island to become an international biotech center and his idea to create an apron park to surround the downtown waterfront  The Senator also urged the State to build other parts of Ground Zero before the building of the Freedom Tower begins       The text of Schumer  s remarks follows       Good morning  it  s good to be back at Crain  s  As some of you may remember  in December of 2003  I last stood at this very forum and discussed our progress in rebuilding of Lower Manhattan since the dark days after September 11  2001  Today I would like look once again at our progress and share with you my thoughts about what we need to do to next to successfully rebuild Downtown and strengthen our City  s economic prosperity       In 2003  I spoke about the need to think big  to pursue bold projects and focus on job creation  I feel that more strongly today than ever about those goals  Yet I see a certain inertia and timidity setting in  and this is slowing the progress of the rebuilding  The signs of that slow down are evident for all to see  Plans for the new Downtown Goldman Sachs headquarters are on hold  Sunday  s New York Times reports that security concerns threaten to bog down the Freedom Tower  Over  700 million in CDBG funds  provided by Congress  remain unspent  We have not yet ordered one beam of steel for the Freedom Tower yet  Nearly four years after September 11  we are losing steam       Rebuilding the Ground Zero is a sign of the renewal and the resilience of New York City in particular  and the United States in general  We must turn our sights to rebuilding Downtown with the same dedication and energy we used to pick up the pieces in the months following that tragic day       Before 9 11 the three biggest commercial districts in the country in terms of office space were Midtown Manhattan  the Chicago Loop  and Lower Manhattan  That  s the way it  s been for years  Since 9 11  Washington DC has surpassed Lower Manhattan in terms of commercial space  That is not happy news  News like that ought to grab our attention and serve as wake up call to focus  once more  on Downtown a the top priority for our City and State       And let me also say that this is not a criticism on Mayor Bloomberg or Governor Pataki  Finger pointing will do us no good to get this project moving  Rather  we must refocus the entire culture surrounding the sites and our city  Unfortunately  a culture of inertia has infected downtown redevelopment and our city in general making large public projects like this one nearly impossible to complete       This culture of inertia has infected our capability to implement bold new public works of any type  At the dawn of the last century  we built a subway system and grand public works like Grand Central station  In the 30  s through 60  s we built a city highway system  Lincoln Center  and the World Trade Center  But there hasn  t been a major public work built in this city for 50 years  Why       I believe a culture of inertia has set in  Criticism predominates over construction  critics are given more weight than those trying to build  It doesn  t matter how small a constituency or flawed an argument the critic possesses  He or she always seems to predominate in political circles  in the news media  and in the public debate       We  ve always been a city that loves free thinking criticism  but it  s always been countered by a can do spirit  The culture of criticism doesn  t completely stop New York from growing because of capitalism  Someone can go ahead and build a small business or even a skyscraper on his or her own  The goal to make money overcomes the culture of criticism  But when it comes to large public works  where the profit motive vanishes and public pressure has great effect  we seem paralyzed  We haven  t built a grand public project or transportation improvement in New York for 50 years  since Lincoln Center and the World trade Center  Everything else   Moynihan Station  Ground Zero  the 7th Avenue extension  and the 2nd Avenue subway   has been held up       Yesterday  s New York Times has an architecture critic discussing how he would redesign the Freedom Tower  Sure  we could always go back to the drawing board and get 10 new plans  But whatever else you want to say about LMDC  they have been open to ideas and their process has been inclusive  The time is now for action  not criticism       New York is a frenetic place of big dreams  ambition  and drive  It  s a place that attracts movers and shakers from all over the world  many of them in this room today  But we  re approaching the biggest development challenge of our collective times with an inertia that doesn  t suit our City      Who Lost Goldman Sachs   In August 2004  Goldman Sachs  one of the world  s premier financial services firms  announced its intention to build a new headquarters in Lower Manhattan  Goldman stated that it would build a magnificent 40 story   2 billion tower that would house the over 12 000 employees  4 000 of them new  The construction alone would bring over 700 construction jobs and add over  350 million to the economy  New Yorkers were both relieved and thrilled       And then in early April  after two years of prolonged negotiations with the City and State  the firm abruptly announced its intention to pull out of Site 26 and seek other options  There seem to be a number of matters at issue and I applaud Governor Pataki for agreeing to drop one of the main obstacles to the deal  construction of a West Street tunnel  It  s good the tunnel is finally dead  To have paid over  700 million extra for a three block tunnel would have been one of the most colossal wastes of money since the Tweed Courthouse  But  unfortunately  it is clear that Goldman  s concerns go beyond the tunnel and the firm has not agreed to return to Site 26 yet       Much to my surprise  Goldman  s announcement prompted relatively little outcry or in the media  In any other city  an announcement such as Goldman  s would have prompted a massive outpouring of public attention and effort  I am sad to say that has not been the case here  Again  our civic culture seems to have just shrugged  Criticism and why we should not get something done ends up on page 1  while the failure to do something  even something vital to our city  more and more  is met with a shrug of the shoulders       I sincerely hope that Goldman will return to the bargaining table  In January 2002 when we were all deeply concerned about the future of Downtown  if someone would have told us that one of the nation  s premier financial services firms wanted to build an elegant new headquarters and add 4 000 new jobs  we would have rolled out the red carpet  We should still do that today       If New York cannot cut through the bureaucratic morass and allow Goldman to build Downtown  then something is deeply wrong with our civic culture and I fear for the future of our city      Freedom Tower  The Times story on Sunday confirmed what many of us feared    momentum for the Freedom Tower is slowing and it now appears that it will be some time before all the complex security and infrastructure questions can be resolved satisfactorily  Originally the Freedom Tower was slated for completion by 2009  now that looks more like 2010 or 2011  nearly a decade after September 11       The fact that the Freedom Tower will be a target is not news  The World Trade Center was attacked twice  and all the parties involved in the construction of the Freedom Tower have approached the project with a dual mission of expressing New York  s  and our nation  s  spirit of hope and optimism  while ensuring that the building be maximally safe from attack       The Freedom Tower has to be one of the very best defended private buildings in the world and we all know that will take extra time and money to do so  But I also know that it is precisely because it WILL be a target that we cannot delay its construction  With its bold and evocative design  the Freedom Tower is more than a building to anchor Lower Manhattan  it is a statement of American resolve  The Police Department  s particular concerns about the building should be taken seriously  But the Freedom Tower cannot become a barricaded  windowless fortress   a dark and uninviting presence in a neighborhood that desperately needs the shops  people and bustle unique to this great City       A higher standard for Freedom Tower is appropriate  But the higher standard we set for the Freedom Tower should not to take over everything else  Santiago Calatrava  s soaring and beautiful design for the World Trade Center station is one of the most extraordinary elements of the Downtown plan  But we know that the glass design might be vulnerable to attack  And while we must take every precaution  we can  t let our security concerns leave us with a cement box       The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  one of urban America  s greatest champions and  not surprisingly a fan of Mr  Calatrava  s designs  repeatedly warned that we must not let our fears destroy the physical and social openness of our nation  s great cities  He warned that   ours must be openness and fearlessness in the face of those who hide in the darkness  A precaution  yes  sequester  no          We all know that a truck bomb could damage any one of our hundreds of skyscrapers  Biological  chemical  and worst of all nuclear weapons could do even worse  But fear of terrorism cannot stop us from building and thinking grand  or we will be much the less      Transportation   I have long supported using the lion  s share of those funds to build a rail link from Downtown to JFK Airport  As we all know  Downtown Manhattan has not grown like Midtown  or even Downtown Brooklyn  in part because it  s harder to get to       There  s a total of 2 7 billion in federal funds available for the downtown link   700 million comes from dollars not spent on West Street tunnel  And  2 billion will come from dollars that Congress will hopefully allocate this summer as the last piece of the  20 billion owed NY  This money was originally scheduled for tax breaks  to prevent business from leaving downtown and has not been used  We have gotten the ok from the President and Senate leaders to use this  2 billion for transportation purposes  Should it pass this summer  and I am optimistic it will  it will be doled out in ten  200 million dollops  Other sources of funds for the tunnel are the  560 from the Port Authority and the  400 the MTA has committed  That makes a total of  3 7 available for the link       That said many people believe the rail link will cost  6  8 billion  The only other real source of dollars is additional funding by the MTA  which finds itself dangerously overextended  Earlier this year  MTA wanted  8 billion to continue its ambitious capital plan  but NYS legislature only gave them only  2 5 billion  which puts much of its capital plan in jeopardy  Furthermore the MTA has listed East Side access and 2nd Avenue subway as its two highest yet unfunded capital projects  Will the MTA commit the extra dollars needed if the rail link costs more the 3 7 billion  And if not where will the dollars come from       I am a believer in the JFK rail link project and was one of the earliest to propose it  But I also feel strongly that the remaining federal funds must be spent quickly  to spur growth and job creation now       We do not have firm plans in place for the route and construction of the JFK rail link  I believe we must set a deadline for ourselves  and begin thinking of alternatives if the dollars or plans for this rail link fail to materialize  If we take as long to get the JFK Downtown rail link underway as some of the other post 9 11 projects  we risk losing the  2 billion altogether  Thus  if the complete financing and plan for building a rail link are not concrete  by the time of next year  s fiscal budget  July 2006  I will move to spend it on some other downtown needed purpose  In Washington if you don  t use it  you lose it      Quality of Life   It will take some time to get the rail link project underway and resolve the security and infrastructure issues surrounding the Freedom Tower  But there is much we can do to revitalize downtown immediately and not wait for final plans for Freedom Tower and the rail link to gel  We should focus immediately on retail development  such as that planned for Tower 2  Tower 2 is a smaller building at Ground Zero facing Church Street that will provide retail  which is so desperately needed Downtown in the Ground Zero area  We built 7 World Trade quickly  why can  t we do the same with number 2 and the beautiful Calatrava station  They should start these projects within one year       We should also focus on quality of life improvements  from parks to cultural activities that attract major employers and residents alike  The Regional Plan Association has proposed five key projects  at a total cost of  464 million that will help revitalize the oldest and one of the most beautiful parts of our great city       New York is city of neighborhoods  And it is the small gifts    such as the parks  that make neighborhoods distinct and soften life in a hectic city  What would the Upper West Side be without Riverside Park OR even the Broadway medians that lend some depth and greenery to the streetscape  Here Downtown  we have a chance to create the same environment       We can easily afford these projects out of the remaining  unused  735 million in federal CDBG funds  We should start all of them within the next year  There is no reason to wait for the Freedom Tower or anything else  For a relatively small public investment  these projects will create one grand GREEN apron that will link the waterfront all the way around Lower Manhattan  The new waterfront access will attract new residents and jobs            70 million to extend the Hudson River Park southwards           90 million   to invest in the Fulton Street Corridor Plan  Help with streetscape improvements  retail fa    ades  and upgrading intersections and parks along Fulton Street  directly east of Ground Zero            27 million   to implement the Chinatown Circulation plan   necessary to create a series of improvements to traffic access and circulation to Chinatown            125 million   the Greenwich Street South project would deck over the Brooklyn Battery Bridge Tunnel cut to build about 2 000 new units of housing and urban parkland            152 million    East River Waterfront Plan  This would open up the East River waterfront to public recreation  and would reconnect the City to the East River where it began  The plan calls for a grand esplanade from the North of the Manhattan Bridge to the battery      I believe these are the kind of relatively small investments that we need to complement the large commercial office towers and major transportation projects  These kinds of projects are important in order to create the kind of residential environment that will attract the people who will create a truly 24 7 community  And the best news is that many of these projects are popular with area residents and businesses  ready to go  and we have funds in hand  A rare and wonderful combination in New York      Jobs and New Industries for New York   But I believe we need to think and dream even beyond these infrastructure projects  We need to plan ahead for the next industries that will create jobs and drive New York  s economic engine  We  re still growing slower than the national average and the finance industry is still 54 000 jobs below 2000 levels  which should not please New Yorkers given the 2001 job losses       We do need Lower Manhattan to remain a vibrant financial center  but we need to attract a diverse mix of industries  so that the economic base Downtown can  t be disrupted the way the financial services industry was disrupted following 9 11       We  ve had a few successes  Verizon  Bowne  and Morgan Stanley  But we should do a lot more and should broaden the net to other industries       Right after 9 11 we put together a slate of federal tax breaks worth  3 8 billion to keep existing businesses downtown  Now  it  s time for City and State to put together a new set of tax incentives to lure new businesses there       There is no excuse for 7 WTC still being vacant  Even if it takes deep State and City tax incentives to restore jobs downtown  the price is clearly worth it      Governors Island   And in the effort to attract new businesses and create jobs  we have a secret weapon    Governors Island       Governors Island is a gem with what amounts to the 50 city blocks worth of developable space just across from Downtown Manhattan  As we know  Governors Island presents a unique chance for the planners and developers to start thinking big  Growth on Governors Island can dovetail on Downtown redevelopment and vice versa       We have a tremendous opportunity with Governor  s Island  and we can  t squander it  I believe we ought to pursue a major bio tech or pharmaceutical facility to the island  The major European pharmaceutical firms have determined that they get better research product from the scientists over here  Novartis recently decided to open a major facility in Cambridge that created 4 to 5 000 jobs  Glaxo Smith Kline and other European pharma firms are looking to open a similar facility in the States  That ought to be New York       We are one of the great centers of biomedical research  But we have relatively few businesses that take that research and turn it into product and more jobs       We have all the major hospitals here and the best doctors  It  s a natural fit for New York  We should do whatever it takes to lure one of these companies that will create thousands of jobs at first and tens of thousands more as spin off firms lure more bio tech to New York       The Coast Guard departed Governors Island in 1997  and now eight years later  once again we have to reject the culture of inertia and act      Conclusion   Osama Bin Laden and the 9 11 hijackers targeted the political  military  and economic centers of the United States  They viewed New York City and the Twin Towers as a mighty symbol of our nation  s power and prosperity  While we can put up a Freedom Tower  we will not have made a statement about the resilience of our City  and the resilience of our nation  unless we truly rebuild Lower Manhattan as an economic center of the free world       Right now we seem to be losing our way  letting inertia and bureaucratic obstacles slow our progress  Rebuilding Lower Manhattan is not just any old public works project  Nothing less than the future of our City is at stake       So let us raise new canyons of steel with the same resolve with which we cleared those mountains of rubble  We are New Yorkers  we don  t cower  We create  We build  We grow ever stronger  There  s no question that New York can do it  And we will  Let  s stop twiddling our thumbs and get to work
