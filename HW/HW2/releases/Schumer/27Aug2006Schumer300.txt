IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 27  2006 Schumer Reveals  United Nations Building Has Deteriorated So That It Has Become A Deathtrap  Putting First Responders At Risk In The Event Of Emergency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Current Building hasn  t been Updated for 50 Years  Violates NYC Fire and Safety Codes    Oval Out Front Could Not Support Necessary Fire Equipment  Would Collapse Under the Weight of the Trucks   Schumer Calls on Ambassador Bolton  Secretary General Annan to Step Up to the Plate  Get Rehabilitation Approved as Soon as UN Reconvenes Next Month                                                 Today  United States Senator Charles E  Schumer  standing at the United Nations called for the immediate renovation of the United Nations building  which has not been updated in fifty years  The United Nations is one of the twenty largest employers in the City and generates billions of dollars for the City  s economy  However  the building  in its current state  poses a terrible risk to those who work inside the building  in the neighborhood  and first responders  Schumer called on Ambassador Bolton and Secretary Annan to work quickly to guide the project through the approval process as soon at the United Nations reconvenes in September         While the blue green windows of Secretariat building glisten on the outside every day  on the inside the building is crumbling     Schumer said     The UN  s grave state of disrepair may be hidden  but it is putting the health and safety of thousands of New Yorkers in great danger         The U N  headquarters hasn t undergone a major renovation since it was built 50 years ago  and now violates most New York City fire and safety codes  In its current state  the UN complex poses a risk to the lives of those who work in the building  the neighborhoods adjacent to the building  and the first responders who would be called onto the scene in the event of an emergency  The complex has no sprinkler system  is packed with asbestos and leaks nearly 25 percent of the heat pumped into it in the winter        In July of 2005  U N  Undersecretary General Christopher Burnham  in his testimony before Congress said that a major fire would sweep up the sides of the building  within minutes    If one of the massive steam pipes which now leak were to blow  there s a real potential that a large area surrounding the U N  would be contaminated with asbestos  requiring the evacuation of the area until cleaning crews could decontaminate it     Heavy emergency service vehicles wouldn t be able to reach the main building because the asphalt oval in the front  which covers an underground garage  could not support their weight       These issues arose in the early 1990  s and the UN has gone to great lengths to prepare for a renovation  spending millions on architects  engineers and sub consultants  The project has been delayed for many reasons  including the New York State Senates failure to alienate the Robert Moses playground in 2005  The defeat of this legislation meant that the UN had to abandon their long held plans of building a new tower to house workers during the renovation and instead opt to move workers out of the Secretariat building in stages while carrying out the extensive renovations        In addition  the UN adds enormous economic value to the city per annum  In employing 6000 people  it is one of the top 20 largest employers in the City   The latest figures on the economic impact of the UN  a study in 1995 by the City of New York  found that entities only here because of the United Nations directly spent  1 5 billion in the NYC area and that the total direct and indirect spending by the entire UN and it s employees was  3 3 billion   Estimates today  put that contribution to the City of New York in excess of  4 billion  Additionally  the UN attracts tourists from around the world to Manhattan  s Far East side  According to the United Nations  37 million visitors have visited the  Parliament of the World  since 1952  with average attendance near 400 000 people per year        In June of this year  the UN adopted a plan    known as Strategy IV    that would move workers out of the Secretariat building ten floors at a time into leased space in midtown Manhattan  The renovations would be performed so that the bulk of the building would be operational throughout the process  The plan also calls for the renovation of the Hall of Delegates  the grand chamber where representatives from nations around the world meet  A temporary Hall space would be constructed on the North Lawn of the UN facility while the renovations were completed  a process that would likely take about 1 year to complete       Currently  the UN has allocated  100 5 million to pay for design  engineering and leasing costs associated with the renovation project  The total project cost is estimated at  1 6 billion  including the money already appropriated  Beginning in October of this year the UN s Fifth Committee  the entity with oversight over all spending at the UN  is expected to commence debate on the remainder of the appropriation  The project will be paid for in the same manner that member nations pay their dues  The United States currently pays 22  of the UN s operating costs of the institution      Schumer warned that if the UN did not move quickly to approve the renovation  the price tag for the job could spiral out of control  In April of this year  the former head of the rebuilding effort  Louis Fredrick Reuter IV calculated that because of worldwide construction escalation costs and the particularly high price of building in New York City  every day that the project was delayed increased the final cost by  225 000        In an effort to finally get the building renovated  Schumer today called on Secretary General Annan to step up to the plate and have the 5th committee consider this item as soon as they return  lest delays will push back construction start date and lead to more cost overruns       He also called on Ambassador Bolton to make this a priority for the United States and the United Nations  Schumer said today that because the United Nations is New York Bolton needs to lead the way in making sure it is safe for the neighborhood and its inhabitants        Schumer noted that while he often disagrees with specific policies and positions adopted by the UN  the renovation of the Secretariat building was a health and safety imperative for New York City        The UN needs to reform the way its bureaucracy works  And the policies that UN implements  and blocks  are sometimes downright awful     Schumer said    Given it dire state of disrepair and the unquestionable value the UN brings to New York  public officials at all levels of government should pull out all the stops to make it happen       The United States and New York City have a long and proud tradition of providing a welcome home to the United Nations Headquarters   In the 1940  s President Truman provided a  65 million   465 million in 2000 dollars  no interest loan to construct the campus  the city of New York contributed  5 million towards clearing land and performing site prep  and a private citizen    John D  Rockefeller    donated 17 acres of property he had purchased for  8 5 million  on which the facility is currently sited          Renovating the UN is not only an investment in the economic future of our city and country     Schumer said    Its presence here has helped New York achieve the rightful title as the Capital of the World  We need to do everything we can to keep the U N  here  A safe U N
