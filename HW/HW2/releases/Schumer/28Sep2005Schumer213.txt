IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 28  2005 Floor Statement Of Sen  Chuck Schumer In Opposition To Roberts Nomination To Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY    Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  announced his opposition to the nomination of Judge John G  Roberts  Jr  for Chief Justice of Supreme Court of the United States at the Judiciary Committee Markup session  The statement prepared for delivery follows       Mr  President  I rise to speak on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States        Votes like this come about so rarely that many Senators have spent their entire careers in this body without ever having had the opportunity to vote on a Chief Justice        And most of us in the Senate today will likely never again vote on a nominee to that incalculably important position       That is why I have been troubled about how some have characterized the votes of conscientious Senators in this case    Senators from my party who have struggled with  and deliberated over  Judge Roberts  s record in arriving at their decisions       As will be borne out tomorrow  Democratic Senators have given this vote the profound and serious consideration that it deserves   We are not voting monolithically  but rather each according to his or her own conscience        And that is what this vote is       It is a question of principle    not of politics  partisanship  or positioning  as some have cynically suggested        Democrats have truly struggled with this vote  I know I have  Like some others  I did not make up my mind until late on the night before the Committee vote       We are not marching in lockstep  with nary a dissent like my colleagues across the aisle       But while this vote was a close call for many  like myself   the next one may not be       While this nomination did not warrant an attempt to block the nominee on the floor of the Senate  the next one might       If the President sends us a nominee who  like Janice Rogers Brown  believes that the New Deal was the triumph of a   socialist revolution     there will be a fight       If the President sends us a nominee who  like Priscilla Owen  was criticized by her conservative colleague  Alberto Gonzalez  for an   unconscionable act of judicial activism     there will be a fight       If the President sends us a nominee who  like Miguel Estrada  refuses to answer any real questions and whose record is not made fully available  there will be a fight       If the President sends us a nominee who is committed to an agenda of turning the clock back on civil rights  workers   rights  individual autonomy  or other vital Constitutional protections  there will likely be a fight       And it will be a fight without any winners        So  Mr  President  on the eve not only of the confirmation vote on John Roberts  but also the President  s nomination of a replacement for the seat of Justice O  Connor    for more than two decades a pivotal swing vote on the High Court    I hope and pray that the President chooses to unite rather than divide  that he chooses consensus over confrontation       Now let me return to the vote at hand       This vote should be viewed against a unique    and troubling    historical backdrop       Indeed  the stage for this vote was set some five years ago  It was set by a President who vowed that    if given the opportunity    he would name to the Supreme Court Justices in the   mold    of Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia       Given the President  s campaign promise and repeated declarations  there is a presumption that any nominee the President sends to the Senate is in that   mold          The presumption is especially strong    and is particularly hard to overcome          with a nominee who was carefully vetted  researched  and interviewed at sufficient length by a President who professed a desire to nominate people in the mold of Thomas and Scalia          with a nominee who is eagerly embraced by those groups who support the views of Thomas and Scalia and who want to change America through the Courts       The presumption can be rebutted  of course  And the way it can be rebutted is through the answering of questions and through the production of relevant documents  And here  regrettably  there was much lacking       To be fair  Judge Roberts did partially rebut the presumption  He made some inroads       Judge Roberts has a keen and impressive intellect  His encyclopedic knowledge of the law and eloquent presentation certainly confirmed what his colleagues have said about him    that he is one of the best advocates  if not the best advocate  in the nation       But being brilliant and accomplished is not the number one criterion for elevation to the Supreme Court    there are many who would use their considerable talents and legal acumen to set America back  So  while legal brilliance is to be considered  it is never dispositive       In addition  very good lawyers know how to avoid tough questions  People have said that one of the reasons the nominee was so effective arguing in the Supreme Court is that he mastered the trick of making the point he wanted to make  rather than answer the question asked       When I reviewed the transcript in the week after the hearings concluded but before we were called on to vote  there was often less than met the ear       There is an obligation of nominees to answer questions fully and forthrightly  because they are essential to figuring out a nominee  s judicial philosophy and ideology   to me  the most important criteria in choosing a Justice        Many of us were disappointed in his failure to answer so many questions and is one of the contributing factors to the no votes that will be cast against Judge Roberts       Add to that the refusal of the Administration to allow the Senate to examine important and relevant documents  and we are voting on a hunch  Senators voting on the position of Chief Justice should not be relegated to voting on a   hunch          We are left to guesswork  impressions  and hunches       There was a bit of a game of hide and seek going on    as much as Senators tried to seek out his views  many remained hidden away       That is why that I so badly hope that the next nominee will be more forthcoming and will answer more questions about his or her legal views  and that all relevant documents will be provided       But  the answering of questions is only a means to an end    it is a means of finding out what kind of judge  or Justice  a nominee will make       In this case  because there were not enough questions answered or documents provided  we are still unsure of the answer to the central question  Who is Judge Roberts       Particularly troubling to me are the eerie parallels between Judge Roberts  s testimony and then Judge Thomas  s  especially given President Bush  s declaration that he would nominate Justices in the mold of Justice Thomas       The echoes of then Judge Thomas  s empty reassurances that he was a mainstream jurist are ringing in the ears of every Senator who listened to many nearly identical statements from Judge Roberts last week       I was particularly troubled by his answers in two areas    the Constitutional right to privacy and the Congress  s Commerce Clause power to protect the rights and improve the lives of the American people         At his hearing  for example  Judge Roberts said that he believes   there is a right to privacy protected as part of the liberty guarantee in the due process clause     At his hearing  then Judge Thomas made almost the identical statement  He said   I  with respect to the privacy interests  would continue to say that the liberty component of the due process clause is the repository of that interest     As a Supreme Court Justice  however  Justice Thomas has repeatedly urged the most narrow interpretation of a privacy interest possible  in Casey  in Lawrence  and at every other opportunity          At his hearing  Judge Roberts repeatedly assured the Committee that he had   no quarrel    with various Supreme Court decisions on issues of privacy  women  s rights  civil rights  education  and other important issues  The same assurance was made by Justice Thomas at his hearings  but when given the opportunity to consider those cases with which he had   no quarrel    from the bench  Justice Thomas voted to overrule         At his hearing  Judge Roberts repeatedly assured the Committee that he had   no agenda     The same assurance was made by Justices Thomas and Scalia at their hearings  But given Justice Thomas  s history  in particular  the phrase alone provides little comfort         Besides these concerns about Judge Roberts  s views on the right to privacy and on the Establishment Clause  I also was troubled by his answers on the Commerce Clause  I asked him if he would disagree with Justice Thomas  s extremely narrow  19th century  and widely discredited view that Congress may not regulate activities occurring within a state even if they have substantial effects on interstate commerce  He refused         There is therefore too serious a chance that Judge Roberts believes that Congress is without power to protect workers   rights  women  s rights  and the environment on this widely accepted Constitutional basis       We simply did not get definitive answers to these questions at the hearings       At the hearings  I gave Judge Roberts EVERY OPPORTUNITY to distance himself from Justice Thomas  s most extreme views  He refused       Now  Senator Cornyn and others from across the aisle have said that if we can  t vote for this nominee who COULD we vote for  Here is your answer          someone who answers questions fully and who makes his or her record fully available          someone who gives us a significant level of assurance with some answers and a record that he or she is not an ideologue        Roberts is clearly brilliant and his demeanor suggests he well MIGHT not be an ideologue       But he simply did not make the case strongly enough to bet the farm       There is a good chance    perhaps even a majority chance    that Judge Roberts will be like Justice Rehnquist on the bench  We know he will be brilliant  and he could well be    while very conservative    not an ideologue  That is why I struggled with this decision so long and so hard   If he is a Rehnquist  that would not be cause for exultation  nor would it be cause for alarm  The Court  s balance will not be altered       But there is a reasonable danger that he will be like Justice Thomas  the most radical Justice on the Supreme Court       It is not that I am certain that he will be a Thomas  It  s not even that the chance that he will a Thomas is greater than fifty percent  But the risk that he might be a Thomas and the lack of reassurance that he won  t    particularly in light of this President  s professed desire to nominate people in that mold    is just not good enough       Because if he is a Justice Thomas  he could turn back the clock decades for all Americans  The Court  s balance may be tipped radically in one direction and stay that way for too long       I hope he is not a Thomas  But the risk is too great to bear  and ti exceeds the upside benefit       Because of that risk and its enormous consequences for generations of Americans  I cannot vote yes  I must reluctantly cast my vote against confirmation
