                                Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer today called on their colleagues in Congress to retain vital homeland security funding for high risk areas in the upcoming supplemental appropriations bill  In a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security  the Senators  along with several of their colleagues  emphasized that the funding in question is vital to ensuring that high risk cities have the resources available to adequately plan and prepare for a major catastrophic event        High threat targets must be our highest homeland security priority   We need to make sure that our limited homeland security funds get to where they are needed most and that New York and other areas under the greatest threat receive adequate funding to prepare and protect themselves   Senator Clinton said        More than five years since the tragic World Trade Center attacks  New York remains in the terrorists  cross hairs along with the other top high risk urban areas across the nation   said Senator Schumer   It s crystal clear that the little homeland security funding we have should be going toward protecting areas where residents are most at risk and this additional funding is a step in the right direction  We are going to continue to fight for the vital homeland security dollars New York desperately needs      A copy of the Senators  letter is attached    The Honorable Robert C Byrd  Chairman  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  D 135  Washington DC 20510   The Honorable Thad Cochran  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  H 123  Washington DC 20510   The Honorable David E  Price  Chairman  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States House of Representatives  B   307 Rayburn  Washington DC 20515   The Honorable Harold Rogers  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States House of Representatives  B   307 Rayburn  Washington DC 20515    Dear Chairmen Byrd and Price and Ranking Members Cochran and Rogers    As you move forward with conference negotiations on the U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans  Health  and Iraq Accountability Act  2007 we ask that the  35 million in the Senate report for Tier One Urban Area Security Initiative cities for the purpose of developing regional catastrophic event plans and preparedness remain in the final version of the bill  In the wake of severe cuts in high threat UASI funding in recent years  this money is vital to ensuring that our highest risk cities have the resources available to adequately plan and prepare for a major catastrophic event       On June 16  2006  the Department of Homeland Security released its Nationwide Plan Review  Phase 2 Report   The DHS report states that  current catastrophic planning is unsystematic and not linked within a national planning system    The report found that 61 percent of States and 69 percent of urban areas do not have adequate plans to respond to a catastrophic event   It is critical that urban areas plan for response and recovery from threats such as a potential nuclear attack  a chemical incident or a major natural disaster    35 million would serve as a starting point for the Tier One UASI sites for strategic planning  mass evacuation planning  and support for the impacted communities surrounding the urban area  public education  and outreach       We recognize the difficult choices you will have to make in completing a final version of the bill  but we think this funding deserves special consideration   Thank you for your consideration of this important request                                                                      Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles E  Schumer  Barack Obama  Dianne Feinstein
