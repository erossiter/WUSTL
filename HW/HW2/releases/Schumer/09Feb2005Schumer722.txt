IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 9  2005 New Schumer Analysis  This Week s Federal Budget Proposal Stiffs Upstate NY Fire Departments By  21 Million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      New analysis reveals FIRE grants program  a critical lifeline to NY fire departments  is underfunded by  450 million nationwide  Program has sent NY fire dept s  77 million since 2001    With New York fire departments struggling to stay afloat  Schumer details new plan that would restore full equipment   training traning    Schumer to detail cuts each NY county faces  Capital Region fire departmen US Senator Charles E  Schumer today vowed to restore funding to the federal budget so that upstate New York fire departments do not lose out on  21 million in funding for equipment  training  and fire trucks as proposed under the Administration s federal budget released this week  Schumer today announced a new report showing that the Administration s budget request that shortchange the USFA Grants to Firefighters Program by  450 million would hit New York particularly hard because fire departments in each county of the state have received a total of  77 million since the program began in 2001         New York  s firefighters serve on the front lines of the War on Terror everyday     Schumer said    We must do everything we can to give them the tools they need to protect us and keep our communities safe  New York fire departments facing huge budget gaps have been able to use this program to pay for fire trucks  train their staff  and fill their equipment needs  We need to restore funding to this program and I m going to fight to make sure we do just that           At Schumer s urging  fire departments across New York have taken advantage of the Grants to Firefighters Program  which sends funds directly for activities such as hiring additional firefighting personnel  specialized emergency response training for situations like terrorist attacks  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  new fire trucks  and fire prevention programs  These grants are distributed through the Department of Homeland Security  s Office of Domestic Preparedness and are a main component of the federal governement  s efforts to aid local first responders        Because of its dramatic success in improving fire safety  Congress has raised the amount of money available in the program from  100 million for FY2001 to  715 million for FY2005  This is the second year in a row that the Administration has proposed cutting the program to  500 million  Last year  Congress restored  215 million of this funding  but this still fell short of the  900 million authorized for the program in FY2005  For FY2006  Congress has authorized  950 million for the program   450 million more than what is included in the Administration  s budget proposal  Schumer said that if the federal government fails to fully fund the authorization  the impact of local budget crunches on fire departments in New York will be exacerbated dramatically next year  His budget  revealed that the proposed budget could impact fire departments in the state at the following levels            Capital Region fire departments could lose out on approximately  2 7 million         Central New York fire departments could lose out on approximately  1 8 million        Rochester Finger Lakes fire departments could lose out on approximately  2 6 million         Hudson Valley fire departments could lose out on approximately  3 million        North Country fire departments could lose out on approximately  3 1 million         Southern Tier fire departments could lose out on approximately  3 2 million         Western New York fire departments could lose out on approximately  4 4 million        Please see attached  for county by county breakdowns and listings of how much each county has received from the program since 2001  For a full list of individual recipients  visit  http   www firegrantsupport com winners aspx       Schumer said that he would join with Senate colleagues later this year to introduce an amendment to the budget that would restore the entire  950 million to the FIRE grants program  Schumer urged the Congress and the White House to adopt this increase by sending the full  950 million promised to fire departments by Congress    and   including approximately  21 million more to upstate New York than is in the current proposal        The Administration  s budget proposal slashes funding for our first responders  but our local fire departments need help from the federal government now more than ever     Schumer said    Budget gaps continue to strain departments  and the burden on local fire departments is becoming too much to bear  Add to that the heightened alert our first responders are on because of the War on Terror  and this attempt to stiff our fire departments makes even less sense        Schumer helped create the original Grants to Firefighters Program  co sponsoring legislation in 2001 that led to its establishment  He also played a central role in preventing the Bush Administration from eliminating funding for the program from the 2001 budget
