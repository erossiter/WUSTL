                                    Early Valentine  s Day Gift to Oil Companies Wrapped in 2005 Energy Bill Reduces Obligations to U S  Taxpayers by Billions   Schumer Introduces Measure to Eliminate Royalty Relief Enacted Last Year Today U S  Senator Chuck Schumer announced that he will introduce a bill to eliminate royalty relief measures for big oil and gas companies signed into law last year in the Energy Bill of 2005  At a time when oil and gas companies are reaping windfall profits  there is no need to further reward them with royalty relief  Recent reports indicate that as a result of loosened royalty requirements  including a wide variety of provisions in last year  s energy bill  oil and gas companies will receive a giant federal hand out at a cost of nearly  7 billion  by some estimates  to U S  taxpayers  Schumer will introduce a measure that will strike those provisions that permit oil and gas companies to avoid paying royalties  the payments required to drill on federal land        Schumer stated    Allowing big oil and gas companies to pad their record profits royalties owed to the American taxpayer would be like giving a box of chocolates to a candy maker on Valentine  s Day            Oil and gas companies  reaping record windfall profits over the last few years  need no added incentive to explore for oil and gas  With prices over  60 a barrel for oil and over  7 for natural gas  the record prices should be incentive enough     Schumer said       According to the most recent prices  oil is selling for  61 55 barrel and gas is at  7 16 mmbtu       Less than a year ago  in an April 20  2005 address to U S  Hispanic Chamber of Commerce  President Bush said    With oil at more than  50 a barrel  by the way  energy companies do not need taxpayers  funded incentives to explore for oil and gas          Last month  Schumer wrote a letter urging the Department of Interior Inspector General to fully investigate whether or not oil and gas companies were short changing taxpayers on their royalty payments  He further asked the I G  Earl Devaney to estimate how much taxpayers will be short due to royalty relief measures contained in the Energy Bill of 2005  Schumer  s initial letter to the Interior Department is below      January 23  2006      The Honorable Earl E  Devaney  Inspector General  United States Department of Interior  1849 C Street  NW  Washington  DC 20240      Dear Inspector General Devaney       I am writing to express my deeply held concern related to a report published in the New York Times that companies producing natural gas may have avoided paying the Department of Interior  DOI  the full amount of royalties owed under the law  As you know  companies that produce natural gas derive a significant amount of their supplies from public lands owned by the American people  I am extremely disturbed by the possibility that as American families are paying significantly higher prices to heat their homes  they may also be getting short changed through underpaid royalties by the same companies that have reaped extraordinary profits from increased energy prices  In order to rectify this situation I urge you to submit a report to Congress within 30 days examining the scope of underpayment  steps to be taken by DOI to better enforce royalty regulations  and the impact of royalty provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other recent changes to royalty rules on future DOI revenues        These reports indicate a number of areas in which misreporting by energy companies  arcane DOI rules  and lax DOI enforcement efforts may have cost American taxpayers millions of dollars in uncollected royalties  It is perhaps most disturbing that these reports indicate energy companies have been able to underpay their royalties simply by reporting a lower natural gas share price to DOI than they report to their own shareholders  For example  using data reported by energy companies DOI stated that the average sale price of natural gas in FY05 was  5 62 per thousand cubic feet  despite the fact that Exxon  Chevron  and Kerr McGee reported prices of about  6 88   6 49  and  6 59 respectively over a similar timeframe  This alleged price under reporting is fundamentally disingenuous and would have a direct impact on royalties collected by DOI  unjustly depriving the American taxpayer of payment for public resources       The report also indicated that DOI has reduced its aggressiveness in auditing royalty information and by enforcing compliance with existing royalty rules  including one instance in which DOI has still not moved to recover royalties owed to it for three years under certain rules governing price triggers for royalty payments on natural gas  Enforcing compliance with royalty regulations and aggressively working to collect money owed by energy companies to the federal government is one of DOI  s core missions  and any possible failure to pursue that responsibility is an unacceptable breach of public trust        The report states that as a result of these practices that despite the soaring price of natural gas  the amount of royalties collected in 2005   5 15 billion  was actually slightly lower than the amount collected in 2001  According to the report the failure of royalty receipts to keep pace with the increase in market prices resulted in a more than  700 million shortfall in federal revenues  At a time when energy company profits are at unprecedented highs  consumer budgets are bearing the heavy burden of high energy costs  and the federal government is facing a growing deficit it is unacceptable to allow energy companies to underpay the American people for their natural resources by failing to pay their full royalty obligation  In order to ensure that these practices do not continue I urge you  within the next 30 days  to provide a report to Congress including       1  The differential in royalty payments actually received from 2000 to the present and the amount of royalties that would have been received had energy companies reported the same natural gas sales price to DOI that they reported to their shareholders   2  A process for providing Congressional oversight committees with information regarding specific royalty transactions on a quarterly basis   3  A record of the number of audits as well as the number of staff and amount of funds dedicated to audits and compliance on an annual basis from FY00 to the present   4  An impact of the royalty reforms contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 as well as any administrative reforms to royalty rules that occurred from 2000 to the present on future royalty revenues       I believe that in order to ensure that American taxpayers receive the benefits they are owed from natural gas production on public lands  and to provide for fair and transparent energy markets  it is vital that these issues be resolved as quickly as possible  I thank you for your attention to this important issue and look forward to your reply       Sincerely   Charles E  Schumer
