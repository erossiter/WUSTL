IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 13  2006 Schumer  19 000 Cap Region Single Parent Families At Risk Because Of Closed Door Legislative Maneuver That Cuts Child Support Collection For Those That Desperately Need It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Over Next Five Years New York State Would Lose  167 Million In Federal Funds  Preventing Collection of Nearly  334 Million In Payments To New York Families    Senator To Stand with Albany Single Mother Who Utilized Program To Collect  27 000 In Back Child Support Payments    Despite Overwhelming Bipartisan Support For One Of Government  s Most Effective and Efficient Programs  Funding Gutted Behind C With 18 800 capital region families depending on child support payments  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called for restored funding for the Child Support Enforcement Program  Congress   Budget Reconciliation Bill cut this critical program by  1 5 billion  which would impact 17 3 million children nationwide and could translate into a  334 million drop in New York child support       These cuts hurt us where we feel it the most  with our families     Schumer said    This is one of the most efficient and effective programs we have  For every  1 spent  families collect  4 38 in child support  We know that fathers who pay child support are more involved with their kids  and kids who get child support do better in school  This program cracks down on deadbeat dads  but also saves families by lifting them out of poverty        The Child Support Enforcement  CSE  Program  established in 1975 as part of the Social Security Act  is a federal state local partnership to collect child support for single parent families that have been unable to obtain financial resources from the non custodial parent  The program helps to ensure that children have the financial support of both their parents  fosters responsible parental behavior towards children  emphasizes that children need to have both parents involved in their lives  and reduces reliance on welfare  The child support program collected  4 38 for every public dollar spent in 2004  In 2005  300 000 families nationwide were able to move off public assistance because of their child support collections      On February 8th  the Budget Reconciliation Bill became law after narrowly passing in the House by two votes and in the Senate by a single vote that was cast by Vice President Cheney  The new law includes a 20  cut to the federal funds devoted to child support  which will act as a double edged sword for families that rely on child support  State Child Support Enforcement Programs will have less financial resources and therefore not be able to collect as much child support  and without the help of child support  more families will be forced to enroll in public assistance programs that will further strap state budgets      State child support programs locate non custodial parents  establish paternity  establish and enforce support orders  modify orders when appropriate  and collect and distribute child support payments  The process of locating a non custodial parent and establishing and enforcing child support orders is a time consuming  labor intensive process which includes data entry and verification  obtaining court orders  collaborating with other states  seizing bank accounts and income tax refunds  and referring low income parents to job centers  Without sufficient funding for these programs  the many moving parts involved in collecting child support will stop working  In New York State alone  these cuts will translate into a  334 million drop in New York child support collections      These cuts will seriously undermine the dramatic progress that New York State has made in its Child Support Enforcement program  In the last twelve years  New York State improved its child support collection rate from 12  to 50   With the federal funding cuts  NYS   collection rates will likely drop      The Child Support Enforcement Program is recognized for both its performance and cost effectiveness  In fact  the federal Office of Management and Budget rated this program as the highest performing social program in the nation  For every public dollar spent   4 38 is collected in private dollars  Cutting this program would cripple one of the most effective and efficient programs in the country      Schumer said today that this program is critical for helping low income families move off of public support  Because the budget cuts will result in diminishing resources for state child support programs  more difficult cases will be pushed to the backburner  Without child support payments to help supplement their income  many of these low income families will be forced onto public assistance  In 2005  300 000 families closed their TANF cases due to their receipt of child support collection  Without child support for these families  many will re enroll in TANF and other public assistance programs    Schumer today discussed several steps to reverse the impact of the cuts  First  he has sent a bipartisan letter to the President urging him to restore funding  Senators John Cornyn  R TX   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Herb Kohl  D WI  joined Schumer in this letter  Second  Schumer announced he would work with Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt to figure out what states can do to fill in the funding shortfall  Can states like New York receive money from a contingency fund  Or can they give NY the authority to fill the gap from other federal moneys they receive from other HHS funded programs  If these measures fail  introduce legislation through the Senate Finance Committee to make sure funding is restored     Schumer was joined by Mary Ann Evans  of Albany  who after enrolling in the program  was able to track down her child  s missing dad and collect over  27 000 in back child support payments
