IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 5  2007 Senators Clinton  Schumer  Kennedy  Lautenberg And Menendez Re Introduce Legislation To Address 9 11 Health Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              One of the first bills to be introduced in the new Congress  9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2007 will provide over  1 9 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment grants to those individuals whose health was directly impacted at or near Ground Zero and Fresh Kills as well as those who responded to the Pentagon attacks                                                        Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Charles Schumer  D NY   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  announced today that they have re introduced legislation  the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2007  to provide over  1 9 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment grants  available from 2008 2012  to firefighters  police officers  EMTs  paramedics  building and construction trades workers  volunteers  residents  and others whose health was directly impacted at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills as well as those who responded to the Pentagon attack   This funding would be administered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and would expand access to health monitoring and health care to all of those who served  lived and worked in the area in the aftermath of 9 11   Senators Clinton  Schumer  Kennedy  and Menendez introduced the same legislation late last year          Time is passing while brave  selfless people are getting sick and dying  This has to be one of the President s top priorities in his upcoming budget  I contacted the President s Director of the Office of Management and Budget to ask that some additional funds be included in the President s Budget for 2008 when it is sent up to Congress next month  but if the President will not act  then we will     Senator Clinton said    I have continually sounded the alarm that those who breathed the toxic air around Ground Zero in the days  weeks and months after 9 11 would suffer health effects and now our worst fears are being realized   I am pleased that this is one of the first bills to be introduced in the new Congress and I will continue to fight for this funding because I believe we have a moral obligation as a nation to help those whose health was affected by 9 11   We must end their suffering and get them the help they need and deserve             On September 11  it was many of New York s brave first responders and residents who rushed into the burning towers  dug through the rubble at Ground Zero in search of survivors  and refused to cow to the terrorists by leaving their great city     said Senator Schumer    Today  many of these men and women have fallen ill and some have even perished from the toxic air they inhaled following the attacks  As Americans  it is our duty that we give all workers who labored on behalf of the cleanup efforts the treatment they deserve  This legislation provides almost  2 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and assistance for those directly affected by the attacks  Over the past five years  I have repeatedly and urgently called for the necessary funding to help 9 11 victims get the medical assistance they need  Today  as the attacks continue to claim new victims  I hope the President understands that we can t afford to wait any longer             These true American heroes  who rescued victims of the 9 11 terrorist attacks and helped to rebuild our communities  are suffering the dire consequences of toxic exposures   They selflessly risked their lives for our country and we must act swiftly to help them as they become sick or disabled   I call on the President and our colleagues to join us in fulfilling our duty to them     said Senator Kennedy          The health of those who responded to 9 11   and those who live near the affected areas   should be a top priority of the federal government     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg said    We can t forget the men and women who put their lives in jeopardy to save the lives of others   This legislation will help ensure they receive the best medical care available             More than five years later  our nation continues to heal from the attacks of September 11  but for many the physical wounds are still all too real     said Senator Menendez    I am proud to work alongside my colleagues in the 110th Congress to ensure that these Americans receive the medical treatment they need  America  s heroes deserve nothing less           Late last year Senators Clinton  Schumer and Kennedy called on the President to include funds in his upcoming Fiscal Year 2008 Budget  due to be released in February  In the event that the funding is not included  the Senators will push hard for their own legislation to be enacted  The Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member and Senator Kennedy is Chairman has jurisdiction over the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2007 and has also committed to hearings on 9 11 health effects in the near future        A five year study conducted by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Ground Zero first responders found that almost 70 percent of WTC responders had new or substantially worsened respiratory symptoms following their work at the WTC site   Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9 11  61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC site  Studies published by the New York City Fire Department  FDNY  also show that over 90  of FDNY rescue workers had new respiratory symptoms following their work at WTC  over 30  continue to have respiratory and or mental health symptomatology  the average decrease in pulmonary function in the first year after WTC was 372ml  12 times the annual decline in the five years pre WTC   25  of those tested who were present during the morning of the attack have objective evidence for airway hyper reactivity consistent with asthma  and nearly 700  5  of exposed workforce  have qualified for respiratory disability pensions
