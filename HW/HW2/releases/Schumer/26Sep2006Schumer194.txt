Further development is needed to optimize a fully transparent advanced glass that can be manufactured in sheet form and with improved   multi hit    capability   These advanced glass families can be processed with much greater mechanical properties such as hardness and fracture toughness  significantly improving armor performance for personnel as well as vehicular use  This development work will leverage these glass strengthening technologies to reduce weight and thickness by up to 50   in line with the Army  s goals for this material  and significantly improve vehicle maneuverability and multi hit ballistic strength survivabilty        SUNY Binghamton    Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing     1 95 million   This bill appropriates   million in funding for the SUNY Binghamton

centric capability to search  receive and display single and multi INT data and information from anywhere within the battle space      Dresser Rand    Advanced Steam Turbine    1 million   The advanced steam turbine will help the Navy meet their requirement to develop technologies and systems for submarines that will match or excel current systems capability while significantly reducing the acquisition and life cycle costs  The development of an advanced steam turbine  using similar magnetic bearings technology  is estimated to reduce the cost the Navy is paying today by as much as 40 percent  Additionally  through improved efficiencies  the expectation is a turbine with more Effective Full Power Hours  EFPH  during its life
