IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 15  2006 Schumer To Lead Bipartisan Senate Delegation Trip To China In Latest Effort To Address Its Unfair Trade Policies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Schumer  s Bipartisan Bill Imposes a Temporary Across The Board Tariff on Chinese Imports Unless China Revalues Currency   Trip Comes As China President Hu Jintao Makes First Ever Visit to United States In Four Weeks    Schumer to Detail Manufacturing Job Loss For Each County  Capital Region has lost approx  8 900 manufacturing jobs  Central NY 11 500  Rochester Finger Lakes 30 60 In light of a loss of over 104 000 manufacturing jobs across upstate New York over the past five years  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced he will be leading a bipartisan delegation of Senators on a trip to China to meet with senior Chinese officials about China  s continued currency manipulation and other trade issues  Schumer  and Senators Lindsey Graham  R SC  and Tom Coburn  R OK  will visit with Chinese government  business  and security leaders from March 19 to 26       New York workers can compete and win on a world stage  but only if there  s a level playing field     Schumer said    New York companies know first hand how China  s unfair trade practices are causing devastating job losses here in the United States  Our trip to China comes at a critical time    we have to get China to play by the rules and I am hopeful that progress can be made when we meet face to face with high level government and economic officials in Beijing and business leaders in Shanghai        Schumer will focus on three different issues throughout his trip  At their first stop in Beijing  Schumer  Graham and Coburn will meet with government leaders to push them to stop China  s currency manipulation and allow the yuan to appreciate  Because China has been slow to allow its currency to appreciate  the global trading system is thrown out of balance  and in 2005 the U S  has a record trade deficit with China  In Shanghai  Schumer and others will meet with leaders of the financial industry and with executives from New York companies with operations in China  including Kodak and Citibank  While in Hong Kong  Schumer will tour one of the world  s largest and busiest international ports to compare port security measures used on site with those employed in the United States  Schumer released a new study today showing that tens of thousands of upstate New York jobs were lost between January 2001 and January 2006  Specifically  Schumer  s report found that           Over the last four years  approximately 8 900 manufacturing jobs in the Capital Region have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 11 500 manufacturing jobs in Central New York have been lost       Over the last four years  approximately 30 600 manufacturing jobs in Rochester Finger Lakes area have been lost       Over the last four years  approximately 12 700 manufacturing jobs in the Hudson Valley have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 5 400 manufacturing jobs in the North Country have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 10 700 manufacturing jobs in the Southern Tier have been lost       Over the last four years  approximately 24 800 manufacturing jobs in Western New York have been lost      Schumer today discussed specific companies throughout upstate New York that demonstrate China  s impact on American jobs  including the Marietta Corporation  headquartered in Cortland  Oneida Ltd   Buffalo  Precision Grinding and Manufacturing  Rochester  MT Picture Display  Elmira  and Prismatic Dyeing and Finishing in Newburgh  Carrier Corporation in Syracuse  Cathedral Candle Company  and Crucible Steel in Syracuse     The Schumer Graham China Free Trade received 67 votes on a procedural vote last April and is scheduled for an up or down vote before March 31   The bill allows for a 180 day negotiation period between the United States and China on currency revaluation  if the negotiations are not successful  a temporary across the board tariff of 27 5  will be applied to all Chinese products entering the United States  If the President certifies to Congress within 180 days of enactment that China has made a good faith effort to revalue its currency upward  he may delay the imposition of the tariffs for an additional 180 days  If at the end of that 180 day period the President determines that China has developed and started actual implementation of a plan to revalue its currency  the President may delay imposition of the tariffs for an additional 12 months     Because China continues to intervene in the currency market to prevent the yuan from appreciating  despite its promise to allow market forces to work  the trade deficit with China rises every month  with no end in sight   Last year  the U S  trade deficit with China exceeded  200 billion  up from  162 billion in 2004   This was an all time record for a trade deficit with any single country   Our trade deficit with China represents more than one quarter of our national trade deficit  which grew by 14 percent last year  to a record  726 billion   Looking at the data sector by sector  the rise in the trade deficit has been even more severe   For example  in computers and mechanical goods  the annual deficit with China has tripled since 2002  in electrical machinery  equipment  and parts  it has doubled since 2003  and in textiles and apparel  it has more than tripled since 2000     Historically  the yuan    sometimes known as renminbi    had been generally pegged to the U S  dollar since 1994   Last July  after having been fixed at 8 28 Yuan to the dollar for more than a decade  China allowed the yuan to appreciate by 2 1 percent and said that they would allow market forces to dictate the yuan  s future rise   They have also purportedly taken steps since then to allow appreciation to continue at a more rapid pace   Since July  however  the yuan has appreciated less than one percent  and economists estimate that it is still undervalued by between 15 and 40 percent  This has a serious impact on U S  manufacturing because it creates a huge built in price advantage for Chinese imports    a differential that dwarfs any effect from lower labor costs in China  since productivity here is so much higher   In fact  the Michigan  s Manufacturing Technology Center estimated that all the competitive advantage a  10 million manufacturing plant in China has over  10 million plant in the U S  would be erased by a 30 percent currency revaluation
