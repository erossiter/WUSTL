IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 17  2005 Schumer Reveals Long Island Woefully Unprepared  If Hurricane  Disaster  Strike   No Plan In Place For Evacuation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Vital Army Corps Hurricane Impact Study for Long Island is Stalled  Completion not Expected Until 2008   Schumer Stands with Suozzi  Levy to Call for Expedited Completion of Study and Evacuation Plan As recent hurricanes have battered the gulf region  emergency preparedness has been elevated to a level of critical importance for communities across the nation  especially Long Island which has a low lying geography  a densely settled population of nearly 3 million people  critical infrastructure  and lack of evacuation routes  On Monday  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  revealed that a Hurricane Evacuation Study  HES  that began in 2000 for Long Island  New York City and Westchester has stalled and is not due for completion until 2008  Schumer  standing with Nassau County Executive  Tom Suozzi  and Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy called on the Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to immediately expedite the completion of the study         We all know that if a hurricane hits Long Island we certainly don  t have a system in place to ensure a safe and effective evacuation and getting hit by a hurricane is only a matter of time  This Hurricane Evacuation Study is a critical tool in making sure that the Long Island residents have a plan in place when they need it     Schumer said    If there was ever a case that a stitch in time saves nine  this is it  In the past months we have learned an ad hoc approach to evacuation just doesn  t work            Long Island has a dense population of more than 3 million people and there are only a few main roads off Long Island     County Executive Suozzi said    Now is the time for both FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers to reexamine a plan that is more than a decade old  We  ve all seen in New Orleans what happens when warnings about outdated systems are ignored  It  s time to make sure that Long Island doesn  t suffer a similar fate            While Suffolk County  s emergency preparedness plans are ahead of the curve  we must rely on federal monies and support to deal with the difficulties related to evacuation from low lying areas  This is exactly why this study must be completed sooner rather than later     said Suffolk County Exceutive  Steve Levy      In 1993  FEMA  working with the Army Corps of Engineers  the National Weather Service  as well as New York State Emergency Management Office  SEMO  and local agencies  produced a hurricane evacuation report based on the 1990 Census  for New York State  more specifically Long Island  New York City and Westchester  FEMA planned to update the report using 2000 Census data  but the study was never completed due to funding cuts       Schumer today called on the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA to assist local efforts by conducting a comprehensive review and needs assessment for an evacuation plan as well as identifying all other actions necessary to be equipped to respond to a natural disaster  There is a need to re evaluate plans to deal with catastrophic events  including evacuation  transportation  road clearance  egress for residents  and access to and within Long Island for emergency vehicles       According to the Army Corps of Engineers a Hurricane Evacuation Plan has 5 elements       1  Hazard Identification  maximum extent of flooding for Category 1 4 hurricanes   2  Behavioral analysis  estimate of percentage of population that would evacuate   3  Transportation analysis  identification of the number of people  roadways  and time necessary to evacuate areas   4  Critical facilities analysis  identification of critical facilities in the evacuation area   5  Shelter analysis  identification of sufficient shelters of structural integrity outside of the flood hazard area        In a letter to Lieutenant General Carl A  Strock of the Army Corps of Engineers and R  David Paulison  Acting Under Secretary of FEMA  Schumer wrote   In light of what we have learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  a new disaster plan is urgently needed for Long Island  I urge the Army Corps and FEMA to work in consultation with SEMO  the National Weather Service  and local emergency agencies on an evaluation of all coastal and storm damage projects in the region to identify critical gaps  especially on the vulnerable South Shore of Long Island
