IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 10  2007 Schumer  Cuomo Unveil New Federal Plan To Protect College Bound Grads From Being Bilked By Always Confusing  Sometimes Devious Loan Applications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 As Thousands of NYC Students Prepare for College  Current Student Loan Applications Are Loaded with Fine Print Concealing Sky High Fees and Interest Rates  Students Have No Way to Compare Which Deal is Best   New Proposal Would Require Lenders to Detail Loan Amounts  Interest Rates and Payment Terms in Simple  Easy to Read Table   Modeled After Successful  Schumer Box  Required on All Cre As thousands of recent New York City high school graduates and their parents slog through complex and sometimes deceptive student loan applications  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo today unveiled a new federal plan to require complete and clear disclosure of student loan terms and fees on every application  The plan  modeled after the highly successful Schumer Box now required on all credit card applications  would mandate that lenders detail loan amounts  range of interest rates and any and all fees in a standardized  easy to read table on every application  After the student applies for the student loan and prior to the student signing a promissory note  the exact interest rate and other terms of the loan will be revealed in a second  mandatory disclosure form Student loan applications contain reams of fine print often hiding significant fees and sudden rate increases that can end up costing students and their families thousands of extra dollars   A high school graduate shouldn t need a law degree to pick a loan for college  Schumer said  More and more college students and their families use private student loans to pay for their college expenses  we need to make sure that students and their families get complete and unbiased information on all of their options  including any and all affordable loans  Schumer said  Including a  Schumer Box  on every loan application package will ensure that students and their families have an understanding of their loan options   Today s proposal moves the nation one step closer to what New York State has already accomplished by providing safeguards for students and their parents borrowing money to pay for college  said Cuomo  Now its time for the federal government to pass legislation like New York s SLATE Act  and mandate nationwide protections for families looking to private lenders to help pay for the ever increasing cost of higher education  I applaud Senator Schumer for his leadership in this issue  He has long been a champion of consumer protection and disclosure in financial transactions   Schumer and Cuomo today revealed that countless student loan applications  by reputable and disreputable lenders alike  contain pages of fine print often hiding new fees  sudden rate changes  and unfair terms  For example  a promissory note for a very popular lender is 16 pages long  with five of those pages containing twin columns of fine print that is indecipherable for the average high school graduate  Most sections contain provisions that are contingent on other sections elsewhere in the application and only apply to specific states  Some banks and lenders offer websites to supposedly clear up the confusion  but the websites simply to attempt to clarify the companys loan offer  rather than give students an opportunity to compare all rates and fees in the student loan market   Private lenders often hide the actual amounts students will have to pay over the life of the loan and do not disclose onerous late fees and penalties  Under current law  major student loan banks do have to provide an estimate of how much a student will have to pay in total  including interest  in order to pay off the loan   but only after the student has graduated  This leaves students without any real concept of how much more they will have to pay when they sign up for a loan   Schumer and Cuomo said  with the Attorney Generals investigation revealing that parents and students need more and better information about loans and how they affect the financial needs of their families  a clear and concise way for graduates to determine what loan is actually best for them is the only way to protect students from being scammed  Without a clear comparative tool  students and their families could get boxed in to long term expensive loans that don t fit their needs and could cripple their financial future   The new Schumer Box for student loans will be an easy to read chart  in large font using non technical terms that will describe the various loan scenarios including information such as different loan amounts  interest rates  and payment periods  It will explain in a concise and clear way exactly how much a student will owe  including interest  in order to pay off the loan   The legislation will require that lenders make two separate disclosures  one on the initial application and one after the potential borrower applies  but prior to signing the promissory note  The following pieces of information will be required to be included in the Schumer Box  applicable interest rates  timing on interest rate changes  limitations to interest rate increases  parent co borrower requirements and changes to interest rates if no parent co borrower  finance charges  late fees  penalties and adjustments to principal based upon borrower transgressions  all fees and range of fees  along with basis for variations in fees   term of loan  interest accrual while in school  payment deferral options   interest and principal  length of grace period and three examples of the total cost of the loan over the life of the loan  done with three different interest rates and principal amounts    The lenders will be required to disclose that a school may have school specific student loan benefits and terms not detailed on this form and require applications to encourage students to exhaust federal loans prior to utilizing private loans  Application will also to put in bold the disclosure that interest rates are variable so that projected cost is only at current interest rate and is likely to go up significantly   Nearly 2 out of every 3 students nationwide have student loan debt  up from less than one half in 1993  and the actual amount of debt from undergraduate loans has also skyrocketed  Over the past decade  debt levels for graduating seniors more than doubled from  9 250 to  19 200  a 58  increase after accounting for inflation   Student loan debt can affect a student s livelihood for decades after graduation  Outstanding loans can limit post collegiate career options  delay the purchase of a home or a car  and discourage graduates from starting a family  In the most extreme cases  burdensome debt can cause some students to default  resulting in lifelong ruined credit   The Schumer Box was created as part of a provision of the Fair Credit and Credit Card Disclosure Act of 1988  which Senator Schumer authored while a member of the House of Representatives  The bill  passed and signed in to law that year  required companies to clearly inform consumers of their terms  in solicitations   found that students are often unaware of the many ways credit card companies take advantage of students  It was the first law to mandate that credit card agreements include a simple table or box of important information such as APRs  transaction fees  annual fees and grace periods   Cuomos nationwide investigation into the student loan industry has resulted in agreements with the nations five largest student loan providers   Citibank  Sallie Mae  JP Morgan Chase  and Bank of America  and Wells Fargo   as well as with Education Finance Partners  EFP  and CIT  Additionally  a total of 25 schools have committed to Cuomos Code of Conduct  nine of which have agreed to reimburse students over  3 million for the cost of revenue sharing agreements  Sallie Mae  Citibank  EFP  and CIT have also agreed to contribute  9 5 million to a national fund established by Cuomo that will educate high school students and their families about the financial aid process  Columbia University has also agreed to pay  1 1 million into the education fund as part of a settlement with the Attorney Generals Office  On May 7  2007  the New York State Legislature passed the Student Lending Accountability  Transparency  and Enforcement  SLATE  Act of 2007  which was sponsored at the request of Cuomo and is the first piece of legislation in the country aimed at ending the widespread conflicts of interest the student loan industry  Governor Spitzer signed the SLATE Act into law on May 29  2007
