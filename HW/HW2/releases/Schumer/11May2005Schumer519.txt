IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 11  2005 In Light Of Latest Chronic Wasting Disease Case  Schumer To Warn This Could Slash Upstate NY  s Deer Population   Cost Hunting Industry Millions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Schumer Unveils Sweeping Five Point Plan To Prevent Dangerous Public Health and Devastating Economic Scenarios    Hunting Industry Means  890 Million to New York State Annually  No National Protocol and Lack of Sufficient Information Leaves Upstate New York and America in Real Danger    Schumer To Detail Number of Deer and Hunters in Each County  Discuss Economic Impact In Each Region of t As frightening reports emerge that Chronic Wasting Disease  CWD  could be spreading in New York  Senator Charles E  Schumer today detailed the possible public health and economic impact on the State  Hunting is one of New York  s largest industries  and with over  107 million dollars at risk  Schumer called on the federal government to take five critical steps in combating the looming disaster  On the heels of finding two positive New York CWD deer in the wild  and five positives on two farms in Oneida County  Schumer discussed how much money each region stands to lose if CWD continues to spread and starts to impact New York  s hunting industry         Hunting is not just a recreational activity    it  s a major part of New York  s economy   Schumer said   This plan will help ensure that the dangers posed by the spread of CWD do not infect our economy or public health  If there was ever a case where a stitch in time saves nine  this is it          So far  the seven positive New York CWD deer were found in Oneida County  The first positive findings were from captive deer kept on farms  while the latest positives were discovered as a result of NY State testing of several hundred deer from Oneida county and surrounding areas  It is unclear whether CWD first affected deer on the farms  who then transmitted the disease to the wild deer population  or if the disease spread from the wild to the farm  Although CWD has not been found in other parts of NY  it is highly transmissible between deer  Other states have found that once the disease becomes endemic  it is close to impossible to contain and control       New York is a potential breeding ground for a CWD pandemic  The total NY deer population is estimated at more than 1 million and 684 000 deer hunting licenses were issued in 2003  Licensed hunters killed 253 000 deer in 2003 and 208 000 in 2004       CWD is a major concern for hunters because wild deer populations will likely be thinned in order to deal with the disease  thus having a negative affect on their hunting season  Hunters are also of course concerned about possible health issues related to handling and eating deer  Some rural households depend on businesses like motels  eating and drinking establishments  deer processing facilities  food and beverage stores and gas stations where hunters from urban areas spend money locally  When fewer hunters come  these households will see their incomes fall and many of the affected individuals live in areas where economic opportunities are limited       Before being discovered in New York  CWD was never found east of Illinois  The disease was first discovered in Colorado and Wyoming  and has since been detected in wild or captive animals in Illinois  South Dakota  Nebraska  Kansas  Oklahoma  New Mexico  Montana  Utah  Wisconsin  and Saskatchewan and Alberta  Canada       CWD was found in Wisconsin in 2002  Since then  authorities have spent millions of dollars on various eradication programs  but have seen marginal results  Attempts to eliminate the disease through controlled culling within specified areas only resulted in the disease spreading further as scared deer migrated out of these areas  In the first year after finding the disease  hunting license applications fell by 10 15 percent       Schumer today released a new analysis showing how much each New York county stands to lose if CDW spreads widely and cannot be contained  Specifically  Schumer found that              The Capital Region economy could lose  7 million through loss of deer hunting revenue        The Central New York economy could lose  7 million through loss of deer hunting revenue        The Rochester Finger Lakes economy could lose  20 million through loss of deer hunting revenue        The Hudson Valley economy could lose  17 million through loss of deer hunting revenue        The North Country economy could lose  13 million through loss of deer hunting revenue        The Southern Tier economy could lose  23 million through loss of deer hunting revenue        The Western New York economy could lose  20 million through loss of deer hunting revenue       Schumer unveiled a 5 point plan to prevent a potential outbreak among humans  Specifically  Schumer  s plan will           Increase funding for research  not enough is known about how this and related diseases are transmitted between animals  and  perhaps more important  how it is transmitted between species  We know that humans can get a form of mad cow  but we are not sure how the disease is transmitted from cows to humans  We also need to find better ways to test animals and humans for these diseases  Currently there are a few   rapid    tests that provide non definitive diagnoses  The only definitive test involves killing the animal so that testers can look at brain tissue samples  There needs to be a definitive live animal test           Elevate the Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory in Ithaca to a premier nationwide testing facility  so far most animal testing for these diseases occurs in Ames  Iowa  Specialists who work with the disease in other parts of the country feel that a second testing laboratory is necessary  The Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory is being used to provide the testing for the New York CWD problem  and has proven to be reliable and accurate  Not only is this the ideal facility to provide back up testing for the Iowa laboratory  but today Schumer proposed to upgrade and improve the Cornell facility and develop it into a premier nationwide research and testing facility for CWD and related diseases           Require head testing in infected areas  encourage voluntary head testing in surrounding areas  and push for expeditious release of findings  to ensure the health and safety of NY  s consumers  all deer taken from areas known to contain CWD that may be used for food need to be tested for CWD  All deer from specified areas within and surrounding Oneida County that are killed by hunters or in traffic accidents should be tested before being eaten  Authorities should provide hunters rapid testing to ensure quick and timely results  Although not definitive  rapid tests can provide results within days instead of weeks required for immuno histochemistry test that is known as the   gold standard          In addition  testing should be encouraged on a voluntary basis throughout New York and across the country  Strategic collection stations should be established for this purpose  The whole animal would be brought to the collection station  where tissue samples will be taken  and the animal tagged for identification  The test for the disease involves looking at brain samples  so collection stations will generally take the head of the deer  During hunting season the number of collection stations will increase accordingly  Test results will be posted publicly and quickly via the internet or other easily accessible means           Establish a nationwide protocol to deal with CWD control and eradication  much of the responsibility for containing and resolving the disease is left to the states  As a result  methods of controlling the disease and managing data on CWD outbreaks are piecemeal  Although New York agencies are dealing with the latest outbreak quickly and decisively  federal guidance and oversight could prevent further outbreaks  foster improved research  and aid in the successful management of CWD  Oversight would include federal collection of data connected to the disease  With a single repository for data  the disease would be easier to track and study           Increase CWD funds spent in New York and Ensure Adequate Safety Measures In Place  in a letter to the Department of Agriculture  s Secretary Mike Johanns  Schumer urged the Department of Agriculture to increase attention and resources devoted to this important issue in New York  With  15 million available to research and manage CWD  Schumer requested that New York receive its fair share of resources devoted to this issue  Schumer also asked Johanns to detail what safety precautions are already in place  if all appropriate federal agencies are coordinating sufficiently  and an exact plan if a nationwide epidemic breaks out      Chronic Wasting Disease is a fatal disease of the brain and nervous system that occurs in deer and elk  CWD is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy  TSE  and is caused by an abnormally shaped protein  called a prion  Other TSEs include bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE or Mad Cow   scrapie  which affects sheep  and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease  CJD  which is found in humans  It is thought that transmission of these diseases is through contact or ingestion of prions  Scientists believe that humans contracted a variant of CJD after eating cows infected with BSE       Please click to view study
