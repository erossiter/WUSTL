IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 18  2007 Schumer Bill To Reimburse Upstate Airports For On Site Security Costs To Pass Full Senate Today   Protects Upstate Airports That Were Set To Lose Up To 53  Of Reimbursement Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Earlier this Year  Schumer Revealed Unfunded Mandate that Could Leave Financially Strapped Upstate Airports Stuck Footing Bill for Essential Security Costs Despite the Addition of 25 Airports to Program  Overall Pot of Money Wasn t going to be Increased  Leading Upstate Airports to Lose up to 53  of Reimbursement Funding Today  Schumer Announces the Senate is Expected to Pass his Amendment as Part of the Omnibus Appropriation Bill to Raise the Overall Funding for Program So Upstate Airports Don t Get Buried in Security Costs Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that the Senate is expected to pass his legislation that was included as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill that will add  3 million to a federal program responsible for reimbursing Upstate New York airports that pay for on site security    Earlier this year Schumer revealed that the program was set to be underfunded  leaving the states already financially strapped airports footing the bill for security costs  Currently  a Transportation Security Administration  TSA  programthe Law Enforcement Office Reimbursement Programreimburses upstate airports that hire local law enforcement officials  However  TSA recently announced a plan to include 25 additional airports in the program without boosting the overall funding   Schumer  who previously warned that airports across Upstate could lose up to 53  of their reimbursement funding for security costs  announced today that the Senate passed his amendment  by including it in Omnibus bill  which will add  3 million to the reimbursement program  minimizing the impact of any potential shortfall faced by the airports    Upstate New York airports dodged a bullet today and wont be stuck picking up the tab for security costs that the federal government should be paying for in a post 9 11 world  said Senator Schumer  My bill guarantees that the federal reimbursement program has the necessary funding in the place so Upstate New York airports officials can ensure the safety of their travelers   In an effort to ensure passenger safety and national security at each airport security passenger screening location  TSA requires that the airport provide law enforcement personnel who are authorized to carry firearms  Although these security personnel dont specifically participate in passenger or baggage screening  they are responsible for all other general security aspects of the airport including monitoring terminals and regulating passenger drop off and pick up areas    To meet this requirement  many airports  including many across Upstate New York  coordinate with local police and sheriff departments to fill these security positions  This makes them eligible for the funding under the Law Enforcement Office Reimbursement Program  LEOP   which is designed to cover the costs associated with these TSA mandated security guards    This year  however  despite TSA announcing its intentions to add 25 new airports to the program  from 275 to 300  the overall funding is not slated to be increased  The direct result would force Upstate New York airports into a shortfall in funding for their much needed security personnel For many of the states smaller airports that are already struggling to make ends meet  their financial problems will only be exacerbated    Senator Schumer earlier this year revealed that many of Upstate New Yorks airportsincluding Buffalo Niagara  Syracuse Hancock  and Rochester Internationalwould be shortchanged by a federal funding program aimed at paying the cost of employing extra security staff required under a post September 11th law    Below is data for each participating upstate airport   Binghamton Regional Airport stands to fall short by  52 471 45 or 25  of its total budget for security   Buffalo Niagara International Airport stands to fall short by  75 053 16 or 19  of its total budget for security   Elmira Corning Regional Airport stands to fall short by  129 635 40 or 53  of its total budget for security   Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport stands to fall short by  83 934 08 or 38  of its total budget for security   Niagara Falls Airport stands to fall short by  19 325 60 or 27  of its total budget for security   Ogdensburg International Airport stands to fall short by  5 022 40 or 6  of its total budget for security   Oneida County Airport stands to fall short by  1 726 40 or 24  of its total budget for security   Rochester International Airport stands to fall short by  69 143 56 or 22  of its total budget for security   Syracuse Hancock International Airport stands to fall short by  62 474 13 or 12  of its total budget for security     Watertown International Airport  Chautauqua County Airport  and Massena International Airport all participate in the program but data was not available    Today Schumer announced the Senate is expected to pass the Omnibus with his amendment included which will increase the Aviation Security Direction and Enforcement fund by  3 million  This fund includes the LEO program  and the Senators amendment increases the LEO program to  67 million  ensuring that thelevel of reimbursement offered by TSA will not suffer as more airports become part of this important program Across Upstate NY  his amendment minimizes the impact of any potential shortfall faced by the airports   In November of 2001  the President and Congress enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act  ATSA   which established TSA as a new federal agency  As an agency  TSA is responsible for civil aviation security including the supervision of screening passengers and property at airports
