IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 3  2005 Invoking Spirit Of FDR  Unified Senate Democrats Demand President Not Add Trillions To Debt In Risky Privatization Scheme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Birth Tax to reach at least  30K by 2015 for every American  Senators Reid  Schumer and Dem  Caucus will release letter SIGNED BY 44 SENATORS to Bush urging him to send a responsible Soc  Sec  Reform package to Congress  not one that unduly burdens future generations Today  standing outside the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial  Senators Reid  Schumer and members of the Senate Democratic Caucus presented a united front to fight against the President  s plans to send the national debt skyrocketing by privatizing Social Security    increasing the burden up to  30 000 per capita  The Senators released a letter to the White House from a unified Democratic Caucus calling on President Bush to send a plan for Social Security reform that does not exacerbate the national debt        Senator Schumer said    Today the Senate Democratic Caucus stands united against the idea that Social Security reform should explode the national debt  We will not allow the President to play retirement roulette and increase the tax burden on future generations with more borrowing  This growing   Birth Tax   will saddle every American with over  30 000 in debt    hardly worthy of the great man this memorial represents    Franklin D  Roosevelt    the architect of greatest American program in the 20th Century            Instead we urge the President to work with us on a plan to keep Social Security intact and able to serve the coming generations without adding  2 trillion in new debt  I don  t understand why the President is still enamored with private accounts  which I believe is a code word for the ultimate undoing of Social Security     Schumer continued       With national debt already reaching record highs  the Senators said that the President  s plan to siphon payroll tax money into private accounts would add trillions in additional debt that future generations will have to repay  The Senators called this added burden a   birth tax     since it is money each newborn American and all Americans will have to pay back with interest  and warned that the President  s privatization plan would increase the per capita debt to close to  30 000 per capita by 2015    up 150  from the 2001 per capita debt of  12 000        Schumer noted that            With no further increases in spending or changes in tax policy  it is predicted the per capita share of the national debt will grow to over  18 000 by 2015    a 50 percent increase in the portion of the public debt owed by each American             When the costs of other spending and tax proposals supported the Administration are added to the mix  including the costs of the new supplemental  the likely ongoing war costs in Iraq  the cost of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent  and additional defense spending brings the per capita figure to over  25 000 in 2015             Setting aside 4 percentage points of the 12 4 percent Social Security payroll tax    nearly one third of the tax    would require the government to borrow close to  2 trillion over the next 10 years in order to pay scheduled benefits to current and near retirees  This would bring the per capita share of the debt to close to  30 000 by 2015  the end of the ten year budget window         The Senators today invoked the image of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who pioneered Social Security and sent a letter signed by the entire Senate Democratic Caucus to President Bush  calling on the Administration to put forth a responsible reform proposal instead of a plan that would more than double the burden of the national debt for future generations        In their letter  the Senators wrote    In the same way that it would be immoral from a generational standpoint for a grandparent to borrow from his grandson  s college fund to buy a big screen TV  we believe it is immoral to borrow another  2 trillion from future generations to finance Social Security reform  We are spending enough of our kids   money  Our country needs to get back to following the teachings of Romans 13 8  which says we should   let no debt remain outstanding            Schumer added    Every member here also knows that Social Security needs some changes in order make sure it  s there for future generations of Americans  The question we have to wrestle with is  what sorts of changes  Does the program need minor tweaking  or does it need to be dismantled and replaced with something else            We have come to this conclusion not because we believe that government does everything right  but because we believe the President  s solution is fundamentally flawed  Ironically  it makes the underlying problem    restoring long term solvency    more difficult to solve  by taking money out of the program at exactly the wrong time  In addition  siphoning payroll tax money into private accounts will add trillions in additional debt that future generations will have to repay  That  s
