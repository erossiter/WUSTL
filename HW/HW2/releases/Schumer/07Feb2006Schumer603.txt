IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 7  2006 Schumer Urges Feds To Designate CNY Technology Development Organization As National Manufacturing Training Center                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New Program  Training Within Industry  Provides Skills Needed To Implement And Sustain Lean Manufacturing   Schumer  Central New York Workforce Setting Trailblazing Example  Leading Nation in Efficiency and Quality U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the U S  Department of Commerce to designate Central New York Technology Development Organization  CNY TDO  as a National Manufacturing Training Center  This designation would allow them to implement a new program called Training Within Industry  TWI  on a wide scale  TWI is a program which provides the skills needed to implement and sustain lean manufacturing  Manufacturers using the program have experienced immediate impacts including reduced costs  improved quality  quicker training time  increased production  and improved employee relations  These outcomes have led to a documented increase in global competitiveness  creating and retaining jobs in the United States         TWI is an essential tool that can make all the difference for our manufacturing plants     Schumer said    This program should be offered to companies across the country  and CNY TDO is the perfect place to teach the fundamentals of lean manufacturing  This will give plants the ability to survive and thrive in the increasingly competitive global marketplace          The TWI program is being successfully delivered by the CNY TDO  a member of NIST  s Manufacturing Extension Partnership  NIST MEP   Schumer said that with limited resources  CNY TDO is constrained in its ability to rapidly expand the program and provide the opportunity for other MEP centers to help manufacturers in their regions  In his letter  Schumer urged the Department of Commerce to provide the support necessary for CNY TDO to make this program accessible to companies throughout the United States        Schumer advocated that the Department of Commerce make TWI a recommended MEP program  thereby eliminating barriers and encouraging the over 400 MEP offices nationwide to adopt the program  Several centers have been interested in offering TWI to their manufacturing clients  but felt constrained by the need for the MEP   seal of approval     TWI complements many of the MEP programs  particularly Lean Manufacturing  Schumer said CNY TDO is willing to work closely with MEP to provide all the necessary support to MEP to do this quickly and have submitted a proposal to present TWI at the national MEP conference in May 2006  Schumer pushed for CNY TDO to be designated as the central Certification Authority for TWI trainers  a role it is fully prepared to take on with an efficient and effective system for training and certifying trainers already in place  MEP centers could have staff trained through TDO or use external TDO Certified TWI trainers to provide the training  By designating TDO as the Certification Authority for TWI  the standards required to make the program successful will be strictly upheld       TWI is a dynamic program of hands on learning and practice  teaching essential skills for supervisors  team leaders and employees from all industries and vocations  These skills make or break the effort to implement and sustain lean manufacturing and continuous improvement efforts  The TWI program  with roots in the intensive World War II workforce training effort  has been refined and is being delivered by the CNY TDO  Their TWI program has already started to spread across New York and to companies in other states  The program is used in Japan and is credited for the success of the Toyota Production System and Lean Manufacturing efforts in general in Japan  As more and more trainers are trained nationwide in the U S   the number of manufacturers able to be helped will increase dramatically       In a personal letter to U S  Department of Commerce Secretary Carlos M  Gutierrez  Schumer wrote    By designating TDO as the Certification Authority for TWI  the standards required to make the program successful will be strictly upheld     As more and more trainers are trained nationwide in the U S   the number of manufacturers able to be helped will increase dramatically          Schumer has been leading a bipartisan effort to provide  112 million in funding for the MEP program  which helps upstate New York s manufacturing companies by offering worker training  management consulting  and suggestions for new business practices to companies  The Administration  s budget proposal would reduce funding for MEP  which has helped over 1 400 manufacturing companies in upstate New York stay afloat  by 57  from  117 million in FY2005 to only  46 8 million  In New York  the MEP program is credited with creating 625 and retaining 2 041 jobs in New York  increasing sales by  46 million  and realizing  13 million in cost savings for participating companies in 2003 alone
