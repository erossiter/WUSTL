IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 12  2005 Schumer  White House Meeting Today A Good First Step  But Consultation Must Be Real On Supreme Court Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Schumer Reiterates Call on President to Convene Summit to Continue Consultation on High Court Nominee  President Bush Agrees with Schumer that Court Nominee  s Philosophy Matters U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  spoke on the floor today calling for real consultation in the Supreme Court nomination process  He repeated his call for the President convene a summit on the nomination and also pointed to an important statement from President Bush today in which he agreed that a nominee  s   philosophy    matters  Schumer has suggested numerous times that a Supreme Court nominee  s philosophy is a key factor in deciding whether or not to support a nominee       President Bush said at a press conference today        when I finally make a decision  it s going to be one based upon a lot of research and a lot of thought about the character of the person  the integrity of the person  the ability of the person to do the job  and the philosophy of the person           A transcript of Schumer  s floor speech this morning follows         Mr  President  thank you  I was just here listening to our majority leader s words on consultation and the process thus far  And I  d like to make a couple of points  The first is that I think we re off to a good start  I certainly agree with the Majority Leader  The phone calls that have been made  this morning s meeting with Senators Frist and Reid and Specter and Leahy is a good first start  And that is how it should be  But I think we have to look at simply phone calls or meetings  if they re devoid of substance  are not going to lead to real consultation  I certainly agree with the Majority Leader s point          The Senate is not a co nominator  and it s the president who has to do the nominating  The way consultation has accurately  has successfully worked in the past is for the president to quietly  privately offer some of the names he s considering to those on both sides of the aisle and get opinions about those names  How would this one fare  How would that one fare  Do you think this one would cause a fight  How about that one  It s not that we would be co nominators at all          A good consultation means that that the senator from Tennessee discusses who he s thinking of nominating and takes the temperature particularly of the other party to see if a consensus nominee could come about  Thus far the president or any of the people working for him    I  ve had one call with Andrew Card  the Chief of Staff  has not offered a single name  From what I understand  this morning the president did not offer a single name  And so we re off to a good first start  Make no mistake about it  It is a good first start to begin the consultation process  But the consultation process  for it to work  is not going to be oh  okay  who do you think is a good name  and that s that  when we don t have a back and forth  In fact  for consultation to work    and we all want it to work    the president should suggest some names and get the opinion of those of us in the Senate          This is how it worked with President Clinton  It wasn t simply that President Clinton called up Orrin Hatch and said  give me some names and didn t have a discussion  President Clinton bounced off names  And in Orrin Hatch s book  he states that one of the names very much wanted to nominate was Bruce Babbitt  the former interior secretary and governor of Arizona  And while Orrin hatch didn t state how he would vote    and I  ve talked to Orrin a little about this    he said  I think Babbitt would cause a big fight  And wisely  President Clinton did not offer his name          So that s how the consultation process  to be successful ought to go and in my talk with Andrew card  I told him something that I  ve said repeatedly  and I think I speak for just about every member of this caucus on this side of the aisle  We don t want a fight  We certainly don t relish a fight  We would much prefer a consensus nominee  and furthermore  we know that that nominee is not going to be a liberal or even a moderate  it s likely to be a conservative  but our view is    and again this time I  m speaking for myself  but I think a lot of my colleagues share it    our view is very simple  that that nominee  though conservative  will interpret law  not make it  will be thoughtful  will be pragmatic  will understand the other point of view  and if that happens  I think we can have a process that works well          So in summary  Mr  President  the consultation we ve had is great  The number of phone calls may exceed any others that have been made  that have been named  but so far  at least according to my phone call and the ones of many of my colleagues that I  ve talked to and from what I  ve been told about the meeting this morning  we haven t gotten into the real nitty gritty of consultation  not co nomination  absolutely not  The president s the nominator  but the nitty gritty means offering some names  the president offers some names and gets the opinion before he makes his decision  and the decision  of course  by the constitution is solely his as to whether that nominee would get broad acceptance or whether that nominee is likely to cause quite a stir here in the senate           So let us hope that this is not the end of the consultation process but the beginning  Let us hope that there will be the kind of dialogue  I d reiterate my call to the president to have a summit  to call a good number of democrats and republicans together for a day at Camp David  for an evening or a dinner at the white house and have a real back and forth where we roll a serious  detailed discussion however we all feel    discussion of how we all feel  Who will benefit if that happens  who will benefit if there s real consultation  Certainly the president  certainly the Senate  certainly the Supreme Court  but most of all certainly the American people  Mr  President  I yield the floor
