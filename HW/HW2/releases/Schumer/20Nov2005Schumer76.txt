IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 20  2005 New Schumer Study Reveals for First Time LaGuardia  JFK And Newark Rank as Worst Three in Nation for Delayed Flights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Of 33 Busiest Airports in Country  LGA  JFK and Newark Rank 31  32  and 33 In Late Arrivals   One Third of Travelers Flying into New York are Now Late   Schumer Unveils 4 Point plan to Combat Delays As Thanksgiving approaches  and New Yorkers prepare for the busiest travel season of the year  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer released a  confirming many travelers worst suspicions  New York City area airports are  for the first time  the worst airports in the country in on time performance  and the problem has gotten markedly worse in the past few years  With nearly 100 million travelers passing through NYC area airports and growing  Schumer called on the FAA  the Administration and the Air Traffic Controllers union to address this problem before it gets worse         I think most New Yorkers suspected that this situation was bad  but this data shows that flight delays are getting worse  with no end in sight     Schumer said    We all know the frustration of being stuck on the runway or in the airport when you should be at home with your family  We need more accountability at the FAA  in the towers and on the ground so that we can remedy this          Schumer  s study uses the latest data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and reveals that of the 3 airports that nearly 100 million travelers passing through New York rely on each year    JFK  LaGuardia and Newark International    have the worst records in the nation for getting travelers in and out on time  The study also shows that these records have gotten worse in the past few years        Of the 33 largest airports nationwide  JFK and La Guardia consistently rank near last in on time performance  From January through September 2005  33  of flights to LaGuardia were delayed   making it 32nd out of 33  In 2004  27  were delayed and it was ranked 31st  and in 2003 LaGuardia had 24  of flights delayed and was ranked 29th  JFK had a similarly disappointing record  From January through September 2005  a full 30  of flights arrived late  placing it 31st among the nation  s 33 large airports  But in 2004  JFK had a 24  of flights delayed with a rank of 25th  in 2003 it has only 20  of flights delayed and ranked 23rd  Newark has consistently posted worst or second to worst  Now it is ranked 33rd of 33 with 34  of arrivals delayed       This summer was the worst ever in terms of delays  In August alone  one out of every three flights in to JFK and La Guardia were late  31  and 32  respectively   Flights out of these airports fared no better  with 22  of flights out of LaGuardia and 25  out of JFK delayed       The  released today showed that over the past three years the frequency of delays has become worse  In 2003  82  of flights nationwide arrived on time  78  in 2004  and down to 75  in 2005 so far  This represents a national drop of 7 percentage points  However  JFK and La Guardia  the problem is worse  At JFK  the percentage of flights arriving on time dropped 9 percentage points from 2003 through 2005 and at LaGuardia  the drop was 11 percentage points        JFK and La Guardia  s most popular destinations are bearing the brunt  Out of JFK  more than one out of every four flights to Los Angeles  26    Ft  Lauderdale  31    Orlando  25    San Juan  29    Boston  25    and West Palm Beach  30   reach their destinations late  At La Guardia  it  s no better  with one out of every three flights to Atlanta  31    Raleigh Durham  31   and Detroit  33   reaching their destinations late       The rise in delays can not only be attributed to weather  showing there is something structurally wrong with how the FAA and air traffic control are managing the traffic in the New York City area  The percentage of total arrival delays that are non weather related has more than doubled in the last three months  from 19  in July to 43  in September  Non weather delays can be attributed to non extreme weather conditions  airport operations  heavy traffic volume and air traffic control       Schumer today detailed his four point plan to combat the record at the three airports and help New Yorkers reach their destinations on time  The Senator       Called on the President and the Department of Transportation to put a new control tower at LaGuardia in next year  s FAA budget  The current tower is dilapidated and its current position and height prevent controllers from having a direct view of the runway  La Guardia needs a workable  state of the art tower in order to handle increasing traffic       Wrote a letter to the FAA asking them to stop dragging its feet on implementing new plane separation rules and to finally fix the management situation at the New York TRACON  Earlier this year  Senator Schumer called on Secretary Mineta to personally intervene and settle the dispute between the FAA and the Air Traffic Controllers Union  In his letter  Schumer reiterated his call  saying the situation has become worse not better  As part of the DOT  s investigation and final Tiger Team report on the NY TRACON  the DOT said it would craft new spacing rules in order to give controllers more flexibility when guiding planes in and out of the New York City airports  Specifically  the rules would allow controllers to bring planes closer together during times of heavy traffic  After more than three months  no action has been taken       Demanded that the FAA finally deploy the state of the art runway monitoring technology to JFK  LaGuardia and Newark  Just weeks ago  after Schumer had called for the deployment of this equipment for the New York airports  the FAA announced that they would equip the three airports with this technology  but gave a murky timeline  Today Schumer called on the FAA to deliver within the year as the new equipment helps controllers monitor and move planes on the runways more efficiently       He also called on the FAA to move forward with its redesign of the airspace over New York  Schumer said that the FAA s delays on massive New York airspace redesign are hampering efforts to manage the air traffic over New York City more effectively and efficiently  That project is now projected to be at least four years late  Before the project can proceed  the FAA must complete a draft Environmental Impact Statement  EIS   which was originally set for release in 2003  After multiple delays  it was expected this fall  The Draft EIS still has not been released       Click here to view
