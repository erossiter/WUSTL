IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 9  2005 Senators Schumer  Clinton Call To Restore 9 11 Money For Ongoing Needs Of Those Impacted By 9 11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Today Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee seeking a restoration of 9 11 funds that were rescinded by President Bush in the FY 2006 budget  This rescission is unprecedented given that these funds were designated as emergency spending when originally appropriated  Today  there is a great need for ongoing medical and mental health treatment for individuals  including emergency services personnel  rescue and recovery personnel  and others who were injured on September 11  2001  The original language only allowed the money to be used for processing of worker s compensation claims       The text of the letter to Senators Cochran  Byrd  Specter and Harkin follows      September 9  2005      Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members       The President  s FY 2006 budget for the Department of Labor included a  125 million rescission of emergency funds appropriated for workers   compensation claims in New York City  These funds were made available to New York State in the aftermath of the September 11  2001  terrorist attacks pursuant to P L  107 117  As you are aware  these funds were appropriated for the then anticipated need of processing workers   compensation claims and for other purposes  These funds were intended to be used to meet whatever future needs would emerge as a result of the attacks at Ground Zero for those workers directly impacted  This money was promised by the United States Congress to our first responders  workers  and volunteers who rushed to save lives and who continue to suffer from mental and physical injuries sustained as a result of their heroic services  The President  s budget seeks an additional  5 million rescission of unspent funds from the worker retraining program established to help New Yorkers who became unemployed as a result of the attacks of September 11th        We are concerned both about the procedure used to rescind this money and the policy determinations made by the Committee on the Budget  the President of the United States  and others at the Office of Management and Budget  and the Congressional Budget Office  As you are likely aware  P  L  107 117 contains the following language         For emergency expenses to respond to the September 11  2001  terrorist attacks on the United States  for     Workers Compensation Programs     175 000 000  to remain available until expended  to be obligated from amounts made available in Public Law 107   38  Provided  That  of such amount   125 000 000 shall be for payment to the New York State Workers Compensation Review Board  for the processing of claims related to the terrorist attacks Provided further  That  of such amount   25 000 000 shall be for payment to the New York State Uninsured Employers Fund  for reimbursement of claims related to the terrorist attacks  Provided further  That  of such amount   25 000 000 shall be for payment to the New York State Uninsured Employers Fund  for reimbursement of claims related to the first response emergency services personnel who were injured  were disabled  or died due to the terrorist attacks  emphasis added           Our government knew neither the full extent of the damage done to our nation and our people on that day nor what future problems many of our citizens would suffer from that point forward  We wish we could have solved all of our rebuilding  health  and compensation problems shortly after the attacks  but we continue to rebuild and care for those who stood at Ground Zero  In a few days  we will all join to remember not only those lost nearly four years ago  but to honor those who remain with us       We have discovered that many workers and first responders have ongoing needs that will not be met if this Congress does not stop this rescission and reprogram this money so that it can be used for ongoing needs  This money must remain available for the thousands of first responders who still need our help not only for ongoing medical and mental health needs  but also for actual worker  s compensation claims  The State of New York  New York City  and the entire New York Congressional delegation stands ready to do whatever we can to reverse this inequity       We believe that this funding should be reprogrammed to allow the State of New York greater flexibility to address the needs of the victims and workers affected by the attacks and that such funding remain as emergency spending as it was when initially appropriated        We propose allowing  50 000 000 to become available for payment to the New York State Uninsured Employers Fund for reimbursement of claims related to the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  and for reimbursement of claims related to the first response emergency services personnel who were injured  disabled  or died due to such terrorist attacks  Further  we believe the remaining  75 000 000 should be set aside for purposes related to the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  with priority given to administer baseline and follow up screening and clinical examinations and long term health monitoring  analysis  and treatment for emergency services personnel  rescue and recovery personnel  and others who were injured on September 11th so that adequate health care remains available as health problems develop or recur  This work is already ongoing through the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program and must continue       We are deeply disturbed at the inexplicable method taken by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  to allow rescissions of prior emergency spending to be scored as savings in the Budget process  This was apparently done with the explicit or implicit acquiescence of the President and the Office of Management and Budget  Initial staff reports indicate that this type of scoring is fairly unprecedented  and we believe if such a policy change should be implemented  it should not come at the expense of New York City firefighters  police officers  emergency response personnel  and other workers who responded on that day        On September 13  2001  the President of the United States spoke to New York  s Governor and New York City  s Mayor and said  in response to the attacks    A nything    anything it takes to help New York           The CBO should never have scored the proposed rescission as a savings since the initial appropriation was emergency spending  We intend to continue fighting for this funding as the FY 2006 Labor  HHS  and Education Appropriations bill proceeds to the Senate floor and we ask for your help to restore this funding and to ensure it is available for the future needs  Since the initial funding was emergency spending  we recommend that restoration of the funds be constituted as emergency spending  We thank you for your continued attention to this matter and look forward to meeting with you in the coming weeks       Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton
