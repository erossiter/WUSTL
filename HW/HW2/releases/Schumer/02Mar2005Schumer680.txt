IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 2  2005 Schumer Details Plans To Lower Home Heating Prices In Face Of Huge Winter Storm

                                Skyrocketing Oil Prices Drive Up Home Winter Heating Bills By  329 For Average New York Household    With New Yorkers Energy Bills Skyrocketing  Schumer Discusses Steps To Lower Prices  Restore Funding to Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program    Schumer Details Home Heating Oil Price Increases in Each County  Capital Region Homeowners Paying  36 6 million more  Central NY  18 6 m  Roch U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today vowed to fight to lower prices for New Yorkers who are paying more than 30 percent more for home heating oil this winter  Schumer today unveiled a new  showing that the average New York household using home heating oil is paying approximately  329 more this year than last year and called on the Administration to pressure Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  to reverse its recent decision to abandon a price target band  a significant factor in the high cost of oil  Schumer also committed to fight to restore funding to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   an area gutted by the Administration in its recent budget proposal         New Yorkers know this week more than ever how expensive it is to heat their homes     Schumer said    We are in are in a no win situation when it comes to heating their homes this year  When the price of oil goes up  it s not just a disruption in the balance of global economic or diplomatic factors  it s real money coming out of the pockets of average people  every single day  New Yorkers are being stretched too thin as it is    we must take immediate steps to ease this growing financial burden          Schumer said that home heating oil prices have been too high for too long  According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority  as of last week  the average cost of a gallon of home heating oil was  2 10  up 38 cents from the  1 72 it cost during the same week last year  In an effort to reduce the price of home heating oil and the burden of expensive heating bills for New Yorkers  Schumer announced today he is sending a letter to President Bush urging him to pressure OPEC to abandon its recent price increase  OPEC made a formal decision to discard its crude oil target price band of  22 28  This decision came on the heels of OPEC  s December announcement that it had decided to cut production to 27 million barrels per day  These actions amount to little more than an attempt by OPEC to enhance profits by capitalizing on last year  s drastic oil price spikes  As a result of these higher prices  OPEC  s members increased their profits last year by over  86 billion       Schumer today released a new  showing how much more New Yorkers in each county are paying to heat their homes this winter than they would have at last year  s home heating oil prices  Specifically  Schumer found that            This winter  families in the Capital Region are paying an estimated  36 6 million more for home heating oil   with the average household paying  340 extra or 34  more than they would have last year        This winter  families in Central New York are paying an estimated  18 6 million more for home heating oil   with the average household paying  322 extra or 32  more than they would have last year        This winter  families in Rochester   Finger Lakes are paying an estimated  16 8 million more for home heating oil   with the average household paying  331 extra or 32  more than they would have last year        This winter  families in the Hudson Valley are paying an estimated  125 million more for home heating oil   with the average household paying  328 extra or 29  more than they would have last year        This winter  families in the North Country are paying an estimated  31 2 million more for home heating oil   with the average household paying  325 extra or 31  more than they would have last year        This winter  families in the Southern Tier are paying an estimated  21 8 million more for home heating oil   with the average household paying  324 extra or 32  more than they would have last year        This winter  families in Western New York are paying an estimated  11 7 million more for home heating oil   with the average household paying  334 extra or 34  more than they would have last year       In addition  despite high energy prices and recent cold snaps that have necessitated the release of emergency funds  the President  s recent budget proposal actually calls for a cut of  80 million  or 4 3  in regular funding for LIHEAP from what was appropriated last year  LIHEAP is a block grant that gives low income households financial help to offset the costs of heating and or cooling their homes  There are over 785 000 households that receive LIHEAP funds in New York  Under this cut  New York stands to receive over  10 million less in funding and may be forced to curtail benefits or reduce the number of people eligible for assistance       Schumer today announced he is urging the Administration to restore funding to LIHEAP  Schumer also signed onto a bipartisan letter urging the Chairmen of the Senate Budget Committee to provide  3 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2006 and that the allocation provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2007  With  3 billion in regular funding and advance appropriations  LIHEAP can help working low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain economic stability  Since 1981  the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has grown  This winter  LIHEAP will serve an estimated 5 million households  Yet  this is only about 15 percent of the 32 million households that are eligible for federal assistance        Cutting the Low Income Home Energy Assistance  LIHEAP  program is wrong headed and inappropriate  especially as the OPEC cartel continues to jack up oil prices and tip American consumers upside down   Schumer said       To view Schumer
