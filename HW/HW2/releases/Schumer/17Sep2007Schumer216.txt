IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 17  2007 Schumer Calls on USDA to Immediately Block Imports of Australian Bees And Chinese Made Bee Food   Mysterious Disease Decimating US Honeybee Population  Now Traced To Australian Bees  Could Cost Li Farmers  100 Million                                                                                                                                                                                        Colony Collapse Disorder  Linked to Australian Bee Imports and  perhaps  Bee food from China  Decimating the Domestic Honey Bee Population Vital to Farmers on LI and Across the Country LI Farmers Stand to Lose up to  100 million in Economic Activity Due to Disappearing Bee Population That Pollinates 1 3 of LI Crops Schumer Leads Push to Have USDA Immediately S In response to the growing concerns over the decline of the U S  domestic bee population and the effect it could have on agriculture on Long Island and across the country  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Department of Agriculture to immediately suspend imports of Australian bees  Recently  a team of scientists led by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA uncovered a possible link between colony collapse disorder  CCD   Israeli acute paralysis virus  IAPV  and the importation of honeybees from Australia  Earlier this summer  Schumer released a new study showing that Long Island farmers could be hit especially hard by CCD  losing  100 million in economic activity if honeybee colonies continue to disappear  Honeybees are essential to Long Islands thriving agricultural economy  and affect the production of one third of crops    We cannot take any chances when it comes to Long Island and our nations farm production  Schumer said  The precipitous decline in the bee population hit Long Island farmers like a ton of bricks and if we dont act fast to stem the decline and rebuild the bee population  it could be too late  This mysterious phenomenon is as real as it gets and could cripple Long Island agriculture  A  100 million loss would be devastating for Long Islands farmers and agricultural workers  and we must take every available step to solve and stop this widening crisis   According to the Long Island Farm Bureau  Long Islands economy could lose up to  100 million in economic activity if the Colony Collapse Disorder continues to spread and decimate the bee population  Colony Collapse is particularly detrimental to the Long Island economy because honeybees are essential to the production of a full third of Long Island crops  ranging from apples and asparagus to pumpkins and tomatoes   The disappearance of honeybees has already affected dozens of Long Island farmers and beekeepers  with the latter reporting thousands of dollars of losses in declining hives  Former President of the Long Island Beekeepers Association  Raymond Lackey  has lost half of his 36 hives in the past few years  and Peter Bizzoso  Long Islands largest commercial beekeeper  has also lost half of his hives  down to 100 from his original 200  Additionally  the beekeepers have been forced to import bees from other states to make up for the loss  which may leave them vulnerable to outbreaks that have occurred in other areas   Beginning in 2004  the USDA lifted a ban on importing Australian and New Zealand bees into the US  Shortly thereafter  Schumer said hives across the US began to die  After years of confusion regarding the cause of the disorder  recent studies have shown that the phenomenon may be caused by a virus  the Israeli acute paralysis virus  IAPV  which is carried by Australian honeybees  Recent studies indicate that the timing of the disease shortly after the ban on imports was lifted is not a coincidence   Schumer today wrote to Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns asking him to immediately ban the import of honeybees from Australia  In his letter  Schumer wrote I urge you to protect Americas bee population  and with it  our beekeepers  farmers  and our vital agricultural economy  I believe that the USDA should err on the side of caution and eliminate the risk of introducing more sources of the virus   Schumer also called for a ban on Chinese royal jelly  It is currently illegal to use Chinese royal jelly as food for bees  However  many farmers are known to use the substance  also thought to carry IAPV  When they violate the law and use the jelly as a food source  their bees become infected  and then spread the virus to the hives of law abiding apiculturists  Schumer wrote that  i n order to protect the bee population and the finances of all apiculturists  it is imperative that Chinese royal jelly not be available in the US for any purpose since it is impossible to stop its use in beekeeping   Schumer is also the author of new legislation authorizing  250 million over ten years for the Agricultural Research Service to study Colony Collapse Disorder  The honey bee provision is part of Schumers comprehensive farm legislation that provides targeted relief to farmers on Long Island and across the Northeast  His legislation will serve as marker bill to insure that the 2007 Farm Bill  expected to be released this month  addresses the unique needs and issues facing Northeast farmers
