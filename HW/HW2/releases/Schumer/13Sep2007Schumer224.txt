IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 13  2007 Schumer Announces  The Deal Is Sealed  As Beech Nut And The Usda Find Solution So Canajoharie Plant Can Operate At Full Throttle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A Decision to Reduce Inspectors at Beech Nut s Canajoharie Plant had Threatened to Slow Down Production and Hamper Expansion Plans After Months of Pressure from the Senator  USDA s Under Secretary Personally Visited the Plant and Provided it with Temporary Inspection Levels While Final Negotiations were Hammered Out Today Schumer and Beech Nut Announce Accord on Inspect Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that Beech Nut s Canajoharie plant and the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  have figured out a solution that provides the plant with adequate federal food inspection levels  allowing it to operate at maximum capacity and continue to fuel the local economy  For months  production capacity at the plant  which recently announced a significant expansion and new locale  was jeopardized by changes in the USDA food inspection procedures that threatened Beech Nuts unique production line   However  after weeks of negotiations between the plant  the USDA and Schumer s office  Under Secretary Dr  Richard Raymond proposed that Beech Nut print the USDA inspection stamp on the baby food jar lids  rather than on the paper label  Since the lid is affixed early in the production process when the USDA inspectors are present  the plant will now be freed to do the paper labeling and packaging later in the day Today Schumer and Beech Nut hailed the final agreement    After months of negotiations  today I m proud to announce that we re out of the woods and the deal is sealed  said Senator Schumer  All parties came together to hammer out a plan that is a win win for the Mohawk Valley by allowing Beech Nut to not only protect its current workforce but also expand its operations and power the region s economy with good paying jobs  The USDA really came through here Dr  Raymond visited the plant last month and come up with a true out of the box solution    The process by which Beech Nut produces its meat based baby food must be monitored by USDA inspectors  However  USDA recently decided to eliminate all minimal and limited inspection services leaving Beech Nut with only one full time inspector and no additional coverage  which could curtail the plant s current operations and plans for future growth    Beech Nut s rigorous baby food production schedule  including preparing  cooking  cooling and packaging it in a sanitary fashion  requires two full time inspector shifts or other equivalent staffing arrangements  Before the recent reduction of inspection services  the Canajoharie plant received inspection over the course of their 20 hour production schedule  The USDA did this by combining a single full time inspector shift with a combination of overtime and limited coverage  The current arrangement has left them with a single inspector  creating inefficiencies and forcing Beech Nut to drastically alter how their products are made   Today Schumer announced a plan had been reached between Beech Nut and the USDA that will give the plant the necessary inspection levels so it can operate at full capacity  Under Secretary Raymond proposed that Beech Nut print the USDA inspection stamp on the baby food jar lids  rather than on the paper label  Since the lid is affixed early in the production process when the USDA inspectors are present  the plant will now be freed to do the paper labeling and packaging later in the day  However  now that the seal will be affixed to the lids during an earlier time of the day  it will eliminate the need for an additional inspection shift and will maximize the productivity of current inspectors   In August  following months of Schumer pressuring the USDA to assign an additional food inspector to Beech Nut s plant  the Under Secretary of the USDA visited the plan for a firsthand look and the agency assigned a temporary inspection shift so that the plant could operate at full capacity while final negotiations were completed    In May  Schumer had sent a letter pressuring USDA to assign a second full time inspection shift to the Canajoharie plant  This lead to the Under Secretary for Food Safety  Dr  Richard Raymond  visited the plant to personally assess the situation on August 8th    Beech Nut has been an economic lynchpin for Montgomery County and the entire Mohawk Valley Region since 1891  Two months ago  Beech Nut announced it will build a 650 000 square foot processing and packaging plant in Florida  Montgomery County  N Y   and relocate its corporate headquarters from St  Louis to the new building  It also announced its intention to add an additional 135 jobs to the 356 who are currently employed at their facility  Over the last several years its production has increased by nearly 50   and in the next several years it is hoping to increase its production by an additional 25   which could create additional jobs and millions of new investment in the region    Schumer has long been instrumental in Beech Nut s success in upstate New York  In the summer of 2006  Schumer worked with Empire State Development Corporation and the U S  Small Business Administration  SBA  to construct an incentives package to save Beech Nut s Canajoharie plant after it suffered severe flood damage  In February 2000  H J  Heinz  Inc  and Beech Nut s then parent company  Minot Holding Corporation  announced a planned merger which threatened operations at both the Canajoharie and Fort Plain production plants  Schumer intervened with the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and asked it to delay approving the merger until Heinz completed its review of the local plants  One week later  the FTC began its ultimately successful effort to block the merger  In the winter of 2002  Schumer also helped launch a new product line  called First Advantage  at the Canajoharie Plant
