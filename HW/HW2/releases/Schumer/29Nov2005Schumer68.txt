IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 29  2005 Schumer  New Survey Shows Staten Island Residents Will Pay Over  69 Million More To Heat Their Homes This Winter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 With Natural Gas Prices Projected to Go Up 40  and Home Heating Oil Prices Projected To Go Up 32   Average SI Resident Can Expect to Pay  466 More Than Last Year   Senator to Announce New Push to Tap Heat Oil Reserve  Expand Heating Assistance Programs  and Increase Weatherization Grants to Help Homeowners Conserve Heat   Senator to Stand with Staten Island Resident and LIHEAP Recipient  Lena Garzet In light of a  69 million projected increase in Staten Island home heating costs this winter  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Administration to tap the government s emergency heating oil stockpile as soon as possible to help bring down high heating fuel prices  The 2 million barrels in the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve would give consumers in the region supplies for about 10 days  the time needed for ships to carry heating fuel from Gulf of Mexico refiners to New York Harbor  Several weeks ago  the Department of Energy threshold for releasing fuel from the stockpile was met  but the Administration declined to tap the reserve          With energy prices through the roof  we need to help people pay for enormous heating costs this winter     Schumer said    More people then ever are likely to qualify for LIHEAP assistance  and we need to make sure the money will be there for them  If we secure additional funding  hopefully everyone who needs help during this cold winter will be able to receive assistance  Nobody should have to choose between putting food on the table and heating their homes          The New York State Public Service Commission recently reported that gas prices will be 35  45  higher than last year  and that the average consumer in New York uses approximately 90 000 cubic ft of natural gas this winter  While last year  s the New York average for natural gas price between October and March was  13 00  this year  s could be  18 20       According to the Energy Information Administration  Northeast consumers will use 641 gallons of home heating oil a year  This week  home heating prices oil prices in New York City were up to  2 65 from  2 22 a year ago  The Energy Information Administration projects home heating oil prices to rise 32  in the winter season  which means that they would be 71 cents over last winter  s average of  2 23 on Staten Island  There are over 126 000 natural gas users on Staten Island and over 21 000 home heating oil users on Staten Island  Each Staten Island gas consumer could pay at least  1638 this year  up from  1170 last year  and the Staten Island heating oil user could pay  1885  up from  1429 last year   the weighted average increase for the Staten Island consumer is  466 this winter  Oil and gas prices were from NYSERDA       Schumer today called on the President to tap the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve at the next possible opportunity  Under a complicated Energy Department formula  the heating oil reserve could have been tapped last week when wholesale heating oil and crude oil prices were at certain high levels  But the administration said there was no shortage of heating oil and refused to release any supplies from the stockpile  When Congress created the heating oil reserve in 2000  it said the president may release fuel from the stockpile if the difference between the price of Northeast heating oil and crude oil is increasing and is 60 percent greater than its five year rolling average for that month for two consecutive weeks       Several weeks ago  the difference in the price of Northeast heating oil and crude oil was  1 10 a gallon  or 62 5 percent of its five year rolling average  The price trigger was hit when the difference rose to almost  1 12 a gallon  or 64 9 percent of the rolling average  based on the government s survey of retail heating oil prices        Currently  the threshold for tapping the oil reserve is not met  but Schumer today said as soon as the formula is triggered  Bush should initiate a swap into the reserve to help lower energy bills for New Yorkers        Schumer today also renewed his call for Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to provide additional funding for LIHEAP this winter  Schumer has been part of a bipartisan push to add  3 1 billion to the Low Income Heating Assistance Program  LIHEAP  which helps eligible low income households meet their home heating needs  In 2003  at least 28 000 people on Long Island received LIHEAP Assistance  but because of higher energy costs fewer families could receive funding this year  Currently  under the FY05 federal allocation for LIHEAP of  1 885 billion  New York is slated to receive  235 6 million  Under Schumer  s proposal for  3 1 billion  New York  s share would increase to  309 1 million  These funds would help LIHEAP recipients cover the gap between their existing LIHEAP benefit and their projected high heating bills        Schumer will also call for expanding the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP  by  500 million  which reduces household energy use and costs by improving the energy efficiency of a participant s home  WAP has been proven to reduce heating bills by 31  and overall energy bills by  274 per year  Weatherization technologies address the whole spectrum of energy consuming systems in low income homes including insulation  blower doors  air sealing  windows  heating  water heaters  air conditioning and warm climate weatherization measures  and electrical appliances and weatherization base load measures
