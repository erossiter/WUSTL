                                         TB Traveler was Allowed to Cross Plattsburgh Border Despite U S  Agents being Instructed to Detain Him Upon Entry   Schumer  Our Nation s First Line of Defense for Keeping Out Diseases and Terrorists is Understaffed and Overworked   In 2006  19 Million Passengers Crossed the NYS border   Senator Calls for a GAO Study to Investigate CBP Staffing Shortage and how to Improve Reten In light of yesterdays news that an individual with a highly dangerous strain of tuberculosis  whose passport was flagged and wasidentified as someone to be detained  was able to cross the upstate New York border  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called for an investigation into the current staffing situation at border crossings across upstate New York and along the Northern Border  Schumer is concerned that the U S  Customs and Border Patrol Service is overworked and understaffed  and that unless changes are made to boost recruitment  improve training and increase retention rates  the agency will be increasingly overwhelmed when it comes to keeping terrorists and weapons of mass destruction from crossing the upstate border    The fact that this individual was able to cross the upstate New   York border despite having his passport tagged  and setting off a warning at the border  exposes a disturbing lapse in our border security  said Senator Schumer  But  perhaps even more frightening  is that if we dont give Customs and Border Patrol the manpower and resources it needs it they will be increasingly overwhelmed when it comes to ensuring that terrorists are kept out of our country  Today  Im calling for the Government Accountability Office to conduct an investigation in the staffing situation at border crossings along the Northern Border  so in locations across Upstate New York we can make sure agents are getting the help and training they need   Yesterday  it was discovered that individual carrying tuberculosis who was placed on a no fly list  which was then turned over to border guards  was still able to cross the Plattsburgh  New York border and travel to Albany and New York City before being detained and quarantined  A single border guard was responsible for mistakenly allowing the patient to enter the country  While the failure todetainthe individualso he could be quarantined exposed a gaping hole in the countrys system toprotect the public from disease  it also underscored the nations vulnerability to stopping terrorists from slipping past border guards and gaining entrance    Today it was one very sick and very irresponsible person who slipped through  but tomorrow could bring much worse  said Schumer  There is just no excuse for this  God forbid this was someone bent on doing us harm  we simply must have more border guards  with better safety protocols  doing a better job    Senator Schumer today warned that this incident showed that potential staffing shortages at the nations border crossings and a lack of adequate training has left agents overworked  under trained and lacking back up support to deal with a deluge of travelers seeking to enter the nation through the Northern Border  The U S  Customers and Border Patrol unions have long complained that long hours and forced overtime have placed significant strain on their ability to deal with the growing number of threats and potential terrorists attempting to enter the border   As of September 11  2006  the Northern Border was still 1 428 officers short of the 4 845 agents required by the USA PATRIOT act According to a May  2005 House Committee report on Homeland Security  despite the number of agents on the Northern Border tripling as a result of an authorization made in the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001  there is concern that those numbers may drop if retiring and promoted agents are not quickly replaced   According to U S  Customers and Border Protection  there are 17 border crossings along the 500 miles of northern border in New York State  spanning from Buffalo to Champlain  They are manned by approximately 980 uniformed officers  including 30 who are agriculture specialists and unarmed  In Fiscal Year 2006  CBP officers cleared 19 million passengers which included 9 790 680 passenger vehicles and 1 890 000 commercial trucks  Today  Senator Schumer called for a new GAO  Government Accountability Office  investigation into the current staffing situation at border crossings along the Northern border  including Upstate New York  He specifically called for examining ways to improve the retention rates of border guards as well as improve their training  The investigation would examine attrition rates  recruitment practices  and whether or not candidates are properly surveyed throughout the hiring and training process   Even though the agent was warned that the man should be detained at all costs  the individual was still allowed to drive into this country no questions asked  Its high time we have a top to bottom investigation of our border control practices  These agents are our nations first line of defense and we need to make sure they get the support and training they deserve  Schumer added
