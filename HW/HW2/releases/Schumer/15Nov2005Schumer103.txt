IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 15  2005 Schumer  Serious Doubts About Whether Gunn Was Fired Legally  Administration Should Reinstate Him As Amtrak President Until Legal Issues Resolved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                After Talking to Legal Experts  Longtime Defender of Amtrak Concerned about Legitimacy of Amtrak  s Board of Directors and Future of Passenger Rail Service   Schumer Urges Bush to Submit List of Nominees to Fill Board  Board is Operating Short Three Members  Two are Recess Appointments and Chairman is Bush Fundraising   Pioneer   Senator Chuck Schumer sent a letter today to President George W  Bush raising serious doubts about the firing of David Gunn as President of Amtrak last week  Gunn was fired by the Amtrak Board of Directors last week  but Schumer and others question the Board  s actions because three slots on the Board are vacant  two of its current members are recess appointments that are about to expire  and its chairman is a major Bush fundraiser whose term is also about to expire  Schumer consulted legal experts and believes that the Board could be operating illegitimately and the firing could be illegal       Schumer said    The Administration  s intent to permanently derail Amtrak has been clear for years  but last week  s illegitimate move to fire David Gunn has gone too far  David Gunn is a brilliant manager who stood up for Amtrak and better than anyone else could bring it into the 21st Century            Amtrak and its millions of riders in New York and across the country need an ally to fight for more funds  and better service and security    the Administration should reinstate Gunn and make that a possibility   Schumer  who has been a leading and longtime defender of Amtrak in the Congress  said        Schumer Letter to President Bush      President George W  Bush  he White House  Washington DC      Dear Mr  President       I write to you to express my strong disagreement with the Amtrak Board of Director  s decision to unilaterally dismiss David Gunn and  after having consulted with several legal experts  believe the firing may have been illegal  Until Congress  the Department of Transportation  and any outside legal authorities can fully examine the legality of the Board  s action  I ask that you reinstate Mr  Gunn  There are serious legal questions surrounding the composition of the current Board and whether or not there are a sufficient number of active members to comprise a quorum  If the Board does not have a quorum  which I believe it does not  then the Board acted outside of its legal authority and Mr  Gunn should be immediately reinstated as President of Amtrak       David Gunn is a brilliant manager and an experienced railroad administrator who during his tenure worked tirelessly to defend and expand Amtrak  I consider him an invaluable ally in the effort to improve Amtrak and someone who has stood up to constant attacks from those inside and outside of the Administration who seek to take Amtrak apart piece by piece       My concern is that the Board  as it is currently comprised of only four active members  two of whom as you know who were recess appointments  does not satisfy the requirements for an active quorum set forth in the Amtrak Articles of Incorporation or the D C  Business Corporation Act  In addition  we feel the use of the recess appointment power  granted to the President by the Constitution  does not apply to non governmental organizations  such as Amtrak and that the appointments of Floyd Hall and Emanuel Sosa are potentially invalid  leaving only two legitimate members on the Board       First  I believe there are not enough active members on the Board to comprise a quorum  According to section 7 01 of the Amtrak Articles of Incorporation  five members are required for a quorum  Though the current Board of Director  s bylaws and the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act only require a majority of the seats to be filled in order for the board to operate  the DC Business Corporation act clearly states    a majority of the number of directors fixed by the bylaws    shall constitute a quorum    unless a higher number is required by the articles of incorporation      Sec  29 101 36  2003   Since the Articles clearly require a higher number of directors  according to DC law  the current board is not sufficiently staffed and does not have the legal authority to act       Second  I question whether the President has the power to make recess appointments to an organization that by law is not part of the federal government  Since its inception more than 30 years ago  Amtrak has never been a department  agency  or instrumentality of the U S  Government  49 U S C  24301 a  3    However  the Constitution states that the President may only make recess appointments to fill vacancies among   Officers of the United States     Since Mr  Sosa and Mr  Hall did not replace   Officers of the United States     we believe their appointments to be invalid  requiring advice and consent of the Senate       Overall  I am disappointed with the manner in which the Board has conducted itself and fear that without a full compliment of qualified Senate confirmed members the future of Amtrak is in grave jeopardy  At the end of this year  the two recess appointments to the Board  Floyd Hall and Emanuel Sosa  will expire  I respectfully urge you to not simply again grant recess appointments to them or anyone else  Instead  I ask that you send to Congress a full list of five new nominees who will be subject to Senate advice and consent  In addition  I ask that you and your staff consult with Senator Reid on these nominations        Mr  Gunn  s firing was an unjustified action  carried out in the dead of night  This behavior is in need of strict review and I ask that you immediately look in to the Board  s action and reinstate Mr  Gunn in the interim       Sincerely       Charles E  Schumer
