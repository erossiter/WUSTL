                                    Schumer  NYPA Should Utilize 20 Mega Watts of Low Cost Power from the St  Lawrence Power Plant   and a  16 Million Fund   to Lure New Jobs to the region Following the Departure of GM  Schumer Champions New Agency to Spur North Country Economic Growth through Low Cost Power and Strategically Targeted Loans  In the wake of General Motors  GM  announcing its intention to eliminate its facility in Massena by 2008  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the New York Power Authority  NYPA  towork with the St  Lawrence Redevelopment Agency  RVRDA  to attract new businesses and spur job growth in St  Lawrence County and across the North Country  Administered by a board with local expertise  the RVRDAhas proposedto use 20 Mega Watts of low cost power from the nearby St  Lawrence Power Plant and a  16 million fund to bring new economic development opportunities to an area too frequently marked by economic stagnation    In a letter to NYPAs Chairman  Roger Kelley  Schumer today argued that the agencys planto provide low cost power as well as strategically targeted loans and grants are two of the most effective tools for municipalities to both create and retain jobs   Givinglow cost power and atrust fund for economic development tothe St  Lawrence Redevelopment Agency willkick start job growth inthe North Country  said Senator Schumer  Today Im calling on NYPA to move forward inworking with thisagency  which has the potential to lure new businesses to the region and create good paying jobs by offering low cost power and a package of targeted loans and grants   The RVRDA would be a St  Lawrence County based agency consisting of local economic leaders  The northern portion of St  Lawrence County  where the RVRDAs economic activities would be primarily focused  is in great need of such an entity  In May  General Motors announceditstheir intention to eliminate all 500 positions atits their facility in Massena by 2008  The companys good paying jobs were critical to the economic health of the region  leaving a void that needs to be filled with quality jobs   This 20MWs of power and the  16 million dollar fund have already been allocated for the benefit of this region said Assemblyman Darrel Aubertine  I have been working very closely with Town  County and St  Lawrence Redevelopment Agency officials to establish a mechanism which will allow for the local administration of these assets  Together  we have brought ideas toward this end to NYPA for their input I will be meeting with NYPA officials again next week and look forward to resolving this issue   Echoing Assemblyman Aubertine s sentiments  Schumer today emphasized that the RVRDA is well positioned to undertake the mission of replacing the lost jobs and spurring additional economic growth across the region  The two sets ofincentives that the RVRDA proposes to use come from existing sources that are specifically designated for economic development purposes  economic grants and loans  and supplying low cost power    The RVRDA intends to use  16 million in grants and loans that were originally designated during the NYPA re licensing process to build an aquariumin Massena  With plans to build this facility now abandoned  Schumer argued the money could be used for a range of activities including site development and acquisition  business grants and loans  and property tax abatement  This fund is the perfect seed money to provide the economic stimulus needed in St  Lawrence County and the North Country  added Schumer    The RVRDA also plans to use low cost power to attract new businesses to the region  In 2005  the State Legislature passed legislation designating 20 MW of low cost from the St  Lawrence Power Plant to be used for economic development projects  While the 20 MW officially became available at the beginning of 2007  as of today  not a single mega watt has gone towards attracting or retaining new businesses  The RVRDA proposed to grant allocations of this low cost power to companies willing to meet stringent growth or retention goals  In the event the power is not fully allocated  they could use excess as a vehicle for monetization  allowing for the new financial resources to become available to the RVRDA    With NYPA recently meeting with State and County officials to discuss the RVRDA proposal  Schumer today called on NYPA to act quickly and aggressively to help clear the way for the proposal that puts economic development tools where they should be  in the hand of local officials who know the region best   Schumer also emphasized that RVRDA would act as good model for dispersing the  16 million in funding to spur economic development throughout region  and suggested that NYPA and Economic Development could playa prominent roles
