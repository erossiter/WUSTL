IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 3  2006 Judiciary Dems Call On Specter To Urge Ashcroft  Comey  Others To Testify At Hearings On Secret Domestic Spying Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Gonzales Will Defend Administration  s Program at Hearing  But Americans Need to Hear from Those in the Administration Who Had Misgivings  Like Former A G  Ashcroft and Deputy A G  Comey  about Secret Wiretapping Program   Senators Also Urge that Administration  s Executive Privilege Not Be Invoked So that the American People Can Get the Full Story on the Secret Spying Program Today all eight Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter urging him to call on more current and former high level Bush Administration officials including former Attorney General John Ashcroft  Deputy Attorneys General Jim Comey and Larry Thompson  and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card  Schumer and Feingold had previously sent a letter calling on Chairman Specter to expand and diversify the witness list so that the American public can get the full story on the secret domestic spying program  They also agreed that no witnesses from the Administration should invoke executive privilege        The letter to Specter follows      February 3  2006  Senator Arlen Specter  Chairman  Committee on the Judiciary      Dear Senator Specter       We fully support all lawful measures to protect the safety and freedom of our country and our citizens  Accordingly  in the interest of both national security and restoring faith in government  we must get to the bottom of the legal questions surrounding the National Security Agency  s domestic spying program  The American people must trust that the Administration has been candid and the Senate thorough in its investigation  And if laws must be reviewed or changed to ensure a robust fight against terrorism and a strict adherence to the rule of law  we need full information in order to make those changes quickly       We therefore very much appreciate your decision to hold a hearing on this issue next week  and we trust that this will be merely the first of several such hearings  We also appreciate your public commitment to pursue this issue thoroughly and fairly  At the same time  however  all of us are concerned that the only Administration witness who has so far committed to attend any hearings is Attorney General Gonzales  These concerns have been heightened by continuing news reports detailing the depth and breadth of dissent within the Administration over the legality of the program       It is our understanding that your staff may have reached out to other Administration officials  both past and present  but we write to ask for additional efforts in this regard  First  we urge you to request that the other Administration officials involved in the review and authorization of this program appear before the Committee  Their testimony is vital       Second  we understand that some of these officials claim they would be prohibited by executive privilege from offering useful testimony at the hearing  We urge you  therefore  to join us in requesting  in the strongest possible terms  that the Administration not assert executive privilege for the following individuals so that they might help the Committee conduct full  thorough  and fair hearings             Former Attorney General John Ashcroft  who reportedly personally approved the program            Former Deputy Attorney General James B  Comey  who reportedly expressed grave reservations about the program            Former Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith  who reportedly objected to the program repeatedly            Former National Security Aide to the Deputy Attorney General Patrick Philbin  who reportedly shared Mr  Goldsmith  s concerns            Director of the Office of Intelligence and Policy Review  James Baker  who testified previously before the Senate that the Bush Administration did not support a proposal by Senator DeWine to amend FISA            Vice President Cheney  s former Counsel  now his Chief of Staff  David Addington  who reportedly played a lead role in advocating for the program  and           Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson  who was Mr  Comey  s predecessor        The trust of the American people in their government is central to our national well being and safety  unfortunately  it has been severely challenged by allegations that the Administration has been less than forthcoming with Senators and citizens alike  That trust may be impossible to restore if these officials are not permitted to testify  or if the excuse of executive privilege is used to shield them from providing frank answers        Sincerely   Charles E  Schumer  Patrick J  Leahy  Richard J  Durbin  Russell D  Feingold  Herbert Kohl   Edward M  Kennedy  Joseph R  Biden  Jr   Dianne Feinstein
