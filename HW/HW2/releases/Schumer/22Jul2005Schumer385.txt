IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 22  2005 New Fuel Efficient Tires Could Save Upstate New Yorkers  225 Million  Conserve Fuel  And Reduce U S  Dependency On Foreign Oil    Schumer Introduces Amendment To Energy Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     As Crude Oil Prices Hit All Time Highs  Schumer Unveils Measure Mandating All Replacement Tires Must Be More Efficient      With Energy Bill Slated For Vote This Week  Schumer Touts New Tire Technology That Cuts Reliance on Foreign Oil and Saves Money at the Pump      Schumer Details Gallons and Dollars Saved In Each County  Drivers in Capital Region Would Save  23 million  Central With the Energy Bill being debated on the floor the U S  Senate  Senator Charles E  Schumer unveiled a new measure requiring the federal government to establish efficiency standards for the replacement tires that drivers buy when the old tires wear out  Most current replacement tires are between 20 and 60 percent less efficient than the original tires automakers equip cars with to help meet federal fuel economy standards  Schumer introduced a amendment to the Energy Bill  currently being debated on the floor of the Senate         This is a win  win  win situation  not only do we conserve fuel  but we reduce our dependency on foreign oil  and drivers save at the pump     Schumer said    If New Yorkers knew they could invest an extra few dollars in a set of tires and then save a lot more at the gas pump  they d jump at the opportunity  Unfortunately  there aren t enough of these tires  and the ones that are on the market are tough to find  But if fuel efficient tires are good enough when you buy a new car  they should be good enough when its time to replace those tires down the road          Schumer released data showing that for an extra  5 to  12 per set of replacement tires  the average motorist can reduce his or her gasoline consumption by 1 5 to 4 5 percent  saving  50  150 over the life of the tires  According to the National Resources Defense Council  the United States could save 360 000 barrels of oil a day by the year 2015 if all replacement tires were as efficient as the originals  In New York alone  efficient replacement tires would save 150 million gallons of gasoline and  240 million a year  Savings nationwide would total between  2 5 and  7 5 billion a year  according to Green Seal Environmental Partners  an independent  non profit organization that produces Consumer ReportsTM  like investigations into the environmental friendliness of consumer products       Schumer today released a  demonstrating New Yorkers would save a total of  225 million and conserve 101 million gallons of gasoline  Specifically  Schumer found that            In the Capital Region fuel efficient tires could save consumers almost  22 8 million a year in gasoline costs  and could conserve over 10 million gallons of gas        In Central New York fuel efficient tires could save consumers almost  29 2 million a year in gasoline costs  and could conserve over 12 9 million gallons of       In Rochester Finger Lakes area fuel efficient tires could save consumers  38 9 million a year in gasoline costs  and could conserve 17 2 million gallons of gas       In the Hudson Valley fuel efficient tires could save consumers  55 1 million a year in gasoline costs  and could conserve 24 6 million gallons of gas        In the North Country an estimated fuel efficient tires could save consumers  17 1 million a year in gasoline costs  and could conserve 7 8 million gallons of gas        In the Southern Tier fuel efficient tires could save consumers  21 million a year in gasoline costs  and could conserve 9 5 million gallons of gas        In Western New York fuel efficient tires could save consumers  40 9 million a year in gasoline costs  and could conserve 18 5 million gallons of gas       Schumer s Amendment directs the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration  a division of the US Department of Transportation  to establish an efficiency standard and labeling requirements for replacement tires so consumers know if the tires they buy are as efficient as the ones that came as original equipment when their cars were new  These standards would be reviewed and updated every three years to keep up with improvements in tire technology       Schumer would also create a new consumer information program to promote the purchase of energy efficient replacement tires including purchase incentives  Internet website listings  and printed fuel economy guide booklets  Schumer said that this information is essential because few drivers know about these tires and even fewer tire retailers in New York and across the nation sell such tires       Tire efficiency is measured through rolling resistance  or the amount of energy needed to roll a tire down the road  Because of their higher rolling resistance  replacement tires are as much as 60 percent less efficient than the most efficient tires  like the ones tires that automakers use to help meet the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards  according to Green Seal  If all replacement tires were as efficient as the originals  fuel economy nationwide would improve by about 3   and the United States could save 5 billion barrels of oil between 2007 and 2050  according to the National Resources Defense Council       The California Energy Commission research has shown that fuel efficient tires perform at the same safety level as the replacement tires that are currently used by cars throughout the United States  Tire manufacturers can use materials like silica to stiffen tires and lower their weight  Improved tread design can also improve rolling resistance       Click here to view
