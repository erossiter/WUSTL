Efforts   And Sticks Residents with Huge Annual Insurance Fees High Insurance Fees Hinder Homeowners in S  Buffalo and Kaisertown from Selling their Homes at Market Rate  Receiving Grants for Home Improvements  and Attracting New Investment in Nearby Properties  Schumer Calls on FEMA to Withhold Issuing Buffalo Flood Map Until Agency Sends a Representative to Tour Cazenovia Creek and Buffalo River Floodplains Before the Senate Banking Committee  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to withhold from issuing its new flood insurance map for the City of Buffalo until it sends a representative to the city to see first hand the citys recent flood mitigation upgrades  Currently  the outdated Flood Insurance Study  FIS  is sticking residents in Kaisertown and South Buffalo with back breaking insurance fees  Despite recent infrastructure investments that dramatically reduced the likelihood of flooding and related property damage in the neighborhoods  the current Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City of Buffalo fails to acknowledge these local flood remediation efforts  forcing residents to pay hundreds of dollars in annual insurance costs    Today  Schumer  speaking before the Senate Banking Committee  called on FEMA to withhold from issuing a new flood map for the city until the agency visits Buffalo to see firsthand the flood prevention upgrades it has recently incorporated    The City of Buffalo has bent over backwards to implement flood prevention upgrades in Kaisertown and South Buffalo in an effort to ease the crippling annual insurance fees local residents are forced to fork over  said Senator Schumer  Now its up to FEMA to send a representative to visit these neighborhoods so it can see firsthand the citys improvements  Issuing a flood map without personally visiting the city only lends itself to the continuation of a policy that is unfairly sticking local residents with sky high insurance fees   Currently thousands of homeowners in the Kaisertown and South Buffalo neighborhoods have been shoehorned into a mandatory Standard Flood Insurance Policy  SFIP  which stipulates the amount of insurance they should pay based on the potential threat of a flood  While recent infrastructure investments have dramatically reduced the likelihood of flooding and related property damage  the current Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City of Buffalo does not acknowledge these local flood remediation efforts  and homeowners continue to foot the bill despite the reduced risk   Schumer stressed that the likelihood of future flooding and related property damage attributable to winter ice jams on the Buffalo River and Cazenovia Creek have diminished markedly due to the completion of flood abatement initiatives such as the new West Seneca Ice Retention Structure  designed by the USACE Cold Regions Lab  This project has greatly reduced the prospect of ice jam flooding in the lower basin of Cazenovia Creek and has substantially reduced the flow of large ice that enters the Buffalo River at its intersection with the creek    Schumer pointed to this project as evidence that the time is ripe for FEMA to reassess risk levels  redraw its insurance maps  reduce premiums  and remove many homeowners from the program altogether   In the history of this program  not one single homeowner in Kaisertown and South Buffalo has ever had to collect reimbursement for flooding  because no substantial flooding or property damage has ever occurred in the area since 1959  Local flood abatement programs since that time have succeeded in preventing future flooding  yet the program in Buffalo has not been changed to reflect existing conditions  Homeowners are now paying hundreds  and sometimes thousands  of dollars yearly for flood insurance programs they do not need and will likely never derive any benefit from    Schumer has expressed concern that current sky high insurance fees deter a homeowners ability in South Buffalo and Kaisertown to sell their homes at market rate  receive grants for home improvements  and attract new investment in the nearby properties
