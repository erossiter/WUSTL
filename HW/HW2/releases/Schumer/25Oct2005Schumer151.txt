IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 25  2005 Schumer Demands Federal Disaster Assistance For Long Island Farmers And Wineries Pummeled By Record Breaking Rainfall                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Nassau and Suffolk Counties in New York suffered serious flood damage as a result of the heavy rainstorms earlier this month   Hurricane Wilma  s impending arrival could bring additional flooding to area and more extensive damage   Many harvests were significantly damaged by severe weather pattern  grapes that were in crucial stages before harvest cause concern for winery owners Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer sent a letter to the United States Department of Agriculture urging federal disaster assistance for farmers and growers and winery owners in Eastern Long Island who were affected by the severely damaging rainfall in recent weeks         You can t prevent natural disasters from happening  but we can and must provide as much assistance as possible     Schumer said   The unprecedented rainfall in this area brought on significant damage to thousands upon thousands of acres and will no doubt result in major economic loss for farmers and winery owners  and it is up to the USDA to step in and provide assistance immediately          According to the National Weather Service  more than a foot of rain fell over an eight day period  making this Long Island  s wettest October on record  From October 8 through October 15  a total of 17 2    of rain was recorded at the Long Island Horticulture Research and Extension Center in Riverhead  New York  The heaviest rains occurred between October 12 15 when daily totals were 5 6     1 5     4 5    and 3 6    respectively  Other unofficial reports indicated between 16 18 inches of rain in Suffolk County  As the flooding has subsided  municipalities have been collecting data and assessing the damage  They are expected to face extensive repair and restoration costs       This unprecedented weather system coincided with the beginning of harvest for red grape varieties on Long Island  Merlot was the most profoundly affected with yield losses ranging from slight to severe  Thin skinned merlot grapes  a staple of Long Island  s red wine industry  were the most profoundly affected after pelting rain  over saturation and disease  50 percent of the acreage experienced yield losses of 20 50 percent and 25 percent of the acreage saw losses spanning from a majority of fruit to total crop failure  Yield losses also affected the two other major red varieties  Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon  As a result of the rainstorms  the quantity of red wine will be significantly reduced compared to what was expected this year  Additionally many winery owners will need to determine if they can salvage their red varieties of grapes still on the vine       While some of the region  s wineries were fortunate to escape the deluge relatively unscathed  others incurred sizeable losses  For example  Long Island  s largest vineyard lost its entire crop of Riesling grapes  Some have predicted that up to 60 to 70 percent of Eastern Long Island  s red grape harvest could be lost       Over the past 30 years  3 000 acres of wine vineyards have replaced vegetable and potato farms  mostly on the eastern Long Island s north fork  although the Hamptons on the south fork are dotted with vineyards as well  There are 39 wineries on Long Island  producing 500 000 cases annually       It is also estimated that these heavy rains impacted over 1 000 acres each of vegetables  potatoes and field corn  The rains caused total or partial damage to these crops harvested by over 100 growers accounting for anticipated losses of over 1 million dollars  Although it is towards the end of the growing season  many fall season vegetables are in the prime of harvest this time of year  These crops include lettuce  spinach  Asian vegetables  leafy greens for mesclun mix  broccoli  cauliflower  pumpkins and squash  In addition  late season tomatoes  sweet corn  peppers  beans and eggplants are productive crops during the mild fall season  The potato growers were in the middle of fall harvest when the rainfall occurred  The hardest hit vegetables were the leafy greens  lettuce  spinach  etc    The damage to these crops at all stages of growth ranged from 90 to 100 percent  The potential for more disease damage and subsequent losses to all vegetable crops over the next few weeks remains extremely high       It is estimated that approximately 40 percent of the 3000 acres of potatoes grown in Suffolk County had not been harvested prior to the heavy rains  The excessive rains washed soil off the hills of potatoes resulting in 10 to 20 percent of the crop turning green due to the exposure to the sun  In addition  over 5 percent of the crop had been lost to soft rot due to the flooding of the fields  The projected total losses of the un harvested potatoes are estimated at 15 to 25 percent  The potential for additional losses from soft rot and pink rot in the field and storage remains very high       In his letter to the USDA  Schumer said         There are some things that proprietors of wineries  vineyards and farms can account for when they  re doing business  like market conditions and costs they incur  but severe weather just is not one of them  It is crucial for the USDA to respond quickly with emergency assistance to keep Long Island  s wineries  vineyards and farms in business
