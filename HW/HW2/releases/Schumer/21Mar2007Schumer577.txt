IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 21  2007 With 900 000 Middle Class Families In Upstate New York About To Be Hit By The Amt For The First Time  Schumer Unveils Sweeping New Middle Class Tax Cut Package                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Comprehensive Legislation Would Provide Targeted Tax Relief At Key Phases Of A Family s Life  Including Expansion of the Child Tax Credit  College Tuition Tax Credit and Two Years of AMT Relief   Schumer  The Concerns of Middle Class Families Have Been Left on the Back Burner for Far Too Long   Schumer s Legislation Would Save Upstate NY Taxpayers Nearly  4 Billion Under the AMT  With the cost of tuition  health care and energy going through the roof and millions more families about to be hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax this year  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a sweeping new package of middle class tax breaks   The comprehensive legislation provides targeted tax breaks to middle class families at every stage of life by  expanding the child tax credit  simplifying and expanding the college tuition tax credit  providing a much needed fix to the AMT  and enhancing tax credits for families taking care of again parents        This package provides relief  instead of a tighter squeeze  for middle class families who need it most of all   Schumer said   Everyone should be able to afford a house  raise a family  help their kids get ahead with a college education  and care for their elderly parents without struggling to make ends meet  With simple  fair changes to our tax code  we can lend middle class families a much needed helping hand        The Middle Class Opportunity Act  which Schumer introduced in the Senate earlier this year  provides targeted tax relief at key phrases of a family s life  Schumer said that middle class families in upstate New York and across the country are struggling to get ahead as they juggle the expenses of childcare  sending kids to college  and taking care of elderly parents  Unfortunately  recent tax cuts were designed to provide the most benefits to the people who don t need them  but didn t provide much relief to middle class families  for whom simple life changes like a new baby or a new school year can create major financial stress        Today  Schumer  a member of the Senate Finance Committee  highlighted his new tax package and the benefits it would bring to middle class families across New York  Over the next four years  the Act would provide approximately  80 billion more tax relief over the one year of AMT relief in the President s budget        The centerpiece of his legislation is two years of much needed relief for middle class families from the Alternative Minimum Tax   Schumer said that record numbers of middle class families are being trapped by the dreaded tax and it is one of the greatest  and costly  tax burdens facing upstate New York families  According to the Congressional Research Service  if no fix is passed  an additional 912 816 families in Upstate New York will have to pay the AMT  costing them  3 87 billion more in taxes  The numbers for upstate families are below            In the Capital Region  11 638 families paid the AMT in 2004  Schumer s bill prevents 73 420 families from falling under the AMT in 2007  saving them  277 305 680            In Central New York  8 706 families paid the AMT in 2004  Schumer s bill prevents 54 927 families from falling under the AMT in 2007  saving them  187 143 482            In the Rochester Finger Lakes region  15 126 families paid the AMT in 2004  Schumer s bill prevents 95 428 families from falling under the AMT in 2007  saving them  350 496 214            In the Hudson Valley  89 568 families paid the AMT in 2004  Schumer s bill prevents 565 078 families from falling under the AMT in 2007  saving them  2 578 216 516            In the North Country  2 840 families paid the AMT in 2004  Schumer s bill prevents 17 915 families from falling under the AMT in 2007  saving them  70 477 847            In the Southern Tier  4 507 families paid the AMT in 2004  Schumer s bill prevents 28 433 families from falling under the AMT in 2007  saving them  113 438 909            In Western New York  12 302 families paid the AMT in 2004  Schumer s bill prevents 77 614 families from falling under the AMT in 2007  saving them  294 203 748        Without action  the AMT would hit upstate New York families like a ton of bricks   Schumer added       Schumer said that in addition to the looming AMT avalanche  the financial concerns facing middle class range from taking care of the youngest members to the oldest   With the rising cost of college tuition  millions of families are struggling to pay fore the rising cost of public and private tuition   Schumer s legislation focuses on four critical areas where families are seeing skyrocketing costs            Increasing the Child Tax Credit   Schumer s legislation provides relief to families with new babies by doubling the child tax credit to  2 000 for the first year of a child s life or in the first year after a child s adoption  To help ease the burden of childcare costs  the bill offers a tax credit to cover 35  of childcare expenses for families earning up to  75 000             Help Pay for College    In previous years  New York families have been eligible for the HOPE credit  the Lifetime Learning credit  and the tuition deduction  These provisions have provided real relief  246 000 families took advantage of the HOPE credit in 2004  shaving  338 million off their tax bills  294 000 claimed the Lifetime Learning credit  for a total of  301 million  and 326 000 New York families took the tuition deduction in 2004  deducting  868 million  Under the Schumer bill  these credits and deductions would be combined into one credit  with a maximum of  2 500 per student to help cover tuition  fees and course books        The new college credit offers two major new benefits for families  First  families with more than one child in college could now claim the credit for two students  rather than just one  Secondly  the credit will also cover students in graduate school and those in community colleges  who were not previously eligible to receive tuition deductions            AMT Relief    Families with incomes between  75 000 and  100 000 who fall into the AMT for the first time  would face a tax increase of nearly  1 000   eliminating the effects of any tax cuts received since 2001  The Middle Class Opportunity Act extends AMT relief through 2008  providing two full years of relief this year  rather than forcing Congress to go through the same exercise every year              Caring for Again Parents   Schumer said that as baby boomers become senior citizens  one of the greatest issues  and burdens  facing middle class families is the ability to pay for the care of their aging parents   Seventy percent of people between the ages of 45 and 55 have at least one living parent  and almost half of women in that age range provide some form of support to an aging parent         Right now  only families who have elderly parents living with them are eligible to claim the dependent care tax credits for expenses they face caring for elderly parents    The Schumer bill would ensure that all families who are caring for aging parents  whether they live with the family or not  would be eligible for the credit  Families caring for elderly families could save families an average of  200 per month with this credit
