                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Calls on Governor Pataki to take the lead in standing up to Bush White House  s proposal to balance budget on the back of blue state residents  Calls effort   dagger at the heart of New York      new data shows will cause giant sucking sound  taking  37 billion out of the pockets of New Yorkers  Using 1986 success as model  Schumer calls on New York business  labor  hospitals and universities to make On his way to Washington for his first Senate Finance Committee meeting on Wednesday morning  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today gave the keynote address to an Association for a Better New York breakfast  where he called for a major New York based effort to block the Bush Administration  s expected proposal to prevent some3 2 million taxpayers in New York from being able to deduct the state and local income taxes they pay on their federal income taxes    which would cost individuals in New York some  37 billion        Specifically  Schumer called on Governor Pataki to take the lead in standing up to the Bush White House on this proposal  Schumer rolled out this effort at ABNY  which led the fight against a similar attempt in 1986  and asked the ABNY members to enlist their business  labor  hospitals and university colleagues from coast to coast to make this a national crusade       Schumer will also wore a new   Moynihan style    hat recently given to him by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  s wife  Elizabeth  When Senator Moynihan was the last New Yorker on the Senate Finance Committee  he was well known for wearing his trademark Brooks Brothers tweed hats  which were purchased for him by his wife  When Schumer was named to Moynihan  s old seat on the powerful Finance Committee  his friend Mrs  Moynihan sent him a hat of his own       The prepared text of Schumer  s remarks follow       SENATOR CHARLES E  SCHUMER  Remarks at ABNY Breakfast  January 19  2005     I want to thank ABNY for inviting me here this morning        As most of you know  I am a new member of the Senate Finance Committee  We re going to face a number of important challenges on that Committee over the next few years  given President Bush s objectives to reform the tax code and remake Social Security       I m looking forward to working with all of my colleagues from both parties on the Committee  because it s where the action is going to be   and as all of you know  I like to be where the action is       I want to spend a few minutes this morning talking about an issue that is of the utmost importance to New York  That issue is the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal income tax returns       As some of you may have heard  President Bush is likely to propose repealing the deduction as a way to offset the costs of his tax reform plan  He and his advisors may be thinking that repealing the deduction is an issue of concern only to high income people in a couple of big  high tax  Democratic leaning  so called  blue  states  but they re wrong  Repealing the deduction will have a major impact on people at all levels of income  from working families of modest means to the very wealthiest people in America       It will have an impact on every states  ability to fund important social services like education   even in big  Republican leaning  red states  like Florida and Texas  which don t have an income tax but benefit from the deduction for sales taxes that was added back to the tax code just last year  So it s not just a  blue state  issue  although they would be hurt the worst   and frankly  some in Washington want it that way  In reality  it hurts the  red states   too       You may recall that nearly 20 years ago  another president proposed eliminating this deduction  Well  let me tell you straight out  even though it would have repercussions across the nation  this is a dagger aimed right at the heart of New York  It will set our state back in a number of ways            It will create a giant sucking sound as the best and brightest workers  and the most productive companies  face incentives to tear up long standing roots and move to lower tax jurisdictions  New York s economy is finally rebounding  but employment in important sectors like finance is still flat  and repealing the deduction will minimize any chance of a turnaround there            It will crush budgets at both the state and local level as officials face pressures to slash spending  which will hurt our teachers  police  and firefighters   let alone the poor  who are already squeezed as it is  You can t eliminate  37 billion in tax deductions and not have some impact on the state and local governments that pay our teachers and first responders and nurses and doctors and hospitals  It will cause a budget crisis that is far worse than what we ve experienced since 9 11            It will make it less likely that entrepreneurs will set up shop here in New York  costing many thousands of jobs down the line  because these smart people won t want to locate where taxes are rising and services are declining            It will make it even harder for the middle class families that are the lifeblood of New York to keep their homes here  as their taxes rise by 5 or 10 or 15 percent in one fell swoop  And it will also sock it to the rich  of course  particularly here in New York City  where people with incomes over  200 000 will see their federal taxes rise on average by more than 20 percent       I ll go through some more numbers in a minute  but it s pretty clear that this idea is an absolute killer for New York       We have to stop it dead in its tracks  with no compromises  and we have to start working now  I m going to talk a little bit about how to do that  and about how ABNY played such a major role in that effort back in 1985 and 1986       Most people don t know this  but the deduction for state and local taxes dates all the way back to the Revenue Act of 1913  We ve just begun the 109th Congress  and it was the 63rd Congress that added this deduction to the Code  It s not some new subsidy or preference that was recently added in a smoke filled back room in the dead of night  It s been there from the very beginning of the income tax  The Congress realized back then that a tax on a tax was inherently unfair  the pundits of the time agreed  and Democrats and Republicans alike have supported it        The  tax on a tax  theme is particularly interesting  given how conservatives in Washington are trying to reshape the tax code       Economic conservatives say that they hate  double taxation   and they wanted to eliminate the individual tax on dividends  a change that many in this room supported two years ago  They succeeded in reducing the tax rate to 15 percent  and now they want to permanently repeal the estate tax  arguing that the assets in many large estates have already been taxed       But what many conservatives today really object to are some forms of double taxation when it suits their agenda  particularly when it s related to investment income  Many in Washington now believe that any income from savings and investment shouldn t be taxed at all  leaving the entire tax burden to be borne entirely by earned income  which disproportionately hurts the middle class  from the upper middle class all the way to the working poor       Well  what about taxing labor income under both the payroll tax and the income tax  which hurts most working families  That s by far the biggest form of double taxation  yet many conservatives aren t bothered by it  and I haven t seen the President propose a deduction for payroll taxes paid       The state and local tax deduction is another example  Eliminating the deduction creates a huge tax on a tax  or  double tax   for millions of Americans  Money used to pay state and local taxes is not available to pay federal taxes  so to include those taxes in one s income creates a tax on a tax  That s double taxation  And it s why the lobbying group ABNY spearheaded to defeat this bad idea 20 years ago was called the Coalition Against Double Taxation       We should be against all forms of double taxation where it really occurs  whether the issue is dividends  payroll taxes  or the state and local deduction  We should be clear and consistent       So let me clear and consistent  Protecting the federal deduction for state and local taxes is my Number One Priority as a new member of the Finance Committee  The fight for homeland security money will be nothing compared to this fight  and I will work day and night to make sure that the Bush Administration does not succeed in eliminating a deduction that more than three million New Yorkers count on       As I said  if the president pursues this plan  New Yorkers would lose about  37 billion per year in federal tax deductions  more than any state except California  It will hurt households at all levels of income  Let s look at some examples            Consider a married couple from Staten Island with taxable income of  50 000  smack dab in the middle of the middle class  If they own a home worth  200 000  they face a property tax bill of about  1 800 and pay about  4 300 in state and city income taxes  Eliminating the deduction will cost them more than  900 in higher federal taxes            Or a family from Jamestown with  75 000 of taxable income  paying  3 200 in property taxes and about  4 000 in state income taxes  Their taxes would go up by  1 800            Or take a family in what might be called the upper middle class  Chris Hahn is my regional rep for Long Island  he lives in Setauket  His family earns about  150 000 and pays about  11 000 in property taxes and  11 300 in state income taxes  Eliminating the deduction will cost his family almost  5 600  That s a huge tax increase       New York City residents would be especially hard hit  Repealing the deduction would raise taxes for almost 700 000 City households and would cost them an additional  3 25 billion in higher taxes in 2005  an average increase of  4 700  More than half of those households have incomes below  75 000       In all  around 2 5 million New York households with incomes under  100 000 take the federal deduction for state and local taxes  On average  these folks would lose the ability to deduct a whopping  5 600 a year  For a two earner family in the 25 percent tax bracket  that s a tax increase of  1 400  In other words  eliminating this deduction would cost the average middle class family in New York 1 4 percent of its income       It also kills what might be called the working class   folks who aren t poor  but are really struggling to make ends meet here in New York  and who want to stay in our state  About 170 000 households in New York City with incomes less than  40 000 a year would see their federal taxes go up by an average of  468   an increase of more than 20 percent       So many middle income people would be hit because they have seen their home values increase  leading to higher property taxes  The fact that they can deduct this higher tax bite makes the property tax a little bit easier to swallow for the person of modest means  whose only real asset is their home  We shouldn t make it harder for these families to make ends meet       Middle class families would be hurt in another way  The value of their homes would decline as the demand for housing drops  particularly in jurisdictions like New York where deductions are so important  Most middle class families have so little income saved as it is  and their homes are their only valuable asset  We shouldn t take their savings away from them  but eliminating this deduction is tantamount to doing just that  It s wrong       But let s be fair  This proposal really socks it to the rich as well  It s not another reverse class warfare proposal that only hurts the middle class       According to an analysis in the Times  about 219 000 households in the state with incomes over  200 000 take the deduction   An income of  200 000 puts you in the top two or so percent of households nationally   These folks would lose the ability to deduct about  67 400 on average  If you re in the top tax bracket  right now 35 percent  that s a tax increase of over  23 000  That s a pretty big reason to move somewhere else       Now  the Bush Administration may decide that it s OK to raise taxes on millions of New Yorkers in order to pay for more of its tax agenda       But we can t allow it to happen  and that s why we need to remember how ABNY helped mobilize wide ranging forces 20 years ago  and how we need to join forces again  New York started on the offensive before President Reagan formally made the proposal  and we would be foolish to wait this time       As all of you know  the late Lew Rudin  who did such a magnificent job as the founder of this group  led the effort  along with civic leaders Jimmy Robinson and David Rockefeller  They helped build a coalition led by the private sector  with help from the real estate industry  labor unions  and others  The National League of Cities  the A F L  C I O   the American Federation of Teachers  the National Association of Counties  and the National Governors Association were all involved  Everyone pitched in  There was a shared understanding of how repealing the deduction would put our great City at a competitive disadvantage       ABNY s coalition turned it into a national issue  raising millions of dollars for print and broadcast ads to be run in key districts  lobbying members of the Ways and Means Committee  and commissioning an study that showed the destabilizing effect repeal would have on states across the country  I remember Governor Cuomo s eloquent testimony before Congress  and Jacob Javits  whose health was failing him at the time  getting deeply involved in the effort  I ll never forget it       Another little known fact is that it was the Governor of Arkansas  a young man named Bill Clinton  who also worked to defeat the proposal when he saw the impact it would have on some of the smaller Southern states  who were   and still are   having trouble adequately funding their schools       In the end  even though Dan Rostenkowski   the powerful Democratic Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee at the time   supported President Reagan s proposal  the coalition led by ABNY beat the Chairman on his own committee  It was a major victory that required a creative  well organized  and well funded lobbying effort       Well  my friends  we need to do the same thing again  The business community and others need to start thinking now about how we will defeat it this time       We can t wait until President Bush puts a specific proposal on the table before we swing into action  because victory will be more difficult in 2005 than it was in 1986 for several reasons  First  the President s party controls both houses of Congress  and his allies are more ideologically rigid than they were 20 years ago  Second  and potentially more important  in 1985  when President Reagan proposed an overhaul of the tax code  many major deductions were on the table  Even the biggest one  for home mortgage interest  was on the chopping block  as the Reagan Administration wanted to broaden the base and lower rates as much as possible  ABNY s coalition was able to make common cause with other groups that were defending the other provisions  and that was a key to our victory       This time  however  the state and local tax deduction stands alone  with a target on its back  The other big ones  such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions and employer provided health insurance  have already been taken off the table  The state and local deduction is the cash cow the Bush team is looking at to fund a lot of what they want to do  This will make our job a lot harder       As a result  the New York business and labor interests can t be complacent  because we have seen that this Administration is relentless when it comes to pursuing its objectives  They will stop at nothing  and neither will we  New Yorkers need to start working today make sure that the deduction stays on the books  as it has for 91 years  ABNY   as well as the other leadership groups in New York  such as the Business Partnership  the Real Estate Board  the state A F L  C I O   and many other groups   needs to help pull everyone together to replicate this effort  but they can t do it alone  I call on everyone in the state to do their part       This week  I am starting to do my part  I have called Governor Pataki  and asked him to get involved in this effort  Governor Cuomo went to the mat for us 20 years ago  and the current governor needs to do the same   even if the President is from his own party  This issue is too vital to New York for the governor   or any elected official  Democrat or Republican   to cozy up to anyone  Governor Pataki needs to get out there in a vocal way to fight for the families and businesses of this state       I spoke with Governor Pataki last night  and we had a brief  but good  preliminary conversation  I am hopeful he will rise to the challenge       I have also called Senator John Breaux  a former senator that the President respects  and who has just been named to co chair a bipartisan tax reform commission  and lobbying him to urge the president not to formally propose this change  He said he would consider doing that       But a few phone calls are not going to do the job  Every one of us has to do our share  A good place to start is the 1985 model  First  every major group in New York must mobilize   the business community  labor unions  the real estate industry  property owners  everyone  We also must have with us all of the groups that represent charitable organizations  like hospitals and the arts and the foundation sector  While these groups don t need to take the deduction  the vitality of our city will be dealt a serious blow if the deduction is repealed  and they have good reason to join our cause       Second  as was done in 1985  we will ask each of these groups to reach out to similar groups across the country  The New York Chamber should work with the Chambers from Ohio and Virginia and California and Pennsylvania  The local labor unions should join forces with parallel groups in New Jersey and Maryland and Arkansas  We must make this issue a national call to arms  It may affect New York and California most  but it will increase taxes on millions and million of taxpayers in nearly every state       And finally  we all know that large numbers of senators and representatives come to New York to raise money  We are asking every one of these groups that help Members of Congress raise money to ask each legislator who comes to New York what their position is on the issue of state and local deductibility  and take that position into account       In short  everyone needs to do everything in their power to see that this proposal to increase  double taxation  never becomes law  Just as we did in 1985  we re going to make this a national issue  and with ABNY s leadership  we re going to win       Two other quick points before I leave you  One is related       First  the individual Alternative Minimum Tax  or AMT  also affects New York dramatically because it affects how many deductions people can take  and thus it impacts a lot of people in our state  We need to address the AMT  which is trickling down to catch more and more middle class families in New York  If we fail to act  then nearly all two earner families with children with incomes over  75 000 will get snagged by the AMT by the year 2010       A family earning  75 000 or  100 000 is not a wealthy family in New York  and they shouldn t get snagged by a tax that was originally designed to make sure that wealthy people didn t completely escape the tax system  At  75 000 or  100 000 of income  you re not a wealthy person in New York  and we can t allow these middle class families to get caught in the AMT       I urge the President to work with Congress to reform and simplify the AMT  Frankly  dealing with it should be a higher priority than making all of the President s tax cuts permanent  because millions of middle class families will lose the tax cuts they ve recently received if we fail to act       Thank you very much
