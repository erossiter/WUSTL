IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 13  2005 With Over 1000 Staten Islanders Diagnosed With Blood Cancer  Schumer Announces New Life Saving Umbilical Cord Blood Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      175 000 People Nationally Diagnosed With Fatal Diseases That Cord Blood Can Treat  New Program Would Turn   Medical Waste into Medical Miracles         Senator Joined by Doctors and Patients Over the past five years  over 1000 people on Staten Island have been diagnosed with blood cancer and could be saved by an umbilical cord blood cell transplant  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today  Schumer unveiled a new sweeping federal plan to coordinate the donation of umbilical cord blood  a viable and more accessible alternative to bone marrow  Umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells  which are the building blocks of the immune system and can be used to treat a variety of life threatening diseases  Cord blood has the ability to treat the same diseases as bone marrow but can be used in more situations because its cells are less mature than marrow cells and does not require a perfect genetic match to be used in a transplant         We have an incredible opportunity to turn medical waste into medical miracles     Schumer said    Mothers bringing one new life into the world can possibly save another one by donating their umbilical cord blood  If we standardize the process  there  s no reason why nearly every healthy mother can  t donate          At least 175 000 people nationwide over the past five years have been diagnosed with fatal diseases that can be treated by a bone marrow transplant  but many die waiting for a donor match  Blood from umbilical cords  a byproduct of birth  is a rich source of hematopoietic  HEM  AT OH POE  ET IC  progenitor cells  The only other place this type of stem cell is found is in bone marrow  Transplants of the stem cells have been used to cure a variety of lethal blood diseases from leukemia to sickle cell anemia  Bone marrow donors are difficult to find for sick patients because a perfect genetic match is usually required between donor and recipient  Cord blood stem cells  however  are less mature than those in bone marrow and can be successfully used even when there is not a perfect match       About 20 public cord blood banks operate in the US  but there are no government standards to ensure that the cells are collected  processed and stored properly and the system for obtaining cord blood is fragmented  In addition  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  classifies cord blood transplantation as an experimental therapy rather than a licensed therapy  Finally  with no single registry for cord blood  searches can be tedious and even impossible       Cord blood stem cell transplants have saved the lives of roughly 20 000 Americans with fatal blood diseases  Unfortunately  thousands of patients who might benefit from these transplants die every year waiting for a bone marrow match unaware of the cord blood option  and possibly unable to access it  Experts say it offers a more effective form of therapy than stem cells derived from bone marrow       Cord blood is not being utilized to its full potential to treat life threatening diseases for several reasons  One reason is that the public does not know enough about the possibilities of cord blood treatment and its life saving potential  As a result of the lack of public awareness  cord blood donations do not occur as frequently as they could and this leads to a limited availability in the cord blood banks  Right now that number is about 50 000 units  an amount that does not give doctors enough options in finding compatible matches for patients most in need       Today Schumer introduced a new  sweeping federal umbilical cord blood program  He will            Cosponsor The Cord Blood Stem Cell Act  which would create a network of qualified cord blood banking centers to prepare  store  and distribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the treatment of patients and to support research using such cells            Increase awareness in the public as well as the medical field through education and training  Obstetricians need to be trained in the proper way to collect cord blood  and pregnant women should be informed about the option to donate to public banks before getting to the third trimester            Increase accessibility to public cord blood banks by regions that are not currently served  Each hospital should be served by at least one public cord blood bank that has an established presence at the hospital  Private cord blood banks that restrict the use of collected blood are usually the only option presented to mothers delivering babies at most hospitals across the country            Request that the FDA create a process for licensure of FDA approved cord blood banks  Schumer will recommend that the New York Blood Center  because of its prominence in the cord blood community be the first licensed cord blood bank  which would then be used as a model to set the standards for licensure for other cord blood banks            Establishing the New York Blood Center as a National Resource Center of practices and standards that other cord blood banks can utilize as a model        The bottom line is that there has always been a great deficit of bone marrow  and people find it almost impossible to find a match  By making cord blood more accessible  we  ll be able to help people who are in grave need  We have a bi partisan bill that would do just that          There are approximately 180 000 units of cord blood stored in banks across the country  The Institute of Medicine figures that 50 000 units of the 180 000 currently in inventory are usable  but at least 150 000 usable units are needed to meet demand  The problem is compatibility  which experts say is determined by six surface proteins  or HLA markers  on each cell  The more closely the markers on the donor s cells match those of the recipient  the less likely it is that the patient s body will reject the transplant  Transplant recipients  especially African and Asian minorities  are much more likely to find a compatible donor if the supply of cord blood is tripled  While cord blood has been used in pediatric transplants for several years  it is only now starting to gain traction in the adult community      In addition to patients with leukemia  cord blood is now being used to treat over 60 other fatal immune and blood diseases  These include  severe combined immune deficiency    boy in the bubble syndrome      lymphoma  adrenoleukodystrophy  Lorenzo  s Oil Disease   and Sickle Cell Anemia among others       Cord blood also offers an extraordinary amount of hope for African Americans  who have the lowest success rate of finding non related bone marrow donors  The ethnic diversity of the bone marrow registry is quite low  although African Americans make up 12  of the population  they only account for 6  of the bone marrow registry  Many African Americans also have both European and African ancestry which puts them at a disadvantage because a person with both tissue types has much more difficulty finding a match  Because of the diversity of tissue types  an African American requires three times the number of donors as a Caucasian to have the same chance of finding a match  Cord blood is a particularly good choice for this community because it doesn  t require a perfect match       Senator Schumer was joined today by Steven Sprague  a Staten Island Native who was one of the first adults to be treated with an umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant  and Dr  Charles Zaroulis  director of hematology oncology and director of the blood bank at Staten Island University Hospital  Dr  Zaroulis performs bone marrow transplants and is a longtime stem cell researcher and research advocate
