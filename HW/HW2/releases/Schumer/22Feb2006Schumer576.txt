Before Deal is Finalized   Schumer  Why Did President Not Know About Deal Until After Approval  What Lobbying Took Place  Did Anyone Raise Objections  Why Did CFIUS Not Do Review Required by Law     Schumer Pushing Bipartisan Legislation When U S  Senator Chuck Schumer sent the following letter President Bush with a list of unanswered questions that must be answered about the Dubai Ports World acquisition of six major U S  ports on the East Coast  including New York and New Jersey  This  6 8 billion deal is scheduled to be closed on March 2 and was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  last month  although the President wasn  t aware of it until after the approval  Except for cargo screening functions performed by the Department of Homeland Security  the Port operator is responsible for securing cargo coming in and out of the port  the port facility itself  and the hiring of security personnel  In light of these critical functions being transferred from a private company based in Britain to a United Arab Emirates government owned company based in Dubai  today Schumer urged the President to answer these questions fully  Yesterday Schumer announced that he and Congressman Peter King  Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee  were introducing emergency legislation to suspend the Dubai port deal       Schumer sent the President the following letter with 15 questions below      February 22  2006      President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington DC      Dear President Bush        Today your spokesperson stated that you were unaware that a foreign government was seeking to acquire shipping operations at major U S  ports until after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  had approved the deal  I trust you share my serious concerns about this deal  s potential impact on our national security  but there are still important questions that are still unanswered about the review process  the transaction and its impact on national security  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my concerns and we all want answers to these important questions        The CFIUS  s evaluation of Dubai Ports World  s takeover of Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Navigation lasted a short 23 days and was concluded without consultation of either the Congress or  apparently  your office  I believe that your Administration failed to give this transaction the throughout review it deserves and is required by law  As you know  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  is required to conduct an additional 45 day investigation in this case where a transaction would give a foreign government involvement in national security matters  That review was not done       I am also concerned that throughout this process  the Administration has relied on the CFIUS security review and private assurances and mitigation agreements between DP World and the Department of Homeland Security as the foundation for approval of the takeover  However  CFIUS and your Administration have refused to reveal the criteria used during the review or the nature of the agreements on which this deal is based  I am concerned that this pattern of secrecy permeates your Administration and this case is no different  Members of Congress and the public need more information about how CFIUS reached the conclusion that this transaction does not  in any way  compromise national security       In light of the growing concerns surrounding the takeover and skepticism about the thoroughness of the Administration  s evaluation  I respectfully ask that you release details of the CFIUS investigation  explain what security criteria were evaluated  why CFIUS did not complete the 45 day investigation  and what  if any  outside influences advocated on behalf of DP World  Specifically  please provide answers to the following questions      1  Why did this matter not come to your attention until the CFIUS review was completed   2  Why did CFIUS decide to forgo the 45 day investigation  despite a Congressional mandate to complete both the 30 day staff review and the 45 day investigation when the purchaser is owned or controlled by a foreign government    3  Did any CFIUS member  or anyone else  recommend foregoing the 45 day review   4  Has CIFUS failed to complete the 45 day investigation in any other case where a foreign government was involved in a transaction   5  Did CFIUS review DP World  s plan to prevent terrorist infiltration at their corporate headquarters or U S  facilities   6  Did CFIUS review past security assessments at DP World  s seaport assets in the US and around the world   7  Did CFIUS look in to whether there is any al Qaeda or suspected terrorist group investment in the company or the financing of the takeover   8  Did CFIUS look in to whether any DP World employee or senior management official had any involvement is past nuclear weapon smuggling operations conducted out of the United Arab Emirates   9  Did CFIUS consider the possibility of sudden regime change in the UAE or formulate a contingency plan if the Government of Dubai suddenly was taken over by radical anti American leaders   10  What assurances did CFIUS receive from the DP World that it would fully comply with U S  port security regulations   11  Did any of CFIUS  s member agencies raise initial objections to the sale and what was done to mitigate those concerns    12  According to the Department of Homeland Security  the Coast Guard is still inspecting DP World assets in the United States  Why did CFIUS not wait until that investigation was completed before approving the takeover   13  Who advocated on behalf of the Government of Dubai for approval of the deal   14  Did any members of your Administration  or former members of your Administration  advocate for approval of the deal    15  What  if any  role did David Sanborne  a former DP World Executive and current nominee to head the Maritime Administration  play in the evaluation and approval of the takeover       This matter is critical national security issue and many share my concern that CFIUS and your Administration have not completed the review necessary to thoroughly consider the security ramifications of turning over control of some of our most critical and vulnerable assets to a foreign government  I am also concerned that the continued secrecy surrounding the evaluation and approval of this transaction again represents your Administration  s reluctance to be forthcoming with Congress and the public regarding pressing national security issues       Sincerely   Charles E  Schumer   The Schumer King emergency bill will        Require the President to place a stay on DP World  s takeover of P ports         Require the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States commence an immediate 45 day investigation on the takeover  s effects on national security  The bill also requires CFIUS to coordinate with other agencies  such as the Coast Guard  and to take in to consideration past security assessments of ports operated by DP World         Require the Secretaries of Homeland Security and the Treasury to prepare a full report and brief members of Congress on their findings         Upon receiving the report  Congress would have the authority to disapprove the sale within thirty days
