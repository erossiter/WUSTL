                                    Senator Worked With IRS  Department Of Justice To Broker A Compromise For Hospital   Sheehan Memorial Hospital Plays A Vital Role In Serving The Community U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced that an agreement has been reached for a settlement plan that will allow Sheehan Memorial Hospital to emerge from bankruptcy and continue to serve the community   Schumer worked with the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  and U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to broker a compromise  The hospital has been working with the IRS to resolve issues over tax debts and penalties that have carried over from a prior period of mismanagement       Sheehan Memorial Hospital  s recovery is a success story  and now a workable deal has been reached that will allow them to stay afloat     Schumer said     Sheehan provides irreplaceable services for a vulnerable population  The hospital has been in the center of the revitalization efforts in the community and has served the inner city of Buffalo for many years   In the last eighteen months they have bounced back from difficult financial times   I was honored to help save this hospital  and I am glad there is a fair and reasonable resolution         Sheila K  Kee  President and CEO  said    On behalf of Sheehan Memorial Hospital  its 150 employees  its management team and its Board of Directors  I wish to extend to U S  Senator Chuck Schumer our sincere gratitude and deepest appreciation for the extraordinary support and assistance he and his staff have provided to Sheehan   Senator Schumer was there to provide assistance when Sheehan needed him the very most    The Schumer team is absolutely the best   The Senator and his staff should take great pride in the high level of constituent services they provide  their responsiveness and the great care and attention they provided to promoting Sheehan Memorial as a vital community asset   Sheehan Memorial Hospital has a promising and vibrant future    Senator Schumer and his team should take great pride in their role to save Sheehan and to ensure that the hospital continues to provide essential healthcare services to community residents        Sheehan Memorial Hospital is a community based  not or profit hospital  located on Buffalo  s East Side   It provides care for parts of the community that often lack medical services and have high risk factors for disease and injury   If Sheehan Memorial Hospital was forced to close  tens of thousand of Buffalo residents would have no comparable alternative for healthcare   In the past year  the center has been recognized by the Community Foundation for Greater Buffalo and the Susan G  Komen Foundation for the role it plays in improving the health status of inner city residents     Since declaring bankruptcy  the hospital has balanced its budget  promptly paid bills  and complied with the terms of their bankruptcy petition   New hospital management reports that operations have dramatically improved  annual spending has been cut by more than half since 2002  and cost containment measures have allowed for significant savings     Millions of dollars have been spend to revitalize the community surrounding Sheehan and throughout this transformation  Sheehan Memorial  s facility has served as the anchor of the neighborhood  s revitalization  The closure of Sheehan could have resulted in an abandoned building  leading to urban decay and neglect  which would seriously erode the significant investments the federal government has made in the area     The U S  Bankruptcy Court of the Western District of New York has approved Sheehan Memorial Hospital  s Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization   Sheehan filed its Chapter 11 petition with the U S  Bankruptcy Court on March 8  2004    A major challenge to Sheehan  s emergence from Chapter 11 involved the resolution of IRS debt  which had been incurred by former hospital administrations     Schumer was in constant contact with the IRS  DOJ and Sheehan throughout this process to ensure the citizens of Buffalo could continue to count on the services provided by the hospital   In June  Schumer wrote to IRS Commissioner Mark Everson  urging that he assist in resolving issues with the hospital   In October  Schumer wrote to Pat Mullarkey  Section Chief  Civil Trial Section  Northern Region of DOJ asking that he help resolve this issue in a way that would allow Sheehan to remain open
