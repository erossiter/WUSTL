                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Schumer Joined By Congresswoman Lowey  New Rochelle Mayor  Fire Commissioner  First Responders  Terrorist Attacks on London  s Mass Transit System Should be Another Wake Up Call for Commuter Rails Traveling To and From New York City   Senator Will Offer Amendment to Homeland Security Spending Bill That Would Improve Funding Streams for Rail Security  Pay For Anti explosive Detection Devices for Tra Westchester train stations and commuter rail lines are still vulnerable to terrorist attack and need federal support to bolster security efforts  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer warned today  Schumer explained that the terrorist attacks on London  s mass transit should serve as a wake up call to the federal government to tighten security on commuter rails outside New York City  With the US Department of Homeland Security  DHS  having raised the terror threat level for commuter rails  the lawmakers discussed how Metro North lines are still lacking proper security infrastructure and will require significant security upgrades         Following the attack on Madrid  s rail system  the terrible terrorist attacks in London are our second wake up call to greatly improve our rail and mass transit security here in America  It is clear that we  re not doing close to enough and must do more  The soft underbelly of buses and subways and railroads are fully exposed to similar terrorist attacks unless we take real steps to beef up mass transit security immediately     Schumer said         We have known since September 11  2001  that our homeland security efforts are a race against the clock  In light of last week s attacks in London  we must provide increased funds for rail and transit security   said Congresswoman Nita Lowey  a Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security   In addition  the Department of Homeland Security must expedite an overdue report on a national strategy for transportation security  which was due to Congress April 1st  I look forward to working with Senator Schumer to close the security gaps on our rail and transit systems          To combat the heightened threat  Schumer will offer an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would quadruple the  100 million in the bill for both mass transit and rail security  for a total of  400 million for FY 2006  The proposed amendment would also double funding for bus security improvements from  10 million to  20 million  Schumer is also including a provision in the amendment that would require DHS to devote  50 million from DHS  s science budget to develop explosive detectors for mass transit stations  rail cars  and buses       Schumer has repeatedly urged the Administration to improve rail and mass transit security  Schumer called for the federal government to accelerate the development of detectors for rail and subway stations  Currently  individual transportation systems in major U S  cities are developing their own detection devices  but Schumer said today that a coordinated effort funded by the federal government is needed to overcome the many technological barriers that face scientists and engineers working on such systems       Schumer today released the following Metro North ridership figures   Line Total Ridership in April Year to Date Ridership through April  Harlem 2 100 000 8 000 000  Hudson 1 200 000 4 500 000  New Haven 2 800 000 10 800 000  Port Jervis  105 000 408 000  Paskack  34 000 133 000   only New York State stops      Schumer is a lead sponsor of the Transportation Security Improvements Act of 2005  S 1052  109th  which would spend over  750 million over three years for rail bus security  along with billions more dollars to beef up security for all modes of transportation across the county        Schumer has also co sponsored the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  S 2884  108th   which would have given  1 billion over three years for mass transit security  including authorizations for security assessments  grants  and research and development for mass transit security technology       Finally  Schumer cosponsored legislation last Congress to allot  1 2 billion over five years for improvements to passenger and freight rail systems throughout the country  The legislation would have directed the Homeland Security Department to assess security risks to freight and passenger rail and develop recommendations for securing them  Schumer s measure would have required the U S  Department of Homeland Security to study the cost and feasibility of screening all passengers  baggage and mail that travels on Amtrak trains  and would have also required the department to conduct a pilot program to randomly screen passengers and baggage at as many as 10 rail stations
