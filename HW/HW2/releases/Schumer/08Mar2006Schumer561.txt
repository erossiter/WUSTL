                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Assistance To Firefighters Grants Fund Life Saving Equipment   Training To Departments Struggling to Stay Afloat    Schumer To Detail Plan To Restore Full Funding    Upstate NY Fire Departments Have Received  102 Million Since 2001    More Than Nearly Any Other State  Current Budget Proposal Cuts Funding Nationally By 46    Schumer to detail cuts each NY county faces  Capital Region fire departmen New York fire departments could lose out on  31 million for equipment  training  and vehicles under a new federal budget proposal  US Senator Charles E  Schumer announced today  Schumer unveiled his plan to restore full funding for Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  also known as FIRE grants  that has provided fire departments throughout New York  102 million since it began in 2001 but is now slated for severe cuts         New York  s firefighters risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe and sound     Schumer said    We must do everything we can to give them the tools they need to protect us and keep our communities safe  New York fire departments facing huge budget gaps have been able to use this program to pay for fire trucks  train their staff  and fill their equipment needs  We need to restore funding to this program and I m going to fight to make sure we do just that           At Schumer s urging  fire departments across New York have taken advantage of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  and used funds for hiring additional firefighting personnel  specialized emergency response training  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  new fire trucks  and fire prevention programs  These grants are distributed through the Department of Homeland Security  s Office of Domestic Preparedness and are a main component of the federal government  s efforts to aid local first responders        Because of its dramatic success in improving fire safety  Congress has raised the amount of money authorized for the program from  100 million for FY2001 to  950 million in FY 2006 and  1 billion in FY 2007  The program has been consistently underfunded  getting  542 million in FY 2006  This is the third year in a row that the Administration has proposed cutting the program  Last year the Administration proposed cutting to  500 million from  650 million in FY 2005  Congress restored funding to  542 million  but this still fell short of the  950 million authorized for the program in FY2006  For FY2007  Congress has authorized  1 billion for the program   707 million more than the  293 million included in the Administration  s budget proposal  The Administration  s proposal for  293 million is 46  less than last year  s appropriation of  542 million  Schumer said that if the federal government fails to fully fund the authorization  the impact of local budget crunches on fire departments in New York will be exacerbated dramatically next year  His budget  revealed that the proposed budget could impact fire departments in the state at the following levels           Capital Region fire departments could lose out on approximately  3 9 million         Central New York fire departments could lose out on approximately  3 million        Rochester Finger Lakes fire departments could lose out on approximately  3 8 million         Hudson Valley fire departments could lose out on approximately  4 8 million        North Country fire departments could lose out on approximately  4 6 million         Southern Tier fire departments could lose out on approximately  4 4 million         Western New York fire departments could lose out on approximately  6 3 million       In response  Schumer today said that he would join with Senate colleagues later this year to support an amendment to the budget that would restore the entire  1 billion to the FIRE grants program  Schumer urged the Congress and the White House to adopt this increase by sending the full  1 billion promised to fire departments by Congress    and   including approximately  31 million more to upstate New York than is in the current proposal  In fact  Senator Schumer and some of his colleagues are sending a letter to the Appropriations Committee asking for full funding of the Assistance to Firefighter Grant program        Schumer is also launching a grassroots campaign  sending petitions to every fire department in the state  asking firefighters to join his call to restore funding  Schumer today said since this is a program that puts life saving equipment in the hands of first responders  mobilizing firefighters across the state could be an effective way to show how critical these grants are to localities that need them         It  s important that Members of Congress hear directly from the men and women on the front lines     Schumer said    I hope every firefighter in the state signs this petition  We funded this bill because it can cost over  4 000 just to outfit a firefighter and up to  500 000 for a modern fire truck  People in small towns and big towns deserve the most modern firefighting equipment           Schumer helped create the original Grants to Firefighters Program  co sponsoring legislation in 2001 that led to its establishment  This program was passed with bi partisan support including Senator Chris Dodd  D CT   Senator John McCain  R AZ   Senator Susan Collins  R ME   and many others  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program was established to provide funding to career and volunteer fire departments and non affiliated emergency medical services providers to help with the rising costs of equipment  vehicles and training  However  soon after the program  s establishment  Schumer played a central role in preventing the Bush Administration from eliminating funding for the program from the 2001 budget  Schumer also co sponsored the 2004 re authorization  which set full funding levels for the program at  1 billion in FY 2007        Click here to view
