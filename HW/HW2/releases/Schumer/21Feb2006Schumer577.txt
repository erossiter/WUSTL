Schumer  Rochester Well Suited To Be National Center for Math Science Rejuvenation   Presidents of Nazareth  RIT  U of R  St  John Fisher  SUNY Geneseo  SUNY Brockport  Hobart   William Smith  Keuka Join Schumer Today With educational  business  government leaders all citing a decline in math and science proficiency  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today brought together president from colleges in the Rochester area to establish a national math and science teaching center of excellence in Rochester  The goal of the consortium is to recruit  train and retain outstanding math and science educators  and collaborate with local employers seeking personnel with extensive math or science training        Math and science education is the key to America s continued prosperity in our global economy  and Rochester can be at the center of it   Senator Schumer said  Unfortunately  more and more math and science teachers come to the profession without expertise in the subjects they teach  But Rochester is well positioned to change all this  With a number of first rate educational schools in the area  Rochester can become a national center of excellence for math science teaching and set a new national standard for global achievement        The Rochester center of excellence would serve a number of functions  including  design ways for colleges to cooperate and collaborate on math science programs  seek funding  which in many instances is more readily available for collaborative efforts  develop partnerships with local  state and national business communities  design marketing campaigns that advertise this region as the center for creative and cooperative approaches to math science initiatives       Going back to the opening of the Erie Canal  continuing with growth of Kodak  Xerox  and Bausch and Laumb into international technology companies  Rochester has been at the cutting edge of industry in the United States  Today  Rochester is still a major science and technology center and is well positioned to develop into a globally recognized leader in science based industry  Rochester was ranked 1st among 125 cities in the world for patent registration  according to the World Knowledge Competitiveness Index 2003 2004  and 1st for utility patents issues per 1 000 workers according to the New Economy Index  Rochester was ranked 5th for  overall innovation capacity  by the New Economy Index in 2001  Rochester was ranked 6th among metro areas for degrees granted in science and engineering  Rochester is 3rd in the nation number of college graduates with life and science degrees  Finally  Rochester s workforce was found to be the 7th most productive workforce in the entire country  The resources and opportunities Rochester area businesses position Rochester to be a leader in math and science education        Senator Schumer said that Rochester s strength as a center for science and technology development made it a logical choice to be the nation s center for math and science education         Science is the future and Rochester can be the science city  When they think of math and science education they should think of Rochester        Earlier  this month  Schumer joined with Republican Congressman Jim Saxton to introduce bipartisan Mathematics and Science Teaching Corps Act of 2006  MSTC   which would create a federal fellowship program to recruit  train and retain outstanding math and science teachers  The program will recruit aspiring and current teachers with strong content knowledge  and will involve approximately 20  of our nation s secondary math and science teachers  MSTC is based on a successful program in New York City called the Newton Fellowship Program  which is operated by a non profit organization called Math for America        Schumer today was joined by Dr  Daan Braveman  President  Nazareth College  Dr  Albert Simone  President  Rochester Institute of Technology  Joel Seligman  President  University of Rochester  Dr  Donald Bain  President  St  John Fisher College  Dr  Christopher Dahl  President  SUNY Geneseo  Dr  John Halstead  President  SUNY Brockport  Mark Gearan
