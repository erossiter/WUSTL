IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 26  2007 With Noisome And Noisy NYC Garbage Truck Traffic Rolling Through Skaneateles And Finger Lakes Towns  Schumer Calls On DSNY To Steer Trucks To Routes Away From Small Communities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In Order to Avoid Paying Tolls and Extra Money on Gas  Dozens of NYC Garbage Trucks Every Day Drive Along Small Roads that Cut through Skaneateles and other Finger Lakes Communities    Out of Town Garbage Trucks Lower the Quality of Life and Hurt Tourism Industry throughout Region by Creating Noise  Exuding Foul Odors and Causing Safety Hazards on the Roads    Schumer Calls on NYC s Sanitati With scores of NYC sanitation trucks driving through Finger Lakes communities everyday  harming the regions quality of life by exuding foul odors  causing safety hazards on the roads and making noise  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the NYC Department of Sanitation  DSNY  to enforce its contract with vendors and steer the trucks away from local roads that run through communities  In order to avoid paying tolls  or to save money on gas  trucks traveling from NYC to landfills in Upstate New York currently leave the larger roads that are better equipped to handle their weight and size in favor of small country roads that wind in and out of the Finger Lakes region    Schumer  who has introduced legislation in Congress to mandate that trucks hauling hazardous materials or solid waste stay on the National Highway System  called on the Commissioner of the DSNY to work with local and state authorities to route these trucks away from these small roads and communities through Central New York and the Finger Lakes   Truck drivers are circumventing the highway system  but our local communities are paying the price  Schumer said  These trucks are evading highway tolls and weigh stations  and are instead driving on neighborhood streets  taxing the roadways and diminishing the quality of life in peaceful communities  This is a very unique and growing problem in this region  and today Im calling on the Commissioner of the NYC Department of Sanitation to work with local officials so a compromise can be worked out that allows the garbage truck drivers to do their job but not at the expense of the quality of life of residents throughout the Skaneateles Region and the rest of the Finger Lakes  Every day  over 200 5 axle single trailer trucks transport solid waste from New  York City to landfills in Central New York  However  trucks can often be seen on country roads evading a toll or weigh station  In order to avoid paying tolls  or to save a few extra dollars on gas  these truck leave the larger  better kept roads that can handle their weight and size in favor of smaller country roads  While the sanitation companies save only minimal funds  it burdens local communities in terms of noise  deteriorating roads and significant safety concerns    Current contracts between the NYC Department of Sanitation and trucking agencies tend to stipulate that trucks should take routes that stay on primary highways and avoid local streets and residential areas  It also states that the contractor shall also route trucks away from environmentally sensitive areas such as parks  historic sites  and wetlands to the maximum extent possible  in conformance with all applicable federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations  However  the contract does not force the trucking companies to abide by the contract  and presently trucks have been straying away from the main highways in favor of utilizing local roads that cut through small towns and communities    Schumer and local leaders are pushing for the truck agencies to respect the spirit of the contract and to work with local authorities to use routes that wont infringe on the regions quality of life and its robust tourism industry  In addition  local residents are concerned that the giant trucks will clog and strain smaller roads that arent constructed to handle trucks of their size and cause a hazard for local drivers    Today  Schumer sent a letter to New York City Department of Sanitation Commissioner John J  Doherty urging him to work with local and state agencies to steer the garbage trucks away from these small roads and communities   Schumer has been a longtime advocate for keeping trucks away from traveling through Central New York and the Finger Lakes communities  Last year he unveiled a three point plan to keep trucks on the highway and off local roads    Schumer has been a longtime advocate for keeping trucks away from traveling through Central New York and the Finger Lakes communities  Last year he unveiled a three point plan to keep trucks on the highway and off of local roads  Earlier this year  Schumer called for permanent routes for trucks carrying hazardous materials and solid waste  Schumer is urging that Interstate 90  the Thruway  and Interstate 81 be designated as truck routes  These routes are designed to keep trucks on large highways and interstates  and off of smaller local roads  Currently  states can choose to set up truck routes  but it is not mandatory    The United States Code allows for these routes to be created  and requires the New York State Department of Transportation  NYSDOT  to work with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA  to create an appropriate routing plan  Schumers bill would also include all solid waste transported over 200 miles in these routes  Such routes are already in place in states including New  Jersey  Ohio  Pennsylvania and Maryland  This would keep trucks off of smaller roads and on larger highways built for handling large trucks   Over 1 9 million trucks travel through Central New York every year carrying freight  but many drive on local roads as a shortcut and to avoid weigh stations  tolls and traffic  Throughout the past few years  there have been numerous accidents spilling fuel  garbage and chemicals  all posing a potential threat to the Onondaga County watershed and surrounding neighborhoods  In addition  the trucks disrupt communities at all hours of the day and night
