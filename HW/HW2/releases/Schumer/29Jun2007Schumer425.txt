                                Senators Worked Closely With Committee To Include  290 5 Million Funding In Spending Bill   Funding will go toward the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  National Synchotron Light Source II  Center for Functional Nanomaterials and the National Synchotron Light Source    Bill will now be sent to the Senate Floor                                                                         U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee approved  290 5 million in funding for the national and international user facilities at the Brookhaven National Laboratory  The funds will go toward the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC   National Synchotron Light Source II  NSLS II   Center for Functional Nanomaterials and National Synchotron Light Sourc  NSLS  programs at Brookhaven under the FY08 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill  The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor for approval   For over fifty years  Brookhaven National Laboratory has produced cutting edge scientific work that benefits all Americans and brings jobs and economic vitality to Long Island  said Schumer  These new funds will allow Brookhaven to continue to push the barriers of scientific knowledge and will keep Long Island a thriving center of innovation   After years of fighting the Administration to fully fund Brookhaven National Labs I am pleased that our Senate colleagues have once again seen the incredible value in their work  Brookhaven National Labs have continually proven their invaluable worth to the scientific community and to Long Islands economy and I am very pleased that we can continue to support them in this way  Senator Clinton said  This is a facility of national and international significance that deserves our support and we will keep fighting to ensure that it gets the funding it needs   Brookhaven National Laboratory  established in 1947 and located in Upton  Long Island  is operated by Brookhaven Science Associates for the United States Department of Energy  Brookhavens staff of over 3 000 scientists  engineers and technicians specializes in nuclear physics research and has received numerous Nobel Prizes for their groundbreaking work   All of the funds approved for Brookhaven National Laboratories come through the Department of Energy  and include money for the   The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider   162 1 million in funding will go toward RHIC in order to provide at least 30 weeks of operating time for optimum benefit for the physics research output  as well as research and construction upgrades  DOE has invested over  1 billion in RHIC  which began operating in 2000 and has already contributed significant discoveries to the scientific community   National Synchotron Light Source II  NSLS II    65 million in funding will be used for research  planning  engineering and design construction costs for the NSLA II  Design and research began this year  and the new facility is set to be operational in 2013  This scientific user facility is expected to reinforce U S  scientific leadership  giving researchers a competitive advantage in numerous scientific fields that will benefit our nations economy   National Synchotron Light Source  NSLS    43 5 million in funding will go towards operating costs for the NSLS  When the U S  Department of Energy s Office of Basic Energy Sciences recognized the need for second generation electron synchrotrons dedicated to the production of light  it budgeted construction funding for Brookhaven s National Synchrotron Light Source  NSLS   beginning in fiscal year 1978  Ground was broken for the NSLS on September 28  1978  and the vacuum ultraviolet  VUV  ring began operations in late 1982  while the x ray ring was commissioned in 1984   Center for Functional Nanomaterials   19 9 million in funding will go toward for operations costs for the Center  The Center provides state of the art capabilities for the fabrication and study of nanoscale materials  with an emphasis on atomic level tailoring to achieve desired properties and functions  The CFN is one of five nanoscale science research centers funded by the Department of Energys Office of Science   Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee  it will be sent to the Senate floor  Following approval by the Senate  the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature
