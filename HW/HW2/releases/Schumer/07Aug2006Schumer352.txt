IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 7  2006 Mayor Bloomberg And Senator Schumer Call For Phase II Expansion Of Jacob K  Javits Convention Center To Begin At Same Time As Phase I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg and U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called for the construction of Phase II of the expansion of the Jacob K  Javits Convention Center to begin at the same time as work begins on Phase I later this year  The City today announced its commitment to dedicate a third of the project cost for the expansion  which is estimated to cost approximately  600 million in total  The Mayor and Senator stressed that if action is taken quickly  Phase II designs could be implemented into Phase I plans without delaying construction that is slated to start later this year         Last month  I hailed the approval of the expansion of the Jacob K  Javits Convention Center  which was the result of an extraordinary partnership between all levels of government and the private sector  led by the hospitality industry     said Mayor Bloomberg    That partnership is allowing us to move forward with a project that will mean thousands of jobs in the building  construction and hospitality industries    jobs for New Yorkers that need them  But why delay Phase II of the project and wait for costs to increase  Now is the time to act and move forward with both Phases I and II simultaneously so that New York City will have a convention center worthy of the world  s greatest city  An expanded Javits not only will generate tens of million in new annual tax revenue but it will double the current size of Javits and provide the City with the ability to host many more conventions  trade shows  exhibitions and special events  sending a resounding message that New York City is open for new business  I urge everyone to join Senator Schumer and me to make both phases of the expansion happen together            New York City needs a convention center that can host the biggest  most lucrative trade shows and conventions     said Senator Schumer    Building Phase II now will help create thousands of new  permanent jobs and secure the future of our tourism industry by developing a convention center that will bring millions of new dollars to local hotels  restaurants  theatres and businesses  Everyone will benefit from this expansion  Millions in tax revenue will be raised by the City and State  thousands of new jobs will be created for New Yorkers and the demand for hotel rooms will never be higher  The cost of this new convention center is a small price to pay for the economic health of New York        Last week  the Javits Center expansion cleared its final regulatory hurdle when the Public Authorities Control Board voted to approve a Phase I plan that will nearly double the size of the facility  adding 520 000 square feet of new exhibition  meeting room and banquet space      Preliminary plans for the Phase II expansion have been created by the Javits Center  s design team  Highlights of the plan include the addition of approximately 300 000 square feet of exhibit space plus additional meeting room space in order to complete the upper  third exhibit level  level 6  southward to 34th Street  This new space would bring the total exhibition space to 1 4 million square feet  putting the Javits Center among the top tier of convention centers in the United States  This expansion would also give the Javits Center two exhibition halls with more than a half million contiguous square feet and nearly 40 foot ceilings  This equally sized  prime contiguous space is the type of space most prized by convention center operators and organizers      The Mayor and Senator also called for Phase II plans to include improvements to the western fa    ade of the Javits center along 12th Avenue  These improvements will orient the Javits Center towards the west  improving the way in which the facility relates to the Hudson River Park when it is completed  Making the Javits accessible from this   back side    will create the possibility for a future western expansion of Javits that could include new facilities on Pier 76 on the Hudson River  consistent with the Hudson River Park Trust Act      The current cost of a Phase I expansion is  1 68 billion  The project is being paid for through contributions from New York State  New York City  a dedicated hotel key surcharge of  1 50 per night  and the sale of publicly owned property  The preliminary cost estimate for the Phase II expansion is roughly  600 million  The Mayor and Senator stressed that executing Phase II now would limit increased costs and operational disruptions to Javits in the future   Phase I is scheduled to be completed in 2010 and this additional work would add only limited construction time  while preventing the costly disruptions that a Phase II expansion would pose if begun later
