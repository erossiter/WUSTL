                                     New York Blood Center Issues Region wide Warning and Hospitals Feel Impact As Donations Come Up 2 500 Units Short So Far in September                                                                                                        Schumer  Who Donated Blood This Month  Urges Federal  State  and Local Governments to Give Comp Time for Workers Who Donate Blood and Kick start Statewide With blood in short supply should an emergency occur  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that donations to the New York Blood Center  the primary blood collector for New York City  Long Island  and New Jersey  came up 25 percent short of needed levels during the first 10 days of September  The blood center had expected to take in 10 000 units during the period  but only collected 7 500  Last week  New York Blood Center declared a blood emergency as the current shortfall came on the heels of a summer when donations were already 30 percent behind goals  Today  Schumer called on state  federal and local governments and businesses to start granting comp time this week to employees who donate blood to help replenish depleted supplies         The bottom line is the life blood of the City may well be drying up     Schumer said    We all want to make sure there is a steady  safe supply of blood available for whenever we need it  When the supply of blood is low  it threatens basic patient safety and the public health  The good news is  it is very easy to get our supply back to normal levels and if we all do our small part  we  ll be fine          From September 1st to September 10th  blood donations to New York Blood Center from the New York City metro area were 25 percent less than was required to meet needs  with the center only taking in 7 500 units of blood instead of 10 000   The week before the center only took in 4 500 units  28 percent less than the 6 500 needed  Schumer said the gaps were particularly disconcerting because blood centers usually see a spike in donations after the Labor Day holiday when people come back from vacation         Here is how the shortfall affected the five boroughs        Manhattan was the hardest hit in the City   Donations in Manhattan fell 30 percent short in the first 10 days of September  with only 1 300 units coming in instead of the 2 000 needed          On Long Island and Queens  donations were 33 percent behind  with the center taking in 2 500 units instead of the 4 000 needed         In the Hudson Valley Bronx area  donations were 11 percent behind the goal  with the center taking in 1 700 units instead of 2 000         On Staten Island and in Brooklyn  donations were 4 percent behind        Schumer said these donation shortfalls were staggering given the everyday needs for blood and the possibility of an emergency  According to the center  treatment of a trauma could require at least 50 units of blood   A severe burn victim typically needs at least 20 units of blood       Last week  New York Blood Center declared a blood emergency for the New York City metro area and issued an urgent appeal for donors  In response to that call and to honor a commitment he made to the myGoodDeed foundation  an organization that encourages New Yorkers to do a good deed to commemorate the 9 11 attacks  Schumer donated blood at New York Blood Center  s headquarters in Manhattan       In response to the critical blood shortage and to help the center drum up donations quickly  Schumer urged Governor Pataki to offer comp time to state employees who donate blood during the workday  and called on local businesses to follow suit in an effort to encourage a culture of donation        In addition  Schumer unveiled a comprehensive plan to significantly ramp up federal efforts to increase the blood supply in New York and in the nation  Specifically  Schumer wrote to U S  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O  Leavitt urging him to immediately allocate  10 million to be used for a widespread campaign to promote blood donation  including public service announcements  subway  bus  and commuter rail posters  newspaper ads and billboards  and deploy 10 new mobile donating vehicles to make donating blood as convenient as possible        Schumer also asked Secretary Leavitt to promote efforts to increase donation in the workplace such as its Workplace Partnership for Life program  whose participants educate their employees on the importance of and ways to donate blood and other tissues  by   a  recruiting federal and state employers to participate   b  urging participants to host a minimum of one blood drive per year  and  c  encouraging participants to offer comp time to employees who donate blood        Lastly  Schumer issued a personal appeal to all eligible New Yorkers to take time out to give blood  Anyone 17 years or older  weighing at least 110 pounds  and in general good health may be eligible to donate blood  In New York State  16 year olds may donate blood provided they bring an original  signed New York State Informed Parental Consent form  All current eligible and new donors are strongly urged to call 1 800 933 BLOOD or www nybloodcenter org  as soon as possible to schedule an appointment to donate blood
