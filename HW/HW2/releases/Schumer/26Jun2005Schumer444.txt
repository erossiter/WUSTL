IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 26  2005 Schumer  Drunken Teenager  s Air Escapade Reveals New York Airspace Rules Still Leave City At Risk To Terrorism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   New York Air Traffic Controllers Still Do Not Require Flight Plans for Planes that Fly Below 2000 Feet and Has No Way of Monitoring Them      Senator Calls on FAA DHS to Beef up Security Protocol for General Aviation      Schumer    If a Drunken 20 Year Old Can Steal Planes for Joy Rides Undetected  Imagine the Harm a Terrorist Could Inflict Upon Us     Earlier this week  a drunk 20 year old stole a small plane in Connecticut and went for a joyride with two friends for three hours before landing the plane at Westchester County Airport  exposing a serious vulnerability in aviation security  Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that despite the efforts to upgrade the nation  s commercial air security after 9 11  general aviation rules for small planes and helicopters traveling over New York City have not been significantly upgraded over the last ten years  This leaves gaps in the city  s security and leaves security officials and air traffic controllers with no real way of knowing for sure if a plane or helicopter has veered off course and is heading to a potential terrorist target   a sharp contrast to upgrades that have been successfully implemented in Washington  DC       Today Schumer asked that the Federal Aviation Administration tighten security measures for general aviation  Schumer also called on Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff to revise  update and implement outdated security rules governing small general aviation airports         There  s an old saying that   forewarned is forearmed    and that  s exactly why we haven  t suffered any major foreign terrorist attacks on US soil since 9 11   because we found out in time to stop them     Schumer said    The fact that we operate the same way that we did 10 years ago  and that we don  t give Air Traffic Controllers the tools they need to know if a private plane veers off course and is headed to a terrorist target  boggles the mind          Aviation regulations in the United States generally divide the airspace above populated land into two halves    that above 2 000 feet and that below 2 000 feet  The airspace above 2 000 feet is tightly controlled with all aircraft having to file detailed flight plans before takeoff and requirements they have functioning transponders in use that broadcast a signal so authorities can identify each aircraft  Under 2 000 feet  neither of these rules is in place  even for larger private planes like a Gulfstream V  which can weigh as much as 91 000 pounds  approximately the same weight as a DC 6 airliner       Despite the efforts to upgrade the nation s commercial air security after 9 11  General Aviation rules which apply to private planes and helicopters traveling over New York City have not been significantly upgraded over the last ten years  Over most of the city  all that a pilot has to do as long he or she stays below 2 000 feet is obtain routine permission from air traffic controllers   Under this routine  which is called   Route Permission     a pilot only has to radio ground control as he or she approaches New York City and relay the intent to travel over the area  No detailed flight plans are required  Because Air Traffic Control does not actively monitor small planes as they fly over New York City  they are unable to easily determine if a pilot has left his or her course as part of a deliberate attack on a building  a bridge  or an area with a high density of people in it       Today Schumer noted that unlike New York City  the airspace over Washington  DC is closed to most General Aviation  On May 11  a single engine Cessna carrying two Pennsylvania men violated the airspace restriction in Washington DC effectively shutting down all three branches of the Federal government  Their plane was immediately intercepted by a Homeland Security Black Hawk helicopter and three jets  Schumer does not propose closing New York City to general aviation  but questioned today whether there would have been such an immediate response had an unidentified plane headed toward a major landmark in New York City       Last year during the Republican National Convention the FAA had plans to tighten the rules and procedures in New York for general aviation  at that time  Schumer called on the FAA to make those new rules and procedures permanent  Today  nearly one year after Schumer  s original call for more stringent security monitoring  he renewed his call for federal officials to make critical changes in the security infrastructure         Another year of inaction is simply unacceptable  If there is one thing we learned this week it  s that we are still very vulnerable     Schumer said       Schumer  s suggestions include      Require low flying aircraft to submit a flight plan to the FAA before entering NYC airspace  As detailed above  General Aviation and helicopter flights currently need only radio Air Traffic Control before they enter New York City and maintain transponder contact with the ground      Create a   frequent flyer    permanent waiver for known pilots and aircraft like news and traffic helicopters  Schumer said a new waiver system has to be developed to allow commercial pilots who regularly fly over the City as often as several times a day for purposes like news or traffic reporting  sightseeing tours  or passenger charter flights to do their jobs      Close the Hudson River approach permanently  After September 11  the FAA closed an approach over the Hudson River where general aviation low flying aircraft could fly into New York without contact with local controllers  This route has since been reopened  Schumer called on the FAA to keep it permanently closed      Tighten Security at small general aviation airports  Specifically Schumer asked Chertoff to impose regulations requiring double locks  closed circuit TV cameras  and perimeter fencing at all major general aviation airports       According to the GAO  general aviation accounts for three quarters of all aircraft that take off and land in the US  There are 19 000 general aviation airports nationwide
