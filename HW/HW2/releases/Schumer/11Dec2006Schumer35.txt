Able to Use the Tax Ded With the cost of college tuition skyrocketing across New York  s five boroughs  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that a two year extension of the Schumer authored   College Tuition Tax Deduction    was approved by the Senate early Saturday morning  Schumer said this tax deduction is needed now more than ever as college tuition costs have skyrocketed across New York City  The college tuition tax deduction  which expired at the beginning of this year  saves middle class families across the country and here in New York City thousands of dollars every year by allowing them to deduct up to  4 000 in college tuition expenses from their taxes  In October  Schumer personally lobbied outgoing  Majority Leader Senator Bill Frist to bring legislation to extend the tax deduction to the Senate floor during the current lame duck session         A college education is a necessity that s become priced as a luxury   and it s breaking the bank for students and their families across our city  s five boroughs     said Senator Schumer    From Kew Gardens to Carroll Gardens  from Riverside to Riverdale  hard working New York parents are saddled with mounting debts and second mortgages just to meet spiraling tuition costs  That translates into lost family vacations to Jones Beach  passing up Mets and Yankees games  and the much more difficult decisions on how many children can attend school  The college tuition tax deduction makes these choices a little easier by saving families thousands of dollars every year          The college tuition tax deduction  passed into law in 2001 and based on bi partisan legislation written by Schumer  originally allowed middle income families to deduct  3 000 from their tax return   The tax deduction was raised to  4 000 a year in 2004  Last year  single filers who made up to  65 000 a year and married couples with incomes up to  130 000 qualified for the tuition deduction  There was also a smaller   2 000 tax deduction for those who earned more  According to the Internal Revenue Service  in 2003  3 6 million families took advantage of the tax deduction  saving them about  4 5 billion      However  in May  language extending the tax deduction for another three years was eliminated from the tax reconciliation bill in favor of restoring  5 billion worth of tax breaks of the major oil companies  In legislation passed early Saturday morning  Congress renewed the lapsed tax deduction for 2006 and extended it through the end of 2007   So come tax time in April  families can rest assured that they will be able to take a deduction on this year  s tuition expenses       In New York  238 000 families took advantage of the college tuition tax deduction in 2003  According to the National Center for Education Statistics  between the 2000 2001 school year and the 2004 2005 school year  the average price of going to a 4 year public college including tuition  fees  and room and board in NY increased by 21   rising from  10 254 in 2001 to  12 441 in 2005  The average price of a 4 year private college including tuition  fees  and room and board in NY increased by 23   rising from  25 171 in 2001 to  30 907 in 2005       This past October  Senator Schumer released a new report showing that  since the 2000 2001 school year  the price of going to college in New York City has risen 31   Below are statistics for the increase in college tuition in New York City from the 2000 2001 school year to the 2005 2006 school year                      In New York City  95 013

going to college in Queens is up 25 percent  rising from  6 218 in 2001 to  7 802 in 2006            Schumer is also the author of the bi partisan   Make College Affordable Act     S  759  which would increase the maximum amount of tuition costs that can be deducted to  12 000 each year  In addition  the bill would help college graduates pay off their loans by offering a tax credit of up to  1 500 for interest paid on student loans over the first five years of repayment  The full credit would apply to single filers with incomes up to  50 000 and joint filers with incomes up to  100 000  The legislation would still allow parents to choose Hope Scholarships instead of the tax deduction  based on which works best for them
