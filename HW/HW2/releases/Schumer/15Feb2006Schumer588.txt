                                     In Recently Passed Budget Bill  Student Loans Interest Rates and Fees Increased While Subsidies Reduced   Schumer Study Shows New Budget Proposals to Eliminate Perkins Loans  Freeze Pell Grants Would Have Dramatic Impact on Upstate New York  s College Students   Senator Pledges To Prevent Largest Cuts In Higher Education Ever From Becoming Law    Schumer to Release Perkins Loans Recipients In Each Region With over one million college students in New York  U S  Senator Charles Schumer  today detailed the impact of the largest cuts ever in higher education and announced a bipartisan effort to restore all federal funding  Schumer revealed how the current budget proposal eliminates Perkins Loans and freezes the maximum Pell grant at  4 050    all on top of the cuts in the recently passed Budget Reconciliation bill  which hikes some interest rates by up to 2 4  over current levels          These are the largest cuts to higher education in our history     Schumer said    As tuition continues to skyrocket out of control  we should be helping families afford college  not making it harder  These changes will place college out of reach for more and more New Yorkers  That  s why we  re going to fight tooth and nail to protect the grants and loans which are not only make college affordable  they make it accessible           Tuition and fees increased in 2005 06 at an average rate of 7 1  for public institutions and 5 9  at private four year colleges  Increased tuition at both private and public colleges and universities has resulted in college costs becoming increasingly unaffordable  and thus has caused an increased reliance on loans and other forms of student aid  As the federal government slashes student loans  the amplified reliance on student aid is poorly timed       Student Loan Interest Rates Hike  In last year  s Budget Reconciliation Bill  which passed February 2nd  student loans became even more difficult to repay  The bill slashed student loan programs by  12 7 billion for the next five years  and increased interest rates on college loans for both students and their families  Specifically  the bill sets a fixed interest rate for Stafford loans at 6 5   a hike from the current variable interest rates of 4 7  for current college students and 5 3  for graduates  The fixed 6 5  interest rate for new Stafford loans will go into effect on July 1  2006  This interest rate hike will affect over 9 million borrowers nationwide        Additionally  the bill increases the interest rate for the Parent Loans for Undergraduate Student  PLUS  program to 8 5   a 2 4  spike from the current rate of 6 1 percent  Today there are 888 000 outstanding PLUS loans nationwide  providing an average loan of  9 416  Federal education loans are an important contributor to college affordability   providing 47 percent of student aid  With the increased interest rates for federal loans mandated by the Budget Reconciliation  more students will turn to less flexible  private student loans  and even more devastatingly  will choose not to go to college        Freezing Pell Grants  For more than thirty years  Federal Pell grants have served as the foundation for undergraduate student aid  Unlike student loans  Pell grants do not have to be repaid  and students may use their grants at any one of approximately 6 000 participating postsecondary institutions  In the 2004 2005 school year  Pell grants served 5 3 million students nationwide and 380 000 students in New York State  Pell grant eligibility and the grant amount awarded depend on family income  the cost of attending the institution  whether the student attends full time or part time  and whether the student attends for a full academic year or less  For the 2004 2005 school year  the highest household income eligible for Pell grants was about  70 000  but approximately 90  of Pell grant recipients come from household incomes of  35 000 or less        In the 2005 2006 academic year  average tuition and fees at a public college increased 7 1  from the 2004 2005 academic year  tuition and fees were 7 1  higher than the year before at the average public college  and 5 9  higher at the average private college  Pell grant maximums  however  have not increased to reflect the increasing cost of tuition since the 2002 2003 academic year  In the Fiscal Year 2007 budget  the Administration proposes to keep the maximum Pell grant level at  4 050 for the fifth year in a row        Eliminating Perkins Loans  Perkins loans provide a unique opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students to obtain a low interest loan through their educational institutions  Depending on when a student applies  his level of need  and the funding level of the school  a student can borrow up to  4 000 for each year of undergraduate study  up to  20 000 total  and  6 000 for each year of graduate or professional study  up to  40 000 total   The interest rates for these loans are set at a low 5   graduates have up to ten years to repay the loans  and the loans can be forgiven if a graduate chooses a public service profession such as nursing or law enforcement        The budget proposal not only eliminates all federal contributions to the Perkins Loans programs  it also rescinds the  7 billion the federal government has given to educational institutions to provide Perkins Loans  canceling all future forgiveness programs  Cutting Perkins loans would leave 62 000 New York students without this critical part of student aid        Schumer today released a  breakdown of Upstate New York recipients of Pell Grants and Perkins Loans for a total of over176 000  and 42 000 respectively statewide             5 820 students at Capital Region colleges took out Perkins loans that would be eliminated under the FY 2007 Administration budget proposal  17 124 students received Pell grants that would be frozen at  4 050 per year despite the rapidly escalating cost of college tuition             5 666 students at Central New York colleges took out Perkins loans that would be eliminated under the FY 2007 Administration budget proposal  20 614 students received Pell grants that would be frozen at  4 050 per year despite the rapidly escalating cost of college tuition             5 420 students at Hudson Valley colleges and universities took out Perkins loans that would be eliminated under the FY 2007 Administration budget proposal  35 695 students received Pell grants that would be frozen at  4 050 per year despite the rapidly escalating cost of college tuition             8 239 students at Rochester Finger Lakes colleges took out Perkins loans that would be eliminated under the FY 2007 Administration budget proposal  36 961 students received Pell grants that would be frozen at  4 050 per year despite the rapidly escalating cost of college tuition             1 445 students at North Country colleges took out Perkins loans that would be eliminated under the FY 2007 Administration budget proposal  14 067 students received Pell grants that would be frozen at  4 050 per year despite the rapidly escalating

Pell grants that would be frozen at  4 050 per year despite the rapidly escalating cost of college tuition            6 610 students at Western New York colleges took out Perkins loans that would be eliminated under the FY 2007 Administration budget proposal  29 690 students received Pell grants that would be frozen at  4 050 per year despite the rapidly escalating cost of college tuition        In response  Senator Schumer announced today that he  as part of a bipartisan coalition  will launch efforts to restore funding to these vital education programs  As the Senate Budget Committee prepares to draft its response to the President  s budget and lay out a roadmap for the Senate  s Appropriations bills  Schumer sent a letter to the Committee Chairman urging him to restore funding to the Pell Grant and Perkins Loan Programs  If Schumer  s efforts are unsuccessful  he will partner with his colleagues once more to submit an amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution that would restore funding to the programs  Such an amendment passed the Senate last year by a vote of 51 49  successfully averting dangerous budget cuts for Fiscal Year 2006  Specifically  last year Schumer worked with Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA   Susan Collins  R ME  and others to prevent the elimination of the Perkins Loans program  and restored other funding for higher education assistance  This year  Schumer plans a similar effort  especially in light of the hike on student loan interest rates       Click here to view
