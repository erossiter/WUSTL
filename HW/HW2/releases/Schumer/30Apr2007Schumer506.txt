                                 With Summer Beach Season Fast Approaching  Schumer  Levy  Bellone   Press for Prompt Fed Aid   With Massive Nor Easter Hammering Long Island Coastline  Suffolk and Nassau Counties Suffered Major Erosion  Flooding  Damage to Homes and Businesses   Schumer Pledges to Push for FEMA Aid for Municipalities  Homeowners and Businesses Damaged by Storm and for Beach Erosion               Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy and Babylon Town Supervisor Steve Bellone toured storm hammered areas in Gilgo Beach in the Town of Babylon to assess the damage and discuss the recovery efforts from the destructive Nor easter  and this weekend s storms  The storms caused over  26 million in damage in Suffolk County  including significant erosion  flooding  and harm to homes  businesses  and infrastructure  In an effort to ensure that Long Islanders get the help they need  Schumer called on the President to immediately issue a disaster declaration to release all available assistance to residents and communities        Long Island s beaches were blasted by last week s devastating nor easter  The massive amount of wind and rain caused significant erosion along the South Shore in parks and beaches like Gilgo  as well as major flooding and damage to Suffolk and Nassau homes  businesses  roads  and infrastructure  Indeed  they are just beginning the recovery process for what emergency responders estimate to be over  26 million in damage in the towns and villages of Suffolk County   Schumer said   With beach season just around the corner  FEMA needs to come through with aid fast to ensure these communities can get back on their feet and avoid potential catastrophe when the next storm comes   Over the long term  I will continue to work with County Executive Levy and Supervisor Bellone in securing federal funds to dredge nearby inlets  replenish the sand  and to better protect the beaches and communities        The Nor easter of April 15 is estimated to have caused over  26 million in damage throughout Suffolk County  impacting beaches  dunes  homes  businesses  roads  and infrastructure  Babylon officials said many town beaches have lost up to 100 feet annually in the last five years because of erosion  and this storm made the situation even worse  Some of the dunes that guard nearby Ocean Parkway from the surf of the Atlantic Ocean were lost  Debris and tidewater that breached the dunes during the storm sat a mere 15 feet from Ocean Parkway  Without immediate remediation  another major storm could threaten the integrity of Ocean Parkway and destroy Gilgo Beach  a major commuter highway with sewer pipes running through it       Cupsogue Beach County Park in Westhampton was hit with over  5 million in damage while millions more in damage affected Smith Point County Park in Shirley  Major erosion and flooding also occurred at places like Captree State Park  Heckscher State Park  Caumsett State Park  Orient Beach  and Montauk Point  The storm led to the partial collapse of a road at Orient Point State Park       Homes in Davis Park in Fire Island were left wobbling over the sea after high tides consumed the sand beneath them  High storm tides battered away 30 feet of protective dune that once guarded wooden pilings beneath a dozen homes in the small community  leaving some at risk of collapse  The waves decimated decks  stairways  and cesspools  In other parks of Fire Island  water stood in the streets of the business area and residential blocks of Ocean Beach  According to the Town of Babylon  homes and businesses south of Montauk Highway encountered significant damage  On the East End  towns like Southold heard from homeowners with flooded basements       Long Island was also plagued by flooding  especially in communities like Copiague  Amityville  Lindenhurst  Lake Ronkonkoma  and Babylon  Rain totals ranged from 1 5 inches to close to 4 inches  Across Long Island  almost 18 500 LIPA customers experienced power outages        Damage estimates have far surpassed the eligibility threshold for federal assistance in this area   said Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy   We have been working closely with Senator Schumer and other federal and state officials  who are lobbying for a Presidential declaration to make our county eligible for reimbursement        Levy worked closely with Senator Schumer and Congressman Tim Bishop earlier in the year to complete a  4 5 million beach replenishment project at Smith Point that had become entangled in a dispute over particulars between the county and federal and state permitting agencies  Failure to complete the project  which ultimately pumped 225 000 cubic yards of sand onto the beach at two locations just two days before the storm hit  would have left Smith Point vulnerable         Thankfully  the replenishment project did its job and  despite the loss of some sand  saved Smith Point beach for people to enjoy this summer   Levy noted          We are very grateful to Senator Schumer for his success in securing desperately needed funding for the dredging of the Fire Island Inlet   said Babylon Town Supervisor Steve Bellone   It has been more than four years since the inlet has been dredged  threatening the integrity of the barrier island  The Nor easter reminded us how vulnerable we are in the Town of Babylon  I thank Senator Schumer for his efforts to get FEMA money to help our community recover from the storm        Governor Eliot Spitzer wrote to President Bush and FEMA Director R  David Paulison to request federal assistance   He requested that President Bush issue a major disaster declaration for Long Island  New York City and Westchester  Orange  Albany  Columbia  Dutchess  Greene  Nassau  Putnam  Rockland  Schoharie  Suffolk and Ulster counties   This request must now be approved by the President before federal aid is released       Since the Nor easter  Schumer has pressed the President and FEMA for the prompt release of emergency aid  On April 16th  Schumer wrote to FEMA supporting Spitzer s request for assistance with completing damage assessments  urging FEMA to help complete the preliminary damage assessments as soon as possible  On April 18th  Schumer wrote to President Bush and FEMA supporting Spitzer s request for a major disaster declaration and corresponding federal assistance  On April 26th  following the promise of aid to individuals in Orange  Westchester and Rockland Counties  Schumer pressed the President and FEMA to immediately approve the pending aid requests  Finally  on April 27th  Schumer called FEMA Director Paulison to urge immediate approval         He is working with Levy and Bellone in securing funds from FEMA s Public Assistance program in which money is given to municipalities to cover the costs of erosion  overtime  trucking  and so forth  They are also pushing for funds from FEMA s Individual Assistance program which will send money directly to homeowners and business owners for repairs and storm damaged needs  and for post disaster aid for businesses through the Small Business Administration       If the disaster declaration is approved by the President  federal aid will be released to local governments  individuals and businesses that are eligible  FEMA teams will be deployed to help with the application process
