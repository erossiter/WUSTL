confirmation process experience with Justices Roberts and Alito  most  significantly that he believes any future nominees record must be given much  more careful consideration  and must be weighted with more importance than the  confirmation hearing itself  Schumer pledged to reverse the presumption of  confirmation on any future nominations by President Bush  saying that he would  place the burden of proof on the nominees themselves     The full text of the speech  as prepared for delivery   appears below     Senator Charles E  Schumer   Keynote Address to the American  Constitution Society  July 27   2007  I want to speak to you today about our most recent  Supreme Court appointees  Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice  Samuel Alito  I had the privilege to take part in their confirmation hearings   and I did my best to perform my solemn constitutional duty to assess their  fitness to take their seats on the high court   I did my best to ascertain their legal philosophies and  judicial ideologies with careful questioning  as did my colleagues  Neither of  them was particularly forthright in answering my questions  and I therefore  could not in good conscience vote to confirm either of  them   This afternoon  I want to address three questions that  arise from the experience of the Roberts and Alito  confirmations   Question One  Were we  duped   Question Two  What  lessons should we draw from the process that led to the confirmation of Roberts  and Alito   Question Three  How  should we apply those lessons to the next nomination to the High  Court   Question One  Were we  duped   Let me go to the first question  Were we  hoodwinked   Although I did not in the end support Judge Roberts  he  garnered an impressive 22 Democratic votes  and I anguished for days before  ultimately voting nay  Although Judge Alito managed to win far fewer votes than  Roberts  there was no serious effort to block him and he  too  was easily  elevated to the High Court    So the question comes  Were we too easily impressed with  the charm of nominee Roberts and the erudition of nominee Alito  Did we  mistakenly vote our hopes when our fears were more than justified from the  ultra conservative records of these two men  Were Senators too quick to credit  these nominees solemn salutes to modesty and stability and incrementalism  Were  we sold a bill of goods by two hyper smart and well coached nominees who  artfully exploited a confirmation process ill suited to lay bare their genuine  judicial philosophy   Based on the record of the last Supreme Court term   sadly  the answer to each of these questions is  yes   Recall the confirmation hearings and the assurances  given  First  we were promised an era of gentility and consensus if the affable  John Roberts were confirmed as Chief Justice  Roberts portrayed himselfto use a  term weve heard beforeas a uniter rather than a divider  He would be the  consummate Chief  we were told  because he understood the importance of  respecting the other Justices points of view  He would be a consensus  builder   Unfortunately  that portrait bears no resemblance to the  bitterly divided Supreme Court we saw last term   We saw fully a third of the Courts docket decided on a  5 4 basis   We saw normally placid Justices taking the unusual  symbolic step of reading their dissents aloud from the  bench   And we heard astonishingly harsh rhetoric  by Court  standards  from the increasingly marginalized liberal wing of that  Court   One assessment  from Justice Breyer  overnight became  the most pithy and poignant indictment of the new Courts  direction   It is not often in the law that so few have so quickly  changed so much   Justice Breyers comment leads me to my second point  about the false advertising at the confirmation hearings  so few have so  quickly changed so much  Justice Breyer was  of course  referring to the new  dynamic duo on the Court    While politicians sometimes campaign on a platform of  change  aspirants to the Court wisely do the opposite  selling themselves not as  agents of change but as guardians of stability  In this regard  Justices Alito  and particularly Roberts were masterful in their public statements  Both Roberts  and Alito repeatedly claimed their loyalty to the principles of stare decisis  and the strong gravitational pull of precedent  Even before his confirmation hearing  Judge Roberts was  compulsive in his studied invocation of judicial modesty  He unfailingly  advertised himself as a judge who appreciates that his role is limited and who  has the humility to respect the precedent that forms the rule of  law   Roberts insisted that his analysis of cases begins with  a basic recognition of the value of precedent    He went on to explain  and I  quote   Judges have to have the humility to recognize that they  operate within a system of precedent  shaped by other judges equally striving to  live up to the judicial oath  And judges have to have the modesty to be open in  the decisional process to the considered views of their colleagues on the  bench   Roberts then famously likened his role as a judge to  that of an umpire  He said  and I quote   Umpires don t make the rules  they apply them           They make sure everybody plays by the rules  But it is a limited role  Nobody  ever went to a ball game to see the umpire   But the umpire has to play by the rules too  He has to  call balls and strikes based on the strike zone developed by those who came  before him   Unfortunately  if there is one thing this term has  showed us  notwithstanding protests to the contrary  it is that Chief Justice  Roberts seems intent on changing the strike zone  When the team he favors is at  batthose who seek to restrict access to the courts  those who seek to roll back  civil rights and libertieshe calls all balls  When the team he doesnt like is  at bat  he calls all strikes   If the past Supreme Court term were a movie  it might be  called  The Umpire Strikes Back   Not to be outdone  Justice Alito also professed his  deeply held respect for precedent  During his hearing  he  testified   I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very  important doctrine        It s the principle that courts in general should  follow their past precedents        It s important because it limits the power  of the judiciary        And it s important because it reflects the view that  courts should respect the judgments and the wisdom that are embodied in prior  judicial decisions   This easy rhetoric simply has not been supported by  their decisions   I am not the only one who thinks so  Senator Specter   who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for both Justices confirmation  hearings  has said he plans to review the testimony of Roberts and Alito to see  how their recent reversals of several long standing precedents might conflict  with their statements during the confirmation  process   In case after case  it becomes more apparent that there  was little truth in advertising    In case after case  our most recently confirmed Justices  have appeared to jettison decisions recently authored by their immediate  predecessors  Although Roberts and Alito both expressed their profound respect  for stare decisis at their confirmation hearings  many of their decisions have  flouted precedent  For example      In Gonzales v  Carhart  they upheld a federal  law prohibiting so called partial birth abortion  even though just seven years  ago  the Supreme Court struck down an almost identical state law as a violation  of Roe v  Wade      In the Seattle School District case  they ruled  that public schools cannot consider race to achieve desegregation except under  certain limited conditions  even though only three years ago  the Court held  that colleges and universities have a compelling interest in achieving diversity  and may use race as a factor in their admissions decisions      In Wisconsin Right to Life  they adopted a  new legal standard that will allow for virtually unlimited advertising by  corporations and unions before electionseven though only four years ago  the  Court upheld a provision of the McCain Feingold Act that prohibited  advertisements funded by corporations and unions that mention specific  candidates immediately before elections    Third  at their confirmation hearings  both Roberts and  Alito presented themselves as fair and compassionate  as jurists who would treat  the powerful and the powerless equally before the  law   Yet the decisions this term were especially cruel   advancing the traditional conservative preferences for the government over  criminal defendants and the interests of business over consumers and employees     For example      In Ledbetter  they made it extremely  difficult for victims of pay discrimination to sue  The court held that a claim  must be brought within 180 days of the time a person s pay is set  even though  it is rare that a person would know of another employees pay in this time  period and have the information needed to be able to bring a discrimination  claim      In Bowles  v  Russell  a particularly outrageous decision  the court ruled that  a criminal defendant was barred from appealing when a federal district court  mistakenly gave him 17 days  rather than 14  to file his appeal  Even though  the defendant followed the instructions of the District Court  the Court held  that he was barred because the trial judge made a  mistake    The Courts decisions reflect a seemingly inexorable  instinct to unravel any precedent or torture the language of a statute or ignore  the legal equites that does not conform to a traditional ultra conservative  ideology    To be sure  as one commentator put it  often rather than  expressly overrule precedents with which he disagrees  Justice Roberts gives the  appearance of tweaking the lawall the while performing radical  surgery   Rather than explicitly overruling precedent  Justice  Roberts has happened on a strategy of gutting prior opinions of all force and  substance  leaving only a hollow and brittle shell to be easily overruled in the  future   Thats not judicial restraint  its a shell  game   This is  perhaps  an extension of the confirmation show   pledge allegiance to precedent in word and in theory  but cast inconvenient  precedents aside in deed and in practice   No one should be fooled  Of all people  Justice Scalia  noted in his concurring opinion in Wisconsin that Roberts parsing of language  did not mask his intention to overrule precedents  Scalia was correct when he  wrote that this faux judicial restraint is judicial obfuscation     I dont agree with Justice Scalia on much  but on this  point I do  There s nothing principled or restrained about overruling cases  while pretending you are not    Although we have only experienced one full term with  both Roberts and Alito on the Supreme Court  it appears that we were not given  the most accurate picture of the nominees we  confirmed   After hearing Roberts wax philosophic about judicial  modesty at his confirmation hearings  and then reading his calculated decisions  furtively defying stare decisis  I can only conclude that we were presented a  misleading portrait   And so  every day  I feel more comfortable with my vote  against Chief Justice Roberts   And every day  I am pained that I didnt do more to try  to block Justice Alito  Every two years  I look back and take stock of my  greatest failings and regrets in the past Congress  Without question  my  greatest regret in the 109th Congress was not doing more to block Alito  Alito  shouldnt have been confirmed  I should have done a better job  my colleagues  said we didnt have the votes  but I think we should have twisted more arms and  done more   Question Two  What lessons were  learned   Let me turn to the second question  what lessons should  we learn from the Roberts and Alito experience   Lesson One is  that confirmation commitments made at Senate hearings  and the Senate hearings  themselves  are often meaningless   That is true for a number of reasons  many of them  obvious  First  hearings produce a lot of sound and fury  often signifying  nothing   It is too easy to evade a question  it is too easy to  refuse to answer  it is too easy to be coached  and it is too easy to offer an  easy platitude rather than a concrete opinion   Reporters will focus  as is their wont  on the gotcha  game  They will report on who yelled  who cried  who was funny  who was  charming    When Alitos wife began to cry during her husbands  hearing  that seemed to have more effect on the media analysis than anything  else on that day  Moreover  when recounting the actual content of the  hearings  the media reports  unvarnished and uncritically  the most banal  platitudes   I recall that headlines in major newspapers  Like the  Washington Post  helpfully proclaimed after day one of the Alito  hearing   Alito Says He Will Keep Open  Mind   While platitudes are the order of the day  truths about  a nominees legal proclivities are underreported  by both the press and the  nominee  because the process is rigged that way   Lesson Two can  be summed up in four words  its the record  stupid   What do I mean by that  I mean that  given the dearth  of information discoverable at the hearing  the single most important measure of  a nominees judicial philosophy and likely approach on the bench is his or her  concrete  paper record   When Justice Alito sat on the Third Circuit  we knew  from his dissents that he was usually to the right of his Republican colleagues  on the bench  That was the most important indicator of how he would judge on  the High Court   Alternately  when the Senate is stonewalled in obtaining  information  we are unable to make a careful and reasoned judgment about whether  to confirm   Similarly  when a nominee has a sparse record  he is  effectively a stealth candidate and  because the hearings provide more heat  than light  we cannot make a good judgment about his fitness for the Court     Even if we doubled the length of our hearings  testimony  from the candidate cannot come close to filling the information gap created by a  sparse record   Lesson Three   Ideology matters  It stands to reason that a conservative lawyer who has  represented the most conservative Administrations and taken the most  conservative positions as a lawyer is likely to be a very conservative jurist     Senators have an obligation to scrutinize the character  and philosophies of judicial nominees  and nominees have an obligation to  cooperate  This is especially when a nominees ideology  judicial philosophy   and constitutional views are central considerations in the Presidents decision  to nominate    There is an inherent illogic in preventing the Senate  from considering the one factor  ideology  that is central to the Presidents  own nomination decision  It is best for the Senate and the country when this  scrutiny and debate occurs in an open and rational  way   It is no longer reasonable or sensible or smart to  hypothesize that such a person will grow on the bench and become something  that she never was because it is our hope or wish   At every confirmation hearing  we are treated to tirades  about David Souter and Earl Warren being more liberal than expected  We are  told  You never know how someone will turn out   Those days are over  as people have come to understand  the central importance of the Court and the need to not take chances     That leads me to Lesson  Four   Take the President at his word  When a President says  he wants to nominate justices in the mold of Scalia and Thomas  believe  him   Dont be fooled by the occasional chink in nominees  conservative armor  that he once worked pro bono for a gay rights group  for  example  Or that he does not subscribe 100 percent to Justice Scalias blanket  refusal to consider legislative history in interpreting  statutes   The burden of proof lies with the nominee to prove that  he is something other than what the President chose him  for   The burden always lies with the nominee to show that he  or she is within the mainstream  And that burden cannot be met  as weve seen   by mouthing pleasant platitudes about modesty and stability at a confirmation  hearing   Ultimately  the overarching lesson of Roberts and Alito  could be summed up with that familiar old phrase    Fool me once  shame on you  Fool me twice  shame on  me   Question Three  How do we  apply these  lessons   So  we come to the third and final question  How do we  apply the lessons we learned from Roberts and Alito to the next nominee   especially if  God forbid  there is another vacancy under this  President   We now have the most conservative Supreme Court in  memory  And  as everyone knows  the Justices who are  actuarially speaking   most likely to step down next are the liberal ones     The Court is  interestingly  at odds with the country   As the Court grows more conservative  the rest of the nation is in the midst of  a pendulum swing in the progressive direction   Unless we are vigilant in our efforts to moderate the  Court  that institution will stand in the way of a much needed and long overdue  swing back to moderation   I am not a scholar or a practitioner  but a Senator  As  such  I am vested by the Constitution with the responsibility to provide advice  and consent on the Presidents judicial nominees   So  based on my experiences of the last two years and my  reading of the last terms cases  let me share with you how I intend to apply  the lessons learned   First  because of the uselessness of the hearings  when  in the future we are presented with a nominee with a sparse written record  a  Senator might very well be justified in voting against that nominee on this  basis alone   One should not have to engage in conjecture about a  nominees way of thinking and method of reasoning  This is not the  lotto   As we have seen  a stealth nominee with a sparse record  has scarce incentive to provide meaningful answers to questions about judicial  philosophy and Constitutional interpretation   Second  for the rest of this Presidents term and if  there is another Republican elected with the same selection criteria let me say  this   We should reverse the presumption of confirmation  The  Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance  We cannot afford to see Justice  Stevens replaced by another Roberts  or Justice Ginsburg by another  Alito   Given the track record of this President and the  experience of obfuscation at the hearings  with respect to the Supreme Court  at  least  I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm a Supreme  Court nominee EXCEPT in extraordinary  circumstances   In the end  these three questions provide the foundation  for thinking about how we ensure that our Court reflects what America  wants  rather than what a diminishing clique of conservative ideologues wish  for   There is no doubt we were hoodwinked  Let me remind you  of one particularly striking passage from Justice Roberts confirmation  hearing   Senator Graham asked him  The idea of a dramatic  departure under your watch from the Rehnquist era is probably not going to  happen  is that true    Roberts responded  Given my view of the role of a judge  which focuses on appropriate modesty and humility  the notion of dramatic  departures is not one that I would hold out much hope  for   Of course  after only a short while  we have a better  understanding    There is no way to say it better than Justice Breyer  it  bears repeating  It is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed  so much   And this the somber judgment after just one full term of  Roberts and Alito   This is just a prologue   Consider the Constitutional harm and dramatic  departures that are in store if those few are joined by just one more  ideological ally   I will do everything in my power to prevent that from  happening   Thank you
