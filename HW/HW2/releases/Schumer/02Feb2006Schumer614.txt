                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            35 Democratic Senators and 1 Independent  With Abramoff Scandal Reaching Deep into Administration and Republican Leadership on Capitol Hill  a Special Counsel Would Be Freer to Examine Wrongdoing than Bush Appointed Justice Department Officials    Schumer and Salazar Sent Similar Letter to Gonzales Last Week   Any Appearance of Bias on the Part of Justice Department Investigation Can Be Put to Rest U S  Senators Harry Reid  Charles E  Schumer  Ken Salazar  and others sent a letter signed by a majority of Democrats to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking him to appoint a special counsel to continue the investigation into and prosecution of the Jack Abramoff corruption scandal  Schumer called for a similar special counsel to head the investigation into the White House leak of a covert CIA operative and persisted until Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed in 2003  The scope of the Republican centered Abramoff scandal is still growing  and it is clear that there are so many officials in and around the White House and Congress are involved  Continuing the investigation and prosecution under a special counsel would ensure that it would proceed without favor or fear of reprisal within the Administration        Reid said    President Bush has worn out his credibility with the American people yet he continues to stonewall an investigation into his involvement with Jack Abramoff  asking Americans to trust him without explaining why  We need an independent investigation  not a whitewash led by Attorney General Gonzales   President Bush s best friend  The American people deserve a Special Council because they demand honest leadership and a government that they can trust          Schumer asserted    We are at a crossroads with this investigation now  If this were the Superbowl  fans would never believe that a referee who used to play for the Seahawks or the Steelers would be calling the shots fairly  In this case  the American people don  t believe that this Administration can investigate this scandal and its own wrongdoing fairly and a special counsel is critical to renew public trust in elected officials          Salazar stated    As a former Attorney General I believe in upholding the law and rooting out corruption  The American people deserve an open  unbiased investigation into this matter  and the growing support for a special counsel shown today merely underscores its necessity  We must begin the process of restoring America  s faith in government          Last week  Senators Schumer and Salazar sent a similar letter to the Attorney General calling for a special counsel and then worked together with Senator Reid  s office to organize the majority of the Democratic Caucus behind the effort to eliminate the appearance of impropriety surrounding the investigation into the Abramoff scandal        The text of the letter is below   February 2  2006      The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  United States Department of Justice   950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530      Dear General Gonzales       We write to join the request made last week that you appoint a special counsel to continue the investigation and the prosecution of those involved in the corruption scandal surrounding Jack Abramoff  s dealings with the federal government  The Department  s response to the press regarding that request did not address the fundamental issue of a conflict of interest or the other serious issues raised by the letter       This scandal has shaken the public  s confidence in our government and all involved must be pursued vigorously  A special counsel will ensure the public  s confidence in the investigation and prosecution and help to restore its faith in our government  FBI officials have said the Abramoff investigation   involves systemic corruption within the highest levels of government     Such an assertion indicates extraordinary circumstances and it is in the public interest that you act under your existing statutory authority to appoint a special counsel        Mr  Abramoff  s significant ties to Republican leadership in Congress  and allegations of improper activity involving Administration officials  reaching  possibly  into the White House itself  pose a possible conflict of interest for the Department and thus further warrant the appointment of a special counsel  Recent news reports confirm that Mr  Abramoff met the President on several occasions and during some of those meetings  Mr  Abramoff and his family had their photos taken with the President  Mr  Abramoff also organized at least one and possibly several meetings with White House staff for his clients  These meetings with the President and White House staff occurred while you were serving as White House Counsel  Given the possible ties between Mr  Abramoff and senior government officials  we believe the appointment of a special counsel is not only justified  but necessary       The Public Integrity section of the Department has thus far pursued this case appropriately  and we applaud its pursuit of Mr  Abramoff and his colleagues  As the investigation turns to government officials and their staffs  both in the Executive and Legislative branches  we have no doubt that if the investigation is left to the career prosecutors in that section  the case would reach its appropriate conclusion  Unfortunately  the highly political context of the allegations and charges may lead some to surmise that political influence may compromise the investigation  This concern is heightened by allegations that Frederick Black  the former acting U S  Attorney for Guam and the Northern Marianas  was replaced  perhaps improperly  as a result of his investigation of Mr  Abramoff       Appointment of a Special Counsel at this point in time is made even more appropriate by the White House  s recent nomination of Noel Hillman  the career prosecutor in charge of the case  to a federal judgeship  As a new prosecutor will need to take over the case  we ask you to appoint an outside Special Counsel so the public can be assured no political considerations will be a part of this investigation or the subsequent prosecutions       Because this investigation is vital to restoring the public  s faith in its government  any appearance of bias  special favor or political consideration would be a further blow to our democracy  Appointment of a special counsel would ensure that the investigation and prosecution will proceed without fear or favor and provide the public with full confidence that no one in this country is above the law        We know you share our commitment to restoring the public  s trust in our government  We hope you will take the only appropriate action here and appoint a special counsel so we can ensure that justice is done while preserving the integrity of the Justice Department       We look forward to hearing from you on this matter soon       Harry Reid  Charles E  Schumer  Ken Salazar  Barack Obama  Dick Durbin  Robert Menendez  Ted Kennedy  Daniel K  Inouye  Blanche L  Lincoln
