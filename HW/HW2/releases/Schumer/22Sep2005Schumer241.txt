IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 22  2005 Statement Of Sen  Schumer In Opposition To Roberts Nomination To Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  announced his opposition to the nomination of Judge John G  Roberts  Jr  for Chief Justice of Supreme Court of the United States at the Judiciary Committee Markup session  The statement prepared for delivery follows       Mr  Chairman  let us take a step back for a moment and consider where we are  consider the context of the votes we cast today  Let us put this nomination in context  Let us set the stage       Let me answer my friend Senator Graham about what difference there is between previous nominations   of Justice Ginsburg or Scalia   and now       Some years ago  a number of extreme groups and individuals decided that they could not abide the direction that America was going in  They could not change America through the Presidency  they could not change it through the Congress  because those are elected branches  and American politics is usually decided in the middle  So  they decided they could change America through the Courts  the one unelected branch of Government  That of course is their right       In 2000  they succeeded  They helped to elect a President who embraced their vision  That President signaled that he agreed with them  that America could and should be changed through the Courts  And he signaled his agreement by repeating over and over again    first on the stump and then at the Presidential podium    that he would appoint judges   in the mold    of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas       That meant that the President subscribed to their viewpoint that America should be radically changed through the Courts and that the clock should be rolled back using legal theories like originalism and strict constructionism       That is very different from what President Clinton did when he nominated Justices Ginsburg and Breyer  both names suggested to him by Senator Hatch  and what President Eisenhower set out to do when he nominated Justices Warren and Brennan        So  Mr  Chairman  the stage for this vote was set some five years ago  It was set by a President who vowed that    if given the opportunity    he would name to the Supreme Court Justices in the   mold    of Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia       Given the President  s campaign promise and repeated declarations  there is a presumption that any nominee the President sends to the Senate is in that   mold          The presumption is especially strong    and is particularly hard to overcome          with a nominee who was carefully vetted  researched  and interviewed at sufficient length by a President who professed a desire to nominate people in the mold of Thomas and Scalia          with a nominee who is eagerly embraced by those groups who support the views of Thomas and Scalia and who want to change America through the Courts       The presumption can be rebutted  of course  And the way it can be rebutted is through the answering of questions and through the production of relevant documents  And here  regrettably  there was much lacking       To be fair  Judge Roberts did partially rebut the presumption  He made some inroads       As I said last week  Judge Roberts has a keen intellect  His encyclopedic knowledge of the law and eloquent presentation certainly confirmed what his colleagues have said about him    that he is one of the best advocates  if not the best advocate  in the nation       But being brilliant and accomplished is not the number one criterion for elevation to the Supreme Court    there are many who would use their considerable talents and legal acumen to set America back  So  while legal brilliance is to be considered  it is never dispositive       In addition  very good lawyers know how to avoid tough questions  People have said that one of the reasons the nominee was so effective arguing in the Supreme Court is that he mastered the trick of making the point he wanted to make  rather than answer the question asked       When one reviewed the transcript  there was often less than met the ear       Judge Roberts was such a good witness that everyone seemed to emerge from the hearing with a different view of what he actually said       People might recall that Judge Roberts mentioned at the hearing that his favorite movies were Doctor Zhivago and North by Northwest   But perhaps the most relevant movie to this hearing is Rashomon  where four people saw the exact same crime and each had a totally different view of what had happened       The answering of questions is extraordinarily important        As I have repeatedly said  there is an obligation of nominees to answer questions fully and forthrightly  because they are essential to figuring out a nominee  s judicial philosophy and ideology   to me  the most important criteria in choosing a Justice        Many of us were disappointed in his failure to answer many questions and is one of the contributing factors to the no votes that will be cast this morning and next week on the Floor       Indeed  a yes vote here for me might indicate acceptance not only of a nominee  s strategic decision to avoid answering important and proper questions about decided cases  but also an Administration  s decision to thumb its nose at the American people  s right to have information about a nominee in the form of important documents   That is why that I hope that    whatever happens with Judge Roberts    the next nominee will be more forthcoming and will answer more questions about his or her legal views  and that all relevant documents will be provided       But  as I have repeatedly said  the answering of questions is only a means to an end    it is a means of finding out what kind of judge  or Justice  a nominee will make       In this case  because there were not enough questions answered or documents provided  we are still unsure of the answer to the central question  Who is Judge Roberts       We are left to guesswork  impressions  and hunches  We are left playing a bit of a game of blind man  s bluff        Particularly troubling to me are the eerie parallels between Judge Roberts  s testimony and then Judge Thomas  s  especially given President Bush  s declaration that he would nominate Justices in the mold of Justice Thomas       The echoes of then Judge Thomas  s empty reassurances that he was a mainstream jurist are ringing in the ears of every Senator who listened to many nearly identical statements from Judge Roberts last week       I was particularly troubled by his answers in two areas    the Constitutional right to privacy and the Congress  s Commerce Clause power to protect the rights and improve the lives of the American people         At his hearing  for example  Judge Roberts said that he believes   there is a right to privacy protected as part of the liberty guarantee in the due process clause     At his hearing  then Judge Thomas made almost the identical statement  He said   I  with respect to the privacy interests  would continue to say that the liberty component of the due process clause is the repository of that interest     As a Supreme Court Justice  however  Justice Thomas has repeatedly urged the most narrow interpretation of a privacy interest possible  in Casey  in Lawrence  and at every other opportunity          At his hearing  as Senator Feinstein has already mentioned  Judge Roberts repeatedly assured the Committee that he had   no quarrel    with various Supreme Court decisions on issues of privacy  women  s rights  civil rights  education  and other important issues  The same assurance was made by Justice Thomas at his hearings  but when given the opportunity to consider those cases with which he had   no quarrel    from the bench  Justice Thomas voted to overrule          Then Judge Thomas had   no quarrel    with the Supreme Court decision in Eisenstadt v  Baird  which protected the right of privacy of unmarried couples  but wrote in dissent in the Lawrence case that there is   no general right to privacy             He said he had no quarrel with the Lemon test used to evaluate challenges to the Establishment Clause  but then joined a dissent which ridiculed that test in the Lamb  s Chapel case       At his hearing  Judge Roberts repeatedly assured the Committee that he had   no agenda     The same assurance was made by Justices Thomas and Scalia at their hearings  But given Justice Thomas  s history  in particular  the phrase alone provides little comfort       Besides these concerns about Judge Roberts  s views on the right to privacy and on the Establishment Clause  I also was troubled by his answers on the Commerce Clause  I asked him if he would disagree with Justice Thomas  s view that Congress may not regulate activities occurring within a state even if they have substantial effects on interstate commerce  He refused       There is therefore too serious a chance that Judge Roberts believes that Congress is without power to protect workers   rights  women  s rights  and the environment on this widely accepted Constitutional basis       We simply did not get definitive answers to these questions at the hearings       At the hearings  I gave Judge Roberts EVERY OPPORTUNITY to distance himself from Justice Thomas  s most extreme views  He refused       For example  after Judge Roberts seemingly answered a question about his belief in a Constitutional right to privacy  I asked him if he agreed or disagreed with Justice Thomas  s view that there is no   general    right to privacy in the Constitution  He refused to give his view        As I said  I asked him whether he agreed with Justice Thomas  s rather extreme view of the Commerce Clause  He refused to disagree       In fact  I asked him if he could name a single opinion written by Justice Thomas with which he disagreed  He refused       In written questions  also  answers to which were received just yesterday  I again gave him the opportunity to explain his position on various issues as compared with Justices Thomas and Scalia  Again  he refused       Of lesser concern  but still rankling  there are questions about some of the old memos and Judge Roberts  s stubborness in standing by the language in some of them           It did not seem much  for instance  to concede  twenty years later  that the wording of   illegal amigos    was unfortunate  yet he refused to say so          Similarly  it did not seem much to acknowledge that a reference to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as   unamerican    was impolitic  to say the least  yet he refused to say so       All of these factors entered into my decision       Now  Senator Cornyn has said that if we can  t vote for this nominee who COULD we vote for  Here is your answer          someone who answers questions fully and who makes his or her record fully available      someone who gives us a significant level of assurance with some answers and a record that he or she is not an ideologue        Roberts is clearly brilliant and his demeanor suggests he well MIGHT not be an ideologue  But he did not make the case strongly enough to bet the whole house       There is a good chance    perhaps even a majority chance    that Judge Roberts will be like Justice Rehnquist on the bench  We know he will be brilliant  and he could well be    while very conservative    not an ideologue  That is why I struggled with this decision so long and so hard       If he is a Rehnquist  that would not be cause for exultation  nor would it be cause for alarm  The Court  s balance will not be altered       But there is a reasonable danger that he will be like Justice Thomas  the most radical Justice on the Supreme Court       It is not that I am certain that he will be a Thomas  It  s not even that the chance that he will a Thomas is greater than fifty percent  But the risk that he might be a Thomas and the lack of reassurance that he won  t    particularly in light of this President  s professed desire to nominate people in that mold    is just not good enough       I hope he is not a Thomas  But the risk is too great to bear  The Court  s balance may for decades be tipped radically in one direction       Because of that risk and its enormous consequences for generations of Americans  I cannot vote yes  I must reluctantly cast my vote against confirmation
