Consumers Have a Better Chance Tracking Down a Lost Book from Amazon than Banks Have Tracking Down Sensitive Data Lost in Transit        Schumer Nelson Comprehensive ID Theft Prevention Bill Would Address ID Theft befor U S  Senator Chuck Schumer  D NY  testified before the Senate Commerce Committee Hearing on Identity Theft today  Schumer along with Commerce Committee member  Bill Nelson  D FL  introduced the Comprehensive Identity Theft Prevention Act in April and also announce an addition to the bill which would require higher security standards for the shipping of data physically  In light of recent Bank of America and Citibank data tape losses  there is a significant loophole which allows companies to ship un encrypted data without any special security measures  Below is Sen  Schumer  s testimony       Thank you  Mr  Chairman and Mr  Ranking Member for the opportunity to testify before the Commerce Committee today  I m honored to be sitting next to Senator Feinstein  who has done so much good work on these issues for so many years       Like Senator Feinstein  I come to urge action    quick action    against an epidemic  An epidemic that burdens our economy  slows our Information Superhighway  and victimizes millions of Americans    Identity Theft       As I ve said before  what bank robbery was to the Depression Era  identity theft is to the Information Age       But identity thieves are in some ways even worse than bank robbers  They not only steal people s money  they also rob people of their time  their sense of security  and their peace of mind       And unless Congress  companies  and consumers take action  this is an epidemic that threatens to spiral out of control  Congressional action must be quick  and it must be comprehensive       Identity theft is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue    it is a non partisan consumer and economic crisis  And there is no excuse for Congress failing to act in a bipartisan way       The numbers are staggering   Almost ten million people a year are victims of some sort of identity theft   Every Senator on this Committee has thousands of constituents who have lost millions of dollars and wasted tens of thousands of hours because we have so far failed to take decisive action       That s why Senator Bill Nelson  an esteemed member of this Committee  and I have introduced a bill that offers a truly comprehensive solution       Instead of just adding another square to the current patchwork quilt of regulations  our bill provides a real security blanket for the American consumer       To really tackle identity theft  our bill takes an aggressive approach in three key areas        1  Empowering Consumers    2  Protecting Our Most Personal Information  and   3  Helping Victims restore their identities quickly and efficiently       1  EMPOWERING CONSUMERS  First  we make companies tell consumers when their information has been breached  so consumers can take action to protect themselves       We also empower consumers by requiring companies to tell them if that company plans to sell sensitive personal information they collect    so consumers can make intelligent decisions about whom to trust with their sensitive personal information       2  PROTECTING INFORMATION  We also take action in the second key area  preventing misuse of sensitive personal information in the first place       An ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of cure  And our bill makes prevention a centerpiece of the effort against identity theft       We establish procedures for the FTC to require companies to authenticate those who try to buy sensitive personal information from them    to stop situations where companies like Choicepoint  for example  sell their personal information to identity theft rings posing as legitimate businesses       We also insist that every company that stores sensitive personal information take  reasonable steps  to protect it    a simple minimum requirement that they treat your sensitive personal information with the care it deserves       The Federal Trade Commission has recently applauded this provision because of its potential to  reduce the risk of identity theft        All companies who keep sensitive personal information need to take responsibility  They need to guard our identities as if they were gold    because in the hands of identity thieves  they are gold       For that reason  we also intend to add a provision to address situations where companies use third party transportation or storage of sensitive personal information  Companies shouldn t be able to abdicate responsibility simply by hiring a subcontractor or courier       We have a better chance of tracking down a lost book from Amazon com than some banks have had in tracking down millions of sensitive records lost in transit       3  HELP VICTIMS  Finally  our bill provides relief to the millions of Americans each year who fall victim to identity theft    vulnerable victims who don t know where to go or where to turn       Our bill also creates an Office of Identity Theft within the FTC  This office will provide a one stop shop to help consumers restore their identities       Right now it takes the average consumer the equivalent of one month of full time work  or 40 hours a week  just to restore their identity  Our bill fixes that       Now  some of the provisions in our bill can be implemented by the FTC today  and I encourage them to begin this process and not simply wait for legislation       Also I encourage every company in America  and especially in my state of New York  to do a top to bottom review of its procedures for handling consumers  sensitive personal information  to stave off more incidents where information is exposed to theft       Identify theft is a serious issue that deserves real  comprehensive action  and I hope this committee will give the Schumer Nelson bill the consideration it deserves  Thank you
