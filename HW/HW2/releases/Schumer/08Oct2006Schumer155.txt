IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 8  2006 Schumer Reveals  Loose Federal Oversight Makes Another Ecoli Outbreak All Too Likely    Vegetable Processing Plants Inspected Only Once Every 10 Years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Inspections Down Outrageous 25 Percent  Largest Outbreak in Produce Ever Exposes Cracks at the FDA  Recent Ecoli Outbreak Could Have been Much Worse    Patchwork for Federal Laws Leave Gaping Holes in Food Safety Measures   Monitoring of Fruits and Vegetables Years Behind Efforts to Protect Meat and Poultry and They Leave Much to be Desired   Schumer Announces New Push for Sweepin In the wake of the worst outbreak of E  coli  Escherichia coli  O157 H7 in produce in United States history  and with news that over the weekend 5 200 pounds of E  coli contaminated beef were recalled in 10 states  including New York U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that a patchwork of federal oversight has left the nation  s food supply dangerously vulnerable to contamination  It took two weeks from the time state officials in Wisconsin first discovered five people who were sick with E  coli to when federal investigators arrived in Salinas Valley  California  the suspected origin of the bacterium  Schumer today said that federal efforts to monitor the food supply  track any contaminated food  and notify the public is significantly hampered because of jurisdictional tangles  a lack of staff  and a lack of funding at the Food and Drug Administration  the agency with oversight of non meat food products  Schumer today announced he was co sponsoring comprehensive food safety legislation that would create a new unified Food Safety Agency to protect farms and consumers         This recent outbreak must be a wake up call to get our food safety house in order because right now it  s in pure disarray     Schumer said     Ensuring the safety of our produce requires immediate action because there s no excuse to allow processing plants to be left undisputed for a decade  Instead of having 12 agencies butting heads and leaving our food supply unprotected  we need to have one agency take charge to ensure the next outbreak isn  t far worse        Under current law  the United States Department of Agriculture has the responsibility of protecting the nation  s meat and poultry supply  while the FDA has oversight over fruits  vegetables  and other food products  In response to several  major E  coli outbreaks in beef in the mid 1990  s  the USDA stepped up enforcement efforts  which are credited with reducing the frequency of E  coli outbreaks in meat and poultry       Unfortunately  the FDA isn  t doing nearly enough to protect fruits and vegetables from contamination and has reduced the number of produce inspections dramatically  In 2005  the FDA conducted 4 573 on site agriculture processing inspections  For 2006  they are only expected to complete 3 400  a 25 percent drop   By contrast  the USDA conducts the same number of inspections in a matter of days  Food inspections have dropped from 50 000 in 1972 to less than 4 500 in 2005  meaning that U S  food processors are inspected on average about once every 10 years  Federal law requires a USDA inspector to be permanently placed at every meat processing plant in the country  however  there is no such requirement of produce at the FDA        This fractured approach has left the nation  s produce vulnerable to contamination   Furthermore  The FDA does not have to power to order recalls  The CDC estimates that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year  Of those individuals  approximately 325 000 will be hospitalized and more than 5 000 will die  Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to foodborne pathogens       Schumer said that food safety monitoring  inspection and labeling functions are actually spread across 12 federal agencies and sub agencies including  the U S  Department of Agriculture  s Food Safety and Inspection Service which regulates meat  poultry and processed egg products  the Food and Drug Administration  s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and Center for Veterinary Medicine which regulates produce and other food products  and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  which tracks foodborne illnesses        Schumer today announced that in the wake of this outbreak  he was pushing comprehensive food safety legislation that would overhaul federal oversight of the food supply   The Food Safety Act  S  729   authored by Senator Richard Durbin  D IL  and co sponsored by Schumer and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  would make one new federal agency responsible for food safety monitoring  The legislation would require food producers to code their products so that those products can be quickly traced in the event of a food borne illness outbreak  requiring that food processing plants have procedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination  requiring regular inspection of domestic food facilities with frequency based on risk  and give the FDA recall authority        Schumer also announced a new push for funding for food inspectors as a response to the drop in inspections  Schumer said that the inspectors would perform unannounced inspections on food producers
