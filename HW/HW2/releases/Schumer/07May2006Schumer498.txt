IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 7  2006 Schumer Announces Legislation Allowing MTA Busses To Bring Staten Island Residents Directly To Bayonne  NJ Transit Hub                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           State law currently roadblocks direct MTA Bus Access to Bayonne Hub   Connecting existing MTA Bus lines to NJ Transit s Hudson Bergen light rail system will reduce commuting time and ease congestion   Schumer  in conversations with MTA Chairmen Kalikow  is assured MTA will begin service if state law is changed U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and Assemblyman Michael C  Cusick today announced legislation that would allow the Metropolitan Transit Authority  MTA  to link existing MTA bus lines to New Jersey Transit  s Hudson Bergen Light Rail line  s station at 34th street in Bayonne  NJ         Staten Islanders suffer from the longest commutes  and worst traffic in this city  A bus link between the North Shore of Staten Island and the Bayonne Transit hub is a no brainer    it  s cheap  it  s easy  it will cut commuting times to Manhattan and will alleviate traffic for all Staten Islanders     Schumer said    This bill will remove the key legal barrier that stands as a roadblock in the effort to make this bus service a reality            We owe it to Staten Islanders to find as many ways as possible to provide a quicker ride to and from work  This legislation is good news for commuters  in fact  it s a boon for all Island residents     said Assemblyman Michael J  Cusick    More people using mass transit means less cars driving on Staten Island s congested roads  I m glad it appears we ve been able to find a way to sidestep a lengthy legal battle and do something that benefits all of Staten Island        Last month  Schumer personally called MTA Chairman Peter Kalikow to urge him to start the service over the Bayonne Bridge from Staten Island to New Jersey  Chairman Kalikow was open to the idea  but pointed out that the New York Public Authorities Law prevented New York City Transit  NYCT  from providing direct bus service to another state       NYCT is responsible for operating all of the MTA  s bus service  NYCT is an affiliate of the MTA and currently does not have the statutory authority to operate   open door    service outside the 5 boroughs of New York  The legislation to be introduced in the New York State Assembly by Mr  Cusick  will amend the New York State Public Authorities Law to allow NYCT to enter into a Joint Service Agreements  JSA  with New Jersey Transit  This JSA would permit existing MTA bus lines to drop Staten Island passengers off at the Bayonne hub and take the direct rail link into Manhattan        Subsidiaries of the MTA  such as Metro North rail systems  are currently permitted to enter in JSAs  allowing train service to operate between New York and Connecticut  New York City Transit  however  was formed under different sections of state law  and today  s legislation would give them the same power to enter into JSA  s as other MTA subsidiaries        The Staten Island to Bayonne service  originally proposed in the late 1990  s  would create a direct link from the North Shore of Staten Island to the Bayonne transit hub which provides a more direct route to Lower Manhattan and Jersey City  where many Staten Islanders work  According to the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce  which has championed this cause  the service would reduce commuting times to Lower Manhattan to under an hour  something currently impossible from the North Shore  Commuters coming from all over the North Shore and in to the middle of Staten Island  especially from in Eltingville  Travis  Graniteville and Annadale  all could see their commutes brought down to under an hour        Schumer noted that    The additional stop at the end of some existing MTA bus routes would go a long way toward alleviating the maddening congestion on Staten Island  s roads and expressways  and provide an efficient route for thousands of New Yorkers to commute to work          While Cusick added that    This new route is estimated to cost only  1 million annually  while reducing commute times dramatically  We need to move full steam ahead  and this bill will pave the way          In September  2005  after a meeting with the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce  Schumer wrote to MTA Chairman Peter Kalikow urging him to extend bus service to Bayonne  At a breakfast sponsored by the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce last week  Senator Schumer pledged to continue lobbying Chairman Kalikow on the issue        Schumer also pledged to lobby NYCT and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to begin contract bus service from Staten Island to the Bayonne hub before MTA service commences  NYCT and the Port Authority are both permitted to hire private companies to run inter state routes  This contract service would allow Islanders to begin taking advantage of the rail link before NYCT busses become able to extend their service across state lines  NYCT direct bus service is far preferable  however  as it would allow commuters to take advantage of existing bus lines creating a one stop ride to Bayonne  MTA NYCT service would also be more cost effective than contract service in the long run       Schumer and Cusick both also promised to lobby New Jersey Governor John Corzine to have New Jersey Transit enter into a JSA with NYCT once the legislation was passed        Staten Island was the fastest growing county in the State of New York from 1990 to 2000  with significant population and economic gains expected over the next 30 years  At the same time  however  Staten Islanders have the longest average commute in the nation  averaging 43 8 minutes each way  Staten Island residents also endure the most frequent   extreme commutes    of 90 minutes or longer in the nation  Congestion and traffic hampers economic growth and creates an environment that businesses try to avoid
