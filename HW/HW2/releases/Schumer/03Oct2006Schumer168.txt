IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 3  2006 Schumer Announces Bold New Federal Plan To Bring Workforce Housing To Westchester And Rockland Counties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Next Generation Housing Zones    Would Bring Major Federal Tax Breaks And Employer Assistance In Key Suburban Areas Like Westchester And Rockland Counties That Have High Housing Costs   High Price of Housing Is Escalating The Brain Drain And Forcing Families To Leave The Area To Live And Work Elsewhere   Schumer  We Must Keep Our Kids Here U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled his bold new plan make housing more accessible to middle income workers and families in Westchester and Rockland Counties  Schumer  s plan centers around   Next Generation Housing Zones    that will bring major federal tax breaks and employer assistance in high cost suburban areas like Westchester and Rockland Counties   Schumer asserts that one of the main reasons why young people of all levels of education are turning away from working and living in Westchester and Rockland Counties is the rising cost of owning a home   The only way to solve this problem  Schumer said  is to bring all the players involved together    employers  builders  federal  state  and local government    to create an environment that encourages and supports home ownership for these workers         The key to the success of the businesses  economy  and even communities and neighborhoods in Westchester and Rockland Counties is the ability to retain and attract younger workers to live  work and settle down here     Schumer said     Westchester and Rockland County businesses are the backbone of our economy and without enough young workers in the area  I  m worried that our back might break  From engineers to firemen and police officers  teachers to clerical workers  Westchester and Rockland Counties needs a robust  multi tiered  and multi talented workforce in order to survive  We need hard working young families to be the base that feeds our economy          Schumer said Westchester and Rockland Counties need to expand their stock of   next generation    housing    housing for younger  middle class  and professional workers who are the future of the economy  Without them  employers could face perpetual labor shortages and the region could face constricted economic growth   This housing crisis is touching every part of life in Westchester and Rockland Counties   Hospitals are having problems getting promising young doctors because they are opting to begin their careers in regions with more acceptable housing costs   It  s the same for schools trying to get the best teachers  fire companies trying to recruit and retain firefighters  and police departments fighting to put the best young cops on the street   In order to do that  Schumer said more housing for younger workers and the middle class needs to be available and something must be done to make home ownership more attainable for everyone who wants to live and work in the Lower Hudson Valley         Since 2001  in Westchester County  the median price of housing has increased 67   from  449 900 to  749 500  while median household incomes went up only 13   from  63 583 in 1999 to  72 000 today   Meanwhile  Westchester County has lost 61 668 people between the ages of 20 34 from 1995 2005  which is a 28  decline   In Rockland  the median housing price is up 80 percent since 2001  from  271 000 to  490 000  while the median household income only increased 16   from  67 971 to  79 000   Rockland County has lost 16 735 people between the ages of 20 34 from 1995 2005  which is a 26  decline  Nationwide  the median income is roughly  45 000 and median price of a home is  185 000   That means the typical home in the United States costs four times as much as an average workers  salary   And the decline in young people between the ages of 20 34 was only 4 percent from 1995 2005       Schumer today announced he will introduce new legislation that would have the Department of Housing and Urban Development designate areas  where the average price of a new home far exceeds the average median income for workers  as   Next Generation Housing Zones      This would directly target a few  unique areas  like the Lower Hudson Valley  where the price of owning a home has risen far out of reach for the average worker and where promising young talent has started to look at other places to live and work   Specifically  under Schumer  s proposal  any area where   the median housing price is more than six times the area median income  there has been a greater than 15 percent decline in the population in the region between the ages of 25 40 over the previous decade  and  housing prices have increased by more than 50 percent over the previous five years  would be designated as a   Next Generation Housing Zone      Similar to   Empowerment Zones     all or parts of counties that fall under this new designation would be eligible for three new tax incentives and credits for builders  established businesses  and new homeowners  in order to spur renewed development and home ownership       Schumer  s legislation includes a three point plan that will cover a limited number of areas   First  businesses hiring new people within the zone would be able provide up to  20 000 toward an employee s down payment on a home  with half that amount being returned to the business as a federal tax credit and the remainder able to be deducted as a normal business expense   Second  younger and middle class workers looking to buy a home in an area designated as a   Next Generation Housing Zone     would receive a first time home buyer tax credit   Any person who buys a home in the zone and whose total household income does not exceed  100 000 a year for single people and  150 000 for married couples  would receive a  5 000 federal tax credit  with unused credits carried forward to future years   Third  Schumer  s legislation would create a new   bonus program    through the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program to give developers an even greater incentive to focus on the areas where the cost of building is growing too rapidly to meet demands   Counties would be able to give developers additional CDBG and HOME funding on top of their existing allocations only if the developer builds within the zones and agrees to keep a portion of the development dedicated for affordable or next generation housing         Time and again  we hear that the greatest barrier to purchasing a new home is the down payment   Most families can usually afford their monthly payments and receive relatively favorable interest rates and mortgage programs   We need to stem the rising tide of talented workers from all backgrounds  ages  and levels of education who are looking beyond Westchester and Rockland Counties to live  work  and start a family   No less than the future of the economy depends on it     Schumer added           In addition to his legislation  Schumer called on Fannie Mae to increase funding for its Low Down Payment Program   Under this program  families can get a mortgage with as little as a  500 down payment   Schumer called on Fannie Mae to add an additional  1 billion to this program for next year   Schumer was joined today by Dr  Marsha Gordon  CEO  and Paul Vitale  vice president for government relations of the Business Council of Westchester  Kevin Luing  President of Berkeley College  Roger Scheiber  vice president for development of the Rockland Business Association  and other business leaders
