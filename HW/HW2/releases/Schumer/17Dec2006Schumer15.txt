                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             After Hundreds Were Sickened  FDA Wasted Precious Time in a Wild Goose Chase for Green Onions    The Monitoring of Fruits and Vegetables is Years Behind Efforts to Protect Meat and Poultry        Tracing Has Reduced E Coli in Meat and Must be Done Immediately for Produce   To Improve the Accuracy and Speed of Tracing Contaminated Produce  Schumer Calls for Congress to Pass Sweeping With the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  still unsure of the source of an E coli outbreak eighteen days after it sickened hundreds of New Yorkers and its investigation muddled by confusion  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called for the FDA to immediately institute produce tracing measures  After initially blaming the outbreak on contaminated green onions at local Taco Bells  a week later the FDA rescinded its conclusion and turned its attention toward investigating the restaurant  s shredded lettuce even though it tested negative for E coli  During the eighteen day investigation  it has become increasingly clear that FDA  s efforts to track contaminated food produce were not working because there wasn  t a comprehensive system in place  With the public and FDA still in the dark over the exact source of the E coli contamination  today  Senator Schumer called for the FDA to immediately begin tracking produce         Eighteen days after an E coli outbreak sickened hundreds of New Yorkers and pulled the rug out from under consumer  s confidence in our nation  s vegetables  the FDA still cannot give us a definite answer on the cause for the outbreak     said Senator Schumer    Unless we overhaul our nation  s tracing and monitoring procedures  the FDA and the other agencies in charge will continue to act like a pack of blind mice who are constantly bumping into each other          On December 6  6 days after taco bell officials learned that people had gotten since with a terrible strain of e  coli the FDA announced that the culprit behind the contamination at local Taco Bells was green onions after the vegetable tested positive for E coli  The public was warned and FDA investigators shifted their focus to finding the origin of the contaminated green onions  But on December 12th  the FDA rescinded it  s conclusion that the green onions were contaminated and briefly considered the fact that it may have been white onions since they had mislabeled a bag  of white onions  labeled them green  that tested positive for e coli  Within a day  investigators discovered that though the white onions did indeed test positive for e  coli it was not the strain that sickened people  December 13th officials announced that it was turning its attention to shredded lettuce served at Taco Bells  Adding more confusion to the investigation is that the shredded lettuce has tested negative for E coli  Despite the negative results  investigators have instead relied on the unscientific methods of comparing what stricken New Yorkers ate and ruling out meats and cheeses because they are either cooked or pasteurized before arriving at Taco Bells  Today  eighteen days after the outbreak  there is still no definitive answer on what food product caused the outbreak  And  if it was lettuce  where that lettuce originated       The FDA  s inability to quickly and precisely locate the contaminated food at Taco Bells comes only two months after the nation  s largest E coli outbreak which sickened 206 people and killed 3 people across 26 states and Canada  Mirroring the same problems associated with the current Taco Bell investigation  it took federal investigators weeks before they could locate the contaminated spinach in California  s Salinas Valley     Under current law  the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  has the responsibility of protecting the nation  s meat and poultry supply  while the FDA oversees fruits  vegetables  and other food products  In response to several major E  coli outbreaks in beef in the mid 1990  s  the USDA stepped up enforcement efforts  which are credited with reducing the frequency of E  coli outbreaks in meat and poultry        Unfortunately  FDA doesn  t have a system in place to trace produce leading to weeks between an outbreak and a conclusion of what exactly happened  In an effort to protect the food supply from yet another e  coli disaster today Senator Schumer called on the Food an Drug Administration to immediately institute a tracking system  Schumer  wrote a letter to FDA Administrator Von Eschenbach to make the changes as quickly as possible        Schumer also announced his intention to reintroduce comprehensive food safety legislation that would overhaul federal oversight of the food supply at the start of the next Congress in January  The Food Safety Act  S  729   authored by Senator Richard Durbin  D IL  and co sponsored by Schumer would            Make one new federal agency responsible for food safety monitoring  The legislation would give the agency recall authority  require food processing plants to implement procedures to prevent and reduce food contamination  require regular inspection of domestic food facilities with frequency based on risk  and prioritize federal food safety efforts and deployment of resources to achieve the greatest possible benefit in reducing food borne illness            Establish requirements for a national system for tracing food and food producing animals from point of origin to retail sale         Establish new  regular inspection protocols for vegetable processing plants
