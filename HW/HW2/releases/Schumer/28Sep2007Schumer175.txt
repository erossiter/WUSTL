IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 28  2007 In the Wake of St  John s Gun Scare  Landmark Schumer   Legislation Designed To Keep Guns Out Of The Hands Of The   Mentally Ill Needlessly Blocked On Senate Floor This Week                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Schumer Legislation Would Dramatically Improve How Information is Turned Over to Feds and Shared Between States to Ensure Guns are Not Sold to Dangerous Individuals Small Band of Right Wing Senators Blocking Legislation Despite Widespread Bi Partisan Support Senator Calls for Immediate Passage of His Legislation to Keep Campuses and Communities Safe With New Yorkers still reeling from a gun scare on the St  Johns campus  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that landmark legislation sponsored by him and Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill has been stonewalled by a small group of Republican Senators  The legislation would get desperately needed resources to states to help them modernize and get their records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System  NICS   so that pre purchase background checks will better catch people who are prohibited from catching firearms  On Wednesday  a student who could have been mentally ill at St  John s University student was arrested after he was caught toting a rifle across campus while wearing a Fred Flinstone mask   This frightening incident must be a wake up call to finally close this gaping hole in our nations gun laws  Our first line of defense against gun crime is ensuring that guns stay out of the hands of violent people  Schumer said  First Virginia Tech and possibly now this week at St  Johns show that guns and the mentally ill are not something that should go together  We can never know if any one law could have prevented a tragedy But we do know that good legislation that could make people safer   and has already passed the house   is being obstructed and blocked by a small group   Though the house passed similar legislation  authored by Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy  earlier this year and the Schumer Leahy legislation has broad bi partisan support  earlier this week a small group of right wing Republican Senators placed a hold on the bill when Schumer called for a vote  Schumer today called on those Senators to lift their hold and allow this long overdue legislation to pass and become law   Right after Virginia Tech  the Bush Administration called on the States to look at the financial barriers to getting their records into NICS  and on the Feds to help the states do so  This bill will help them do exactly that  Im just astonished that a very small number of my colleagues in the Senate wont see the urgency or importance here   When a person attempts to purchase a firearm  a background check is run through the National Instant Criminal Background  or NICS system  A NICS call center representative  or automated system  runs a check of several databases to see if the purchaser has a record prohibiting him or her from buying a gun under federal law  The majority of potential gun buyers are either approved or denied almost instantly  But if the computer search is unable to reach a final determination  a NICS representative will conduct a manual search for missing information that will allow NICS to make a final determination  In such a situation  the NICS representative must attempt to get the missing information by calling state and local courthouses  judges  clerks  or even law enforcement officers to get the information  If the NICS representative cannot get an answer in three days  the gun dealer automatically has permission to sell the gun to the buyer   A criminal background check is only as good as the records that the states provide to the system  Millions of criminal and mental health records are inaccessible to the NICS system  mostly because state and local governments lack the money to submit the records  Furthermore  the process is often spotty  as states are not required by law to turn over all pertinent information that could potentially prohibit a person from buying a gun  As a result  many people who simply should not have guns are allowed to purchase them   In 2002  Senator Schumer introduced very similar legislation to address the shortcomings of the NICS system in response to a tragic shooting that took place on New Yorks Long Island  On March 12  2002  a gunman by the name of Peter Troy entered the Our Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook during mass and gunned down a priest  Rev  Lawrence M  Penzes  and a parishioner  Eileen Tosner  Well before the murders  Troy had been hospitalized for paranoid schizophrenia and had been prescribed psychotropic medications  but after his release  county mental health workers lost track of him and improperly closed his case  Troy was later sentenced to life in prison   Many of the rules to do exactly that are already on the books  and the NICS system is key to ensuring that gun dealers know when not to sell a gun to a particular individual  Schumer added  In the case of the Virginia Tech shooting  Cho allegedly acquired the two firearms in two separate transactions  both within weeks of the massacre  Because no mental health information was in the system  he was able to pass his background checks   However  two years before buying the guns  Cho was accused of stalking two of his fellow female students at Virginia Tech  and had been civilly committed  At the time  a judge found that Cho present ed  an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness  He was then briefly admitted to a psychiatric facility for an overnight stay as an outpatient  This information was never conveyed to the federal government and never appeared on Chos background checks   This bill authorizes up to  400 million to state agencies and  125 million for state courts to upgrade their computers to ensure speedy delivery of information  Using a carrot and stick approach  states who poorly comply with the law will risk losing 5  of their funding under the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968  Significant incentives will be provided to states that have good reporting records  States who comply would be required to share informationsuch as an individuals relevant  disqualifying history of mental illnesswith the FBI  The law would also requires federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security to make their records available to the NICS database to ensure timely and thorough background checks of those who purchase guns  The bill also requires states to set up procedures whereby a person who previously had been deemed mentally ill can petition to regain the right to own a firearm   Federal law clearly prohibits the purchase of firearms by those who have been adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental health institution  Also forbidden from possessing guns are people who    Are subject to a court order restraining them from domestic violence     Are under indictment for  or have been convicted of a felony   Are fugitives from justice   Are users or addicts of controlled substances   Have been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor  Have been dishonorably discharged from the military   Are illegal aliens  or  Have renounced U S  Citizenship
