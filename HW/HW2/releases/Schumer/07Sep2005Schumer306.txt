IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 7  2005 With Shocking Gas Prices Throughout Upstate New York  Schumer To Call For Immediate Steps To Deliver Relief At The Pump

Small Businesses  Self Employed  Government Employees  And Workers Who Get Reimbursed By Employers  New Report Finds Average Upstate New York Family With 2 Cars Could Pay  1 977 More For Gas This Year  Hurricane Katrina Related Price G As gas prices continue to spiral out of control  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a new report showing how much New Yorkers will have to pay for gas this year  Schumer released county by county  detailing how much more New Yorkers in each county are paying for gas over last year  s prices  Schumer also called for immediate action to provide relief at the pump  including expanded swap of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves  an increase it the IRS mileage reimbursement formula  and a top to bottom FTC Investigation of the entire oil industry  examining gas stations  big four oil companies  and pipelines         We all know that there was a gas crisis before Katrina and now that crisis has been compounded into a full blown gasoline catastrophe     Schumer said  The effects of this disaster are being felt far and wide and in addition to the enormous personal devastation that people are feeling the economic implications for Katrina will be felt for many months and potentially years  Though we have not felt one drop of rain here in New York we have seen the prices of gasoline go through the roof  and they continue to soar  We need relief at the pump    and we need it now           In the immediate wake of Hurricane Katrina crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange quickly rose to a record breaking level of  70 85 per barrel and remained at unprecedented levels for several days  In addition  the average price at the pump in NYS was  3 34 on Tuesday   1 32 higher than September 6  2004       Schumer today released a new  showing how much more New Yorkers in each county are paying to for gas over last year  s prices  Specifically  Schumer found that based on the price of gas in each region of the state            This year the average two car family in the Capital Region will pay  2 235 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in Central New York will pay  2 157 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the Hudson Valley will pay  1 408 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the Rochester Finger Lakes area will pay  1 971 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the North Country will pay  2 446 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the Southern Tier will pay  2 159 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in Western New York will pay  2 051 above the high prices paid at the pump last year       Extended SPR Swap  Schumer today said the Administration should undertake a second round of sales from the Strategic Petroleum reserve to provide ongoing crude oil price relief  Yesterday  the Administration began the process of releasing some 30 million barrels of crude oil from its emergency stockpile for sale  in addition to loaning 9 5 million barrels to specific refiners  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds 700 million barrels of crude oil  Initiating another swap will help stabilize supply and prices even after the immediate shock of Hurricane Katrina wears off  Schumer said the SPR can and should be used as a lever to reduce record gas prices       Initiating a swap of oil from the SPR to increase the supply of oil is a proven way to reduce the price of gasoline and heating oil  In the fall of 2000  Schumer successfully convinced the Clinton Administration to swap 30 million barrels over 30 days  causing crude oil prices to quickly fall by over  6 per barrel and wholesale gasoline prices to fall  0 14 per gallon  Under a swap  the federal government could decide on a set quantity of oil to release from the SPR  and accepts bids from private companies for the rights to that oil  The companies would then bid on how much oil they are willing to return to the SPR at a later date  For example  if the federal government decided to release oil and a private company wanted to obtain 10 million barrels  the company could bid for the 10 million barrels by promising 15 million barrels to be returned to the SPR at a later date        IRS Mileage Reimbursement Formula  Citing the thousands of New Yorkers who are self employed  or who use their cars for work but do not get fully reimbursed for their costs  Schumer today proposed a temporary increase in all mileage reimbursement rates to 60 cents per mile  Right now  the Internal Revenue Service sets the mileage rate every year for determining how much of an individual  s travel costs can be deductible  For 2005  the standard mileage rates for the use of a car  including vans  pickups or panel trucks  has been set at 40 5 cents a mile for all business miles driven  up from 37 5 cents a mile in 2004  and 15 cents a mile when computing deductible medical or moving expenses  up from 14 cents a mile in 2004        According to the American Automobile Association  an average car driven 15 000 miles a year  the true cost is closer to 56 cents a mile    and this is before Hurricane Katrina raised fuel costs even further  Schumer  s proposal reflects the increase in gas prices and brings consistency to the tax code  Under the Schumer proposal  from September 1  2005 through December 31  2006  the 60 cents per mile rate would be set by law  rather than the IRS  and it would apply to businesses or charitable use  or moving or medical expenses        While these rates will have the most direct impact on people who are not directly reimbursed by their companies  many businesses use the IRS rate as a standard for mileage reimbursements to employees  So while benefits may be most targeted to the self employed  many others who use their personal vehicles for work will benefit as businesses alter their policies to reflect the new rate  According to a recent report by the Business Travel Coalition  78 percent of corporations  universities  and government entities surveyed establish their reimbursement rate based on the IRS formula  Ninety three percent of those surveyed had not increased their rate in light of the high gas prices        In addition  reports of the low reimbursement formula impacting volunteerism have surfaced throughout New York  including Catholic Family Center and Lifespan in Rochester  and Meals on Wheels  Currently  individuals who use their personal vehicles to provide services to a charitable organization can deduct 14 cents per mile but would be increased to 60 cents under Schumer  s proposal  Schumer will use his seat on the Senate Finance Committee to push this legislation either in bills addressing the Katrina disaster  a bill to address the rising costs of fuel and energy  or the tax reconciliation bill        Federal Trade Commission Investigation Into Price Gouging  In an effort to crackdown on any possible price gouging  Schumer today called on the Federal Trade Commission to launch a top to bottom investigation to make sure that oil companies and gas station owners and the pipeline in between them are operating ethically and within the law  Though the Federal Trade Commission already monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust violations in the petroleum industry  Schumer joined Senator Jon Corzine  D NJ  in calling for the immediate formation of a task force to promptly identify the many cases of price gouging being reported across the country  and asked that the task force formulate a process by which price gougers are swiftly prosecuted       There are currently no federal laws that specifically address price gouging  The state laws that do exist regarding price gouging are usually only triggered in situations arising from a declared emergency  Schumer and Corzine  in a letter to the FTC asked for the Commission  s recommendations on the most effective way to strengthen the federal government  s authority in this area       Increasing LIHEAP Funds  Yesterday  EIA Administrator Guy Caruso testified at the Senate Energy Committee that the price of heating oil could rise up 30  over last year and will be as natural gas being expensive as well  Schumer has urged the Administration to provide  900 million in Low Income Heating Energy Assistance funding to offset the dramatic increases in gas and energy prices in light of Hurricane Katrina  The Hurricane  combined with the unprecedented rise in energy prices could create a looming disaster for millions of seniors and low income families throughout New York who depend on the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  to heat their homes in the winter months        Click here to view
