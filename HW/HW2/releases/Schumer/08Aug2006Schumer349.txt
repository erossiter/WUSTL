IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 8  2006 As Senate Authorizes New Funding For Autism  Schumer Visits Renowned Wildwood School To Urge House To Do Same So Bill Can Become Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator  Joined By Leading Autism Researchers And Families Affected By the Autistic Spectrum  Announces the Passage of Senate Legislation Funding Autism Research  Education     Schumer Pushes House to Vote on Bipartisan Combating Autism Act  Which Would Provide  860 Million In New Funding Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer toured the Capital Region  s Wildwood School  a renowned school for students between the ages of 3 to 21 with neurological impairments  complex learning disabilities  autism and other neurologically based developmental disorders and announced the Senate s unanimous approval of the Combating Autism Act  which would authorize  860 million over five years to increase and coordinate federal autism research and education   Late last Thursday  the bill unanimously passed the Senate   Now Schumer will push the House of Representatives to do the same so that the bill can become a law  The Combating Autism Act  would authorize  860 million over five years to increase and coordinate federal research and education about autism  Nationwide  autism has a tremendous impact on the lives of children and their families   The rate of autism diagnoses has grown in the past few decades  with 1 out of every 166 children now being diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder         Autism is a nationwide epidemic that has lived in the shadows for too long     Schumer said     The Wildwood School and facilities like it across the country help thousands of children and their families every year cope with the devastating affects of autism  but they need more help   Our bill would not only provide critical funds to schools and other organizations as they help families affected by autism receive counseling and education  but would also give public and private researchers the tools they need to find a cure for this terrible disease          Wildwood Programs began in 1966 when a group of parents frustrated with the lack of services for their children with complex learning disabilities  autism and other developmental disabilities decided to work together to create a new program  Today  Wildwood Programs provides a comprehensive continuum of resources including education  employment services  residential services  recreation  counseling or service coordination  Working collaboratively with families  Wildwood Programs empowers and enables children and adults with neurologically based learning disabilities  autism and other developmental disorders to live independent  productive and fulfilling lives  They employ 650 people and serve about 800 children  adolescents  adults and their families in Albany  Schenectady  Rensselaer  Saratoga  Columbia  Greene  Fulton  Montgomery  Schoharie  Warren  Washington  and Otsego Counties        While Wildwood Programs provides outstanding services to its students  in general there are not enough resources for children with special needs in New York State   1 700 kids a year are placed at facilities outside New York State  at a cost of  2 million to  3 million a year         In addition  studies by the U S  Centers for Disease Control   Prevention suggest that the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders has significantly increased  from approximately four in 10 000 children born in the early 1990s to as many as one in every 166 children born today  Despite its strikingly high prevalence  autism research remains one of the least funded areas of medical research by both public and private sources  Currently  the causes of autism are unknown and there are no specific medical treatments for autism  or a cure   Furthermore  physicians have no blood test or diagnostic scan that can definitively diagnose autistic spectrum disorders       The Combating Autism Act would create a national education program for doctors and the public about autism  provide grants for statewide autism screening  create a new National Institutes of Health  NIH  center of excellence for autism research  and create a nationwide data clearinghouse   Additionally  the bill would increase the collaboration of individuals and groups who are working on autism  extend the activities of the Autism Coordinating Committee that manages the efforts of various federal health agencies  and require the NIH to create a strategic plan to combat autism       Schumer was joined today by Joe Fitzgerald  Chairman of the Board and parent of an autistic child and Pamela Karathomas  Vice President of the Board for the Albany chapter of the Autism Society of America
