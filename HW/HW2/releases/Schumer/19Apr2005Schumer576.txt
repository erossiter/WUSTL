IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 19  2005 Schumer Announces Major Increase Coming For Tax Free Commuter Benefit  Clears Big Hurdle In Senate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Schumer Amend  Passes  Will Increase Transit Benefit for Commuters by 50     Moynihan Conceived Commuter Tax Relief Idea Will Encourage More Commuters to Take Mass Transit    Especially LIRR  MetroNorth As subway fares in New York City continue to rise and commuting into and out of Manhattan costs passengers millions of dollars every year  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced the passage of his amendment to this year  s tax title of the multi billion dollar Transportation Reauthorization Bill which increases the qualified tax free transit benefit from  105 to  155 dollars  Schumer said that raising the transit benefit will simultaneously reduce traffic  congestion and smog while saving New York  s commuters hundreds of dollars every year  Under current law  employers are able to offer employees a transit benefit  tax free up to  105 dollars to cover transit costs    the Schumer amendment would increase this benefit by almost 50  and also provides the cash strapped MTA with a steady  predictable revenue stream        The mass transit subsidy program has been a great success and great for New York     said Schumer   This huge increase in the benefit rewards commuters who choose mass transit and makes drivers think twice about getting in their cars  For commuters who use the LIRR and Metro North  this increase could mean hundreds of dollars per year in savings        The transit and parking benefits  originally conceived by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  allow employees get this transit benefit tax free  and it allows employers to offer the benefit tax free  The transit benefit saves commuters on average over  30 a month and reduces their commuting expenses by a third or more  Employers save on payroll taxes on the amount that their employees use on a pre tax basis for their transit commute expenses       According to a survey by The Transit Center  a leading advocate for increasing the transit benefit and creator of the nation  s first transit voucher  24  of MetroNorth  25  of Long Island Railroad  and 18  of NYC Transit  s daily riders take advantage of commuter benefit programs       The transit benefit currently saves companies over  90 a year on each employee  In the New York metro area alone  commuters will save cumulatively over  150 million this year  Employers have saved significantly as well  over  35 million since the benefit went into effect in the New York area  The added subsidy will not only benefit employees  but will also provide additional tax relief for businesses who contribute to their employees   deductions and will encourage employers to become involved in the transit choices of their worker       Schumer  s amendment would not only provide hundreds of dollars in savings to commuters  but also encourage more drivers to choose mass transit  The bill brings the mass transit subsidy far closer to the  200 set aside for employee parking expenses  increasing the incentive to take mass transit  The benefit increase would go a long way in reducing traffic delays in and around New York City  which have increased by 158  since 1982       Schumer continued    I will continue to fight to bring the transit benefit up to par with the parking benefit to give commuters more incentive to travel using mass transit  This significant transit benefit increase will decrease traffic woes  reduce pollution  s impact on public health  and make New York a more livable place          Schumer emphasized that increasing the transit benefit is a low cost way to get more cars off the road and more commuters in to existing and expanding mass transportation systems  By increasing ridership  the transit benefit creates a steady and reliable source of income mass transit operators can rely on to maintain and grow their systems  In addition to the cost savings for New York  s commuters  raising the transit benefit and providing a greater incentive for people to use mass transit is sound environmentally       Schumer expressed confidence that more employers will offer the expanded benefit  In 1998  for example  the  65 federal transit benefit was clarified in the tax code and then raised automatically in 2002 to  100 and New York City Transportation authorities created the unlimited ride   63 MetroCard  the number of companies offering transit subsidies increased from 8 000 to 13 000 in just two years        Simply stated  the daily commute on the LIE is a nightmare and the commute from White Plains and elsewhere in the Hudson Valley is tedious  Thousands of commuters are looking for a better way   said Schumer   If we can make mass transit financially attractive  many commuters will be more than happy to leave their car keys at home         MetroNorth routes and how much the new monthly transit benefit would cover      Station Monthly Costs Coverage at  105 month Coverage at  155 month  Harlem  148 54 71  100
