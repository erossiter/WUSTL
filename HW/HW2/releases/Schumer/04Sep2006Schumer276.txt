                             Annual Report Thoroughly Analyzes a Dozen Areas  Failing Grades for Mass Transit Security  First Responder Grants and Detection Devices   Far too Little Accomplished on Protecting Highly Vulnerable Mass Transit  Port and Trucking Systems   Schumer Proposes Five Steps the President Can Take Today to Make America More Secure Five years after the 9 11 attacks  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released a new comprehensive homeland security  revealing that despite a national focus on homeland security in the wake of the attacks  the Bush Administration and the Department of Homeland Security have left America dangerously vulnerable  Schumer  s report evaluated and gave grades for 12 different critical security areas  including port  rail  truck  cyber security and intelligence gathering  rating the government  s overall effort a   C    and issuing failing grades for progress made in detection devices  mass transit security and distributing first responder funding  In a personal letter to President George W  Bush  Schumer also proposed five immediate steps the President can take today that would make America more secure         Are we safer now than we were five years ago  Absolutely  But  are we as safe as we should be  The answer is no     Schumer said    This Administration made us a promise five years ago  that they would do everything they could to make our homeland safer  These efforts have been hampered by rampant under funding and budget cuts  poor management of political programs  bureaucratic tangles and political deal making  Needless to say  that promise remains unfulfilled          Since 9 11  there has been a dramatic spike in terrorist activity and though the U S  has not been attacked since 9 11  recent revelations of threats of a cyanide gas attack on the New York City subway system and a plot to smuggle liquid explosives on multiple flights bound for the U S   show the threats facing New York City and the entire country are as real and diverse than ever       In his report  one of Schumer  s highest grades of B  was given for aviation security to acknowledge the progress the government has made securing airports and domestic flights  The installation of hardened cockpit doors on all domestic flights and positioning federal air marshals on more flights have made the possibility of terrorists pulling off a 9 11 style attack again unlikely  However  failing and near failing grades for port  mass transit  and biosecurity show that the Administration has focused primarily on responding the previous attack at the expense of preventing the next one       Schumer said one area where DHS and the Administration had been particularly deficient was in developing new explosive  chemical  biological  and radiological detection and screening equipment  In all areas of security  development of new detection technology has been dangerously slow  with advanced bomb detectors for mass transit systems still on the drawing board and nuclear container scanners at ports more likely to pick up kitty litter and lemons than a nuclear device       To close these gaping security holes  Schumer has led the fight to reform the first responder and high threat grant process to ensure funding is given out based only on risk and threat  increase funding for research and development  institute a revolutionary and comprehensive screening system at ports in the U S  and around the world  and beef up air cargo security and chemical security       In addition to these and other on going efforts  Schumer today sent a letter to President George W  Bush recommending five steps the President can take today to make America more secure  These steps are immediate directives the President can give to various agencies within the federal government            First  the President should issue an executive order directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to complete the long overdue Comprehensive Terrorist Threat Assessment  Although the FBI promised to deliver this assessment to Congress since 1999  it has not been completed  The President should direct the FBI to complete it immediately  Even the DOJ Inspector General agrees that without such an assessment  America cannot be sure that the FBI is actually using its resources in the most effective way            Second  the President should make DHS mass transit security directives mandatory and request significant funding from Congress to help operators implement the directives  In May of 2004  DHS issued voluntary security recommendations to transit operators nationwide  The guidelines suggested operators improve safety by installing transparent bomb resistant trash cans  deploying additional officers  and installing security cameras  The attacks on London  s subway system last summer made clear that these directives are too critical to be optional            Third  the President should deploy the Coast Guard task force to inspect the nation  s top 10 busiest ports to check if they are in compliance with federal requirements and facility security plans  Ports  port facilities  and vessels were tasked with developing comprehensive security and incident response plans under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002  These plans were completed over two years ago  but DHS has not effectively ensured that the plans  or other federal regulations  are being followed  Merely including security measures in a facility plan is not enough to ensure our safety    the Coast Guard must do more to verify compliance            Fourth  the President should direct the TSA to issue a new aviation security guideline that requires ID checks at the gate before a passenger boards a commercial flight   In simple steps  a terrorist can easily buy a boarding pass with a stolen credit card number and board a flight   There needs to be a second ID check at the gate to ensure the name on the ticket matches the name of the person boarding the flight            Fifth  the President should require all agencies  whose wireless networks contain information highly valuable to terrorists  to immediately follow security recommendations issued by the FBI   For example  despite the President  s pledge to secure federal wireless local area networks  a 2005 GAO report concluded that federal agencies had failed to implement all key security elements for wireless networks  At the six agencies tested  the wireless networks in use were not secure  Nine federal agencies had not even issued policies regarding wireless networks  Eighteen of 24 federal agencies had no wireless security training for employees and contractors       Below are highlights of Schumer  s report      Port Security  GRADE  D  After the 9 11 attacks revealed to the nation that seaports around the country were an easy access point for terrorists to smuggle a nuclear weapon into the United States  the government moved to strengthen port security by setting specific requirements for perimeter protection and employee identification  expanding customs screening programs in the United States and around the world  and developing advanced and rapid nuclear screening technology for cargo  Unfortunately  five years later  none of these goals have been fully achieved      Mass Transit Security  GRADE  F  Mass transit systems have been a prime target for terrorists for decades  Yet prior to 9 11  subways  buses  and long distance trains in New York and across the country were left woefully unprotected  Despite the obvious threat  many stations were not equipped with closed circuit security camera systems and bomb detectors were only deployed in extraordinary circumstances        In the wake of the 9 11 attacks  local and federal law enforcement stepped up police presence at stations and deployed bomb sniffing dog teams  but other than that  there was no advanced technology available to immediately detect the presence of a nuclear  biological  chemical  or explosive device  DHS has only issued voluntary guidelines for transit operators  Currently  bomb detection technology is still in the early testing phases and is too slow to be used in on busy systems      Intelligence  GRADE  C   Following 9 11  both the 9 11 Commission and the Joint Inquiry of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees concluded that the U S  counterterrorism effort leading up to the attack was hampered by lack of cooperation and information sharing across agencies  by insufficient strategic analysis of al Qaeda  and by shortcomings in our domestic intelligence capabilities        Congress and the President have carried out many of the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  such as the creation of a National Counterterrorism Center  the appointment of a high level Director of National Intelligence  and the development of a national security workforce within the FBI  Unfortunately  these bureaucratic reforms have yet to live up to expectations and new intelligence technology projects have routinely been overdue and over budget      Truck Security  GRADE  C  Terrorists have used trucks to attack Americans around the world and on our own soil    in New York City at the World Trade Center in 1993  in Oklahoma City  and at our military compound in Dhahran  Saudi Arabia  Prior to 9 11  the government did very little to track shipments of hazardous materials or perform background checks for any of the drivers who haul these materials        Today  many of our nation  s larger trucking companies have voluntarily placed GPS tracking devices on their trucks  Yet there is no federal requirement that trucks be equipped with GPS technology  and there is no federal center to track truck shipments across the country  Moreover  DHS has stated that it will take at least three more years to run background checks on drivers who transport hazardous materials       Aviation Security  B   In the immediate aftermath of the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  Congress acted quickly to address the gaping holes in our aviation security system and passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act  which created the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  and a federalized force of security screeners to inspect passengers and luggage   Post 9 11 security upgrades also included in flight measures  such as the expansion of the Federal Air Marshal Service  FAMS  and the installation of hardened cockpit doors       Despite these efforts  weaknesses still exist  a July 2006 Congressional Research Service  CRS  report concludes that airport screener performance is still in need of improvement  This and other analyses show that TSA is not able to do enough with the equipment and resources it currently has       Detection Devices  GRADE  F  Before the 9 11 attacks  research and development in to advanced bomb detection technology was limited  focusing primarily on keeping metal objects off of airplanes  When DHS was created  the Department included a Science and Technology directorate to oversee critical technological development projects  However  in all areas of security  progress has been dangerously slow  with advanced explosive detectors for mass transit systems still on the drawing board and nuclear container scanners at ports more likely to pick up kitty litter and lemons than a nuclear device      Spread of Nuclear Materials  GRADE  C   Since 9 11  the most terrifying attack on the minds of Americans and homeland security experts is the possibility of nuclear device being detonated in major city   After the Cold War  countless stockpiles of unused Russian nuclear weapons were left unprotected and vulnerable to theft by terrorists or resale by rogue states like Iran and North Korea  The United States government  s primary program to recover and secure these weapons  known as Nunn Lugar  has so far collected half of the known nuclear weapons stockpiles   However  the Bush Administration has cut funding for this critical program even though its vital task has not been completed      First Responder Grants  GRADE  F  After 9 11 and DHS was created  the Department began dolling out billions of dollars in grants to first responders and high threat urban areas to help them protect and respond to another terrorist attack   Unfortunately  these critical funds have terribly mismanaged and have not been given to the areas that face the greatest risk and threat      Nuclear Plant Security  GRADE  B   For each nuclear energy facility in the United States  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  sets security standards  defines a level of attack that the facility must be able to repel  known as the Design Basis Threat  DBT   and conducts regular inspections  While there is still room for improvement  nuclear plants have long been strictly regulated and improvements are ongoing  Remaining areas of concern are the enforcement of existing security standards and preparedness for nuclear incidents      Biosecurity  GRADE  C   Though the US has never been hit with chemical or biological attack  the attacks of 9 11 showed the country that terrorists will use any means necessary to cause destruction  DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services established a comprehensive program to protect the country from a biological attack by creating stockpiles of medicine and antidotes  Unfortunately  the effort is understaffed  under funded  and poorly managed      Chemical Plant Security  GRADE  D  Chemical facilities across the country produce and process some of the most dangerous materials known to man and many of these plants are located near densely populated areas  Since 9 11  many major chemical companies have taken the initiative and voluntarily instituted tough security programs  However  because DHS has not issued final security regulations and standards  many plants remain vulnerable      Cyber Security  GRADE  C   Terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda  Hamas and Hezbollah  who previously used the Internet for fundraising  communication and propaganda  are now suspected of using the Internet to develop advanced cyber weapons to attack US systems  After 9 11  the Administration issued cyber security standards for federal networks and created the position of Cyber Security Czar  However  the standards remain unfulfilled and the position  more than a year after being created  is still vacant
