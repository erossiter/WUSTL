IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 2  2007 Schumer Reveals Cuts To Cops Grants And Safe Schools Program Could Cost Upstate Law Enforcement Millions   Programs Have Prevented An Estimated 35 000 Criminal Incidents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Administration s Budget Slashes Federal Funding for School Safety and Eliminates COPS Program  after Rash of Shootings at VA Tech and Public Places across the Country   Senator Announces Plan to Require New Campus Safety Assessments  Restore Cuts  and Increase Direct Resources to Keep Upstate NY Schools and Streets Safe   COPS Program Has Sent Upstate New York Law Enforcement Mor In the wake of the tragic shootings at Virginia Tech and a recent rash of violence in public places  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today blasted Administration budget cuts to critical crime programs that have sent upstate New York law enforcement hundreds of millions of federal dollars  The COPS and Secure Our Schools programs provide invaluable resources to schools and local law enforcement to put more cops on the street and keep schools safe from random acts of violence  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that for every dollar spent through the COPS program per resident  crime fell by almost 30 incidents per 100 000 residents        The bottom line is schools and police forces are on edge these days and are actively reviewing safety and security plans   Schumer said   However  when they look at the bottom line  they may come up short without this funding   For schools  this could mean cut backs in vital education programs or other safety measures  The horrific violence at Virginia Tech was a painful wake up call that we need to be doing more to make our schools safe  No student should have to fear for his or her safety while attending class  This bill will help restore our shaken confidence by taking necessary steps to improve school safety        Schumer said that despite the success of these important programs  the current Administration budget drastically reduces funding for successful state and local law enforcement programs   An overwhelming success  COPS placed nearly 118 000 officers on the street in more than 13 000 communities across the country   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that for every dollar spent on COPS hiring per resident  crime fell by almost 30 incidents per 100 000 residents        Today  Schumer released a new  showing that the COPS program has sent upstate New York communities  115 229 602 since 1995  Using the formula devised by the GAO  this translates to prevention of roughly 34 569 criminal incidents throughout upstate New York            Communities in Western New York have received  27 493 733 from the COPS program  which has prevented an estimated 8 248 crimes            Communities in the Southern Tier have received  4 715 720 from the COPS program  which has prevented an estimated 1 415 crimes            Communities in the North Country have received  4 345 207 from the COPS program  which has prevented an estimated 1 304 crimes            Communities in the Hudson Valley have received  32 534 754 from the COPS program  which has prevented an estimated 9 760 crimes            Communities in the Rochester Finger Lakes Region have received  12 364 946 from the COPS program  which has prevented an estimated 3 709 crimes            Communities in Central New York have received  15 716 903 from the COPS program  which has prevented an estimated 4 715 crimes            Communities in the Capital Region have received  18 058 339 from the COPS program  which has prevented an estimated 5 418 crimes       Despite this success  since 2001  the Administration has cut funding for state and local law enforcement programs by more than fifty percent  including COPS   In 1997 and 1998  approximately  1 2 billion dollars were spent each year by the federal government to hire new police officers under COPS   After steady decreases over the last five years  funding for COPS hiring has fallen to zero  This year  the Administration again has proposed eliminating the program altogether       From a high of  180 million in 2002  the Secure Our Schools Program has also been steadily reduced until funding was completely eliminated for FY 2006  and it is zeroed out in this year s budget  The Secure Our Schools Program is a voluntary  matching grant program that affords municipalities the opportunity to apply for federal funding for school safety grants  The grants can be used for metal detectors  locks  improved lighting  other deterrent measures  school security assessments  and security training for students and personnel  The federal government pays for 50 percent of the cost of the security measures  with the state or local government covering the remainder of the cost        The Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program was created in 1994 as a part of the Crime Bill to combat a national crime crisis by revolutionizing state and local law enforcement  enabling policy officials to deploy new crime fighting technologies  developing innovative policing methods  and hiring new officers         To ensure that local law enforcement and upstate New York schools have the resources they need to keep out communities safe  Schumer today announced a new plan to restore these devastating cuts and expand the programs upstate New York communities depend on            Restore Budget Cuts   Schumer today sent a letter to the Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations committee asking that cuts to the program be restored and that the entire COPS program  which includes Safe Schools  be funding at  1 15 billion for FY 2008  the full authorized level         Campus Safety Assessments   Schumer today announced that he  along with Senator Barbara Boxer   D CA  have made changes to their School Safety Enhancements Act of 2007  The Senators first introduced in February to help ensure better security at America s schools  The new provisions of the bill specifically would require each college and university that receives federal student aid funding to conduct an annual campus safety assessment in consultation with local law enforcement officials   The bill would also require each college and university to develop and implement a campus emergency response plan to address law enforcement emergencies such as active shooter situations and bomb threats  as well as terrorist attacks and natural disasters          Expand Safe Schools   The School Safety Enhancement Act improves the Secure Our Schools program  which is currently administered by the Department of Justice through the COPS program   The bill would increase the program authorization from  30 million a year to  50 million a year and increase the federal share of covering the costs of these programs from 50  to 80   The bill would also add surveillance equipment  tiplines hotlines  and capital improvements to the list of approved uses of grant funds  money may already be used for metal detectors and locks  and create an inter agency task force between the Justice Department and the Department of Education to develop and publish advisory school safety guidelines
