IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 24  2006 Schumer Blasts DHS For Dragging Its Feet On Chemical Plant Security  Particularly Important On Staten Island Following Last Week  s Reports Of Noxious Fumes Sickening SI Residents                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Schumer Announces Comprehensive Plan to Secure Chemical Facilities  Including New Nationwide Standards and Protections   Located Directly Across from New Jersey  s   Chemical Corridor     Thousands of Staten Island Residents Could be in Danger if Chem Plants Attacked  Potential Plume from South Kearney Chlorine Plant Would Harm Over 12 Million in Metro NY Region   Schumer  DHS is Pla While last week  s toxic fumes that sickened Staten Island residents served as a wake up call for New Yorkers of the enormous potential for disaster if terrorists were to attack the metropolitan area  s numerous chemical plants  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a comprehensive plan to secure chemical facilities by requiring Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to step up to the plate  including setting new national standards and providing support to companies complying with new security regulations  Since the 9 11 attacks  the Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly failed to mandate federal regulations to secure one of the nation  s most vulnerable terrorist targets         By twiddling its thumbs over securing the nation  s chemical plants  DHS has once again proven itself incompetent at securing our homeland  but frighteningly effective at endangering thousands of Staten Island residents     said Senator Schumer    Because we shouldn  t have to fear that the next smoking gun will be a cloud of toxic chemicals heading over the Arthur Kill  its well past time to implement only the toughest federal regulations          Staten Island sits directly across the Arthur Kill and Kill van Kull from New Jersey  s   chemical corridor     Due to its dense population of chemical plants  Northern New Jersey has the dubious honor of being home to   the most dangerous two miles in America     The Government Accountability Office reported that New Jersey has six chemical plants that can harm over a million people if attacked  While GAO withheld the facilities   names due to safety concerns  security experts believe the plants are located in the heavily populated two mile stretch between Newark Airport and Port Elizabeth  a short distance from Staten Island  A recent report issued by the New Jersey Work Environmental Council documented 19 chemical facilities in New Jersey  s Middlesex County  a county which sits directly across the Arthur Kill from Staten Island       The close proximity of New Jersey  s chemical plants to Staten Island leaves the island  s residents at risk to a terrorist attack on nearby chemical plants  According to the New Jersey Work Environmental Council report  the Kuehne Chemical plant in South Kearney  New Jersey would affect 12 million residents within a 14 mile radius  Thousands of Staten Island residents live within 12 miles of the plant  The Infineum USA plant located in Linden  NJ would affect approximately 4 2 million people living within a 14 mile radius including thousands of Staten Island residents who live within 8 miles  Staten Island has its own chemical plant complex in the Port Mobil storage facility in Charleston where a barge exploded during refueling in February 2003  killing two crew members and releasing black smoke over the area        Despite the alarming threat posed by the New York metropolitan area  s chemical plants  DHS has displayed a disturbing pattern of negligence and a lack of urgency towards upgrading security standards  A DHS report for developing a strategy for protecting the nation  s infrastructure  including a plan to protect the chemical plant industry  was long overdue  Finally released in June 2006  the DHS report titled    National Infrastructure Protection Plan     only established vague guidelines toward protecting the nation  s infrastructure and promised to issue industry specific plans in the following 6 months        While some facilities in the chemical industry are voluntarily addressing plant security  stringent national standards still need to be established and DHS still lacks the authority to effectively regulate facilities  A study released in January by GAO detailed the challenges industry officials face in preparing their facilities against terrorist attacks  including limited guidance on the level of security they should implement         Secretary Chertoff hit it dead on when he said   the terrorists aren  t planning to take this year off    so why is DHS on permanent vacation when it comes to chemical security     said Senator Schumer    Almost five years since the September 11th attacks  the clock has struck midnight and it  s high time we secure our nation  s most vulnerable terrorist targets          Today  Schumer championed new legislation to beef up chemical security in the New York Metropolitan area and across the country            First  Schumer is sponsoring the Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Act that requires DHS to issue new security rules for chemical plants and creates new regional offices to coordinate and monitor chemical plant security  Under the new rules  DHS would conduct a nationwide review and designate vulnerable chemical facilities that would be subject to new regulation  assign them to various risk based tiers  and establish performance based standards for each tier  Designated chemical facilities would be required to submit to DHS vulnerability assessments  security plans  and emergency response scenarios for terrorist incidents  DHS  other federal agencies  and state and local agencies would specifically be prohibited from releasing to the public  protected information  from the plans submitted by facilities  The bill  S  2145  has bipartisan sponsorship  including U S  Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT   A companion bill  HR  4999  has been introduced in the House by Representatives Christopher Shays  R CT  and Jim Langevin  D RI             Second  Schumer is pushing for a new provision requiring DHS to impose security regulations for chemical facilities within 6 months and setting tough penalties for any company found to violate those rules  The legislation includes civil penalties of up to  25 000  The regulations would apply to the highest risk facilities  but all facilities would have to meet minimum security standards and submit security plans to DHS  The legislation  offered by Senator Robert Byrd  D WV   was included in the Senate s version of Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill  but since there was no similar provision passed in the House  the legislation must be approved by the joint House Senate conference committee  Schumer said he is fighting to ensure the provision survives the conference and is included in the final legislation        Schumer is also the author of the High Risk Protection Act of 2006 that requires funding for high threat areas only be given out based on risk and threat  The bill would also eliminate the controversial peer review system  The legislation requires DHS to conduct a comprehensive review regarding the determination of high threat areas  evaluation of threats  vulnerabilities  and consequences  and consideration of any previous terrorist attacks  This first responder funding is critical to ensure that New York  s first responders have the equipment  technology  and training they need to prevent and respond to an attack on a chemical facility         The U S  is home to approximately 15 000 chemical plants that either utilize or store hazardous chemicals  and the Government Accountability Office  GAO  recently identified over 100 plants nationwide that if attacked are capable of threatening at least one million Americans  Its potential for causing mass destruction has made the nation  s chemical infrastructure a premier target for terrorists  Both the 9 11 Commission Report and the FBI  s National Infrastructure Protection Center  now in the Department of Homeland Security  have warned that Al Qaeda operatives may attempt to launch conventional attacks against the U S  chemical industrial infrastructure
