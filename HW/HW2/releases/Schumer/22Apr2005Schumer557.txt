IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 22  2005 Schumer  Staten Island In Midst Of Nursing Shortage   Unveils New Plan To Relieve Scarcity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Stands with local Nurses  Announces New Plan to Recapture Unused Visas for Nurses    15  of Hospitals in New York Have Shortage of Nurses  Without Schumer  s Initiative  They Can  t Provide Proper Services Standing at Staten Island University Hospital  which is facing a significant nurse shortage  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer introduced his plan to fill the nursing shortage in New York  This week Schumer introduced and successfully added an amendment to the emergency supplemental spending bill in the Senate that recaptured unused visas for nurses  physical therapists  and their dependents  This amendment does not create new visas  instead it makes sure that previously authorized visas  which would otherwise have expired and gone unused  are used in the areas that are most needed  Without this initiative  over 15  of hospitals in New York will not be able to provide these services any longer         In New York alone  if we don  t address the nursing shortage  15  of our hospitals won  t be able to provide the services they are expected to render  My amendment makes roughly half of the 140 000 EB 3 visas available for nurses to solve this problem     Schumer said       The United States is facing a serious nursing shortage  126 000 nurses are needed to fill vacancies across the country  and 75  of all hospital vacancies are for nurses  The State of New York alone has 17 000 nursing vacancies  For years the INS was unable to process the 140 000 Employment Based  EB  visa applications from skilled workers that Congress authorized each year because the agency was under funded and poorly organized  As a result of the backlog  141 000 EB 3 visas went unprocessed and unused from 2001 through 2004  Before September 11  Staten Island University Hospital had a contract to hire 60 nurses from abroad but because of visa problems they were unable to hire any of them  As a result they are still approximately 50 nurses short       When Congress transferred immigration authority to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  and provided DHS with significant new funds to streamline and reorganize the visa process  DHS    along with the State Department    developed the capacity to process these visas at a more rapid rate       Under Schumer  s plan  of the over 141 000 unused EB 3 visas  half of them would go to nurses  physical therapists  and their dependents  the other half would be available to all workers who qualify for EB 3 visas  high tech workers  engineers  computer scientists  and their dependents  The nursing shortfall in New York is expected to grow to 18 000 this year  Even with a recent increase in nursing school enrollments  there are not nearly enough new graduates each year to keep pace with the number of Registered Nurses needed all across this country       According to a U S  Department of Health and Human Services Report titled  Projected Supply  Demand  and Shortages of Registered Nurses  2000 2020   if the impending nursing shortage is not addressed and current trends continue  the national shortage will hit 29  by 2020  This projection in 2020 stems from an estimated 40 percent increase in demand between 2000 and 2020 with a 6 percent growth in supply       Some factors which contribute to the declining supply of nurses are the decrease in the number of nursing graduates since the early 90 s and a decline in enrollment in the last five years  In conjunction with the decline in graduates is the aging of the current nursing workforce  as the average age for nurses has climbed steadily in recent years with fewer recent nursing graduates entering the field  Additionally  nursing salaries play a role in the supply of nurses  The relative earnings for nurses has remained basically the same since 1991  The major factors causing the growth in demand of nurses include population growth and aging  increased demand for health care  and varying trends in health care financing   Supply versus Demand Projections for FTE Registered Nurses For New York State     Year Supply Demand Shortage   Shortage     2005 146 211 158 851  12 640  8   2010

demographics only get worse     Schumer said       In 2003 Schumer was a chief sponsor of the Nurse Reinvestment Act  P L  107 205  which provides scholarships to nursing students who agree to provide at least two years of service in a health care facility with a critical nursing shortage  It creates career ladders to help nurses and other health professionals advance in their careers  provides loan cancellation for nurses with advanced degrees in exchange for teaching at a school of nursing  improves nurse retention by promoting nurse involvement in organizational decision making  and provides specialized training for nurses       This Congress  Schumer has been leading the fight to invest adequate funding in these programs  Current funding levels fail to meet the growing need for nurses  In fiscal year 2004  the Health Resources and Services Administration  HRSA  was forced to turn away 82  of the applicants for the Nurse Education Loan Repayment Program  NELRP   and 98  of the applicants for the Nursing Scholarship program due to lack of adequate funding  He is calling for  24 millions dollars  bringing the total to  175 million for Title VIII nursing education       Today Schumer stood at Staten Island University Hospital with Nurses Justina Lansigan  Sandra O Keefe  Cindy Wou  Gemini Thomas  Laura Wenzel and Anthony Ferreri  President   CEO of Staten Island University Hospital and Chief of Nurse Recruiting  Yvette Veneziano
