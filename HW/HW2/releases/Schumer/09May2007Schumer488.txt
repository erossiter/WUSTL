                              Bulky Bureaucracy and Rules Favoring Chains Drove More than 220 Independent New York Pharmacies Out of Business Last Year Alone        Senator Announces New Plan to Level the Playing Field to Keep Mom and Pop Stores Alive        Schumer Report  There Are Less than 500 Independent Pharmacies Left In Upstate New York  35 in the Cap Region  39 Central New York  49 Rochester Finger L Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that the hundreds of independent and family run pharmacies in New York are in danger of going out of business as a direct result of Medicare Part D   The Medicare prescription drug program  which began in January of 2006  is not reimbursing pharmacies quickly enough or at high enough levels for them to stay out of the red   Pharmacies often wait over a month for a reimbursement from the Medicare drug plans  and too often the reimbursement rates do not even come close to covering the ever increasing cost of dispensing drugs to fill a Medicare beneficiary s prescription   With costs rising and reimbursements coming too late and not covering enough of the cost  many Upstate pharmacies have been forced to take out loans simply to keep their doors open         If we don t act fast  the mom and pop pharmacy will be a thing of the past   Schumer said   Pharmacies should not have to choose between keeping their businesses afloat and serving Medicare beneficiaries  Mom and pop pharmacies are the backbones of many communities and shouldn t have to wait in line behind the big chains   The legislation that I am pushing will level the playing field to protect community pharmacies in upstate New York and across the country         In December 2003  Congress passed The Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003  which created the Medicare drug program   As some analysts predicted when the Medicare drug program started in 2006  a number of independent pharmacies have had to close their doors because of slow payments  inadequate reimbursements  and the inability to retain customers who use the program to pay for their prescription medications        Schumer said the same cumbersome bureaucracy that has confused millions of seniors in upstate New York and across the country has also stifled the small independent pharmacy   First and foremost  processing reimbursements for prescriptions takes a significant amount of time and advanced technology   While chain pharmacies have intricate on line networks that streamline the process  independent pharmacies sometimes lack the resources to process reimbursements efficiently         Medicare drug plans now tend to take about six weeks to reimburse a pharmacy for a dispensed drug  It used to take seven to 15 days  Some independent pharmacies have had to take out loans to compensate for the resulting cash flow problems          Schumer today said that all of these factors have caused a chilling effect for the independent pharmacy industry   According to the National Community Pharmacists Association  90 percent of independent pharmacists report that their overall cash flow is worse now than before Part D began  and 33  said that they have considered closing their pharmacy as a result         Independent and community pharmacies are also negatively affected because unlike large chains  they lack the purchasing power to buy drugs in bulk at a lower price  thus they are disproportionately hurt by the low and tardy reimbursements         Despite the statewide shortage in pharmacists  pharmacy owners are finding themselves having to lay off pharmacists  technicians and delivery drivers  while also cutting back on hours   Many community pharmacies are no longer open on Sundays  and many more have cut back hours on Saturdays  closing at 6 00 p m  as opposed to 9 00 p m          Schumer today released a new   showing that last year  221 independent pharmacies closed their doors in New York State  These numbers represent a community  sole proprietor  pharmacy that either went out of business or was acquired by a large chain  An additional 40 independent pharmacies are in the process of being bought out  Right now  according to the New York State Board of Pharmacy  there are only 477 community pharmacies left in Upstate New York        The numbers below show how many independent pharmacies are left in each region of Upstate New York          There are only 35 community pharmacies left in the Capital Region  three fewer than last year           There are only 39 community pharmacies left in Central New York  four fewer than last year           There are only 49 community pharmacies left in the Rochester Finger Lakes region  five fewer than last year           There are only 206 community pharmacies left in the Hudson Valley  24 fewer than last year           There are only 26 community pharmacies left in the North Country  two fewer than last year           There are only 33 community pharmacies left in the Southern Tier  three fewer than last year           There are only 89 community pharmacies left in Western New York  nine fewer than last year           Upstate New York s independent pharmacies serve a higher proportion of Medicare beneficiaries than chain pharmacies  and they typically serve multi county areas  often up to a 45 mile radius   When an independent pharmacy is forced to cut services such as delivery or reduce its hours  many customers  especially the elderly and disabled  are faced with few alternatives        Additionally  due to the fact that most community pharmacies are located in poorer  rural areas  independent pharmacies typically have to fill a larger percentage of Medicare prescriptions than big chains do   This means that the vast majority of their transactions have to go through this time consuming and cost intensive Medicare reimbursement process  In addition  92 percent of the business at independent pharmacies comes from prescription drugs  so they can not make up the losses in front end store sales   Both of these factors results in the Medicare drug plan disproportionately impacting independent pharmacies        To protect mom and pop pharmacies and level the playing field  Schumer today announced that he will push legislation that would help independent pharmacists bear the burden of the Medicare drug plan   This legislation would help independent pharmacists get their reimbursements faster by requiring prompt payment  within 14 days for claims submitted electronically  and 30 days for claims submitted otherwise  by prescription drug plans  PDPs  and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans  MA PD Plans    It also requires the payment of interest should the deadline not be met within the applicable number of days        The bill  to be authored by Senator Max Baucus  will also require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set reasonable dispensing fees for covered Medicare Part D drugs dispensed by participating pharmacies  and encourage the use of generic drugs by paying an increased dispensing fee for generics   The bill would also establish a 24 hour toll free hotline for all pharmacists and pharmacy staff  dedicated to disseminating information with regard to Medicare prescription drug benefit information        Last year  Senator Schumer was a co sponsor of the legislation introduced by Senator Max Baucus  D MT  titled the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act  which would have helped community pharmacies maintain their financial livelihood by mandating prompt and fair payments to pharmacies
