IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 13  2007 Schumer Unveils New Approach To Immediately Amend FAA Airspace Redesign Plan To Significantly Reduce Airplane Noise Over Westchester And Rockland                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Senator Pushes the FAA to Promptly Alter Draft Plan to Raise Altitude of Planes Set to Fly over the Two Counties to at least 10 000 Feet Schumer s Plan Will Mitigate Noise and Pollution Levels and Avoid the Lengthy NEPA Review Process   Allowing FAA to Amend the Redesign within 90 Days U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a plan to have the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  promptly amend its Airspace Redesign Plan by raising the altitude to above 10 000feet for all flights slated to travel over Westchester and Rockland counties  Schumers announcement comes as the FAA is finalizing its redesign plan to reduce air congestion nationally and in the Tri state area  The plan sets new flight paths for aircraft over parts of Westchester and Rockland Counties  which could increase noise and pollution over some residential neighborhoods    Schumers new plan will significantly reduce noise and pollution impacts by raising the flight altitudes  And  because raising the flight altitude does not involve extraordinary circumstances  it is considered a categorical exclusion  allowing the FAA to avoid the lengthy National Environmental Policy Act  NEPA  process and to incorporate the change into the redesign plan within 90 days    This is a golden opportunity for the FAA to use its flexibility to alter the proposed Airspace Redesign Plan so its impact on neighborhoods across the region will be minimized  said Senator Schumer  My plan will immediately raise the altitude ceiling for planes to over 10 000 feet  which will significantly reduce noise and pollution impacts on Rockland and Westchester communities  The FAA has the power to make this happen with the stroke of a pen  and I will push to make sure they do just that before the plan is implemented   The FAAs redesign plan includes new flight paths that will usher in an increase in air traffic over Rockland and Westchester Counties  In some cases  under the proposed plan  local residents could see as many as 600 flights a day fly over their communities  The majority of the flights would travel in a corridor which runs between Suffern and Hillcrest in Rockland County  and includes the communities of Wesley Hills  Montebello  Kaser  Monsey  Chestnut Ridge and Pearl River  In Westchester  new flight patterns will bring additional air traffic over parts of Yonkers  Hawthorne  Thornwood  Peekskill  North Salem  Pound Ridge  Scarsdale and Chappaqua   Local residents are concerned that with planes flying as low as 6 000 8 000 feet above the ground in Rockland and 6 000 10 000 feet in Westchester  communities throughout the two counties will experience a significant rise in noise levels particularly in areas that previously were never exposed to air traffic  Many residents fear the spike in the number of planes flying overhead could lead to an overall reduction in the quality of life by increasing noise and pollution levels  Schumer contends that the FAA has failed to adequately take into account the concerns of residents in Rockland and Westchester Counties regarding the effects that the proposed Redesign changes will bring   Residents in these communities have gotten short shrift from the FAA  said Senator Schumer  Raising the altitude ceilings will reduce noise and pollution and address their justified quality of life concerns without compromising the redesign plans overall objectives    To protect local residents quality of life  Schumer today unveiled a plan for the FAA to implement which would adjust the original redesign plan by raising the flight ceiling above 10 000 feet  The plan is designed to ease any impact a spike in flights over Rockland and Westchester Counties will have on residents  And by raising the flight ceiling  but maintaining the direction of the actual flight route  other sections of the county wont be subjected to the change    Schumers change would qualify as a categorical exclusion  meaning the amendment could be studied without going through the cumbersome NEPA process  According to FAA guidelines  actions involving the modification of airspace and air traffic procedures conducted at 3 000 feet or more above ground level typically qualify as categorical exclusions  Although categorical exclusions can be denied if environmental controversy exists  Schumers proposed change in altitude will not alter the flight path  which could add new environmental concerns  Instead  it calls for an adjustment in the ceiling to raise flight altitudes  If the altitude change is accepted as a categorical exclusion  this amendment can be incorporated into the redesign plan within as few as 90 days  ensuring that it will be included when the FAA begins implementing other redesign changes   An amendment to the redesign plan will provide significant noise relief for these communities without posing additional environmental concerns  and today Im calling on the FAA to immediately study raising the altitudes and implement this change as swiftly as possible  added Schumer     Earlier this month Schumer sent a letter to the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  demanding that the agency answer seven concerns the Senator had on how Rockland and Westchester residents would be affected under the implementation of the Airspace Redesign Plan    Schumer has repeatedly called on the FAA to ensure that local concerns are adequately expressed and considered in the Airspace Redesign Project  Time and again  he has pushed the FAA to alleviate air traffic issues by maximizing the number of air traffic comptrollers  which are chronically under staffed at area airports  In early July  he sent a letter to FAA Administrator Marion Blakey to schedule additional meetings in the New York metropolitan area in order to hear the concerns of local residents  In his letter he expressed that he understood that the priority of the redesign project was efficiency  but that the FAA could not overlook the fact that increased efficiency and increased traffic would mean an increase in air traffic noise and pollution for many communities in Rockland and Westchester Counties   In July of this year  Schumer called for Blakey s resignation due to her inability to effectively lead the FAA Schumer wrote to Secretary Peters in an attempt to secure firm leadership and hard answers on this aviation related issue
