North Country     said Schumer    Firefighters and emergency professionals put their lives on the line every day and it is imperative that we do everything we can to provide them with everything they need to do their jobs safely and effectively  These grants are an enormous step in the right direction          In Franklin County  two grants were awarded for a total of  102 716 for fire operations

356  and Lyons Falls Fire Department   89 063  in Lewis County  The grants were part of the initial round of fire grants in FY05  with more to come       A Schumer analysis of the Administration s federal budget for FY05 found that cuts to the program could shortchange New York fire departments by  16 million  In March  Schumer urged the Congress and the White House to bolster the Administration s proposal by sending the full  900 million promised to fire departments by Congress       At Schumer s urging  fire departments and emergency services providers across New York have taken advantage of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  which sends funds directly for activities such as specialized emergency response training for situations like terrorist attacks  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  new fire trucks  and fire prevention programs        If ever our local fire departments needed an infusion of cash from the federal government  that time is now   Schumer said   Budget gaps are worse than they ve been in a long time with little relief in sight  and the strain on local fire departments is becoming too much to bear  Add to that the heightened alert our first responders are on because of the war  and this opportunity for fire departments to get financial support is just what the doctor ordered        The grant program  called the USFA Grants to Firefighters Program  awards grants directly to fire departments to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public  as well as that of firefighting personnel  facing fire and fire related hazards        The USFA awards the grants on a competitive basis to the applicants that most closely address the program s priorities and demonstrate financial need  Funding is available for activities such as specialized emergency response training for situations like terrorist attacks  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  and fire prevention programs
