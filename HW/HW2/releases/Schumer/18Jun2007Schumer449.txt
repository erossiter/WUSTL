IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 18  2007 Schumer  New Revelation  Hundreds Of Thousands Of New Yorkers  Private Health And Prescription Records Being Sold Without Consent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Every time a Pharmacy is Bought or Closed  Customer List is Up for Grabs and Can Be Sold for Big Bucks   Social Security Numbers  Past Prescriptions  and Medical Histories All Able to Be Released without Consent or Notification    Schumer  Prescription Histories and Social Security Numbers shouldn t be Traded Like Stocks on Wall Street                                              Standing with a New York family  whose medical information and prescription history was sold without their consent or notification  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that pharmacies can sell their customers  most private information to the highest bidder when a pharmacy is sold or closes  Pharmacies going out of business often sell their customer lists  including Social Security numbers  medical histories  and the prescriptions filled by the individuals  to other pharmacies  Schumer said this is a gross breach of privacy that leaves intensely private information in the hands of strangers  Schumer today called on the Department of Health and Human Services to immediately close this gaping hole in patient privacy protections   Our most private personal health information should not be auctioned off to the highest bidder  Schumer said  It is outrageous that companies can get away with revealing what prescription medications New Yorkers have taken and when and not even notify the customer  Our nation s privacy laws prevent New Yorkers from learning what s wrong with their own family members when they re taken to the hospital  but allow total strangers to purchase this same information  This loophole must be closed before any more information leaks through   Today  Schumer revealed that pharmacies large and small regularly buy and sell their customer lists to the highest bidder when a pharmacy either closes or is bought out by another company  The customer list not only contains the names and addresses of every customer registered with that pharmacy  but it also includes their Social Security numbers  medical history  and a listing of their prescription medications  These lists are sometimes thousands of names long  with information dating back decades   Most recently  after a Stop and Shop in Levittown  Long Island closed its pharmacy  Randy Lonegan  who stood with Schumer today and her attorney Stephanie Ovadia  said that her personal information was sold to Target without her knowledge  She only found out about the sale when she went to fill her prescription at the Shop and Shop and learned the pharmacy had closed  The Stop and Shop manager told her that all of her information had been transferred to Target  When she went to Target  the new pharmacist had her entire history  included prescriptions she had taken 20 years prior   Schumer said that this common practice is shockingly legal  and that there are no rules on the books protecting consumers from any adverse effects of these transactions  Right now  a pharmacist does not have to notify their customers  request their consent  or offer them the opportunity to protect their information from being given over to a pharmacy they have no intention of utilizing  Typically  the pharmacist offers up their customer lists to open bidding and sometimes they can be sold for large sums   Schumer today said this practice has skyrocketed as more and more mom and pop pharmacies are taken over by large chains  Schumer today released a new report showing that last year  221 independent pharmacies closed their doors in New York State  These numbers represent a community  sole proprietor  pharmacy that either went out of business or was acquired by a large chain  An additional 40 independent pharmacies are in the process of being bought out    The primary law on the books right now regulating pharmacies and prescription drug records is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA   By passing HIPAA in 1996  Congress gave broad discretion to the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to protect patient privacy  The HHS regulations  issued in 2000 and updated only once in 2002  have created burdens for many consumers and their families yet have left this surprising loophole in privacy protections    HIPAA explicitly allows pharmacies to sell patient information as part of the normal operations of their business  as long as they sell the records to another pharmacy  While this practice may not be objectionable to some patients  it is certainly objectionable to others who do not want their personal information being owned by a pharmacy they might not even use  In addition  while pharmacies are expressly prohibited from selling customer lists to prescription drug companies for marketing purposes  they are allowed to sell the very same lists to other pharmacies   Most consumers are familiar with HIPAA due to forms they must sign at their doctors offices  Some have had difficulty accessing information about the care of family members or allowing other essential caregivers to access their own information  These burdens are the price of protecting private information from falling into the wrong hands  But they are all for nothing if the law allows other methods of accessing private information without patients  awareness   To close this gaping loophole  Schumer today called on Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt to immediately implement tough  new regulations requiring all pharmacies to provide ample notification to patients before selling or transferring their records  and giving patients an opportunity to opt out   When HIPAA became law in 1996  it surely was not the intention of Congress to require a patient to jump through hoops to authorize access to information in some cases while allowing the same information to be shared without the patient s knowledge in other cases  Schumer wrote in his letter to Leavitt  I urge you to modify the HIPAA regulations to redress this situation
