Affordable Books For College Act Which Would Initiate Campus wide Textbook Rental Programs  Allowing College Students To Borrow Books Each Semester for a Low  Flat Rate   New School By School Analysis of NY College and University Bookstore Price As students begin their college semesters  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a new  showing required textbook prices at universities and colleges across New York have risen 14 percent since 2003  Nationally  textbook prices are increasing at more than double the rate of inflation  and four times the inflation rate for all finished goods  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics   Producer Price Index          Getting a college degree has not only become critical  but now it  s become backbreaking with costs going up so much     Schumer said    After they pay tuition  parents and students are getting slapped with shockingly high costs for textbooks in class after class  at school after school  This plan would take a very successful program which has saved families hundreds of dollars and replicate it across the country  This means real dollars and real savings for middle class families who have to beg and borrow to send their kids to college          Schumer today announced legislation  the Affordable Books for College Act  which will encourage the proliferation of textbook rental programs  saving average college students  600 by allowing them to borrow their books each semester for a low  flat rate  Schumer is also reintroducing his bill to allow students to deduct up to  1 000 for the cost of textbooks from their federal income taxes        Schumer today released a school by school regional  showing how much typical college students are spending on textbooks in New York  and how much they stand to save if the rental program is universally adopted         The average freshman in the Capital Region could pay  1 073 for textbooks  if every school adopted rental programs  students could save  32 1 million         The average freshman in the Rochester Finger Lakes area could pay  963 for textbooks  if every school adopted rental programs  students could save  51 3 million         The average freshman in Central New York could pay  1034 for textbooks  if every school adopted rental programs they could save  34 2 million         The average freshman in the Hudson Valley could pay  1 112 for textbooks  if every school adopted rental programs  students could save  62 million          The average freshman in the North Country could pay  1038 for textbooks  if every school adopted rental programs  students could save  17 7 million         The average freshman in the Southern Tier could pay  1193 for textbooks  if every school adopted rental programs  students could save  22 9 million         The average freshman in Western New York could pay  1031 for textbooks  if every school adopted rental programs  students could save  45 8 million       The Affordable Books for College Act will help students pay for textbooks by establishing more rental programs  which would provide meaningful savings to college students by allowing them to borrow their books each semester for a low  flat rate  Specifically  Schumer  s bill  S  1384  will establish         Feasibility Study Grants  Education Department shall award grants to colleges to conduct feasibility studies because not all colleges are good candidates for rental programs  Successful rental programs also have the support of all players on campus  including students  faculty  bookstore owners  and administrators  Performing the feasibility study will allow schools to determine whether the size and type of their classes are well suited for rental programs  and if sufficient support exists in the community to ensure a viable program         Low Interest Loans  Education Department shall award low interest loans to successful applicants  including colleges and bookstores  Funds may be used to purchase course materials  necessary equipment or software  staff  and storage space for expanded inventory  The most significant barrier to new rental programs tends to be the up front costs associated with purchasing several semesters worth of course materials at one time  and expanding existing storage space  Although rental programs ultimately break even or run small profits  they need help with the initial capital investment          Models for Best Practices  Education Department shall develop and make available a document describing best practices for colleges that are designing new rental programs         Assessment Study  Education Department shall conduct a study on the savings achieved by students enrolled in rental programs       In the last two decades  college textbook prices have increased at twice the rate of inflation but have followed close behind tuition increases  According to a recent report from the Government Accounting Office  textbook prices nearly tripled from December 1986 to December 2004  while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall inflation was 72 percent  The cost of textbooks and supplies as a percentage of tuition and fees for full time  degree seeking students is 72 percent at 2 year public institutions  26 percent at 4 year public institutions  and 8 percent for 4 year private institutions       Schumer today also urged the Department of Education to work with schools and book publishers to find incentives to lower book costs  Specifically  Schumer proposed that the Department look into         Guaranteeing textbooks are available for free in libraries B most schools make at least some required texts available in the reserved sections of the school libraries so students can do their reading without having to buy expensive texts  With higher textbook prices forcing more students to rely on libraries  Schumer asked the Department to look into having schools guarantee that all required textbooks are available from campus libraries B and there are enough copies for students to have a reasonable expectation of completing their reading         Ensuring students can buy only the texts they need for classes without being forced to purchase unneeded extras as part of a  bundle   Often  students can find cheaper alternatives for some of the required texts on websites like www amazon com  www half com  or www dogears net  Unfortunately  because some required books are only sold  bundled  in a single package with other books  study guides  CD ROMs  or other supplements  students are forced to purchase the entire package and can t comparison shop for individual pieces  Schumer urged the Department to look into encouraging schools and publishers to sell materials separately so students can bargain shop for some texts and purchase others new         Guarding against professors who take advantage of students by assigning books they wrote  One of college students  biggest complaints about paying for college textbooks is when a professor assigns a book written by that professor or a colleague  While Schumer said colleges and universities often boast many scholars who are experts in their fields and who have written defining works in their subjects B making their books the best choices for required reading  Rather than prohibit professors from assigning works they wrote  Schumer urged the Department to set up a panel to examine egregious cases in which professors appear to be taking advantage of students in this way          Ensuring that  new  editions of textbooks are truly warranted  An alternative approach may be for publishers to offer annual supplements to allow students to use old books from a previous year while still having updated information         Publishing books online to eliminate the costs associated with printing hard copies       The rental program is already piloted at several universities throughout the country  The rental service at Eastern Illinois University was established decades ago and served 11 651 students in 2004  Textbooks are labeled and entered into the student textbook database when issued  Students pick up and return the books at the beginning and end of each semester  Students are asked to highlight and mark in the books sparingly  During designated periods in the academic year  students may purchase their textbooks with rental fees credited toward the purchase price  The service operates on a self sustaining basis with cash reserves if a particular year  s costs exceed budgeted estimates        Schumer today also announced he would reintroduce his legislation to deduct up to  1 000 for the cost of textbooks from their federal income taxes  This new tax deduction is modeled on the new federal College Tuition Tax Deduction  which was originally part of Schumer s Make College Affordable Act  Beginning in April 2003  New Yorkers were able to deduct up to  3 000 in college tuition costs on their federal taxes for the first time  This tuition tax deduction increased to  4 000 last year       Click here to view
