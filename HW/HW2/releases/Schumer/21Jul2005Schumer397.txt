IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 21  2005 Schumer  Clinton Announce More Than  42 000 000 In Homeland Security Funds Coming To Tri State Area For Mass Transit Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senators announce funds from Department of Homeland Security s Transit Security Grant Program    In the wake of the London bombings  Senators Schumer  Clinton say the money will better protect New York City commuters U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that  42 057 076 in federal funds will now be available to the tri state area from the U S  Department of Homeland Security s Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness  SLGCP  to improve security on its mass transit network  This comes in response to a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff urging the Department to release this funding  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority  MTA  and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will each receive a yet to be determined allocation of  37 575 000 available for rail transit security and  4 482 076 for bus transit security  The funds are available from within the FY 2005 Transit Security Grant Program         This critical funding will allow the MTA and the Port Authority to beef up security on the rails and on buses and to better protect New York  s commuters   Senator Schumer said   It is vital that we have the best and most sophisticated bomb detection equipment in place to ensure that the loss of life that we saw in London doesn t happen in New York City or anywhere else           Now more than ever it is critical that we make these kinds of investments in transit security to protect New York City s commuters  These much needed funds will allow the MTA to upgrade security and ensure commuters that our transportation systems have adequate security operations in place once the funds are distributed     Senator Clinton said        As the nation  s largest transportation provider  the MTA oversees America  s largest subway and bus fleet  with 6 000 subway cars and approximately 5 000 buses  two of its largest commuter railroads  with 2 000 rail cars and locomotives  and its largest bridge and tunnel authority  with 7 bridges   2 tunnels   Nearly eight million riders use the system daily at rush hour  with the MTA providing over 80  of the commutes to the Manhattan central business district       Schumer and Clinton have long been advocates for tougher rail security and have been critical of the Bush administration for not focusing enough time  effort and resources to protect the more than 9 billion Americans who take mass transit every year  Last week  along with a bi partisan coalition of Senators  Schumer and Clinton fought to increase funding for mass transit security from  100 million to  1 16 billion  They said that despite Republican and Administration stonewalling  they will continue to fight for more funding and better security technology for mass transit  Additionally  Senators Clinton and Schumer  along with seven of their Senate colleagues  sent a letter to Secretary Chertoff on July 8  2005  urging the department to release the FY 2005 grant money  Now that the money is available  States must submit their regional plans to receive this much needed funding        Following the attack on Madrid s rail system  the terrible terrorist attacks in London are a second wake up call to greatly improve our rail and mass transit security here in America   Senator Schumer said   It is clear that we re not doing close to enough and must do more  The soft underbelly of buses  subways and railroads are exposed to similar terrorist attacks unless we take real steps to beef up mass transit security immediately          The recent attacks in Madrid and London are a tragic reminder to New Yorkers and Americans that we need to have the right kind of security and detection equipment in place to prevent such a tragedy from occurring here     Senator Clinton said    Our citizens deserve these security resources and the understanding that we are doing all we can to prevent against future terrorist attacks in this country          The Transit Security Grant Program provides funding for mass transit operators to enhance security measures in order to better detect explosive devices and chemical  biological  radiological and nuclear agents that may be brought on to rail cars or busses  Eligible rail transit systems were determined using a formula approach including the following factors  ridership  track miles  number of stations and threat  For FY  05  DHS will distribute roughly  135 million in mass transit grants to rail  bus  and ferry systems across the country
