unsafe dams in the United States  Many Dams across the Hudson Valley Are More than 100 Years Old and Could Breach After Heavy Rains  Leaving Communities in the Crosshairs Schumer Pushes for New Comprehensive Legislation to Help Localities Maintain and Upgrade Antiquated Dams With dams across the Hudson Valley in a dangerous state of disrepair  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2007  Schumer  an original co sponsor of the bill authored by Senators Akaka  D HI  and Voinovich  R OH   said that many dams are more than 100 years old and some have been without attentive ownership and upkeep for decades  After periods of heavy rain  these dilapidated dams could breach  leading to flooding in major residential communities  Schumer today announced new legislation in the senate that would establish a federal program to fund rehabilitation and repair of publicly owned dams     Dam failures can be devastating and even deadly  especially in regions like the Hudson Valley where major flash floods are all too routine  said Senator Schumer  With Hudson Valleys aging dams deteriorating and crumbling  this legislation will provide local communities with the resources they need to make vital repairs to them before a major breach occurs     Schumer today announced legislation that will establish a program with the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to fund rehabilitation and repairs of publicly owned dams  It also allows for authorization of appropriation levels that will help rehabilitate these deficient dams  Schumer  an original co sponsor on the bill  has committed to fervently pushing the legislation through the senate     Schumer  while touring dams throughout the Hudson Valley earlier this year  noted that the most recent noreaster exposed serious flaws in the dam networks throughout the Hudson Valley  Whaley Lake Dam in Dutchess County  for example  has a history of serious structural and repair flaws  The dam is over 150 years old and has fallen into complete disrepair  For years  remedies were sought for this dam but major improvements were never completed  The dam holds back more than 1 2 billion gallons of water     The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC  finally came in earlier this year and determined that either repairs would have to be made to the dam or the DEC will have to breach it  Such a breach would devastate the entire Lake Community  Whaley Lake Dam is just one of many dams across the Hudson Valley and the entire state in need of repair     The dam has a downstream hazard potential of high  meaning that if a malfunction were to occur  the loss of human life as well as economic and environmental damage would be significant  There is no emergency action plan if a dam failure does occur     According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials  there are 384 dams throughout New York State listed as unsafe and classified as high hazard  There are over 1 971 dams in New York  however  there were only 8 full time employees assigned to the dam safety program as of 2005  Nationwide  there are 10 000 dams listed as high hazard  The nations dams received a grade of D from the American Society of Civil Engineers 2005 Report Card for Americas Infrastructure  which cited more than 3 500 unsafe dams in the United States     To give local governments the resources they need to protect communities in the Hudson Valley  Schumer said  this legislation requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to establish a program to provide grants to states for use in rehabilitating publicly owned dams that fail to meet minimum safety standards and pose an unacceptable risk to the public  deficient dams      Dams can provide many benefits  including flood protection  drinking water  hydroelectric power  irrigation and recreation  However  without proper maintenance  dams can be hazardous structures  Failure or improper operation of dams can result in loss of human life  economic loss  powerline disruption and environmental damage  In order to provide safe  continuous service  dams require ongoing maintenance  monitoring  frequent safety inspections and rehabilitation
