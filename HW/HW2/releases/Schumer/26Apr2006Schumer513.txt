IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 26  2006 Schumer Reveals Upstate NY Vets Shortchanged  80 Million In Health Care In Proposed Budget  Monthly Co Pay Slated To Almost Double  Plus A New  250 VA User Fee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  As Senate Debates Emergency Spending Bill  Schumer and Others Launch Effort To Add  430 Million To Current Budget for Vets Healthcare   Under New Budget Proposal Vets Monthly Co Pay Increases From  8 to  15  New  250 User Fee Charged For Use of VA Health Services    Senator Announces Opposition   Schumer to Detail How Much Vets Would Be Shortchanged In Each County  Capital Region Vets Hit By  8 2 million Under the most recent federal budget proposal  more than 280 000 upstate New York veterans would be shortchanged almost  80 million in health care funding  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today  Schumer announced an amendment to the pending Emergency Supplemental spending bill  which would add  430 million to current funding for veterans health care  and send New York more than  15 million in additional funding for Vet Centers  mental health services  and general health care          This is the time to bolster vets   health care    not gut it     Schumer said    We must ensure the VA health care system receives the funding it needs so veterans get the quality health care they deserve  The bottom line is that these veterans have already made one sacrifice for their nation  they shouldn t be forced to make another          The budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2007 provides insufficient funding for veterans healthcare in light of rising costs and increasing demand for VA services as a result of ongoing U S  military efforts  The Budget provides approximately  31 billion for veterans healthcare  a roughly  3 2 billion increase over last year  This increase still only accounts for slightly more than half of the  5 7 billion increase it is estimated would be required to allow the VA to meet its core mission and obligations  As a result  veterans   health care will be short by almost  2 5 billion  shortchange New York veterans about  150 million needed to provide adequate service  In addition to these cuts  the Administration  s budget would place increased burdens on certain veterans by doubling the monthly co payment for prescription drugs from  8 to 15 and charging a  250   user fee    to for the use of VA health services       The additional user fees and prescription drug co pays would be assessed on all Priority 7 and Priority 8 veterans  There are currently about 122 000 Priority 7 and Priority 8 veterans enrolled in the VA Health Service in upstate New York  Veterans are generally classified as Priority 7 or Priority 8 if they do not have active service related disabilities  Under the proposed budget  each of these veterans would have a fee added to their monthly health care bill  totaling an additional  250 more per year        The increase in the prescription drug co pay would also be assessed only on Priority 7 and Priority 8 veterans  The increase would be per prescription  meaning the more prescriptions an injured veteran gets  the more they pay       These fees could mean an increase of almost  1 000 or more per year on the typical veteran  s health care bill  For example  if a Priority 7 veteran had eight regular prescriptions  the monthly co pay for each prescription would go from  8 to  15 per month  This would raise the cost for their prescriptions by  672 for the entire year  If you add the  250 user fee  that  s an increase of  922 for health care per year       VA projected it would treat 110 000 returning veterans this FY  but VA has already treated 74 000 just in this quarter  VA data also shows that the number of new veterans enrolled in the department s health care system and waiting for their first clinic appointment to be scheduled has doubled in the year  As of April 2005  15 211 veterans were waiting  This month  the number has ballooned to 30 475  Over the course of two years  the number of new enrollees waiting has increased by over 400 percent       Schumer today released a  report detailing how much each region would be shortchanged under the current budget proposal  and how much veterans would pay under the increased fees           34 302 Capital Region veterans could lose out on approximately  8 2 million         30 558 Central New York veterans could lose out on approximately  9 2 million        37 731 Rochester Finger Lakes veterans could lose out on approximately  9 8 million         63 076 Hudson Valley veterans could lose out on approximately  20 million        21 116 North Country veterans could lose out on approximately  3 2 million         24 019 Southern Tier veterans could lose out on approximately  6 5 million         52 834 Western New York veterans could lose out on approximately  22 9 million       In response  Schumer announced several efforts to bolster funding for veterans healthcare  Specifically  Schumer discussed two measures            Schumer introduced with Senator Akaka of Hawaii an amendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that would directly address ongoing shortfalls in veteran  s health care funding  The amendment adds a total of  430 million to VA health Care systems  This amount will go directly to health care  mental health care  and prosthetics services at VA  The amendment includes  80 million for the VA Adjustment Counseling Service   164 million for the VA  s Comprehensive Mental Health Plan  and  182 million to deal with existing shortfalls at VA hospitals and the overall network            Schumer is also pushing the Fulfilling Our Duty to America s Veterans Act to reverse existing and future shortfalls in the VA Health Care Budget and eliminate the need for any increases in user fees or prescription drug co pays  The bill would seek to ensure adequate funding for all veterans health care needs       Click here to view
