IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 18  2005 To Bring Gas Prices Down  Schumer Demands FTC Block Newly Announced ChevronTexaco Unocal Merger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Merging two of the ten biggest oil companies could drive gas prices even higher  only a handful of oil companies remain  with control over resources similar to OPEC  Letter from 10 Senators Urge FTC to Examine Most Recent Merger    Schumer Amendment Would Force Tapping of Strategic Petroleum Reserve    Schumer calls for FTC review impact of Exxon Mobil  Chevron Texaco  Amoco BP mergers With gas prices hitting record highs around the country  as consumers pay 49 cents more now than they were paying last year at this time  and with summer just around the corner threatening to push gas prices even higher  U S Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the FTC to block the ChevronTexaco Unocal merger and to review the Exxon Mobil merger and the Chevron Texaco mergers to asses their impact on gasoline prices and retail competition  Additionally  he led a letter from 10 Senators to the FTC urging them to review the merger immediately       Schumer also pressed for President Bush to initiate a swap in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  to pressure OPEC to reduce per barrel oil prices  by introducing an amendment on Friday afternoon to the supplemental spending bill which is still being debate in the Senate  There could be a vote on the Schumer SPR amendment as soon as this afternoon         The bottom line is  the price of gas is going way up and competition is going way down     Schumer said    Without regulating the mergers of these behemoth oil companies  gas prices will continue to skyrocket    lining the pockets of Big Oil and bilking American consumers          The letter  signed by nine other Senators said    We are extremely concerned that this merger will only intensify the dangerous level of concentration in the oil industry  This consolidation has already drastically undermined competition  leaving American consumers vulnerable to repeated and sustained spikes in the price of oil          On Friday  the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at  50 49  and crude oil has been trading at above  50 per barrel for half of 2005  In addition  the average price at the pump in New York State has hit  2 33    already 46 cents higher than it was last year on this date  National average retail gasoline prices have increased to 2 25 and analysts predict that prices could increase as the summer driving season rapidly approaches  In New York City  prices average out at 2 34 which is a full 40 cents above what people in the five boroughs were paying last year       Gas prices in New York hit a record this Tuesday when they reached  2 34 per gallon and they have stayed there  This is a 9  increase over prices from a month ago and a 21  increase over prices of last year  If gas prices continues to rise at the rate they did this month  in a month  on May 17th a gallon of gas could cost  2 55  by June 17  a gallon will cost  2 78  and by July 4  gas will cost   2 93  Just three months from now gas could break 3 00 a gallon       If current prices stayed the same for a year  the average New York driver would pay  234 more a year in gasoline over the next year and the average two car family would pay a whopping  468 more in 2005  In total  New York drivers will pay  390 767 832 more per year       In an effort to create competition to drive these already too high gas prices down  Schumer called on the FTC to block the newly announced merger between ChevronTexaco and Unocal  The ChevronTexaco Unocal merger  like the Chevron Texaco and Exxon Mobil mergers before it  will further reduce competition in the oil industry by placing the vast majority of production and distribution resources under the control of a handful of corporate giants  Schumer also called on the FTC to look at other oil company mergers including Exxon Mobil  BP Amoco and Chevron Texaco to examine how to bring gas prices down       If ChevronTexaco  which is already the world  s fifth largest oil company  is allowed to acquire Unocal  the ninth largest oil and gas company in the world  the resulting corporate entity would be the world s fourth largest publicly traded oil and gas company behind Exxon Mobil  BP and Shell  Following the merger ChevronTexaco would control 13 billion barrels of oil equivalent proven reserves  and would increase its oil equivalent production to 3 million barrels per day  This amount exceeds the daily production of every OPEC member with the exceptions of Iran and Saudi Arabia      The merger of these two companies will only intensify the dangerous level of concentration in the oil industry  Consolidation has already seriously undermined competition  leaving American consumers vulnerable to repeated and sustained spikes in the price of oil  Because if the industry  s vertical integration    the five largest oil companies in the United States control almost as much crude oil production as the Middle Eastern members of OPEC  over half of domestic refiner capacity  and over 60 percent of the retail gasoline market       Last year  with crude oil averaging  41 per barrel and working families paying exorbitant prices to heat their homes and fuel their cars  the world  s top ten oil companies made more than  100 billion in profit and in some cases posted record breaking fourth quarter earnings that were in some cases more than 200 percent higher than the previous year  This year  crude oil prices are consistently trading at above  50 per barrel  simultaneously increasing the financial burden of energy costs for working families and oil company profits         Americans are getting scorched by sky high gas prices and the summer hasn  t even arrived yet  The Bush Administration must do something now to avert what will be a very hot  very expensive summer for all Americans if they are paying 3 bucks or more for a gallon of gas     Schumer concluded       Click to view letter
