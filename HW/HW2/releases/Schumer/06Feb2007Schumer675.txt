IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 6  2007 Opening Statement of Senator Charles E  Schumer    Preserving Prosecutorial Independence  Is the Department of Justice Politicizing the Hiring and Firing of U S  Attorneys   Senate Committee on the Judiciary                                                                                                                                                                                                   We are holding this hearing because many members of this Committee  including Chairman Leahy  have become increasingly concerned about the administration of justice and the rule of law in this country       I have observed  with increasing alarm  how politicized the Department of Justice has become  I have watched  with growing worry  as the Department has increasingly based hiring on political affiliation  ignored the recommendations of career attorneys  focused on the promotion of political agendas  and failed to retain legions of talented career attorneys  I have sat on this Committee for eight years  and before that on the House Judiciary Committee for sixteen       During those combined twenty four years of oversight over the Department of Justice   through seven presidential terms  including three Republican presidents   I have never seen the Department more politicized and pushed further away from its mission as an apolitical enforcer of the rule of law       And now  it appears  even the hiring and firing of our top federal prosecutors has become infused and corrupted with political  rather than prudent  considerations   Or at least  there is a very strong appearance that this is so       For six years there has been little or no oversight of the Department of Justice   Those days are over       There are many questions surrounding the firing of a slew of U S  Attorneys   I am committed to getting to the bottom of those questions       If we do not get the documentary information that we seek  I will consider moving to subpoena that material  including performance evaluations and other documents       If we do not get forthright answers to our questions  I will consider moving to subpoena one or more of the fired U S  Attorneys so that the record is clear       So  with that in mind  let me turn to the issue at the center of today s hearing       Once appointed  U S  Attorneys  perhaps more than any other public servant  must be above politics and beyond reproach   They must be seen to enforce the rule of law without fear or favor         When politics unduly infects the appointment and removal of U S  Attorneys  what happens       Cases suffer   Confidence plummets   And corruption has a chance to take root       What has happened here over the last 7 weeks is nothing short of breathtaking          Less than two months ago  seven or more U S  Attorneys reportedly received an unwelcome Christmas present   As the Washington Post reports  those top federal prosecutors were called and terminated on the same day       The Attorney General and others have sought to deflect criticism by suggesting that these officials all had it coming because of poor performance  that U S  Attorneys are routinely removed from office  and that this was only business as usual       But what happened here doesn t sound like an orderly and natural replacement of underperforming prosecutors  it sounds more like a purge         What happened here doesn t sound like business as usual  it appears more reminiscent of a different sort of Saturday night massacre       Here s what the record shows         Several U S  Attorneys were apparently fired with no real explanation         Several were seemingly removed merely to make way for political up and comers         One was fired in the midst of a successful and continuing investigation of lawmakers          Another was replaced with a pure partisan of limited prosecutorial experience  without Senate confirmation         And all of this  coincidentally  followed a legal change   slipped into the PATRIOT Act in the dead of night   which for first time in our history gave the Attorney General the power to make indefinite interim appointments and to bypass the Senate altogether        We have heard from prominent attorneys   including many Republicans   who confirm that these actions are unprecedented  unnerving  and unnecessary            The former San Diego U S  Attorney  Peter Nunez  who served under Reagan said    This  is like nothing I ve ever seen before in 35 plus years    He went on to say that while the President has the authority to fire a U S  Attorney for any reason  it is  extremely rare  unless there is an allegation of misconduct             Another former U S  Attorney and head of the National Association of Former United States Attorneys said members of his group were in  shock  over the purge  which  goes against all tradition     Washington Post  February 4  2007         The Attorney General  for his part  has flatly denied that politics has played any part in the firings   At a Judiciary Committee hearing last month  he testified that   I would never  ever make a change in a U S  Attorney position for political reasons          And yet  the recent purge of top federal prosecutors reeks of politics   An honest look at the record reveals that something is rotten in Denmark            In Nevada  where U S  Attorney Daniel Bogden was reportedly fired  a Republican source told the press that  the decision to remove U S  attorneys       was part of a plan to  give somebody else that experience  to build up the back bench of Republicans by giving them high profile jobs    Las Vegas Review Journal  January 18  2007             In New Mexico  where U S  Attorney David Iglesias was reportedly fired  he has publicly stated that when he asked why he was asked to resign  he  wasn t given any answers             In San Diego  where U S  Attorney Carol Lam was reportedly fired  the top ranking FBI official in San Diego said   I guarantee politics is involved     Dan Dzwilewski  quoted in the San Diego Union Tribune  January 13  2007    And the former U S  Attorney under President Reagan said   It really is outrageous     North County Times        o Ms  Lam  of course  was in the midst of a sweeping public corruption investigation of Randy  Duke  Cunningham and his co conspirators  and her office has outstanding subpoenas to three House Committees       o Was her firing a political retaliation   There is no way to know   But the Department of Justice should go out of its way to avoid even the appearance of impropriety   That is not too much to ask   And  as I ve said  the appearance here   given all the circumstances   is awful            Finally  in Arkansas  where U S  Attorney Bud Cummins was forced out  there is not a scintilla of evidence that he had any blemish on his record   In fact  he was well respected on both sides of the aisle  and was in the middle of a number of important investigations       o His sin   Occupying a high profile position that was being eyed by an ambitious acolyte of Karl Rove  who had minimal federal prosecution experience  but was highly skilled at opposition research and partisan attacks for the Republican National Committee       o Among other things  I look forward to hearing the Deputy Attorney General explain to us this morning how and why a well performing prosecutor was axed in favor of such a partisan warrior   What strings were pulled and what influence was brought to bear       o In June of 2006  when Karl Rove was himself still being investigated by a U S  Attorney  was he brazenly leading the charge to oust a sitting U S  Attorney and install his own former aide       Now  I ask  is this really how we should be replacing U S  Attorneys in the middle of a Presidential term       No one doubts the President has the legal authority to do it  but can this build confidence in the Justice Department   Can this build confidence in the administration of justice         Of course  what makes these firings especially troubling is their timing  mere months after the Administration secured unprecedented power   under the PATRIOT Act   to appoint interim U S  Attorneys indefinitely  For 20 years  the Attorney General could appoint an interim for 120 days  after which the chief judge had the authority to make the appointment  if the Senate had not yet confirmed a replacement  And for decades before that  the District Court alone had the authority to appoint an interim U S  Attorney         There is absolutely no Constitutional problem with the previous system  as every former DOJ official testifying here today acknowledges  Though the Department now  strongly opposes  any return to the old system  the Department cites no case in support of its view       There is  however  a Supreme Court case  Morrison v  Olson  making it absolutely clear that interim federal prosecutors are inferior officers who may be appointed by the courts         Moreover  almost a week after my staff asked for specific examples of judges making arguably unsuitable appointments  the Department was able to come up with precisely ONE in the last hundred years  I respectfully suggest that the Attorney General possibly has a worse track record for making unsuitable interim appointments in just the last seven weeks         Let me finish by making three quick points  First  no one is saying that underperforming U S  Attorneys should not be removed   Every President has done it  and should do it  and good management improves public confidence   That does not appear  in too many instances  to be at the bottom of what s happened here        Second  no one is saying that politics doesn t play any role in the picking of U S  Attorneys   They are  after all  political appointments   And no one is saying that some political experience or affiliation should render a candidate unsuitable   Indeed  just last year we unanimously approved a highly regarded counsel to Senator Specter to be U S  Attorney in Utah        Third  no one is accusing the Administration of blatantly removing a U S  Attorney to put an end to an inconvenient and damaging public corruption investigation   But  some are rightly noting the appearance of such a conflict and are correctly asking the Department to demonstrate that retaliation was not a motive here        In the end  justice must not only be done  it must be seen to be done        I cannot improve on the words of former Attorney General  and later Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson   Mary Jo White  in her own testimony  cites to this passage from a famous speech he gave to United States Attorneys in 1940        It would probably be within the range of that exaggeration permitted in Washington to say that assembled in this room is one of the most powerful peace time forces known to our country   The prosecutor has more control over life  liberty  and reputation than any other person in America   His discretion is tremendous        That is why we are holding this hearing  That is why this hearing is so important  And that is why I hope we get candid answers to our questions        Now  let me turn to our Ranking Member  Senator Specter
