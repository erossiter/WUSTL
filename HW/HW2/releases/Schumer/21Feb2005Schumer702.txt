IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 21  2005 Schumer Unveils New Social Security Calculator Shows That Over 6 Million NY Area Residents Would Lose Under Bush Privatization Scheme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            New  easy to use  accessible web calculator allows  for the first time ever  each NY area resident to tabulate how much they will get under present Social Security system  how much they lose under Administration privatization plan  Schumer hosts live demonstration of Social Security calculator with new Yorkers of varied incomes and ages  learning for the first time effects of plan Schumer  We will not allow the president to play retirement roulette   US Senator Charles E  Schumer  unveiling a new Social Security web calculator  demonstrated how much New York area residents stand to lose under the Administration  s proposal to privatize Social Security  Joined by New York City residents who input their year of birth and average income  Schumer released a new program that computes a side by side personal comparison of the Bush Privatization Plan and the current Social Security system  Schumer also pledged to protect Social Security from privatization and preserve the benefit for generations to come        When it comes to cutting Social Security  my answer is no way  no time  no how   Schumer said   The federal government made a promise to all Americans that if they worked hard  paid their taxes  and played by the rules  they could retire in dignity and get their benefits  The privatization plan that is on the table puts everyone  s benefits at risk          The Social Security calculator  which can be accessed through a button on Schumer  s website  www schumer senate gov  allows Americans to simply plug in their average annual salary and year of birth and see a side by side comparison of the benefits between the Bush Privatization Plan and the current Social Security system  The calculator shows the expected annual benefits under both systems  the difference between the two plans as well as the percent reduction that Americans will face under the Bush Privatization Plan        All numbers for the calculator are annual benefits adjusted for inflation  Calculations are based on Congressional Budget Office  CBO  economic assumptions  The President has said that individual accounts would do nothing to restore long term solvency and that further benefit cuts are necessary    Social Security has become an essential facet of American life  with one in every six Americans receiving a Social Security benefit and more than 95 percent of all workers covered by Social Security  Today  47 million people receive these benefits  Nine out of ten individuals age 65 and older receive Social Security benefits  and roughly two thirds of beneficiaries receive 50 percent or more of their income from the program  Social Security also provides benefits to disabled workers and survivors of deceased workers        The President  s proposed privatization plan worsens Social Security  s already existing long term financial problems  According to the Social Security Administration  Social Security will be able to pay full benefits until at until at least 2042  With the President  s private accounts and no other changes  the system would only be able to pay full benefits through 2031  Privatization shortens the Social Security trust fund by eleven years because payroll taxes that would otherwise go to pay benefits are diverted to private accounts  which forces the government to borrow trillions more to pay benefits to current retirees         Its simple math     Schumer said    You can  t use the same dollars for two different things          The privatization plan slashes benefits in two ways  The first  price indexing  targets young Americans who are just entering the work force  The younger a future social security recipient is today  the smaller their initial Social Security benefit will be       The second cut  the privatization tax  is the additional amount of a promised Social Security benefit that a recipient loses as a result of having set up a private account  Under the privatization plan  recipients get to keep what  s in their account  minus any administrative fees  But the guaranteed Social Security benefit will be reduced by whatever is contributed to an account plus some interest  Private accounts only help if the annual rate of return earned on investments exceeds the rate of inflation plus three percent  If the money is invested poorly  or the market drops right before retirement  then the expected payout will drop accordingly       The President  s plan also increases the birth tax   the amount of debt that is laid on the shoulders of each newborn child  The President  s plan adds almost  17 000 to every child  s birth tax  because it adds nearly  5 trillion in new debt over the first 20 years         It is morally irresponsible to be passing such a huge birth tax to future generations  All of this borrowing will eventually have to be repaid with interest  just like a home mortgage or a personal credit card     said Schumer
