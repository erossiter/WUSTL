IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 30  2005 New Schumer Study  41  Of Upstate Activated Reservist Families Suffer Economic Hardship    Senator Unveils Plan To Fix Pay Gap  Address Latest Recruitment Problems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               New   Standing With Our Troops Tax Credits    Would Encourage Employers to Keep Paying Reservists   Salary While Serving Overseas  Could Help With Recruitment Problems    Army Recently Announced Major Recruitment Shortages for Active Duty and Reserves Enlistments  New Bill Could Alleviate Problem By Addressing Troop  s Economic Hardship    Schumer Details How Many Reservists In Each County In light of recruitment shortages just announced by Defense Department Officials  US Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled new  showing nearly half of all New York activated reservist families are losing significant amounts of income while serving  Schumer also announced a new   Standing With Our Troops Tax Credit    plan to give up to  15 000 tax breaks to employers who pay the salaries of activated reservists while the reservists are abroad fighting the War on Terror   which would cut the financial drain on reservist families         It  s a shame for those in service  Reservists give up everything normal in their lives to fly halfway around the world to fight terror  only to take a huge hit in income back at home     Schumer said    If a reservist bought a house at his old salary and his wife and kids are still living in it  no bank is going to cut his mortgage 60  just because that  s the salary hit he  s taking to do his duty  We need to step up to the plate to help companies keep the jobs and paychecks coming until the reservists come back home to us          Late last week  US Army Secretary Francis J  Harvey announced active duty Army was 27 percent below its recruiting goal of 7 050  According to the Government Accounting Office  The Army Reserve and Army National Guard are 13 and 20 percent of below their overall recruiting goals  respectively       Schumer  s new  uses the latest troop data available from the Pentagon  s Defense Manpower Data Center  as of December 1  2004  and finds that more than 7 400 New Yorkers  are currently in activated status in the National Guard and Reserves  While these personnel are away from home fighting the War on Terror  their families often have trouble making ends meet  When reservists are activated  they receive the same pay as active duty military  except in very rare circumstances  However  military pay is determined by a combination of rank and experience  so different reservists are paid different amounts  In 2004  active duty enlisted military personnel paygrades started at  27 013 and officers   paygrade started at  41 856  according to the Uniformed Services Almanac  For 2005  pay rates will be about 3 5  higher       These figures do not include combat and other special pay  For a soldier serving in Iraq or Afghanistan  they could get on a monthly basis  225 in hostile fire pay   250 in family separation pay if they have dependents   100 in hardship pay in some cases  and a  105 in per diems  All told  soldiers could be getting  680 a month on top of the figures above       But data from the non partisan and independent federal Government Accountability Office finds 41 percent of National Guard and Reserve drilling unit members reported income loss during past military operations  and senior officers in the reserve component reported average losses of  5 000 in income  For our troops  this loss in pay leaves great strains on the home front  Troops are forced to devote attention to whether their families can pay the bills  which diverts attention away from their mission  Families that are struggling with emotional strain of a spouse and parent being away and in harm  s way also must deal with the financial strain of lost income       In some cases  businesses who employ these reservists will continue to pay the difference between activated member  s civilian salary and their military salary  Schumer said today these employers are true patriots because this sacrifice can end up an expensive endeavor for small businesses    especially with the now frequent extensions of tours of duty  In addition  small business employers often have a difficult time finding temporary workers to fill while the reservists are serving  since the new employees know that the reservists can come back to claim their old jobs       Schumer today released a new analysis showing how many New York military reservist families are suffering deep economic hardship while breadwinners serve in Iraq           In the Capital Region  an estimated 325 families are losing income because of a reservist  s service overseas        In Central New York  an estimated 145 families are losing income because of a reservist  s service overseas        In the Rochester Finger Lakes Region  an estimated 182 families are losing income because of a reservist  s service overseas        In the Hudson Valley  an estimated 447 families are losing income because of a reservist  s service overseas        In the North Country  an estimated 166 families are losing income because of a reservist  s service overseas        In the Southern Tier  an estimated 75 families are losing income because of a reservist  s service overseas        In Western New York  an estimated 313 families are losing income because of a reservist  s service overseas       Schumer today also detailed proposed legislation which includes provisions to boost income security for the families of New York  s reservists currently serving active duty and to encourage more of their small business employers to pay the income difference while they serve  Also known as S  11  the Standing With Our Troops Act was the very first bill introduced by the Democrats in the Congress  It will           Create federal tax credits for employers to make up for 50  of the reservists   pay gap  Standing With Our Troops would provide a tax credit worth 50  of the salaries that employers are continuing to pay activated Guard and Reserve employees to make up for the income gap the reservists suffer while abroad  The tax credit would be applied on the company  s federal income taxes and would be worth up to  15 000 per employee  It is designed to reward patriotic employers who keep paying these salaries and encourage more employers to do so           Create federal tax credits to help small business owners and manufacturers hire temporary workers  Standing With Our Troops would also provide a  6 000 federal tax credit to help small businesses hire temporary workers to fill in for activated employees and a separate  10 000 credit for small manufacturers to hire temporary workers         The War on Terror is unlike any other war we  re ever fought  and we  re fighting it with a military unlike any we  ve ever had  Our military is more effective than ever not only because our men and women in uniform are better trained  and because so many of them are reservists who are so deeply committed to serving their country that they will balance burdens on the home front  That commitment shouldn  t penalized and we need to crate a way to help them keep their obligations at home     Schumer said       Click here to view
