IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 1  2007 Schumer Calls On Commanding General To Keep 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion In Western Ny  Urges Him To Investigate Relocating Unit To Niagara Falls Air Reserve Base                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The U S  Military Recently Reported that it will Close the 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion in Tonawanda and Move Unit to Undisclosed Location The 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion  with over 100 Active Duty and Reserve Soldiers  has Both a Rich History in Western NY and One of the Highest Recruitment and Retention Records of any Civil Affairs Unit in the Country Schumer Calls on Commanding General to Jettison Plans to Close Unit and Urges Him to Investigate Moving Battalion to the Recently Expanded Niagara Falls Air Reserve Base In the wake of recent reports that the 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion based in Tonawanda  New York will be closed and relocated outside of Western New York  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called today on the U S  Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command to keep the battalion stationed in the Buffalo area  The 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion  with over 100 active duty and reserve soldiers  has one of the highest recruitment and retention records of any civil affairs unit in the country  Since 1948  it has attracted highly educated and motivated recruits from the Buffalo area who wish to remain in the region   Schumer today urged Major General David A  Morris  Commanding General of USCAPOC  to also investigate moving the battalion to the nearby Niagara Falls Air Reserve Base which has recently undergone an expansion and could accommodate additional soldiers    For over 50 years  the 402nd Battalion has been an institution in Western  NY  attracting highly educated and motivated recruits from the area  It has one of the highest recruitment and retention rates in the nation  If there ever was a case of If it aint broke  dont fix it  this is it  said Senator Schumer  Today Im calling on the Commanding General to ditch any plans to close the 402nd Battalion base in Tonawanda and  at the very least  investigate moving it to the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Base so it can remain in Western New York    As part of a command wide consolidation of civil affairs units  it has been reported that units in the 402nd would be consolidated with other units outside Western NY and outside the state  potentially in Puerto Rico  The 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion  with over 100 active duty and reserve soldiers  has one of the highest recruitment and retention records of any civil affairs unit in the country  It has a long and honorable history in Western New York with deployments to foreign conflicts and contingency operations dating back to the unit s activation in December of 1948    Schumer today warned that retaining members while consolidating civil affairs units has proven to be a great challenge for the military  Recently  the Utica based 414th Civil Affairs Battalion was dismantled and partially consolidated with the Syracuse based 403rd  It was then reorganized at Southfield  Michigan  where the units overall size plummeted from approximately eighty servicemen to less than twenty   In addition to calling for the USCAPOC to jettison its plans to close the base  Schumer today also suggested that the agency look at transferring the unit to the nearby Niagara Falls Air Reserve Base  NFARB   The Base Realignment and Closure Commission  BRAC  recently overturned an administration proposal to close the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Base  Since that victory   32 million in federal funding has been allocated to construct an Army regional readiness center at the NFARB  It is currently slated to house a relocated 277th Quartermaster Company and 865th Combat Support Hospital from Porter Road in Niagara Falls  NY    However  Schumer today noted that the new Army regional readiness center is designed to accommodate additional unit presence  and may be sufficient to house an expanded 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion headquarters  He called on the Civil Affairs and Psychological Affairs Command to study the possibility of such a move  which could improve efficiency  bolster training and readiness  enhance security  realize cost savings  and increase the availability of base amenities for the 402nd   As an emerging hub for military operations in the region  the NFARB already contains the critical mass of resources to support the missions of multiple reserve units from various branches of the military  The current facilities of the 402nd in Tonawanda have been described as isolated  providing limited interaction with other Army Reserve units and limited resources to accomplish the unit s mission  By relocating and expanding at the NFARB s Army Regional Readiness Center  the unit will have the opportunity to share a critical mass of resources  Shared command posts  motor pools  office resources  post base exchanges  dining and recreation facilities  supply areas  maintenance staffs  and training programs are just the beginning  As reservists in the 402nd already drive away from their Tonawanda headquarters to take frequent advantage of NFARB amenities  it only makes sense to consider consolidating the 402nd with the other regional Army Reserve units now making the move
