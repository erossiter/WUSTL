IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 8  2005 New Schumer Report  Upstate New York Manufacturing Hit Hard By Unfair China Trade Practices    Senator Unveils New Steps To Level The Playing Field                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               As Commerce Secretary Returns From China Empty Handed  Schumer Announces Long Overdue Senate Hearing on China Trade      Schumer  s Plan Includes Restoring Funding to Manufacturing Extension Partnerships  Revaluing China Currency or Imposing a Temporary Across the Board Tariff on Chinese Imports      Schumer Details Manufacturing Industry For Each County  Capital Region has lost app The federal government must act immediately to bolster upstate New York  s manufacturing industry  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer explained today  Schumer unveiled new  swift action to crack down on China  s currency manipulation  and other critical steps needed to strengthen New York  s manufacturing industry  Schumer  s bipartisan bill  co sponsored by Senator Lindsay Graham  R SC   allows for a 180 day negotiation period between the US and China to revalue its currency  if the negotiations are not successful  a temporary across the board tariff of 27 5  will be applied to all Chinese products entering the United States         Nobody knows better than New Yorkers  how China  s unfair trade practices are devastating jobs here in the United States     Schumer said    It s no secret that the manufacturing industry has been getting killed throughout the country and New York is no exception  We need to fight to keep our manufacturing jobs from leaving New York and we need to wage that fight on two fronts  On one front  we must get tougher on other countries like China that give their companies unfair advantages by playing games with their currency  And on the other front  we must give companies here at home the tools and the support they need to succeed          Schumer today discussed specific companies across upstate New York that illustrate China  s devastating impact on American jobs  including the Marietta Corporation  headquartered in Cortland  Buffalo Color  Buffalo  Eastman Kodak  Rochester  Oneida Ltd   Buffalo  Precision Grinding and Manufacturing  Rochester  MT Picture Display  Elmira  and Prismatic Dyeing and Finishing in Newburgh       In addition  yesterday  General Motors Corporation announced it would be cutting 25 000 manufacturing jobs by 2008  Currently  General Motors has two plants in New York  in Tonawanda and Massena  which employ nearly 3 300 New Yorkers  Schumer today wrote to General Motors Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner  urging him to protect New York jobs because of the state  s top notch workforce and how critical these jobs are to each community in New York       Schumer released a new study today showing that tens of thousands of upstate New York jobs were lost between January 2001 and April 2005  Specifically  Schumer  s report found that            Over the last four years  approximately 8 900 manufacturing jobs in the Capital Region have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 11 900 manufacturing jobs in Central New York have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 27 400 manufacturing jobs in Rochester Finger Lakes area have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 9 900 manufacturing jobs in the Hudson Valley have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 4 300 manufacturing jobs in the North Country have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 10 900 manufacturing jobs in the Southern Tier have been lost        Over the last four years  approximately 21 300 manufacturing jobs in Western New York have been lost       In order to bolster upstate  s economy  Schumer is leading a bipartisan effort to provide  112 million in funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership  MEP  program  which helps upstate New York s manufacturing companies by offering worker training  management consulting  and suggestions for new business practices to companies  The Administration  s budget proposal would reduce funding for MEP  which has helped over 1 400 manufacturing companies in upstate New York stay afloat  by 57  from  117 million in FY2005 to only  46 8 million  In New York  the MEP program is credited with creating 625 and retaining 2 041 jobs in New York  increasing sales by  46 million  and realizing  13 million in cost savings for participating companies in 2003 alone       Schumer today announced two major steps to promote his legislation that would level the playing field with China  First  Schumer urged the Administration to call for a summit on China trade with key Administration officials  including the Treasury Department  s Special Envoy on China  and members of the House and Senate  Schumer said this would be an opportunity for all of the key players in this issue to discuss the next steps in getting China to stop its currency manipulation       Second  Schumer announced today that the Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley  R IA   at Schumer  s urging  has scheduled a hearing on China trade in the next few weeks at which senior Administration officials and trade experts will testify  One of the issues that will be discussed will be the Schumer Graham China Free Trade bill  which  when offered as an amendment to the State Department Authorization Bill  got an overwhelming vote in the Senate earlier this year       Because China continues to peg its currency to the U S  dollar  in 2004 we saw record trade deficits with China  Last November it was reported that our trade deficit with China grew by 25   This number represents one quarter of our national trade deficit  Since 2000  the US trade deficit with China is up over 94  to  162 billion dollars  In one year from 2004 to 2005  the trade imbalance increased 30   In computer manufacturing the deficit is up over 300   During that time NYS has lost 20 000 computer equipment jobs  In apparel manufacturing the deficit is up 50  over 4 years  but textile manufacturing alone is up 100  in the first four months of this year alone  New York State has lost 27 000 textile jobs  In tool and dye  and heavy metal imports  Chinese imports are up almost  3 billion in four years  During that time NYS lost at least 21 000 machinery and fabricated metal jobs       The Yuan    sometimes known as renminbi    has been tightly pegged to the U S  dollar since 1994  approximately 8 28 Yuan to the dollar   During that period of time  China  s economy has grown dramatically  averaging over 8  per year  If China  s currency freely floated in the market  as is the case with virtually all major world currencies  it would have appreciated  substantially reflecting China s underlying economic strength  However  it has remained at the same pegged value  and the result is that many economists estimate that the yuan is now undervalued by between 15 and 40   This has a serious impact on manufacturing  The Michigan  s Manufacturing Technology Center estimated that all the competitive advantage a  10 million manufacturing plant in China has over  10 million plant in the U S  would be erased by a 30  currency revaluation       In order to hold the value of the Yuan within its tight and artificial trading band  the Chinese government has intervened in its foreign exchange markets  The practice of   currency manipulation    to gain a trade or competitive advantage violates World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund agreements  of which China is now party  China  s emergence as a manufacturing powerhouse at the expense of the United States raises significant economic security concerns and the question of whether a country that loses its ability to produce tangible products will long remain an economic power       The bipartisan Schumer Graham China Free Trade bill allows for a 180 day negotiation period between the U S  and China to revalue its currency  and if the negotiations are not successful  the tariff would be applied to all Chinese products entering the United States  If the President certifies to Congress within 180 days of enactment that China has made a good faith effort to revalue its currency upward  he may delay the imposition of the tariffs for an additional 180 days  If at the end of that 180 day period the President determines that China has developed and started actual implementation of a plan to revalue its currency  the President may delay imposition of the tariffs for an additional 12 months       Click here to view
