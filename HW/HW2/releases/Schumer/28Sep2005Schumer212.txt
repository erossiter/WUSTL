IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 28  2005 Schumer Issues New Report On Upstate Air Travel    Discusses Impact Of Mergers  Bankruptcies And High Jet Fuel Prices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             As USAirways America West Join  Senator To Urge Newly Merged Airline to Expand Service In Upstate New York Markets   Schumer Examines Jet Fuel Price Relief For Airlines  Proposes Amendment Doubling Funding for Essential Air Service At Regional Airports   Schumer  Low Cost Carriers Have Increased Upstate Passenger Counts 42   Expanded Their Market Share To 29   And Have Dramatically Lowered Fares As pending mergers and bankruptcies stand to shakeup the airline industry  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  today unveiled a new  showing unprecedented passenger growth at upstate New York airports  including Buffalo  Syracuse  Rochester  Albany  and Stewart  Schumer  s report also shows a dramatic rise in low cost airlines   market share and the fall of average fares from each major airport  Schumer  s report includes an airport by airport analysis showing how service in upstate New York could expand now that US Airways and America West merged  opening up new markets  especially for Binghamton  Elmira  and Ithaca  Schumer will also be introducing legislation to increase funding by  110 million for Essential Air Service  which would increase federal funding for air service to and from small airports like Massena  Watertown  Jamestown  and Ogdensburg and funding for Small Community Air Service Development Grants         We know that low cost airfare is the engine of economic growth  and that  s why we will continue to push so hard to expand service throughout upstate New York     Schumer said    We  ve come a long way  but there  s still a lot of work to be done  The price tags on most flights to upstate New York have historically been sky high  but we  re bringing them back down to earth and this can only mean more jobs  more service  and more economic growth for all of New York           Schumer  s  showed dramatic passenger growth  substantial fare decline  and an increase in market share of low cost airlines for Buffalo Niagara International Airport  Greater Rochester International Airport  Syracuse International Hancock Airport  Albany International Airport  and Stewart International Airport  At all of these major airports  the market share of low cost airlines  including JetBlue  Southwest Airlines  Airtran  and Independence Air  has risen from 4  in 1999 to 30  in 2004  Between  1999 2004 passenger counts have grown 40   36   30   60   37  in Buffalo  Rochester  Syracuse  Albany  Stewart respectively        Schumer said that bringing low cost carriers in to the market not only lowers fares and fosters growth  but it also protects a market if a larger carrier were to go out of business  Ten years ago  when large carriers dominated the market  a bankruptcy or liquidation would have been disastrous and left many markets with out any air service  Low cost carriers have brought diversity to the market and are now in many regions the dominant carrier  For example  in Buffalo  Delta dropped from 14  of the market share in 1999 to 9  in 2005  If a legacy carrier were to go out of business  the shock to the market would now be significantly less  In the past 6 years  Delta and Northwest combined market share dropped from 35  to 23  in Syracuse and 33  to 21  in Albany        The Department of Energy has reported US Gulf Coast kerosene type jet fuel climbed from  1 18 to  1 84 from August 2004 to August 2005  That  s a 56  increase in one year and does not even shown the dramatic increases for September  In total  U S  passenger and cargo airlines are projected to consume 19 billion gallons of jet fuel in worldwide operations in 2005  That means that for every penny increase in the price of a gallon of jet fuel drives an additional  190 million in annual fuel costs for U S  airlines  If the price is a dollar more a year  then that  s a  19 billion  So if prices stayed at August  s price  the airlines are looking at a  12 5 billion increase in expenses  Jet fuel averaged  0 57 cents over the between 1985 and 2003  now it  s  1 85  As of September 7  the price of jet fuel was  2 08 per gallon or  87 51 per barrel  which is more than the approximately  65 for jet fuel  The price of jet fuel hit  100 a barrel during the second week of September because of Hurricane Katrina refinery closures  It averaged  25 a barrel from 1994 to 2004       Schumer today took steps to examine ways to provide relief for airlines struggling with the high cost of jet fuel  First  Schumer wrote to the International Energy Agency  IEA   to ensure that ongoing releases of finished petroleum products from the strategic reserves of IEA member nations include enough jet fuel to avert supply disruptions  The increased refinery crunch caused by Hurricane Katrina temporarily eliminated 13  of daily domestic jet fuel production        Second  Schumer called on the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to extend its price gouging investigation the airline industry  Earlier this month  Schumer joined a bipartisan group of Senators urging the FTC to launch a top to bottom investigation to make sure that oil companies and gas station owners and the pipeline in between them are operating ethically and within the law  Schumer called for the immediate formation of a task force to promptly identify the many cases of price gouging being reported across the country  and asked that the task force formulate a process by which price gougers are swiftly prosecuted  Today  s Schumer is asking the FTC to use the same task force examining price gouging between the oil industry and consumers to investigate price gouging between the oil industry and the airlines       Schumer  s  also analyzed Greater Binghamton Airport  Elmira Corning Regional Airport  and Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport  Schumer  s report demonstrated that because USAirways is the major carrier for each of these regions  dozens of destinations    both domestic and international    will now be available from Binghamton  Elmira  and Ithaca since the USAirways America West merger is finalized       The merger of US Airways and America West  originally announced in May and approved by the bankruptcy court last week  was finalized yesterday  creating the nation  s fifth largest airline and bringing US Airways formally out of bankruptcy after more than a year  The newly merged airline will continue to operate under the US Airways name and will service more than 225 destinations worldwide  including Europe  the Caribbean  Mexico  Canada and eventually Hawaii  A full list of new and potential destinations is included in today  s report       Schumer today wrote to Bruce Lakefield  President and CEO of US Airways  and Doug Parker  America West Chairman  President and CEO  urging them to make upstate New York air service a priority and to ensure service is expanded  not contracted as they formulate their new destination maps  Schumer touted recent passenger growth  airport improvements  and community needs as incentives to pay particular attention to these markets in New York  s Southern Tier        Schumer today announced his is introducing bipartisan legislation to double funding for the EAS program  Right now  the Senate Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies spending bill includes  110 million for the program  more than doubling the President  s budget request of  50 million  Schumer  s proposal would bring total funding for the program up to  220 million  By providing more funding for EAS nationally  the Department of Transportation will be able to offer airlines more lucrative contracts to fly to EAS communities in New York  which would mean more service options in Western New York and the North Country       In July  after an intense lobbying effort from Schumer  the Senate Appropriations Committee reversed the Administration  s proposed cuts to EAS  This prevented EAS funding cuts for Jamestown  Massena  Ogdensburg  Plattsburgh  Saranac Lake  and Watertown airports  Overall  the Administration proposed cutting EAS funding by  52 million  from  102 million in 2005 to  50 million in 2006  Communities would have lost funding based on how far away they were located from a major airport        Since 1999  New York airports have received more than  9 826 147 in federal funds through this program  allocated directly to the airlines that serve the Jamestown  Massena  Ogdensburg  Watertown  Plattsburgh  Saranac Lake  and Utica communities  EAS ensures residents and businesses in these communities have air travel options by providing funding to airlines and airports to keep their flights running With five EAS communities  New York ranks fifth in number of EAS communities among all states  EAS enabled Colgan Air to service Chautauqua County Airport providing affordable airfare from Jamestown to Pittsburgh       Schumer is sending his  to the management of all of the legacy carriers and low cost airlines in order to encourage them to expand service in upstate New York markets  In an effort to remind site selectors of the benefits of moving businesses to upstate New York  Schumer is also sending them today  s report  drawing their attention to the decline in fares and the potential for economic growth in each region        Click here to view
