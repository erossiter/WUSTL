that will boost the economy  Furthermore the new camera system in the City of Buffalo will help local law enforcement crack down on crime and increase security throughout the city  I am also pleased with the funding for the Father Mychal Judge Center at St  Bonaventure University  Father Mychal Judge was a supreme humanitarian in the true Franciscan tradition  This center will ensure that his legacy will continue for future generations   I am pleased that we were able to secure the Committees approval for these funds that will help bolster these critical infrastructure and development projects  Funding for the Chautauqua Landfill project will help the County with an innovative project developing much needed alternative energy from landfill and the funds for Smokes Creek will help repair years of environmental damage  The commitment to funding for the Buffalo River will be critical in enabling the Army Corps of Engineers and Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper to continue working to clean up the Buffalo River which is a key environmental priority and a necessary step for us to realize the real potential of this resource to the city  I will closely monitor this program as it moves through Congress to ensure that we get the funds we need to continue this essential restoration project  The funds for the City of Buffalo are part of our collective commitment to helping the city deal with its unique status on a busy border in the fight against local crime and in the protection of our homeland  These kinds of federal funds are essential to our partnerships with local governments as we work together to invest in community and regional infrastructure projects for the future  Senator Clinton said  I am very pleased that we can support the Father Mychal Judge Center at St  Bonaventure and the possibilities it will mean not only for the students here in America but for those in Northern Ireland who will travel to Western New York  We have made great progress in Northern Ireland and I know that this program will serve as an important exchange of ideas and experiences beneficial to all students named in honor of a hero to many of us    Chautauqua County  NY  Landfill at Ellery will use  500 000 in funds to finance  design  permit  construct  own and operate a Landfill Gas Utilization Project for the Chautauqua County Landfill at Ellery  The requested

protected waterway around the reefs  rapids and fast currents that exist in the upstream portion of the Niagara River  The lock and channel permit pleasure craft and comercial vessels to travel between Buffalo Harbor and Tonawanda Harbor  In combination with the New York Erie Canal  they provide pleasure craft and canal draft vessels an inland water route between Lake Erie and the Atlantic Ocean    Smokes Creek  which runs through property that once housed an integrated steel facility  is in a degraded state  A feasibility study would evaluate relocating the creek to provide environmental and flood control benefits  Federal funds would be used to initiate a Feasibility Study and associated reports to determine the most optimum environmental restoration project  with respect to environmental acceptability and budget priority  Although this project is included in the bill  the final funding amounts will be determined at a later point in the appropriations process
