IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 24  2007 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approves  1 4 Million For Cornell Apple And Grape Disease Prevention Programs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Funds Will Be Awarded to Cornell University For Research To Keep New York s Viticulture and Apple Growing Industries Safe From Disease and Blight    Senators Worked Closely With Committee To Include Funding In Spending Bill    Bill will now be sent to the Senate Floor                                                                                                                     U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration  and Related Agencies FY08 Appropriations Bill  which includes  1 2 million for Viticulture Research  to be shared by Cornell University  The bill also includes  200 000 to combat Apple Fire Blight to be shared by Cornell University  The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process  Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this years spending bill   This is great news for New York vineyards and apple orchards  Schumer said  This funding will burnish Cornell Universitys sterling reputation as a premier center for agricultural research  As the second largest apple producing state in the country  and home to the gorgeous Finger Lakes vineyards  this funding is crucial to Upstate New Yorks the agricultural economy  I will continue fighting to ensure Cornell University has the funding necessary to protect our grapes and apples against disease and blight   This is wonderful news as these funds will help to safeguard the growth of our agriculture industry  The Apple Fire Blight program at Cornell Universitys New York State Agricultural Experiment Station is absolutely essential in understanding this serious bacterial disease affecting our crops  The challenges facing our grape and grape products industries will be addressed by researchers of the Viticulture Consortium  who will use the funds to distribute competitive grants  Senator Clinton said  This funding is critical to continuing research into the diseases and problems that impact some of our states biggest agricultural industries  Supporting this type of agricultural research will create better quality crops and help our local growers  fostering the world class research that helps us continue to develop a world class product   The Viticulture Consortium will receive  1 2 million to be used for a competitive grants program that will address a wide range of problems affecting grape growers on both the east and west coasts  Started in 1996 and administered by the University of California  Cornell University and Penn State University  the Consortium funds competitive grants in about half the states for grape related research  The program is designed to focus research efforts to avoid duplication and target resources to strategic priorities   identified by the industry in collaboration with researchers and extension personnel  that will accelerate innovation and knowledge based tools to enhance the competitiveness of the grape and grape products industries that are facing intense margin pressures and loss of market share to imports  The Consortium leverages state and industry funding to maximize coordination  collaboration and efficiency  eliminate duplication and ensure the extension of research results to industry users   Imports have increased to more than 29 percent of wine consumed in the U S   rising from 40 million cases in 1998 to 81 million cases in 2005  Research is critical to helping the industry improve quality  reduce costs and implement environmentally friendly practices to remain competitive with wine producing countries with lower production costs and a variety of government support programs  Individual growers cannot fund the research needed to remain competitive and continue to grow the ability of the U S  wine industry to generate jobs  tax revenue and exports  Through the Viticulture Consortium  wine grape growers  working in cooperation with table  juice and raisin grape growers  can prioritize needs  avoid duplicate projects and stimulate proposals from multi disciplines to solve complex problems  The Viticulture Consortium also fosters collaboration across institutions  creating multi state projects that provide benefit to state and national grower community   The Apple Fire Blight program at Cornell Universitys New York State Agricultural Experiment Station  located in Geneva  will receive  200 000 to be shared with Michigan State University  Fire blight is a serious bacterial disease of apples and peas and is one of the most damaging diseases affecting apple trees across the Nation  with crop and tree losses and related costs exceeding  1 million annually  Research at Cornell will be conducted to understand and manage the apple fire blight disease by investigating the molecular basis of disease resistance in apples and developing disease resistant apple varieties and rootstocks   New York is the second largest apple producing state in the country  In 2005  growers harvested more than 1 billion pounds of apples  worth almost  200 million  In a bad year  New York State losses can reach  10 million  All 60 000 acres of apples in New York State are vulnerable to the disease and may succumb when the weather favors the disease with rain  heavy dews  and high humidity   Specifically researchers hope to identify new biological control agents that can help fight the disease  identify genetic differences in closely related bacteria that cause fire blight on apples or brambles  screen a fire blight tolerant apple variety as a possible source of resistance genes  identify a new gene in the fire blight pathogen  identify alternatives to streptomycin that can control fire blight   Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee  it will be sent to the Senate floor  Following approval by the Senate  the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature
