IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 14  2005 Schumer Urges Feds To Hold Upcoming Hearing On Bethlehem Steel In Buffalo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Also Calls On Fed Review Board To Approve Former Bethlehem Steel Workers Under Nuke Worker Benefits Program Via Same Provision Used For Linde Ceramics Workers   Schumer  Former Nuclear Workers Have The Right To Witness Action On The Bethlehem Site Profile  And Participate In Public Comment Session U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on the federal Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to hold their upcoming January meeting on the Site Profile of Bethlehem Steel in Buffalo  Schumer also urged the Advisory Board to approve former Bethlehem Steel workers for participation in the compensation program via the same legal provision    the Special Exposure Cohort    used to provide access to the program for Linde Ceramics workers  In a letter to Secretary of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt  Schumer announced his support of the Linde Ceramics case  and urged Leavitt to approve Bethlehem Steel under the same clause  The Advisory Board is the gatekeeper to the federal compensation program that was established as a method of providing justice for workers who were contaminated with radiation while they toiled in America  s nuclear program during the Cold War         We need to give New York  s Cold War heroes the support they need and the compensation they deserve     Schumer said    These former nuclear workers got dangerously ill developing the country s nuclear weapons program  and should not have to wait a minute longer for help  Too many have died already  some of them perhaps from exposure to radiation     Schumer added    The upcoming Bethlehem Steel meeting needs to take place in Buffalo  because these forgotten patriots have the right to witness actions taken on the Site Profile  and participate in the public comment session  We have been working so hard for so long to provide access to justice for former nuclear workers  the time for them to get this help is now          New data from Bethlehem Steel has been under review and will be the topic of the upcoming meeting that Schumer urged  in his letter to in a letter to Dr  Paul L  Ziemer  Chairman of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  be held in Buffalo  Currently  the January meeting is scheduled to be held in Knoxville  TN  Western New York has one of the greatest concentrations of facilities involved in nuclear weapons production related activities in the nation  yet continues to be severely underserved by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  EEOICPA   Schumer suggests that many former nuclear workers have been unaware of the program or were not provided with sufficient information about how the claimant process worked  and that this program was ineffectual in its ability to address their questions and concerns properly  As a result  he feels it is even more important that the Bethlehem Site Profile meeting be held in Buffalo       During World War II and at the start of the Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help  Workers at these facilities handled high levels of radioactive materials and were responsible for helping to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War  Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer       In his letter to Leavitt  Schumer said    By approving the Special Exposure Cohort for both facilities  Linde and Bethlehem   we can finally put the former workers on the path to getting the recognition and compensation they deserve  rather than have these beleaguered cold war soldiers battle with controversial dose reconstruction programs     The Linde Ceramics decision was made using a clause which allows the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to grant a Special Exposure Cohort to workers if there is not enough information to estimate the radiation each worker was exposed to  In the case of Bethlehem Steel  NIOSH is using air sample data from Simonds Saw and Steel in place of Bethlehem Steel data to use in dose reconstruction  If using air sample data from a different factory shows a lack of information to conduct an accurate dose reconstruction  Schumer asserts that these workers should be awarded a Special Exposure Cohort as well        Senator Schumer has aggressively worked to get aid for former nuclear workers in Western New York  In an effort to compensate these workers  Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allowed them to file claims with the US Department of Labor for individual payments of  150 000 and other benefits for medical treatments  Workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War were eligible  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history       As of February 1  2004  the number of claims submitted to the Department of Labor under subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 from the Western New York region  including western Pennsylvania  exceeded the number of such claims filed at resource centers in Hanford  Washington  Portsmouth  Ohio  Los Alamos  New Mexico  the Nevada Test Site  Nevada  the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site  Colorado  the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory  Idaho  and the Amchitka Test Site  Alaska  Western New York is home to 14 former Atomic Weapon Employers  AWE  sites and DOE clean up facilities       Even though Western New York has a large number of facilities  the only assistance applicants in the region now receive to wade through layers of red tape is from a traveling resource center that comes to the area infrequently to serve current and former nuclear workers  EEOICPA Section 3631 requires DOL to provide outreach and claimant assistance       In November 2004  Schumer successfully secured a mandate from Congress that establishes a resource center intended to provide Western New Yorkers with the support that they need to effectively navigate the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  Senator Schumer s language established a new resource center in Western New York that would help sick nuclear workers with their compensation applications  Schumer  who has lambasted the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  for only paying out ten percent of claims to New York nuclear workers  said that the resource center was vital to assist local nuclear workers with the application process  Last February  Schumer urged Mr  Shelby Hallmark  the Director of the Labor Department  s Office of Workers   Compensation Programs  for an accelerated timetable in establishing this center  and in July they opened an office in the Amherst Development Park
