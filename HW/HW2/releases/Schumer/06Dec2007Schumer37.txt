IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 6  2007 With Traffic And Wait Times Likely To Worsen At NYs Border Crossings In 2008  Schumer Pushes Comprehensive Investigation Into Border Staffing Levels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Drivers at NYS Border Crossings Regularly Face Multi Mile Backups  Waiting 2 3 Hours for Customs Processing to Cross Into the U S  From Canada With the Implementation of WHTI Rules Set to Begin in January 2008  Longer Waits are Expected at the Border  Threatening Cross Border Commerce  Businesses in NYS Border Communities  and Regional Tourism   Schumer s Bill Will  Assess Traffic Patterns at the Border  Wait Times  CBP Staffing Levels and the Economic Impact on NYS Border Communities Caused by Border Traffic With New Yorkers regularly experiencing hours long waits at Upstate NY border crossings  which are only expected to grow worse with the implementation of stricter border crossing rules in January 2008  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer introduced a bill that will institute comprehensive studies on the causes and effects of traffic at New York States border crossings  Schumer is concerned that serious traffic congestions at border crossings are harming local businesses in NYS border communities and hampering the ability of tourists to move between the U S  and Canada  Schumer also expressed concern that a lack of Customs and Border Patrol  CBP  agents at border crossings is contributing to the traffic jams and long waits     The congestion at the borders is only expected to grow worse with the start of implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   which will require land passengers to show a passport when crossing the Northern border  As the first step of WHTI implementation  CBP has pledged to stop accepting oral declarations of citizenship and to begin demanding documents proving citizenship  such as a birth certificate  at the border starting on January 31  2008    Schumer today introduced his bill  the Border Wait Times Study Act  which will examine the following issues at the countrys border crossings  traffic patterns  wait times  and how CBP staffing levels are affecting wait times  In addition  Schumers bill will assess whether and how long waits at the borders are economically hurting New York States border communities     Its high time that we get a crystal clear picture of what is causing these huge delays at New York States border crossings  which have the potential to both jeopardize cross border commerce and stifle regional tourism  said Senator Schumer  New Yorkers are all too familiar with the frustration that comes with sitting in your car for hours during family vacations or even shopping trips  waiting to cross the border  These comprehensive studies will pinpoint the necessary steps we need to take to ensure that in the future New Yorkers can quickly and safely cross the border    In recent months  border waits have grown longer due to CBP agents stepping up border inspections in anticipation of new rules scheduled to take effect in January that will require Americans to show a passport or other proof of citizenship and identity to enter the United States     Schumer today noted that there is also concern that inadequate staffing levels at inspection booths at the states border crossings has led to waits of up to two or three hours during peak travel periods  During holidays  additional post 9 11 security measures have led to even longer waits  for example  during the 4th of July weekend this year  some drivers reported waiting up to five hours to cross the bridge  The problem begins early in the morning during the 6am to 9am rush hour     Schumer also noted that border congestion hinders business in border communities across the state  The United States and Canada have the largest bi national trade relationship in the world  Trade with Canada supports an estimated 350 000 jobs in New York alone  Fully 25  of all New York State exports  accounting for  10 5 billion  go to Canada every year  The impact of tourism and spur of the moment trips is also staggering  with Canadians accounting for 2 2 million visits to New York in 2002 and injecting  389 million into the local economies    Schumer  who has led the charge to ensure a safe  secure and efficient flow of traffic at New York States border crossings  said that increased staffing would help to move cars and trucks more quickly through the inspection station and would alleviate some of the gridlock  In the past  Schumer has sent letters to the Customs Commissioner urging him to increase staff levels at the stations  especially during the morning rush hour between 6am and 9am  and to better plan the deployment of staff at the inspection booths  The delays  backups and waiting times have become more than just an inconvenience  it is now interfering with local commerce and safety  Schumer wrote  I urge Customs to increase staffing during peak commuter traffic hours as soon as possible     Schumers bill  the Border Wait Times Study Act  will require the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Commerce to submit reports to Congress on the commercial and passenger vehicle traffic at points of entry across the nation and New York State     The study will investigate four issues     Traffic patterns of commercial and passenger vehicles at international land ports of entry along the northern and southern borders of the United States      Volume and wait times of commercial and passenger vehicles entering and exiting the United States as land ports of entry since the year 2000      The effect of staffing levels on wait times at land points of entry since the year 2000  and     The impact that border traffic  wait times and staff levels have had on the economic health of border communities across the country     The Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Commerce  in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security  will be responsible for conducting the studies     Schumer has raised serious concerns that DHS is moving too quickly to implement new passport rules and has urged DHS to give NY State enough time to make new enhanced drivers licenses available to citizens for border crossings
