                                   U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced a total of  7 749 800 has been awarded to two organizations in Western New York by the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  under the Section 202 Grant program   ITC Corporation will receive  2 843 000 to add an additional senior living community to its housing complex in Lewiston   People Inc  will receive a grant for  5 915 800 to create safe and affordable housing for low income seniors in Lockport and Angola   In May  2006 Schumer sent personal letters to the Secretary of HUD on behalf of ITC Corporation and People Inc  supporting their applications for this funding             This is great news for Western New York  said Schumer     For far too many seniors  the cost of living is so high that it forces them to move elsewhere  or move into substandard housing   These new apartments will not only give seniors an affordable alternative  but they are also designed to be safe and convenient by offering a variety of services   People  Inc and ITC Corporation have done a great job ensuring that community seniors can continue to enjoy the high quality of life that Western New York has to offer          People  Inc  will use federal funds for the construction of safe and affordable housing apartments for low income seniors in Lockport and Angola   Many seniors in these areas are currently living in sub standard housing  without the support they need to continue living independently   Founded in 1970  People Inc  is a leading non profit human service agency serving communities throughout Western New York   The agency provides a variety of services  including residential  employment  community outreach  health care  and recreation programs   Today  the agency provides over 300 units of quality housing for low income seniors in Amherst  Blasdell  Buffalo  Cheektowaga  Grand Island  and Hamburg   In September of this year  People Inc  was awarded  399 000 from HUD under the Section 202 Demonstration Planning Grant program for predevelopment planning related expenses including architectural and engineering work and site control        ITC Corporation will use federal funds to add an additional senior living community to its housing complex  Lewiston Villa  on Upper Mountain Road in Lewiston    The new facility will include 24 new affordable housing units  each equipped with crucial senior safety mechanisms including grab bars and adjustable mirrors   In addition  the units will also include emergency pull cords in each bathroom and bedroom to help residents summon help   The new complex will provide area seniors with the privacy they desire  but will also feature a community room with kitchenette and an attached patio   The facility will be in close proximity to medical facilities  shopping  entertainment  churches  and many other conveniences  At Lewiston Villa  qualified applicants are offered subsidized rents  based on their age and income   In the Lewiston area  apartments typically rent for more than  700 per month  making more low income senior housing opportunities a necessity          The Section 202 Program allows elderly persons  including the frail elderly  to live as independently as possible in the community by increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services   Under this program  capital advances are made to private nonprofit organizations or non profit consumer cooperatives to build  acquire  and or rehabilitate rental housing with supportive services for elderly persons  including the frail elderly  who are 62 years of age or older   The capital advance is interest free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low income elderly persons for at least 40 years   Project rental assistance is used to cover the difference between the HUD approved operating cost per unit and the tenant  s rent
