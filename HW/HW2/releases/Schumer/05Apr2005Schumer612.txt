IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 5  2005 Schumer  Senate Should Shoot Down Lawsuit Immunity For Gun Manufacturers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Innocent Victims of Gun Violence Should Be Protected from Defective Guns  Irresponsible Gun Dealers and Manufacturers U S  Senator Chuck Schumer joined with the Brady Campaign and a number of other lawmakers and victims of gun violence today to call for the defeat of a bill in the Senate that would grant broad lawsuit immunity to gun manufacturers  Schumer  s statement for the press conference follows       Last year  the NRA failed in their effort to pass a bill that would have given greedy gun manufacturers and dealers broad immunity against any lawsuit brought by victims of gun violence     The American court system is not a perfect system  and we took great strides to reform it in the class action bill earlier this year  But the court system is the great equalizer  It allows everyone    from businessmen to electricians to plumbers    to play on the same field under the same rules     We should never take that level playing field away from ordinary citizens absent some extraordinary circumstance    and there is none in this case     But that is exactly what the NRA and some Republicans would like to do  I understand that they are going to reintroduce this bill  which is plainly a sweetheart deal for the gun manufacturers and dealers  and a heart attack for victims of gun violence     We must do everything we can to amend this bill or defeat it     This bill will hurt victims of gun violence all across America  And I mean that literally  Innocent men  women  and children will end up being shot and killed if this bill passes because a gun dealer can  t keep track of his guns and there is no check on him     This bill will endanger law enforcement officers    like Officers Lomengello and McGuire from New Jersey    or judges like the ones slain by gunmen this year in Chicago and Atlanta    because a gun dealer is too lazy or too greedy to draw the distinction between selling a gun to a lawful citizen and selling one to a violent criminal or straw purchaser     This bill will immediately put us all in danger because it eliminates the last check our society has on bad gun dealers    the threat of lawsuits    because the regulations on the books are insufficient     Today  a bad gun dealer has nothing to fear from the federal agency that oversees guns    the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives  ATF   ATF is underfunded  understaffed and   at most   inspects about 5  of gun dealers a year     The only thing left standing between bad gun dealers and violent criminals is the threat of lawsuits  And this bill would eliminate that threat  leaving bad dealers free to handle their weapons as negligently as they wish     And when I say   bad    gun dealers  I mean   bad gun dealers   not the thousands of honest gun dealers across America who follow the law  pay their taxes and serve their communities     We know who most of these bad gun dealers are  A recent study of ATF data by the group Americans for Gun Safety found that   on average  57  of ATF  s gun traces from crime scenes go back to only 1  of gun dealers nationwide     Put another way  1  of the nation  s licensed gun dealers   or about 1 000 gun dealers   provide more than half of the guns used in crimes in America     If we know who the bad gun dealers are in America  it is reasonable to ask   why can  t we do something about them  You would think that the government could focus on these bad dealers and eliminate them  But it appears incapable of doing so     Those bad gun dealers continue to provide guns to   straw purchasers      or criminals   over and over and over again   with very little consequence  They continue to keep sloppy records   fail to keep proper inventories   and lose their weapons to theft or negligence without even knowing that they have been stolen     The poster child for the failure of the current system to regulate gun dealers is the Bull  s Eye Shooter Supply gun dealer in Tacoma  Washington  the dealer who provided the gun used by the Sniper to shoot and kill 10 people in the Washington  D C  area     The sniper rifle was stolen from Bull  s Eye sometime in 2001 without the dealer even knowing it     ATF inspected Bull  s Eye not once  not twice  not three times  but four times in six years prior to the sniper shootings  And do you know what those inspections revealed  They revealed that Bull  s Eye could not account for over 160 missing guns from its inventory  160 guns   160 possible sniper weapons      And what happened since this was discovered     Well  the ATF then did a real investigation and found that Bull  s Eye could not account for   not 160   but 238 guns  That is 238 guns that were missing Bull  s Eyes missing gun rate was worse than 98  of all other gun dealers in America  But it was still open and doing business     And what recourse was there for the families of the sniper victims while they were waiting for the government to act     The only remedy left to the D C  sniper victims  s families is the last check left on bad gun dealers across America   the threat of a lawsuit     The victims of people killed by the D C  snipers sued the gun dealer for negligence and other claims in Washington State  A judge has looked at the case  denied defendant  s motion to dismiss and set a trial date for November 2004     The system is working as it should  The victims   families have exercised their right to have their day in court     But passing this Gun Immunity Bill would destroy that right  It is an extreme remedy that would slam the door of the courthouse in the face of all gun crime victims others who try to make sure that gun dealers are responsible     That the NRA and the Republicans are rushing this bill to the floor of the Senate is a slap in the face of common sense and justice    particularly in this post 9 11 world     Last month  in fact  we learned from the GAO that our gun laws remain in a pre 9 11 world  That if you  re on a terrorist watch list  that  s not enough to disqualify you from buying an AK 47 or any other kind of firearm in this country  That  s preposterous and should be at the top of Congress   agenda    not creating immunity from lawsuits for the gun manufacturers and dealers     I will be reintroducing legislation soon to close that loophole     Our goal in the Senate should be to make it harder for terrorists to obtain deadly weapons    not easier  Our goal in the Senate should be to stand by the side of law enforcement  who put their necks on the line for each and every one of us day in and day out     Our goal should therefore be to do everything we can to defeat the NRA  s gun immunity bill
