IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 31  2006 Schumer Urges State To Support Disaster Preparedness Program In Peekskill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Calls For Plan To Meet The National Guard and Homeland Security Needs   Schumer  This Essential Program Cuts Reaction Time In Case Of Disaster U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on Governor George E  Pataki to support the Pre Positioned Equipment Program  PEP   and resist any attempt to downside or relocate resources  Schumer called for a plan that will meet the National Guard and Homeland Security needs  Peekskill  New York is home to one of nine PEP sites  and would react to a disaster in the Hudson Valley  New York City  much of New York State and the entire northeast  The goal of the PEP is to provide first responders across the country with the equipment they need to handle disasters in the critical hours and days before Federal assistance  including the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   can arrive  Firefighters and other first responders strongly support this program as it provides them with the equipment and support staff they so sorely need in the unfortunate event of a disaster         This is an important tool for ensuring our nation is prepared in case of disaster  be it terrorist or natural     Schumer said    The PEP located at Camp Smith in Peekskill  New York  is an essential program for not only the Hudson Valley and New York City  but America at large  Camp Smith is an ideal location  because of its other infrastructure and operations  including military security  National Guard transportation units  and a helicopter landing pad  It also has easy access to the airlift capabilities at Stewart International Airport  We need to develop a plan meets the needs of the National Guard  while ensuring that New York has the required equipment in the case of a disaster          The building that the PEP program occupies at Camp Smith is slated for demolition by the National Guard  and PEP has been told it must leave the building by September 2006  Officials of the Red Cross in New York City need to expand their emergency equipment storage  and Schumer suggests that the PEP building at Camp Smith  would be a good location for them as well  The Red Cross is looking for 15 000 to 25 000 square feet  and specifically seek space outside New York City  At Camp Smith  the PEP occupies approximately 35 000 square feet  of the building s total 88 000 square feet  The demolition is scheduled in order to make way for construction of a new National Guard building       In a personal letter to Pataki  Schumer wrote    While undoubtedly the National Guard wants to proceed with its new structure  perhaps there is another location on Camp Smith s 1 600 acres for it  This would allow the building housing PEP to remain and also expand its use as an emergency preparedness site serving a large part of New York State and New York City  Alternatively  perhaps there is other space at Camp Smith to house PEP and the Red Cross  I urge you to review whether the demolition of the building housing PEP can be halted or delayed  while still ensuring that the needs of the National Guard are met  PEP and other emergency support services that could be located at Camp Smith are  like the National Guard  critically important to the firefighters and other first responders who protect New Yorkers in times of crisis          Established after Sept  11  2001  the PEP program has already demonstrated its effectiveness  delivering seven pods of equipment to first responders after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in August 2005  PEP also responded in January 2005 to Graniteville  SC  after a train derailment resulted in a chlorine gas leak that killed nine people and overwhelmed local emergency resources       Currently  the PEP is operational at four out of eleven sites throughout the country  following budget cuts by the Department of Homeland Security earlier this year  There are reports the FEMA  which now oversees the program  may be reinstating four more sites  The Camp Smith site was not affected by the cutbacks  The PEP equipment includes personal protective devices and clothing  detection equipment for radiological  chemical and biological agents  medical equipment  communication equipment  and other vital supplies  All of these are packaged in  pods   which remain loaded at all times onto large flatbed trucks at each PEP site  The loaded trucks can be put on the road immediately upon notification of a disaster  When operating at full capacity  the program is capable of sending support to any major population area in America within twelve hours  Schumer wrote to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff in March  urging DHS to retain the program  which had been scheduled for elimination
