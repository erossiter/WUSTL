IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 24  2005 Schumer  Bitter Dispute Between FAA And Controllers At NY Air Traffic Control Tower Jeopardizes New Yorkers   Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator takes unusual step of  on Transportation Secretary Mineta to mediate dispute immediately    Schumer  Severe slashing of FAA budget and friction between labor and management must no longer stand between the public and safety With reports that errors at the New York TRACON have jumped to an all time high  from 24 last year to 117 this year   and disputes between the FAA and the National Air Traffic Controllers  Association    the union that represents controllers    continue to boil over due to staffing concerns and overtime disagreements  putting New Yorkers who fly out of Newark  Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in serious danger  Senator Charles E  Schumer today took an unusual step and  on Secretary Mineta to step in and put an end to the fighting  Schumer  s call comes on the heels of a series of bitter disagreements between the two groups and a proven inability by both to come to conclusions on appropriate levels of staffing and general confusion on whether and why there has been such a dramatic rise in operational errors         The bottom line is  errors are increasing  air traffic is increasing and staff numbers are steadily decreasing  in my book this could be a recipe for disaster     said Schumer    This is not about pointing fingers  it  s about finding solutions          The reported increase in incidents is the first finding of an investigation at the New York TRACON  Terminal Radar Approach Control  in Westbury  Long Island where controllers guide planes in and out of area airports  The new numbers came to light after a Department of Transportation Inspector General review of mistakes reported to the anonymous FAA hotline  117 errors is an enormous number for a facility like the New York TRACON where last year the controllers reported only 24       The investigation began in late February  about a month after New York TRACON managers tried to cut back on authorized overtime and then saw a spike in reports of operational errors  The controllers union attributes the sudden increase in operational errors as the result of the FAA preventing controllers from supplementing staffing shortages with overtime  a previously common practice  and thus reducing the number of controllers on the scopes at any given time  The FAA sent a   tiger team    to investigate  their full report is expected to be released next week       This finding  along with staffing and overtime concerns  have sparked a bitter dispute between the union and the FAA  endangering the millions of New Yorkers  Americans and world travelers who fly in and out of area airports  In addition  air traffic is rising steadily  and without an adequate assessment of staffing needs  area airports will be unprepared for the growing number of people trying to fly  In an effort to combat this dangerous scenario  Schumer today took the unusual step of writing a letter to Transportation Secretary Mineta to mediate the dispute         Severe slashing of FAA budget and friction between labor and management must no longer stand between the public and safety     said Schumer    Safety must come first          Among the claims that Schumer is calling on Mineta to resolve are            There have been 117 reported   operational incidents    so far this year  up from only 24 last year  Operational incidents are classified in groups as A  B  C  and D with A  s and Bs as the most serious The FAA claims that while 30  of these incidents are classified as A and B type errors  they are in fact not that serious and do not put lives at risk  The union contends that controllers have been fired in the past for making similar A and B errors           The FAA says that the dramatic increase in operational errors is highly suspicious and comes from a few  disgruntled  employees  However  last year the DOT Inspector General found significant underreporting of errors at the NY TRACON  The FAA claims that now this is a coordinated effort by the union to increase the number of errors to make the safety situation at the TRACON seem worse than it is  The union replies that FAA regulations require them to report potential errors to the FAA and that it is up to the FAA to determine whether the errors actually occurred and the degree of severity            One of the disputes centers on how much overtime should be made available at NY TRACON  The FAA says the union is simply trying to   shake them down    for unneeded overtime  The FAA argues that they spend a far greater amount on overtime at the NY TRACON than they do at comparable facilities  almost  4 million last year compared to a little more than  1 million at the Southern California TRACON which employs a similar number of controllers   The union says that the  4 million figure is actually exaggerated  it includes other facilities not involved in air traffic operations  The union has consistently said that its primary objective is to increase staffing levels to their proper amounts  not to retain overtime  Inherently  any increase in staffing would result in a corresponding decrease in the need for overtime to supplement staffing shortages  The FAA says it is preparing a new scheduling plan that will eliminate the need for additional controllers and plans to present it to the union in the coming weeks       The New York TRACON is currently staffed at only 76 percent  According to the FAA  the TRACON is authorized 270 controllers to ensure safe and efficient operations  Yet  there are only 224 controllers assigned to the facility and of those  only 205 are certified professional controllers   In January 2005  there were 212 certified professional controllers  now there are only 205  Almost 20  of controllers at the TRACON can retire today         I have said it before  and I will say it as many times as it takes to be heard  we need to make sure that there are enough trained controllers to make the system work  With the increase in air traffic and the concern of losing controllers to retirees we just can  t risk understaffing the tower     said Schumer       According to the Port Authority  nearly 94 million passengers used John F  Kennedy  Newark and LaGuardia Airports in 2004 which exceeded the annual totals before September 11th  37 5 million passengers passed through John F  Kennedy Airport  representing an 18 percent increase over 2003  Newark Airport saw an 8 3 percent increase  with 31 9 million passengers in 2004 and LaGuardia Airport had 24 4 million passengers in 2004  an increase of 8 7 percent       Click here to view
