IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 9  2005 Schumer Hands Alito List Of Over 100 Questions At Their First Meeting Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator Hopes to Get Answers to a Broad Range of Questions Discussed in Private Meeting Today and Addressed by His List of Questions As Well U S  Sen  Chuck Schumer  the ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  met with Judge Samuel Alito today and handed him a list of over 100 questions  Judge Alito will come before the Judiciary Committee on January 9  2006       Questions for Judge Samuel A  Alito  Jr  from Senator Charles E  Schumer      1  Judicial Review and Legislative Deference      Chief Justice John Marshall famously wrote in Marbury v  Madison  1803     It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is  Those who apply the rule to particular cases  must of necessity expound and interpret that rule  If two laws conflict with each other  the courts must decide on the operation of each                Do you agree with the principle of judicial review established in Marbury v  Madison        Under what circumstances should the Supreme Court invalidate a law duly passed by Congress        What deference should the Court give to Congress when reviewing legislation  Is similar deference  less deference  or greater deference owed to the enactments of state legislatures        Do certain types of laws    such as comprehensive regulatory regimes or criminal laws    deserve greater deference than others        Do you agree that the Supreme Court must defer to Congress when Congress had a   rational basis    for believing that a particular activity has a   substantial affect    on interstate commerce       Which of the following laws and legal documents should be construed as narrowly as possible  and which should be construed more broadly            The Constitution        Federal statutes        State statutes        Agency rules and regulations        Search warrants        Contractual terms       Let me ask you about a few cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down federal or state laws            Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s decision to strike down the Gun Free School Zones Act at issue in United States v  Lopez  1995   Why or why not        Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s decision to strike down provisions of the Violence Against Women Act in United States v  Morrison  2000   Why or why not        Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s decision that the federal Controlled Substances Act can be constitutionally enforced against California citizens with respect to medical marijuana  despite that state  s Compassionate Use Act  in Gonzales v  Raich  2005        2  Stare Decisis       Under what circumstances is it appropriate for the Supreme Court to overturn a well settled precedent upon which Americans have come to rely            Does your answer depend at all on the length of time that the precedent has been on the books        Does your answer depend at all on how widely criticized or accepted the precedent is        Does it matter if the precedent was 5 4 in deciding whether to overturn it  Does it matter if was a unanimous decision        Does it matter whether the question at hand is a matter of statutory interpretation or constitutional interpretation        Does it matter if the precedent has been revisited  Does it matter if the precedent has been specifically affirmed  Does it matter if the Court was closely split on revisiting        Does it matter if the composition of the Court has changed since the issue was originally considered        What if you agree with the result in a case but believe the legal reasoning was seriously flawed  Does that make a difference       Specifically            Do you agree with the 1976 decision in which the Supreme Court held that Congress could not extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and city employees  National League of Cities v  Usery   or do you agree with the later 1985 decision  which held that Congress could  Garcia v  San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent nine years later  Why or why not        Do you agree with the 1989 decision in which the Supreme Court held that it was constitutional to execute minors  Stanford v  Kentucky   or do you agree with the later 2005 decision  which held that executing minors violates the Eighth Amendment  Roper v  Simmons   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent sixteen years later  Why or why not        Do you agree with the 1986 decision in which the Supreme Court held that states could criminalize private sex acts between consenting adults  Bowers v  Hardwick   or do you agree with the later 2003 decision  which held that the states could not  Lawrence v  Texas   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent seventeen years later  Why or why not       3  Judicial Activism      How do you define judicial activism  Give us three examples of Supreme Court cases that you consider to be the product of judicial activism            Is the   activist    label limited to more liberal leaning judges  or can there be conservative activist judges  Can you cite any examples of conservative judicial activism        Do you believe that the Supreme Court was engaging in judicial activism when it struck down provisions of the Gun Free School Zones Act  United States v  Lopez  or the Violence Against Women Act  United States v  Morrison   both of which had been passed by Congress       Was the Supreme Court engaging in judicial activism in            Brown v  Board of Education        Miranda v  Arizona        Dred Scott v  Sandford        The Civil Rights Cases of 1883        Lochner v  New York        Furman v  Georgia        Bush v  Gore       What distinguishes one case from the other       Judicial activism has been defined as a making rather than interpreting law  and specifically as a lack of deference to the politically accountable branches of government through the invalidation of laws enacted through the democratic process  A recent study found that  by this definition  Justice Clarence Thomas  appointed by President George H  W  Bush  was the most activist judge on the Supreme Court  voting to invalidate 65 63 percent of Congressional statutes he considered  Justice Stephen Breyer  appointed by President Bill Clinton  was the least  voting to invalidate 28 13 percent  Do you agree with this definition of judicial activism  Why or why not       4  Judicial Philosophy      Do you describe yourself as falling into any particular school of judicial philosophy            What is your view of   strict constructionism           What is your view of the notion of   original intent    and   original meaning     Is there a significant difference between the two         How do you square the notion of respecting   original intent    with the acceptance of the institution of slavery at the time the Constitution was adopted       Chief Justice Roberts used the terms   modesty    and   stability    to describe the philosophical underpinnings of his approach to judging            What is your perspective on this approach        Would you use the same words to describe yourself         What other descriptions would you choose       5  Commerce Clause      Beginning in 1937  when it upheld the National Labor Relations Act  the Supreme Court has granted Congress great latitude in passing laws under the Commerce Clause  The Court has upheld a wide range of federal laws  including those that regulate labor standards  personal consumption of produce  racial discrimination in public accommodations  and crime  In the last ten years  however  the Supreme Court has shifted course  striking down acts of Congress on Commerce Clause grounds for the first time in Sixty years            Do you agree that prior to the mid 1990s  the Court had given Congress too much leeway in its exercise of the Commerce Clause power         Do you agree with the trend towards striking down laws on this basis        What do you believe is the extent of Congress  s authority to legislate under the Commerce Clause  How are those limits determined        Can Congress regulate local trade in a product that is used nationally        Can Congress regulate labor standards for states and cities under its Commerce Clause power        How closely connected must the regulated action be to interstate commerce for Congress to have the authority to legislate        Where would you look for evidence that Congress is properly legislating under its Commerce Clause authority  Do you rely exclusively on the text of the legislation  Do you look at the legislative history  Do you consider the nature of the regulated activity       Specifically            Do you agree with the Court  s decision in United States v  Lopez  1995   which struck down the Gun Free School Zone Act  Is there any circumstance under which Congress could regulate activities in and around schools using its Commerce Clause authority        Do you believe that the Constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate wholly intrastate manufacturing and production of commercial goods  as the Court held in Wickard v  Filburn  1942  and Gonzales v  Raich  2005         Do you see any inconsistencies between the trend that began with United States v  Lopez  1995  and United States v  Morrison  2000  and the decision this year in Gonzales v  Raich  2005  In your view  can those cases be fairly reconciled       6  Privacy      Is there a constitutionally protected right to privacy  and if so  under what circumstances does it apply            The word   privacy    is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution  In your view  does that mean it is wrong for the Supreme Court to interpret the 14th Amendment to the Constitution as conferring such a right        Do you agree with Justice Scalia  s reference in United States v  Carlton  1994  to   substantive due process    as an   oxymoron     Or  alternatively  do you agree with Chief Justice Roberts that the Fourteenth Amendment  s guarantee of   due process    has a substantive component as a well as a procedural component        Do you further agree with Chief Justice Roberts that a right to privacy is part of the liberty interest that is protected under the substantive component of due process        Do you believe that either the United States Congress or the states can regulate the sexual behavior of individuals within the privacy of their home       Specifically            Do you believe that Griswold v  Connecticut  1965   which held that the right to privacy in the Constitution protects the right of married couples to purchase and use contraception  was correctly decided  Do you agree with the legal reasoning in that case  Do you believe it reached the right result        Do you believe that Roe v  Wade  1973  was correctly decided  Do you agree with the legal reasoning in that case  Do you believe that it reached the right result        Once a particular right to privacy has been found    as in Griswold and Roe    under what circumstances should the Supreme Court revisit that right        Do you agree with Chief Justice Roberts  s statements in his confirmation hearings that the right to privacy extends back to the cases Meyer v  Nebraska  1923  and Pierce v  Society of Sisters  1925   which concerned the rights of parents to educate their children        7  Civil Rights           Do you believe that racism remains a problem in America        Do you believe that sexism remains a problem in America        Are there other issues of discrimination that you find troubling in America         What is your general view of the constitutionality of affirmative action        Does a law violate the Equal Protection Clause if it affects different groups differently  or must there be a discriminatory intent        What do you believe to be the constitutionally appropriate role of the federal government and of the courts to protect access to the polls  From what provisions of the Constitution do these roles derive         To what extent can Congress use its power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit discrimination that is not already prohibited by the Amendment itself        What are the requirements and limitations of the constitutional principle of one person one vote         Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s holding in Johnson v  DeGrandy that proportional representation  while not dispositive  may be an indication that a districting plan does not unlawfully dilute minority voting strength under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act        Do you agree that  under the Equal Protection Clause  disparate impact alone does not render a law unconstitutional  as the Court held in Washington v  Davis  1976        8  Environment      What is the proper role of the federal government in enacting laws to protect the environment            Does the Constitution provide any instruction on how Congress should balance the interests of industry against environmental interests        Under the Constitution  how far can Congress go in imposing restrictions on people and businesses to protect the air and water        Under the Constitution  how far can the states go in enacting laws to protect the environment  and does it matter whether there is federal legislation on the same subject        Who has standing to challenge a corporation or a governmental agency that either is damaging or inadequately protecting the environment        9  Rights of the Disabled      What is the proper role of the federal government in enacting laws to protect the rights of the disabled            Does the Constitution provide any instruction as to how Congress should balance the costs to business against the government  s interest in creating equal access to facilities for disabled persons        Does the Constitution provide any instruction on whether federal laws mandating access to buildings for disabled people can be written to apply to both public and private buildings in the states        Under the Constitution  may Congress use its spending power to attach conditions to the receipt of federal funds by the states  What limitations  if any  apply to such conditions        For example  do you believe that the Americans with Disabilities Act constitutionally requires state buildings to be accessible to the disabled  as the Supreme Court held in Tennessee v  Lane  or do you think that sovereign immunity exempts the states       10  First Amendment and Freedom of Expression       What  if any  are the limitations on the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution            When can Government regulate public speech by individuals        When does speech cross the line between constitutionally protected free expression and slander        In what ways does the First Amendment protect the spending and raising of money by individuals in politics        Can Government regulate hate speech  What about sexually explicit materials       Specifically            Do you agree with the landmark decision in New York Times v  Sullivan  1964   which held that public criticism of public figures is acceptable unless motivated by actual malice  What individual characteristics do you believe determine whether someone is a public figure under this standard        Do you believe the Supreme Court was correct to strike down the Communications Decency Act in Reno v  ACLU  1997  on the grounds that pornography on the Internet is protected by the First Amendment        What is your view on the distinction the Supreme Court drew in Buckley v  Valeo  1976  and McConnell v  FEC  2003  between contributions and expenditures in the course of political campaigns  Do you believe that it is legitimate to construe campaign expenditures as protected speech but not donations by individuals       11  First Amendment and the Establishment Clause       Under the Establishment Clause  what  if any  is the appropriate role of religion in Government            Is there a difference between religious expression in Government buildings  documents  and institutions and Government spending on private  faith based initiatives        What do you see as the constitutionally protected or limited role of faith based groups in Government funded activity  In Government institutions       Specifically            In the two cases the Supreme Court decided on the Ten Commandments recently  a display of the Commandments inside a Courthouse was found unconstitutional  while a statue of the Commandments on the grounds of a state capitol was deemed acceptable  Do you agree with the distinction the Court drew between the two displays in Van Orden v  Perry and McCreary Country v  ACLU  2005   In your view  are these decisions consistent with each other        What is your view of the Supreme Court s opinion in Santa Fe Independent School District v  Doe  2000   which held that prayer in public schools is prohibited even where it is student organized  non denominational  and at a football game       12  Justiciability      Where would you draw the line between questions that are political and questions that are appropriate for a court to decide            Do you agree with the reasoning in Powell v  McCormack  Why or why not        Do you agree with the reasoning in Baker v  Carr  Why or why not         Do you agree with the reasoning in Bush v  Gore  Why or why not        What power does the Supreme Court have to intervene in state election laws  as in Bush v  Gore         What role should the Supreme Court play in disputed elections       13  Which Supreme Court Justice do you believe your jurisprudence most closely resembles and why       14  When the Supreme Court issues non unanimous opinions  Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg frequently find themselves in disagreement with each other  Do you more frequently agree with Justice Scalia s opinions  or Justice Ginsburg s       15  Can you identify three Supreme Court cases that have not been reversed where you are critical of the Court s holding or reasoning and discuss the reasons for your criticism       16  Can you identify any case you have decided in which you felt compelled by the law to reach an outcome that you would have disagreed with from a policy perspective
