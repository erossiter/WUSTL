IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 15  2006 Schumer  Hempstead Supervisor Murray Call For Emergency Funding For Point Lookout And Dredging Of Jones Inlet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Long Beach City Council Rejected Army Corps Storm Damage Reduction Erosion Action Plan Leaving Fate of Point Lookout in Jeopardy   Schumer to Congressional Appropriators  with Point Lookout Eroding and Jones Inlet Deteriorating  the Town of Hempstead May be in Double Jeopardy Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray made a bipartisan push for urgent funding for two critical projects for the Town of Hempstead  the dredging of Jones Inlet and funding for an erosion project at Point Lookout  Earlier this month the Long Beach City Council rejected a critical Army Corps action plan that would preserve the beauty and vitality of Point Lookout  leaving its future in jeopardy  Hempstead Town officials have strongly supported Army Corps plans to alleviate the terrible damage inflicted on residential  commercial and recreational interests         It has been clear for decades that Point Lookout is in trouble and the problem can no longer be fixed cosmetically   Schumer said   Without critical funding to move this project forward and dredge the Jones Inlet  the Hempstead community will continue to be at risk of escalating and imminent threats as this year  s storm season arrives           Hempstead Town is sending out an S O S   which stands for Save Our Shorefront  and the time to answer the town s S O S  is now   said Hempstead Town Supervisor Kate Murray   We ve been committed to this project to protect our beaches  homes and infrastructure from further damage for over a decade  Now that Long Beach has opted out of the project  Senator Schumer and I  along with a host of other federal  state and local representatives are calling on the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with a plan to protect residents of Point Lookout and other town beaches on Long Beach Island         Severe erosion has devastated local Hempstead beaches and exposed the Point Lookout community to damage from major storms like Nor easters and Hurricanes  Schumer noted today that that the Army Corps has recognized Point Lookout as the hardest hit area on the barrier island  Schumer also indicated that  by taking swift action the Army Corps will mitigate the impact of high energy waves and ocean side flooding in the event of a level 3 hurricane 100 year storm event as well as provide beach nourishment to counteract augmenting erosion and related dune destruction  Moreover  this essential project will restore safe navigation and direct passage through Jones Inlet for emergency  commercial  and recreational vessels       In his letter to Chairman Pete Domenici and Ranking Democrat Harry Reid of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee  Schumer wrote   It is important to reiterate that after forty years of planning  twenty years of refining a feasibility plan  and two substantial reviews  now the community faces the real possibility that the entire project will be abandoned  Nobody disputes that action at the most severely damaged eastern reach in Point Lookout in Hempstead is long overdue  If the Corps enacts its plans at Point Lookout  the Town of Hempstead will be able to implement desperately needed capital projects to restore environmental and recreational quality on the beaches         In order to provide a minimal level of immediate storm damage protection to the easternmost areas  Schumer and Murray also asked that funding support dredging of Jones Inlet and concomitant beneficial placement of the dredged material on the immediate down drift shore  Together  the short term benefits of the sand from the channel maintenance project coupled with the 50 year long term storm damage reduction plan will provide the area with a level of protection sought by local officials through the Corps  original planning effort  By mitigating the problems at Jones Inlet  the Corps will offer sorely needed assistance in improving safe and productive commercial and recreational navigation  emergency marine response  and prevention of the westerly migration of deep water channel that threatens the shore stabilization structures along Point Lookout        In his letter Schumer noted that implementation of the Plan in the area known as Reach 1 includes  dune and berm development  groin rehabilitation  four new groins with three deferred  and the extension of groin number one       Jones Inlet has historically been dredged on a 2 3 year cycle  However the most recent dredging there was in 1995 which means dredging is long overdue  Schumer noted today that the project is not in the President s 2007 budget and he has requested  5 5 million for Maintenance Dredging and Beach Nourishment at Jones Inlet  The lack of dredging has caused the waterway to become too shallow and mariners are endangered  Sand is filling in the channel and causing rougher and more unpredictable conditions  Jones Inlet is used by nearly 20 commercial vessels  including fishing vessels  and charter fishing vessels  as well as the M V Majesty  a passenger vessel certified to carry over 400 passengers        Schumer s letter also said   Now more than ever  residents of Point Lookout know they are threatened with the spectre of the Atlantic Ocean further encroaching upon their homes  I understand that the Point Lookout community  as well as the Town of Hempstead  enthusiastically endorses the Corps  plan to provide this curative storm damage mitigation and long term erosion control to the area  With Long Beach choosing to forego its portion of the plan  let s delay no further in cooperating with Hempstead officials in addressing this matter  I respectfully request the Committee provide  2 5 million to the Army Corps of Engineers for the Point Lookout section of the Long Beach Island Storm Damage Reduction Project
