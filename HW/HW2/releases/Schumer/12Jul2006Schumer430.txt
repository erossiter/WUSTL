IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 12  2006 In The Wake Of New Attacks  Schumer  Menendez  Clinton Offer Amendment Boost Funding For Mass Transit Security In Homeland Security Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         With Two New Threats Revealed in As Many Months  How Many Wake Up Calls Do the Feds Need    Homeland Security Appropriations Bill On Senate Floor This Week  Schumer  Menendez  Clinton to Offer Amendments to Provide an Additional  300 million in Federal Funding for New York and New Jersey and Transit Security With yesterday  s tragic bombing of trains in India and the recent revelation of two new terror plots against New York area transportation systems  today U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  Robert Menendez and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced they are going to offer an amendment to provide an additional  300 million to beef up mass transit security to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill which is on the Senate floor this week         It  s shocking that after two confirmed terror threats to New York in as many months Secretary Chertoff remains as stubborn as he has been     Schumer said    I don  t know how many wake up calls Chertoff needs before he understands that New York is in the crosshairs of those who wish to do us harm  The feds need to help us protect New York  instead of asking us to fight terror blindfolded with one hand tied behind our backs           Yesterday  s tragic bombings in India are just one more warning to a Republican Congress that continues to fiddle when it comes to transit security     Menendez said    What would we be willing to do  what commitment would we be willing to make  if yesterday  s news had been about trains in New Brunswick  New York  Atlanta  or any other American city  We cannot wait for an attack on American soil  We must make the commitment to real mass transit security now           It is unconscionable that nearly five years after 9 11  this Administration and the Republican leadership still will not act to address the vulnerabilities we face to our homeland security  Millions of New Yorkers use our transit system everyday and we have to ensure that we are doing everything we can to keep them safe  Yesterday s tragic attacks in Mumbai are yet another vivid reminder of the vulnerability we face here at home and if the Administration won t recognize the threat and take action  we will   said Senator Clinton       In light of these significant funding cuts and the lack of overall funding dedicated to beefing up subway and bus security in New York and across the country  the senator  s announced their plans to offer an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill which is on the Senate floor on Monday  The senators   amendment would increase funding for transit security by  300 million on top of  150 million already in the bill and would specifically            Provide an additional  200 million for DHS  s Transit Security grant program on top of  150 million already in the bill  The transit security grant program provides critical funding to subway and bus operators across the country  allowing them to purchase vital security equipment  such as closed circuit television systems and bomb sniffing dogs             Create a  50 million transit security competitive research and development grant program  The new program would give out grants to universities  private companies  and governments to develop chemical  biological  radiological  and explosive detectors for mass transit stations  rail cars  and buses             Provide  50 million to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for staff overtime incurred during periods of high alert  The primary expense incurred by the city during times of heightened alert is overtime for law enforcement and first responders  In light of this recent threat  the NYPD deployed armed police officers at tunnels across the city  In addition  during past periods of high alert  the city has stationed a police officer at every subway station and platform in the city        Senators Schumer  Clinton  and Mikulski also said today that they are going to introduce an amendment with to restore Homeland Security funding to 2005 funding levels    which provided New York and Maryland with adequate funding for its needs  It would bring funding levels for the Urban Areas Security Initiative  UASI   the funding for high threat areas  NYC  s share was cut 40  this year  back to the 2005 levels as well as restore the other homeland security grant programs
