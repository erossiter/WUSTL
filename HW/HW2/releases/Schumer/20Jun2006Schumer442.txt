IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 20  2006 Schumer Reveals Merck Offering Payoffs To Discourage Health Plans From Using Generic Version Of Zocor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If Deals Are Allowed to Prevail  Could Be First Step In Massive Rollback of Consumer Access to Generic Drugs   Senator Calls On FTC to Immediately Investigate Anti Competitive Arrangements that Could Devastate the Market for All Generic Drugs    Also Asks Health Plans Not To Accept Deal Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer blasted the pharmaceutical company Merck  the manufacturer of the cholesterol drug Zocor  for offering payoffs to major health insurers to prevent consumers from buying the new generic version of Zocor  Schumer called on Merck to immediately withdraw these offers and asked the Federal Trade Commission to begin an investigation into possibly anti competitive behavior  Schumer  s office has learned that Merck is offering hefty rebates to some of the nation  s largest health insurance companies if they raise the cost to the consumer of the generic alternative in an effort to maintain the brand  s market share          Specifically  Merck is offering rebates to health insurance plans that charge their lowest co pay for the brand drug and their highest co pay for the generic drug  It is unclear to what extent any of these rebates will be disclosed or passed along to purchasers and consumers  The result will be employers  pharmacies  and ultimately consumers paying more for prescription drugs  Even if consumers themselves don  t pay more for Zocor at the point of sale  the cost to the health care system as a whole from using the brand instead of the generic will be higher  and those costs eventually will come out of consumers   pocket  Schumer announced that at least one company  United Health Group  has accepted Merck  s offer           This could close the door on future generics     Schumer said    It  s a desperate move to keep prices high and generics out of the market  The big pharmaceutical companies are trying to deny tens of millions of families and seniors the cheaper generic drugs that they rely on so desperately  Too many seniors have to choose between paying the bills and taking their medication  and if these deals are allowed to go through  it will make it even harder for those most in need            Generic drugs typically offer consumers a cheaper alternative than the brand name drug and are usually the best option for patients and seniors faced with the rising cost of prescription drugs  Schumer  the author of The Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act which became law in 2003  called these deals blatantly anti competitive  potentially denying tens of millions of patients   access to cheaper generic drugs         In order to protect its market share of Zocor  whose patent expires this month  and disincentivize the use of a generic alternative  Merck is colluding with insurance companies to raise the price of the cheaper generic  simvastatin  which is set to hit shelves at the end of this week  Merck is offering to provide rebates to insurance companies in exchange for inverting co pays to favor the dispensing of the brand over the generic  The deals would most likely last for only 180 days and would be intentionally designed to interfere with the 180 day exclusivity period that the first generic drug on the market relies on to recoup the costs of ensuring timely patent challenges and market entry  Once the 180 day period is over  it is likely that the arrangement will change  By then  however  the harm to the generic from losing its 180 day exclusivity period would already be done   If schemes like this are allowed  fewer patent challenges will occur and few generic drugs will come to market over time  leaving consumers no choice but to buy higher priced brand drugs         Zocor is Merck  s cholesterol cutting drug whose sales totaled  4 4 billion in 2005  Zocor has been proven to reduce coronary heart disease events  such as heart attack and angina  and deaths due to heart attack  The Food and Drug Administration approved the generic alternative and therapeutic equivalent to Zocor earlier this year         In his  to the FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras  Schumer said   The availability of generic drugs have made life saving pharmaceuticals more affordable and accessible to all Americans  and manipulation of the consumer price of these drugs to preserve the market share of the more expensive product is unconscionable  Time is of the essence given the imminence of the generic drug s entrance into the market  and I urge you to begin an investigation of these anti competitive behaviors expeditiously     Schumer also said that if Merck continues this effort to reduce the public  s access to cheaper generic drugs  he will introduce legislation to prohibit these anti competitive deals         This is yet another onslaught in the recent attacks against consumer access to affordable medications  Last month  Schumer revealed the recent dramatic rise in settlements in which brand name pharmaceutical companies pay off generic drug companies to keep cheaper generics off the market  Schumer and Representative Henry A  Waxman wrote to the heads of the two major pharmaceutical trade organizations asking them to take a strong  public stance against these deals that decrease competition and result in a drastic increase in the price of prescription drug prices  according to experts         In 1999  the Federal Trade Commission successfully challenged these types of patent settlements  which deprive consumers of cost savings from generic competition while allowing branded and generic companies to share in the monopoly profits  Until recently  most drug companies have followed the precedent set by the FTC and abandoned settlements that included these types of payoffs          However  two recent appellate decisions  Schering Plough Corp  v  FTC  and In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig   paved the way for the increase by holding that these settlement agreements do not violate antitrust laws  Since the decision  there has been a resurgence in these types of arrangements  According to the FTC in the six months following the March 2005 court decisions  more than two thirds of brand name generic settlement agreements included such terms         Merck  s conduct here is similar in many respects to the practice recently adopted by many brand name drug companies of launching so called   authorized generic    versions of their own product at the same time that a true generic launches  Authorized generics significantly decrease the profit earned by generic manufacturers during the statutory 180 day exclusivity period  These profits are a key incentive for generic manufacturers to pursue entry prior to patent expiration  and taking them away will cause harm to consumers  This spring  the FTC announced that it would conduct a major study of the anticompetitive effects of authorized generics  Merck  s conduct here is even more pernicious         Schumer is also the author of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act with Senator John McCain  R AZ   The Schumer McCain law  which was enacted in 2003  shut down loopholes that drug companies created in Hatch Waxman law  enabling generic drugs to be brought to market sooner  and lowering the cost of prescriptions for millions of Americans       For a copy of
