Authorization Bill  Schumer  Clinton Deliver Total of over  230 million for New York In Bill Just Passed By Senate House Conference Committee  Expected to Pass Full House and Senate This Week U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill  entitled the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  and Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU   was approved by the Conference Committee on which Senator Clinton served  includes  27 1 million for Central New York projects  Schumer and Clinton secured over  230 million in special projects for New York  Schumer and Clinton announced a substantial increase of approximately  3 billion in additional funding coming to New York State for highways and transit for a total of over  16 5 billion in total federal spending for New York  Specifically  the legislation includes  10 07 billion in highway funds and  6 5 billion for New York State  s transit systems  a 19 percent increase in annual average highway spending and a 30 percent increase in public transit funding compared to the previous six year transportation authorization bill  The bill also contains funding for research  safety  environment  transportation planning and security that will benefit all New Yorkers       Senator Clinton served as a member of the Conference between the House and Senate due to her role as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Schumer is a member of the Banking and Finance Committees  which control the transit funding and tax portions of the bill  Both Senators fought hard to ensure that provisions important to New York were retained in the Conference Report         This is great news for Syracuse and all of Central New York  These transportation funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state  These federal dollars will be a huge shot in the arm for local transit needs    new buses  repairs for buses  and fixing up our stations    and highway repairs and upgrades  Without first rate highway and transit facilities  New York would literally stop short     Schumer said    The money for Syracuse University will provide improved transportation to the new hot spots for the local arts  which will benefit the entire region  and strengthening the essential relationship between the university and the city  This federal funding will present enormous opportunities for Syracuse and Central New York            After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to Central New York  These funds will go a long way towards helping communities make the infrastructure improvements needed to keep their economies moving     said Senator Clinton  who served as a Senate conferee in negotiations on the bill    I am proud that our efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the ever increasing transportation demands on our state  We have made a substantial contribution to the future of the Central New York by investing in these critical road and transit projects  I am especially pleased that we were able to secure funding for Syracuse University  s bus route to connect the University Hill campus with the downtown area  for the upgrades to Route 12  for a local company    PAR Technologies   which is working to develop important cargo tracking systems and for improvements to York Street in Auburn  The federal funding will make a substantial contribution to Syracuse and the entire Central New York region  and the dividends will pay off for years  Finally  I am thrilled that we were able to secure language that will officially designate Interstate Highway 86 in the Southern Tier  as the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway  It is a most fitting tribute to his work  that this highway bear his name          The funding approved in the bill today includes        5 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for DestiNY USA Design  Research  Construction and Improvements  This project will serve as a major transformation of the Central New York area generating significant enhancements to Onondaga County  I 81 serves as an important corridor in the region with its access to Canada as well as to Pennsylvania  Maryland  Virginia  West Virginia  Kentucky  and Tennessee  This project will eliminate interchange traffic between I 81 and I 690  This project will also enhance Intermodal transportation in the region and serve as an economic development generator        7 6 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for Syracuse University to establish and develop a 2 2 mile bus route connecting the University Hill campus with the recently acquired downtown classroom space for programs in its School of Architecture  College of Visual and Performing Arts and Newhouse School of Communications and for the construction of an intermodal facility in downtown Syracuse at the Center of Excellence in Environmental Systems Mitigation Enhancement Project  This is in addition to the  1 5 million provided for in the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations Bill for a total of approximately  8 3 million for Syracuse University downtown development and the connective corridor  The bus route will operate twenty four hours a day  seven days a week  and will bring riders to arts and cultural locations including Syracuse Stage  the Everson Museum  the Museum of Science and Technology  the Civic Center  and the Landmark Theater  Over 500 student riders  over 65 faculty members  and numerous community riders will utilize this bus route each day  with an estimated 225 000 riders per year  This functional and symbolic Connective Corridor will signal SU s commitment to the regeneration and growth of downtown and will provide a functional system of bus transportation for students and the community       Syracuse University is engaged in a historic refocus and revitalization of its commitment to Central New York and downtown Syracuse  As part of this realignment of resources  SU recently announced the acquisition and or lease of eleven off campus buildings in downtown Syracuse including the former Dunk and Bright warehouse building  As envisioned  the warehouse will become the cornerstone in an illuminated pedestrian walkway and bike pathway facilitating the cross movement of students and the community between downtown Syracuse and the SU campus  Plans for these new spaces include a public gallery for local artists  an auditorium  centralized box office and various educational programs  Better public transportation to these sites will increase opportunities for SU students and community residents to experience the energy of the local arts community        9 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured in additional funding for the Route 12 Corridor Improvement Project  in addition to funding provided by the House for a total approximately  9 8 million  Route 12  which runs from the juncture of Route 17 and Interstate 81 in Broome County to Interstate 90 in Oneida County  is a two lane highway with limited passing opportunities and thus a history of significant traffic problems  Specifically  this funding would be used to continue construction on short term projects such as spot safety improvements and additional passing zones       CargoWatch Technology    the Senators secured  3 5 million for PAR Technology  s CargoWatch Transportation Management Program  This funding is in addition to funds added in the House  These funds will be used to identify  track  and manage cargo within containers along with associated over the road assets from point origin until destination  Tracking container shipping supply chains will provide essential national security and efficient transportation management  The tracking system is being developed by PAR Technologies  based in New Hartford  NY        2 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for construction and improvements to York Street in Auburn       Senators Schumer and Clinton today also announced the approval of several of their own provisions  including       Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured language in this bill renaming all of I 86 after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  a fitting tribute to a man who once chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee and who fought hard in previous transportation reauthorization bills for the needs of New York  Senator Clinton introduced an amendment last year that was accepted by the Senate during consideration of the surface transportation reauthorization bill  The provision was retained in this year  s bill and will now become law       Amo Houghton Bypass    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured approval to rename a portion of Route 86 near Corning  NY  after former Congressman Amo Houghton who was primarily responsible for securing the funding that made construction of this bypass possible  Senator Clinton offered an amendment  and it was accepted  during the Environment and Public Works Committee  s markup of the surface transportation reauthorization bill  This provision was also included in the House bill sponsored by Rep  Randy Kuhl        9 25 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for the University of Buffalo  s Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER   Clinton and Schumer secured approval for  1 25 million per year  over the next five years  in funding for research on the impact of seismic activity on the federal highway system and the nation  s transportation network as well as ways to reduce our vulnerability from earthquakes  In addition  the Senators provided an additional  3 million to support ongoing research activities  The funding will also help improve earthquake simulation facilities  This is an important economic generator in Western New York and will keep the University of Buffalo at the forefront of this important research  Senator Clinton promised to fight hard to include the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  in this version of the bill  MCEER is a national center of excellence in advanced technology applications dedicated to the reduction of earthquake losses nationwide  MCEER is headquartered at the State University of New York at Buffalo  The Center was originally established by the National Science Foundation  NSF  in 1986 and has been included in every reauthorization bill since its creation  Senator Clinton sponsored an Amendment       High Priority Corridor Amendment   Clinton and Schumer worked to secure approval for Route 219 in Western New York  I 86 I 99  I 87 from the Quebec border to New York City  the East West Corridor from Watertown to Vermont  and I 95 from New York to Connecticut to be designated as high priority corridors  making them eligible for specific high priority corridor funding  These roads are important routes within the State of New York and this amendment makes single and two corridors eligible for federal funding to assure long term stability  Senator Clinton proposed this amendment during the Environment and Public Works Committee  s markup  Both roads were originally designated as High Priority Corridors in 1991  but language in this bill originally removed two state or single state corridors  The Clinton amendment makes all single state and two state corridors eligible because they can be just as vital as multi state corridors        National System Study Commission   The Conference Report contains a provision creating the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that Senator Clinton authored as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  This Commission will determine the future transportation needs of New York and the nation  This Commission will combine the National Transportation System Study and the Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission  Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward  The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing provides a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future  A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York  It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network       The Conference Report is now scheduled to be considered by both the Senate and the House sometime later this week  After passing each House  the approved Report will then go to the President  s desk to be signed  The bill originally passed the House on March 10 and the Senate on May 17  The new project funding is in addition to any money already approved by the House
