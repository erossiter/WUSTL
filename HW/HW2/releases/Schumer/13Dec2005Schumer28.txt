IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 13  2005 With Christmas Around The Corner HUD Is Scrooge  Will Force Up To 335 Poor Families Out Of Their Harlem And Bed STUY Homes And Into The Cold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Despite Years of Cooperation  NYC Intervention  HUD Refuses To Renew Section 8 Contracts Leaving Affordable Housing Developers Unable To Afford Loans and Residents Out In The Cold   Schumer  Rangel  Abyssinian Development Corporation  and Urban Homesteading Assistance Board Call on HUD To Live Up To Its Commitments To Help Repair Neglected Buildings   Schumer Just Passed Law To Remedy Problem Senator Chuck Schumer  Representative Charlie Rangel  Reverend Calvin Butts of the Abyssinian Development Corporation  ADC   and Andrew Reicher of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board  UHAB  will call on HUD to renew project based Section 8 contracts for two developments in New York that have been recently transferred from slum lords to responsible managers for renovation  HUD waited until the November 30th deadline to announce that it would not extend the Section 8 contract for Ennis Francis  HUD refused to renew Gates Patchen  s contract on August 30th just six weeks after transferring the property to UHAB  This doomed years of work by ADC and UHAB  and destroyed the non profits   ability to renovate the neglected properties  ADC and UHAB cannot afford to maintain the buildings  let alone renovate them to code if HUD does not grant this administrative renewal  Up to 335 families could lose their homes  despite the fact that HUD has been working for years with Senator Schumer and the developers to take control of the properties and put them back on track          With Christmas around the corner  HUD is Scrooge  Further inaction could force hundreds of families out of their homes during the cold winter  This would be terrible any time of year  but is doubly painful that this is the gift HUD is giving these families for Christmas     Schumer said    To add insult to injury  this decision by HUD is punishing success stories  In both cases tenant organizations took control of their own destiny and worked with HUD to find responsible developers to manage the property with dignity and give their families the chance for a better life          Ennis Francis and Gates Patchen are the two projects in New York City that inspired Schumer  s amendment to the FY 2006 HUD appropriations bill that mandates HUD renew all Section 8 contracts on all buildings post foreclosure  which could save hundreds of thousands of affordable units nation wide  They are also the ONLY two projects in NY at risk under this policy since the Schumer amendment covers all similar situations in the future  The Schumer Amendment grants responsible developers an income source to continue operations and allow for renovations  without leaving the very residents HUD is supposed to protect out in the cold  HUD claims that the tenants will be eligible for Section 8 vouchers  but because of years of neglect and mismanagement  it is likely the buildings wouldn  t pass NYCHA standards for Section 8 vouchers  so the residents may not be able to continue to live there  Even if the residents were all provided with vouchers promptly  there aren  t that many available Section 8 properties in New York City to quickly accommodate over 300 families  Schumer  s amendment passed as part of the FY 2006 HUD Appropriations bill on October 20  2005  and was supported by HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Kit Bond  R MO   Many New York based housing rights organizations worked to make sure Schumer  s amendment had significant support such as New York States Tenants and Neighbors  Harlem Operation Take Back  Legal Aid Society and South Brooklyn Legal Services        Both ADC and UHAB had made clear to HUD that they could not continue to manage their properties without an extension of the project based Section 8  informed HUD they would lose up to 70  of their revenue that enables them to pay their elevator operator  security  and heating costs going in the cold winter  Nevertheless  HUD decided at the last possible day  November 30th  that it would not extend the Section 8 grant for Ennis Francis  In the past 24 months  HUD has started foreclose proceedings on 2156 units in 14 buildings in New York City  Advocates estimate that there are an additional 79 buildings in New York City at risk of foreclosure due to failing physical conditions  which have a total of 16 767 units  Over 120 000 units of affordable housing nationwide have have lost their Project Based Section 8 subsidy due to foreclosure over the past decade  In New York State alone 4 000 units have been lost in 49 buildings due to foreclosures over the past decade        Schumer said    There could be a light at the end of the tunnel for these families  and HUD is turning it off  The government shouldn  t be the Grinch  After years of painstaking progress  to turn around and slam the door shut on the very properties that inspired my amendment puts the tenants out in the cold    that is just callous when we should be acting in the Christmas spirit         Ennis Francis   Abyssinian Development Corporation worked with HUD and New York City to take possession of the Ennis Francis houses  which has 231 units  for nearly two years  Despite years of Section 8 project grants which mandate that the owner maintain the property to certain standards  and HUD  s yearly inspection of the property  Ennis Francis received a REAC score of under 15  out of 100   the minimum NYCHA standards for failing is a 60  ADC reports there was open sewage in the hallways and drug rings operating openly  A resident spearheaded a tenants organization that worked with HUD and NYCHA to bring a civil 7A proceeding against the previous owners and eventually transfer the rights to the property to ADC  On November 1  2004 Abyssinian Development Corporation was appointed the 7A Administrator for Ennis Francis Houses  making it the first time ever in history that a HUD building had an appointed 7A administrator      Gates Patchen   Gates Patchen  s Section 8 Contract expired on August 31  2005    6 weeks after the transfer to UHAB  HUD has refused to renew the subsidy leaving the building operating at a 40  deficit since that time  Due to this income loss  the building is having substantial trouble covering operating costs  UHAB is falling behind on payments to its vendors including their Elevator Service Provider and their security company  UHAB is particularly worried about the upcoming heating season and its ability to keep the building heated this winter  If the building is converted to vouchers now  it is expected that the majority of tenants will be forced to move out due to housing quality standards rules  units will be fully compliant with HQS following the rehabilitation   The residents of Gates Patchen are working towards becoming a co op  Converting to Vouchers now will jeopardize this plan and put both the project and the eventual cooperative at risk       Estimated Number Of NYC Buildings At Risk of

from several sources  but should not be considered a complete list of troubled HUD properties in NYC    This information is the most accurate and up to date that we have been able to access  However  the status of all buildings is subject to change and should be verified by HUD
