IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 3  2006 Schumer  Nassau D A  Rice Unveil New Plan To Fight Gang Violence    New Proposal Protects Courageous Witnesses From Intimidation  Provides Breakthrough In Prosecuting Gangs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      New  90 Million Federal Program Would Help Localities That Can t Afford to Protect Witnesses    Witness Protection Has Had Success in Breaking Gang Violence Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a new  90 million a year plan that would  for the first time make the Federal government responsible for assisting local governments in paying for witness protection in major violent crime court cases in high crime areas  The Justice Department s current Federal Witness Protection Program is designed to provide long term protection for witnesses in cases that are being tried in Federal courts  Schumer  s legislation creates a new grants program through the federal government with the sole purpose of protecting witnesses in state and local criminal trials  Schumer announced his bill alongside Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice        Witnesses who are willing to stand up in court and testify about a violent crime in their community are some of the most courageous people there are   Schumer said   They are literally willing to put their lives on the line for the sake of justice  The least we can do is protect them from the criminals who want to harm them         For a long time local authorities have had a near impossible time protecting witnesses and  therefore  securing convictions in gang related cases  Thanks to the efforts of Senator Schumer  this bill gives us a necessary tool to fight gangs here in Nassau County  I applaud his leadership on this issue and look forward to finding more solutions at the federal and local levels to combat gang crime   said Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice       Gang crimes have been on the rise on Long Island  In Nassau alone statistics show gang membership could be up to 3 000 people    there were only a handful a decade ago  Similarly in Suffolk  which estimated only 200 gang members in 1997  estimates about 1500 now  The rise in numbers is evident through the rise in crimes        Schumer said that local prosecutors are faced with a double edged sword in protecting witnesses  they have far too few resources to pay to protect as many witnesses as they would like  but every dollar they add to witness protection programs comes at the cost of money for prosecutors and criminal prosecutions  Most District Attorneys report that putting any additional resources into the program without federal help will impede prosecutors  ability to try cases and will increase backlogs in the judicial system       Schumer  s Short Term Witness Protection Act of 2006 will create a new federal grants program to pay for protecting witnesses in state and local criminal trials  Funds from the Schumer grants program will be distributed to local and state prosecutors on a competitive basis and will go to areas that have the greatest need as measured by crime rates  Schumer said that most of the funds will be distributed to states like New York that have 100 or more murders a year       Last year Nassau County spent  14 453 last year on protecting two witnesses  If the Schumer bill passes and Nassau County got funding proportionate to its population  it would get  470 943  This represents a 3363  increase over current spending       Schumer said that threats against witnesses occur on Long Island often resulting in either dismissals or significantly reduced plea deals because witnesses were too afraid to come forward  The prosecution of at least three crimes in 2005 was seriously impeded because of witness intimidation        First  two Latin King gang members were arrested for stabbing a rival SWP member and were charged with Gang Assault  The complainant refused to cooperate with the police and the DA  s office  The two witnesses refused to speak to the ADA on the phone  refused to come to Court and did not appear when subpoenaed for the Grand Jury  One witness did call back but refused to appear for the Grand Jury out of fear of retaliation  After several months of investigation and trying to get the cooperation of these three witnesses to no avail  the People were forced to offer a disorderly conduct violation to each defendant       In another case  seven Blood gang members were arrested for assaulting rival MS 13 members  The main victim was stabbed  punched and kicked in the head  All defendants were arrested for Gang Assault  Although the complainant was initially cooperative with police  he did not appear when subpoenaed for the Grand Jury on three separate occasions  Neither he nor the witnesses would return phone calls left by the ADA and did not respond to numerous letters sent by the ADA  On the third scheduled Grand Jury date  the case was dismissed for lack of evidence and witnesses       Finally  a Latin King gang member was arrested for Attempted Murder  Gang Assault  Assault First Degree and Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Third Degree  there were several victims and a number of witnesses  Although one of the witnesses was severely injured  he and his friends and family members would not agree to testify  They were cooperative with the police and the DA  s office to the extent that they were forthcoming about the events  They were all in fear for their safety as they were aware that the defendant was a high ranking member of the Latin Kings  Although the complainant said that he might testify at the Grand Jury  since it was a sealed proceeding  he would not agree to testify at hearings or trials if necessary  All of the other eyewitnesses refused to testify at all out of fear  They requested we take a plea on the case and the defendant plead guilty to Criminal Possession of a Weapon and was sentenced to a two years upstate
