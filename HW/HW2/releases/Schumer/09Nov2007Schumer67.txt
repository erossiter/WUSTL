Appropriations bill conference report  which includes  25 4 million in defense funding for the Capital Region    The bill  having been approved by both chambers of Congress  will now be sent to the President for his signature   This is terrific news for the Capital Region and Watervliet Arsenal  which will continue to serve as a vital hub of economic activity  said Senator Schumer  All of these cutting edge programs direct research and produce innovation that is absolutely vital in this day and age  and I will urge the president to sign this bill immediately   This funding is an important investment in the Capital Region  Not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said  I look forward to the President signing this bill into law   The  25 4 million for the Capital Region in the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes   Watervliet Arsenal  Arsenal Support Program Initiative  ASPI     9 6 million   The purpose of the Arsenal Support Program Initiative  ASPI  is to help maintain the viability of Army manufacturing arsenals and the unique capabilities of these arsenals in supporting national security interests  These funds will be used to help Watervliet Arsenal to secure new companies on site  bringing significant investment to the Capital Region and reducing the Army s cost of ownership   Watervliet Arsenal BAE Systems  M777A1 A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer    4 million  The M777A1 Howitzer is a joint program with Army and Marine Corps to replace old M198 howitzers with a more reliable system with a 40  weight savings  It is in full rate production under a multi year procurement approved by the Congress in FY2005 defense appropriations  The M777A1 replaces the current M198 howitzer  which has been in service for over 25 years and is increasingly unsupportable  The M777A1 was competitively procured and will provide enhanced mobility and lethality   Watervliet Arsenal Arsenal Business  Technology Partnership  NanoSensor StagGate Accelerator    1 6 million  The NanoSensor StageGate Accelerator  NSSA  supports the development and commercialization of nanotechnology enabled products in support of the Armys transformation into a lighter  more agile warfighting force  Funding would create a distributed  highly integrated industry university government collaboration centered around the Arsenal Business  Technology Partnership  ABTP   the U S  Army Benet Laboratories  Benet   and the College  of Nanoscale Science and Engineering  CNSE  of the University at Albany SUNY  UAlbany   The mission of the NSSA is to support a nanotechnology driven development and deployment strategy to accelerate research  pilot prototyping  scale up production  and commercialization of nanomaterial and nanosystem innovations  including nanosensors  system on a chip  SOC   and system in a package  SIP  technologies for harsh environment applications  particularly in defense sectors but also in aerospace  energy and transportation   Benet Labs  Smart Machine Platform Initiative    3 million  Funding will help to develop a test bed for Smart Machine applications  This test bed will serve as the validation point for the material variation work performed on new materials for cannon tubes  Under the Smart Machine Platform Initiative program the development and integration of technologies that allow for the production of the first part correct will be implemented in a smart machine tool  In order to accomplish this goal the next generation of machinery must not only execute instructions  they must also possess complex internal sensing and control systems to create instructions and integrate them  in real time  into manufacturing processes    Starfire Systems  Functionally Integrated Reactive Surface Technologies  FIRST  Program    2 4 million  The FIRST program will provide intelligent clothing designed for soldiers and first responders to sense a chemical biological attack  monitor physiological conditions  and automatically change the permeability of the clothing to optimize the safety of the individual  The FIRST program specifically involves designing and building autonomous  intelligent clothing patches for an inner garment whose permeability to chemical and biological agents can be quickly altered in response to changes in the external or internal human environment such as body core temperature  An onboard microcontroller communicates with the sensors  performs a threat risk analysis  chemical and biological weapons vs  heat stroke threats  and alters clothing permeability to maximize the safety and comfort of the individual  The plug and play generic patch design for the inner garment can be used to design specialty clothing for a variety of applications and integrates with outer garment elements suitable for fire and ballistic protection   SUNY Cobleskill  Biowaste to Bioenergy  Phase Two    1 6 million  The Biowaste to Bioenergy project is focused on reducing the militarys need to transport fuel and waste during combat operations by converting biowaste to liquid fuel or electricity  Funds will be used to continue development of the SUNY Cobleskill  Bioenergy Research  Center and its development of clean liquid and gas fuels through conversion of animal and municipal solid waste  with development of mobile technology for military application in the field  Specifically  funding will be used for manufacture and installation of a 1 MW gasifier  an internal combustion engine for conversion test operation of the center for one full year and analysis of data received for application in the next phase of the project   C 9 Corporation  Defect Free Commercially Viable Si C Semiconductor Using Superlattice Technology    3 2 million  This project seeks to develop ongoing DOD semiconductor solar research and development projects  Funding for this effort will help lead to the manufacture of semiconductor and solar devices for the DOD
