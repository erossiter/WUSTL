Bill Reauthorization Revving Up  Schumer s Proposal Will Serve to Ensure Issues Facing NY Farmers are Heard Loud and Clear   Senator Releases New Report Detailing County By County Upstate Agricultural Production Surge  C As negotiations over the 2007 Farm Bill begin to rev up in Congress  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer will outline his agenda to ensure that the needs of upstate New York farmers are addressed during the negotiations  debate  and in the final legislation   Schumer last night met with more than a dozen agricultural leaders from across the state during a New York farm summit in his Washington D C  office  According the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets  cash receipts for upstate New York farmers increased by nearly  470 million from 1999 to 2005        We need to start the march to protect our farmers and ensure they receive the support from this bill that they need and deserve  Agriculture and farming is the lifeblood of the upstate economy and we need to everything we can to ensure it stays that way   Schumer said   From grapes  to corn  to vegetables  to milk  upstate New York diverse and growing agricultural base is a force on the global market and this new farm bill needs to reflect that   Upstate New York farmers and farmers across the Northeast have unique needs that differ  sometimes significantly  from their Midwestern and West Coast counterparts   I am going to fight to ensure that the needs and concerns don t get plowed over in the 2007 farm bill        Congress is set to reauthorize the provisions passed in the 2002 Farm Bill  which is massive legislation that supports the farming economy across the country   Schumer today said that negotiations over the provisions in the bill have already begun to rev up with the Senate Agriculture Committee s goal of having a bill written possibly by the end of June 2007   The provisions in the current farm bill expire on September 30  2007       Schumer today said that  unfortunately in year s past  the needs of farmers and the agricultural community in the Northeast have been left behind in favor of major agriculture conglomerates in the Midwest and on the West Coast   Today  Schumer released a new  showing significant growth in agricultural production in upstate New York and its growing share of the overall upstate economy        Agricultural production returned over  3 6 billion to the farm economy in 2005  About 25 percent of the state s land area  or 7 55 million acres  are used by the 35 600 farms to produce a very diverse array of food products  Milk is New York s leading agricultural product and is produced all across the state  Milk sales account for one half of total agricultural receipts  Production in 2005 was 11 7 billion pounds with a preliminary value of  1 91 billion  placing New York as the nations 3rd leading producer       Schumer s report found that cash receipts for farms in upstate New York are up nearly  470 million from 1999 to 2005   Below is how the numbers break out across upstate from   In the Capital Region  cash receipts are up  32 813 000 from  265 830 000 to  298 643 000   There are 3 980 farms in the region   In Central New York  cash receipts are up  32 163 000 from  312 795 000 to  344 958 000  There are 3 620 farms in the region   In the Rochester   Finger Lakes region  cash receipts are up  104 874 000 from  603 778 000 to  708 652 000   There are 5 990 farms in the region    In the Hudson Valley  cash receipts are up  7 666 000 from  280 945 000 to  288 611 000   There are 3 190 farms in the region    In the North Country  cash receipts are up  97 186 000 from  445 259 000 to  542 445 000   There are 5 125 farms in the region    In the Southern Tier  cash receipts are up  60 388 000 from  358 684 000 to  419 072 000   There are 6 465 farms in the region    In Western New York  cash receipts are up  134  345 000 from  657 511 000 to  791 856 000   There are 6 535 farms in the region       Schumer today announced his new comprehensive plan to highlight the needs and issues facing upstate New York farmers and the entire agricultural community in the Northeast   The proposals outlined below will be included in forthcoming legislation and will serve as marker during the negotiations over the farm bill   Schumer said he has been in contact with other Northeastern Senators  offices  including Senator Arlen Spector  R PA  about his legislation   Schumer s proposal includes the following provisions            Crop Insurance   Schumer s proposal would expand the crop insurance programs to ensure that specialty crop growers are covered and receive a fair share of payments  Although the list of covered commodities has grown in recent years  80  of total policy premiums and federal subsidies are accounted for by just four commodities    corn  soybeans  wheat and cotton   Nearly 56  of payouts to farmers in four states    Texas  North Dakota  South Dakota  Oklahoma   Schumer s proposal would double the Agricultural Management Assistance program  reauthorize and improve the Adjusted Gross Revenue Insurance Pilot Program  and expand crop insurance incentives to include beginning farmers  as an incentive to enter agriculture             Conservation   Schumer would increase funding for working lands conservation programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  and the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program  FRPP    Specifically  Schumer would raise funding for EQIP to  2 billion every year  up from  1 3 bill annually and increase funding for FRPP to  300 million   These programs are extremely important to farmers in New York where there is a huge backlog of unfunded applications   Schumer s proposal also includes fully funding the Conservation Security Program  which removes producing cropland into conserving uses for about 10 years              Nutrition   Schumer s proposal would dramatically expand nutrition education and Farm to School programs   This would include farm to cafeteria programs  farmers  market promotion programs  and school fruit and vegetable snack programs   Schumer s proposal would increase funding for the School Fruit and Vegetable Program to  300 million every year and expand the program to a minimum of 100 schools in each state   In addition  Schumer legislation would increase funding for the Farm to Cafeteria Program and the Farmers  Market Production Program            Energy   In addition to Schumer s previous legislation to boost corn based ethanol production in upstate New York  Schumer s proposal would provide direct incentives to speed up development of Cellulosic ethanol   Specifically  Schumer s proposal would reauthorize Section 9008 of the 2002 Farm Bill  which funds research and development on production of bio based fuels  including feedstock production  harvesting  transport  and storage            Promote the Farm Economy for the Future   During Schumer s farm summit  members of the upstate New York agricultural community raised serious concerns about the fact that young people are not going in to farming or agriculture science   Schumer s plan would create the Farm and Ranch Profitability Grant program   This new program would provide grants to improve the profitability of farms and support state  local  and farm level programs to promote market development and advertising  business planning  ownership modeling  and product development   Overall  this program would promote the farm economy and demonstrate how vital it is to our way of life            Dairy Safety Net   Schumer s proposal includes a permanent extension and expansion of the existing MILC program   Specifically  this plan includes language that would double the annual production cap to 4 8 million pounds  which could mean millions more in relief for New York s dairy farms  It is estimated that raising the cap from 2 4 million pounds to 4 8 million pounds would increase eligible participation by New York dairy farmers in the MILC program from 72  of production to 84  of production   Schumer also said he is pushing provisions of the National Dairy Equity Act to be included in the legislation       In addition to this proposal  Schumer today also announced that he is an original cosponsor of the AgJOBS Act of 2007  S 340   authored by Senator Dianne Feinstein  D CA    The bipartisan legislation would create a  blue card  for certain types of immigrant farm workers   The bill represents a labor management compromise on farm worker immigration policy by creating a two step  legalization  or  earned adjustment  program under which undocumented farm workers who have been performing work in agriculture in the United States may gain temporary resident immigration status and then earn permanent resident immigration status upon completing additional employment in U S  agriculture during the next three to five years   The bill also contains revisions to the H 2A agricultural guest worker program  which allows agricultural employers to employ foreign workers on temporary nonimmigrant visas based on claims of labor shortages
