IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 28  2006 Schumer  Lowey  Bishop Introduce Bill To Prevent 276 000 More New Yorkers From Losing EPIC Coverage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              360 000 New Yorkers on EPIC  and 574 000 Dual Medicare Medicaid Enrollees Could Lose Benefits  Receive Inferior Drugs  Or Lose Coverage At Local Pharmacy   After New York State Transferred 91 000 EPIC Beneficiaries To Medicare Part D  Schumer  Lowey  and Bishop Introduce Bill To Protect EPIC U S  Senator Chuck Schumer and Representatives Nita Lowey and Tim Bishop introduced legislation that would prevent 276 000 New York additional seniors from losing EPIC coverage  The legislation come in light of Governor Pataki  s 2006 budget proposal  released January 17  that would push one quarter of EPIC enrollees or 91 000 low income New York seniors from the EPIC program into the Medicare program  Since the implementation of Medicare Part D on January 1  2006  New York seniors have faced confusion and gaps in coverage  Across New York  367 000 seniors are enrolled in New York  s popular Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage  EPIC   Schumer previously urged Center for Medicaid and Medicaid Services   Administrator Mark McClellan to offer the same safeguards to EPIC that are currently given to other private plans        Schumer    The Federal government has not been straight with the American people  especially seniors  Seniors who thought they were getting a Cadillac of a prescription drug program are now finding out their insurance plan is a jalopy  We all have a special duty to protect New York  s seniors and turn this lemon of a program into lemonade  Our bill will make sure EPIC is protected          Lowey    The EPIC program has provided reliable  affordable drug coverage to our seniors  It  s a program that works  That  s why it doesn  t make sense to pull the rug out from under seniors by dropping their coverage and forcing them into the flawed Medicare program  We need to protect seniors   access to drug coverage  not undermine it          Bishop    Thousands of seniors who benefit from EPIC have a simple question   If it ain t broke  why are you trying to fix it   Bishop said   This legislation will make sure that New York s seniors at least have the same protections and benefits they enjoy now        Transitioning From EPIC to Medicare   Some of the 367 000 New York seniors enrolled in EPIC will be forced to enroll in Medicare drug plans by July 1st  Governor Pataki  s 2006 budget proposal  released January 17th  would push about 91 000 low income New York seniors from the EPIC program onto the Medicare drug program  EPIC provides prescription coverage for seniors who have too high of an income to qualify for Medicaid  but still need help paying for costly prescription drugs  These 91 000 people are the members of EPIC who are eligible for a federal low income subsidy if they enroll in a Medicare drug plan  which will make their drugs cheaper  but will also give them coverage that is inferior to EPIC       The EPIC program is a simple  cost sharing prescription drug plan that covers almost all medications for enrollees  Most pharmacies in New York accept EPIC  and EPIC seniors pay at most  20 for a medication  The Medicare drug plan  on the other hand  is extremely complex and difficult to navigate  With over 40 drug plan options in New York and each plan covering different drugs  many seniors have found choosing a Medicare drug plan paralyzing  Additionally  the Medicare drug plan drastically differs from EPIC in that not all pharmacies accept the wide variety of Medicare drug plans  and co pays vary from plan to plan        The grave nature of the impending transition of EPIC seniors onto the Medicare drug plans by July 1st is amplified because of the Medicare drug plan  s remaining glitches  Many seniors still aren  t receiving the drugs they need  are trapped in inappropriate plans  or are paying far too much for their medications  Since the implementation of the Medicare drug plan  New York seniors enrolled in Medicare drug plans have faced dangerous gaps in drug coverage  Knowing the abundance of problems with the Medicare drug plan  EPIC seniors shouldn  t be forced from a simple plan that provides secure coverage to a complex plan that still has many glitches        Schumer  Lowey  and Bishop  s legislation  the   Existing Drug Coverage Protection Act     will         Prevent the remaining 276 000 EPIC enrollees from being transitioned onto Medicare in the future  The Medicare program currently pays 28  federal subsidies to employers to ensure that companies will not push their retirees from employer sponsored plans onto Medicare  EPIC should benefit from the same federal subsidies to give the State the incentive it needs to retain current EPIC coverage for New York seniors
