technologies can together be a more effective tool to address many criminal justice needs  The second grant of  496 341 from the Biometrics Technologies Solicitation Program will be used to develop a site adaptive approach to face recognition at a distance  for use in criminal justice and homeland security applications  The final two grants were awarded from the Sensors and Surveillance Technologies Solicitation Program and total  950 172  They will be used to develop an automated standoff detection technology to be used for asphyxiation victims and to develop an affordable video based site surveillance system that will enable unattended remote monitoring of locations such as schools  public parks  prison yard and public venues   This is great news for General Electric  Schenectady County and families across our state and nation  said Schumer  These funds will help develop cutting edge forensic technology that will place our law enforcement and homeland security

otherwise monitor and thus safeguard locations remotely  These technologies include video cameras and closed circuit television systems  audio receivers and recorders  radar traffic enforcement devices  motion detectors  heartbeat detectors  radar flashlights to detect breathing and other vital signs  devices to see through walls and into enclosed spaces to locate and track concealed persons  and night vision and thermal imaging devices that detect infrared radiation or heat
