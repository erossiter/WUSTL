easing the current health care crunch affecting the region  Schumer pledged to call HealthNow in an attempt to mediate a contract dispute between Hudson Headwaters Health Network and the company     HealthNow  which does business in the Adirondacks under the name Blue Shield of Northeastern New York  is the only hold out among the region s four major health insurance companies that has not reached a new contract with Hudson Headwaters  Between four and five thousand Hudson Headwaters patients are covered by BlueShield  A disagreement between the groups has centered around Hudson Headwaters request that insurance companies increase payments to the same level federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs pay     Hudson Headwaters  which treats about 60 000 patients  operates 12 health centers in Warren  Saratoga  Essex and Hamilton counties     During his visit to the Indian Lake Health Care Center  Schumer also pushed his legislation to attract new physicians to underserved rural and urban areas  Schumers bi partisan Physician Shortage Elimination Act of 2007 invests in programs that have been effective in attracting and retaining physicians to serve in our most underserved areas of the country like the North Country     In the North Country and countless other regions across New York State  the shortage threatens doctors of all stripes  from pediatricians  to internists  to general surgeons  In Upstate New York  more than 52 percent of active patient care physicians are age 50 or older  Schumer said that without decisive intervention  these trends will have a serious impact on physicians and hospitals  ability to care for patients and communities in Upstate New York  Schumer said that as the baby boomers age in to retirement  demand for medical services and health care will skyrocket     Schumers bi partisan Physician Shortage Elimination Act of 2007 will specifically do the following      Double funding for the National Health Service Corps  a program that is dedicated to meeting the needs of the underserved  Despite its success  it has been vastly under funded  in fact 80 percent of applicants must be turned away each year      Allow rural and underserved physician residency programs to expand by removing barriers that prevent programs from developing rural training programs      Double certain Title VII funding for programs that target disadvantaged youth in rural and underserved areas and nurture them to create a pipeline to careers in healthcare  and     Bolster the health care cornerstone of underserved areas  the community health center  through grants and by allowing them to expand their residency programs     According to the American Association of Medical Colleges  one third  250 000  of active physicians nationwide are over age 55 and likely to retire by 2020  and the newest generation of physicians is unlikely to be willing to work the long hours that prior generations of physicians reportedly worked  The physician to population ratio will peak by 2020 when Americans will need more  not fewer  medical services and the baby boomers begin to approach 75 years of age  Several studies have suggested a substantial physician shortage  100 000 or more  will develop nationwide in the next 20 years     In Upstate New York  more than 52 percent of active patient care physicians are age 50 or older  according to a recent report by the SUNY Center for Health Workforce Studies  Statistics from the New York State Department of Labor indicate that the projected percentage of annual growth of physicians and surgeons from 2004 2014 statewide is 10 percent  whereas the expected population growth rate is 14 percent annually for Upstate
