IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 14  2005 Schumer  Levy Announce New Push For Federal Funding For New County Wide 311 System

                                    County Exec outlines need for single non emergency number Suffolk County residents can call for help with government services   In November  Schumer secured  500 000 for Town of North Hempstead 311 system   plans same all out effort for Suffolk Senator Charles E  Schumer and Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy today announced a new effort to secure federal funding for a 311 call system that Suffolk County residents can use for non emergencies not covered by the county s 911 emergency call system         Establishing a communication management system in Suffolk County is a win win situation  It frees up 911  ensuring it is only used for emergencies  The 311 system will provide residents with a much needed resource for any non emergency need  concern  or question   Schumer said        Having a 311 system where residents can route their quality of life complaints has been a priority of mine since I was a County Legislator   said Levy    Senator Schumer was on the phone to my office within a day after the State of the County to offer his assistance on obtaining funding  and we certainly appreciate his support and enthusiasm for the project        In his State of the County address three weeks ago  Levy announced that Suffolk County will explore the possibility of implementing a 311 system to avoid waste and delays in 911 response time that can cost lives  He also announced the creation of a five member panel that will report to him by June how this concept can be suitably implemented        Schumer said today that he plans to make funding for Suffolk s 311 system a high priority for 2006  There are 1 4 million residents in Suffolk County  and nearly 50 different departments  divisions  or offices in County Government with over 12 000 employees  Currently  residents rely on the blue pages or the internet to find government listings  which can be a slow  arduous process  It can be nearly impossible to find the agency or service the caller is looking for  For calls to or within County government  there is no standardized routing procedure and phones are only staffed between 8 30am 5pm daily  As a result  911 is on the receiving end for both emergency and non emergency calls        Last November  Schumer secured  500 000 for a  311 Communication Management System  in the 2005 omnibus spending bill for the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County  The funding was included in the Commerce  Justice  State and the Judiciary portion of the bill        North Hempstead is planning to create a 311 non emergency phone number  in part  because the town s Inspector General found that their emergency communication system is clogged and unresponsive because of the large number of non emergency calls that are placed to 911  North Hempstead also found that their government s current handling of non emergency calls is ineffective and non centralized  Schumer  s success in securing funding for North Hempstead prompted a closer look at the need for this system in other areas on Long Island       Across the country  311 systems have been developed to make local governments more accessible to their constituents by letting people request and receive information and government services by calling one simple  toll free number   311  Call takers at a centralized call center  available 24 hours a day  7 days a week  provide information  take service requests and refer callers to government agencies  Service requests made via 311 are transferred to the appropriate government agency for direct and immediate service        New York City 311  which was implemented in 2003  was able to consolidate over 30 call centers and hundreds of government phone numbers   from the Actuary of the City of New York to the Youth and Community Development Department and includes such often dialed numbers as the Department of Health  the Taxi and Limousine Commission  and the Department of Sanitation  into 311  Schumer and Levy said that Suffolk s 311 system will build on the lessons learned from other 311 systems already designed and implemented across the country       In the program s first year  New York City government logged over 8 million calls  or approximately one call for each of the 8 115 135 New York City residents  As of November  the average number of calls per day was about 40 000 calls  with an average length of service per call at about 26 seconds  The record number of 311 calls received per day by New York City is 111 000 calls  in response to the flu vaccine availability and the STAR tax rebate       At a time when every government is looking to do more with less  it is gratifying to see lawmakers like Senator Schumer step forward to support our efforts to speed up 911 response and enhance the flow of information to our 1 4 million residents   Levy concluded         As we can see from the success of New York City  s 311 line  this system works  It can make a world of difference in a city  s communication capabilities   Schumer said    The bottom line is  the 911 emergency response system benefits from this by being less clogged and more able to respond to real emergencies  all residents benefit from a greater service to the public
