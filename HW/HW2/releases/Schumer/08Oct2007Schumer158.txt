IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 8  2007 Schumer Reveals  Thousands of NYC Firefighters Carrying Life Saving Alarms That Can Fail During Fires   Unveils Plan to Beef Up Standards to Protect Firefighters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Devices Should Sound Loud Alarm When a Firefighter Collapses or Stops Moving For Any Reason So They Can Be Immediately Located and Rescued Senator  Piecemeal Federal Standards Allow Defective Alarms to Slip into the Market   At Least One NYC Firefighter Has Already Died Because Their Alarm Failed to Sound During a Fire Schumer Unveils Plan to Overhaul Inspecti Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that malfunctioning life saving devices are threatening the lives of thousands of firefighters across New York  The Personal Alert Safety System  PASS  devices  worn by all firefighters when responding to a fire  are designed to sound an alarm when a firefighter is trapped  allowing nearby firefighters to rescue the at risk firefighter  Currently hundreds of fire companies across New York use these devices every day  However  over the past decade  15 firemen have died nationwide when their PASS devices failed under routine heat and water conditions    In response to this critical local and national concern  Schumer today unveiled a plan to increase the federal governments role in testing all PASS devices before they go on the market and to assess what devices currently in use fail to meet newly issued standards    Its unacceptable that the safety of firefighters across New York is jeopardized by malfunctioning equipment that they rely on as their last line of defense when battling a blaze  said Senator Schumer  Its high time that the federal government step up to the plate and ensure that our firefighters are equipped with the safest and most advanced devices  Simply put  when firefighters put their lives on the line to save others  their gear must function at the highest standards possible  And when it doesnt  it should be pulled from the market  fast  This is why  today  Im proposing a three point plan that will usher in a higher level of accountability and strict federal testing on the PASS devices firefighters wear to protect them in emergency situations    The PASS device is a motion sensor worn by firefighters when responding to a blaze  The devices are designed to repeatedly flash a light and trigger a high pitched noise if a firefighter stops moving for 30 seconds  thereby signaling to fellow firefighters that he may be trapped or injured and in need of rescuing  Nationwide  it is estimated that over a million firefighters use the PASS device and across New York State thousands of fulltime and volunteer fighters regularly rely on them    Despite the life saving importance of the PASS device for firefighters  federal and independent inspectors have found that PASS alarms tend to malfunction when the device becomes too hot or wet  Over the past decade  federal authorities have reported 15 fatalities of firefighters who died while responding to blazes where their PASS failed to function or functioned at too low a level    This year the National Fire Protection Association  NFPA  Technical Committee on Electronic Safety Equipment released a new report documenting the flaws in the current PASS devices worn by firefighters  and issued higher standards for future PASS devices to meet  The report calls for strengthening performance requirements and addresses the alarm signal degradation issue linked to heat  water and vibration   Testing of PASS devices has shown sound reduction may begin to occur at temperatures as low as 300 F  150 C  An earlier National Institute for Operational Safety and Health  NIOSH  report stated that during the investigation of four firefighter fatalities that occurred between 2001 and 2004  the PASS alarm signals were either not heard or were barely audible  apparently due to thermal related degradation    Schumer today noted that despite the new NFPA report recommending higher standards for new PASS devices  it in no way offered a plan to test the ones currently in the field  Schumer stressed that there are still tens of thousands of PASS devices currently being used in the field that pre date the public discovery of the problem  PASS alarms cost approximately  200 by themselves  but are most commonly integrated into firefighters breathing apparatus which cost roughly  3 000 per unit  Because of the high cost of the equipment  fire departments expect to get up to twenty years out of their breathing apparatus  therefore it could be decades before the faulty PASS devices are purged from the field    Schumer today also revealed there is no federal agency responsible for testing or inspecting PASS devices before they go on the market  Firefighters must rely on the private sector to ensure that their lifesaving equipment meets the highest safety standards    In response to this life and death matter  Schumer unveiled a three point plan to beef up the federal governments role in ensuring the PASS devices used by New Yorks firefighters meet the highest standards    1  Schumer called on the United States Fire Administration  USFA  to lead a coordinated effort with NIOSH and the National Institute of Science and Technology  NIST  to inspect all PASS devices before they are sold on the open market    2  Schumer called on the new USFA led coalition to inspect all PASS devices that are already in use by our firefighterseither by themselves or with the help of the private sectorto see which products comply with the new safety standards issued this year    3  Schumer called on PASS manufacturers to quickly produce devices that are complaint with the updated safety standards
