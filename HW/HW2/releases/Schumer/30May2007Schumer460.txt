IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 30  2007 With Watertown   North Country On The Brink Of A Serious Doctor Shortage  Schumer Announces New Legislation To Prevent Health Care Crisis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Standing with Health Care Leaders  Schumer Reveals that 1 in 3 Doctors Are Set to Retire by 2020 with Not Nearly Enough Med Students in the Pipeline to Fill the Void   With Demand for Physician Services Skyrocketing  Schumer Legislation Would Double Funding to Vital Programs to Attract New  Young Doctors to Underserved Areas   Schumer  If We Don t Act Now  Medical Care Could Be Hobbled for Decades Standing with local health care leaders  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer unveiled new legislation to address the severe physician shortage facing the Watertown and North Country areas and countless other regions across New York State   The shortage threatens doctors of all stripes  from pediatricians  to internists  to general surgeons  In Upstate New York  more than 52 percent of active patient care physicians are age 50 or older   Schumer said that without decisive intervention  these trends will have a serious impact on physicians  and hospitals  ability to care for patients and communities in Upstate New York        Our hospitals are the life blood of our community and an economic engine for the entire state   Schumer said   However  if we cannot recruit and retain enough doctors to meet demand  the engine might just give out  Fewer doctors mean longer shifts  longer waits to see doctors and nurses  longer response times to inpatient emergencies  and too few hands on deck during a crisis  If we don t aggressively take steps to recruit  educate  and retain more doctors in physician shortage areas  patients will not be able to expect the level of care they ve come to rely on  That s not something anyone wants to see  and we need to stop the shortage before it gets even worse        Schumer said that as the baby boomers age in to retirement  demand for medical services and health care will skyrocket   Nationwide  the US population is growing rapidly with the largest growth occurring in people over the age of 65  who consume the greatest health care resources   In addition  the expectations and wealth of Americans will motivate and enable them to use more health care services       However  the available supply of doctors to provide those health care services will decrease  According to the American Association of Medical Colleges  one third  250 000  of active physicians nationwide are over age 55 and likely to retire by 2020  and the newest generation of physicians is unlikely to be willing to work the long hours that prior generations of physicians reportedly worked  The physician to population ratio will peak by 2020 when Americans will need more  not fewer  medical services and the baby boomers begin to approach 75 years of age  Several studies have suggested a substantial physician shortage  100 000 or more  will develop nationwide in the next 20 years       In Upstate New York  more than 52 percent of active patient care physicians are age 50 or older  according to a recent report by the SUNY Center for Health Workforce Studies  Statistics from the New York State Department of Labor indicate that the projected percentage of annual growth of physicians and surgeons from 2004 2014 statewide is 10 percent  whereas the expected population growth rate is 14 percent annually for Upstate       Schumer said age is not the only factor that is causing this looming shortage   Health care leaders overwhelmingly agree that urban and rural areas in the Northeast are having significant problems  not only recruiting medical students  but retaining them to practice medicine in the area  Schumer said that there is widespread agreement that the first places where this shortage will be felt are poorer  urban areas and rural communities  Hospitals are feeling the shortage right now   This shortage will be fully underway within just a few years in subspecialty practices such as radiology and dermatology         Shortages would follow next in the categories of general surgery and primary care   which includes pediatricians    and generally agreed upon projections indicate the situation could become a full blown crisis particularly affecting the smaller cities of central and upstate regions       According to a study by the SUNY Center for Health Workforce Studies  nearly 80 percent of hospitals reported vacant hospital based positions for physicians  while 65 percent reported available community based practice opportunities for physicians in their service area  Forty six percent indicated that physician vacancies in their hospitals were primarily attributable to an overall shortage of physicians in the region  while 18 percent cited poor reimbursement for physician services in the regions as the primary cause for the vacancies        To address this looming shortage and prevent a health care crisis  Schumer announced new comprehensive legislation that will help hospitals and underserved localities recruit doctors and provide much needed funding for programs that send doctors to underserved areas       The bi partisan Physician Shortage Elimination Act of 2007 provides additional investments in programs that have been effective in attracting and retaining physicians to serve in our most underserved areas of the country   Specifically the bill will            Double funding for the National Health Service Corps   a program that is dedicated to meeting the needs of the underserved   Despite its success  it has been vastly under funded   in fact 80 percent of applicants must be turned away each year            Allow rural and underserved physician residency programs to expand by removing barriers that prevent programs from developing rural training programs            Double certain Title VII funding for programs that target disadvantaged youth in rural and underserved areas and nurture them to create a  pipeline  to careers in healthcare  and           Bolster the health care cornerstone of underserved areas  the community health center  through grants and by allowing them to expand their residency programs       Schumer was joined by Tom Carman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Samaritan Medical Center  and Dr  Stephen T  Grybowski  a family practice physician who came to the community 25 years ago through the National Health Service Corps
