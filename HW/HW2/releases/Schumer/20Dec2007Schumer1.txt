Time Low                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Completing 62 County Tour for Record Ninth Year in a Row  Schumer in Rensselaer County Reveals Feds Starving NYS of Funding to Upgrade Crumbling Sewer Infrastructure Ancient  Insufficient Sewage Capacity has Hamstrung Nearly  700 Million in New Economic Projects in Rensselaer County  Leaving Local Taxpayers to Get Socked by Soaring Costs to Fix Dilapidated Sewer System To Assist Communities Across the State  Schumer Announces Plan to Boost Federal Funding For Sewage Infrastructure Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer completed a record ninth straight 62 county tour in Rensselaer County  where he blasted the federal government for turning its back on funding New York States crumbling infrastructure that is jeopardizing regional economic growth and public and environmental health  Counties spanning the entire state  including the Capital Region  are suffering from an aging sewer system that is unable to accommodate new economic development projects  In Rensselaer County  nearly   700 million in new projects are hamstrung due to existing local sewer and water systems unable to handle them   Schumer revealed that federal funding for improving sewer systems is at an all time low and unveiled a plan to increase federal funding to help modernize the states deteriorating sewage system    Unfortunately  over the past several decades the federal government has retreated from its responsibilities under the Clean Water Act  leaving communities across New York State with a deteriorating sewer system that can stifle economic growth  damage residential property and is hazardous to the environmental and public health  said Senator Schumer  This summer  the collapse of the bridge in Minnesota was a tragic reminder of what transpires when the federal government turns a blind eye to the needs of older states like New York State  Just like the aging bridges that dot our state  our sewer infrastructure is steadily decaying and its high time the federal government upholds its end of the deal and works with state and local governments to maintain first rate water treatment systems  Local residents shouldnt be stuck footing the bill alone   Communities across New York State are currently faced with dilapidated sewer systems that will require a significant level of funding to upgrade  Cities  towns and suburbs in the state rely on a sewer infrastructure that  in many cases  was originally built in the early 20th century and have since then only undergone modest upgrades  Communities suffer from leaky and overflowing pipes that have the capability to spew untreated sewage into residential homes and local bodies of waters like the Great Lakes  Finger Lakes  rivers and creeks    The deteriorating sewer infrastructure also threatens future economic growth  Communities are now faced with the threat of government agencies placing moratoriums on future development unless they upgrade their sewer system    In Rensselaer County  nearly  700 million in new economic projects are hamstrung by a sewer and water system that lacks the capability to accommodate new buildings and construction  The Town of East Greenbush in Rensselaer County is currently trying to complete at least three large development projects that total approximately  280 million in investment  but authorities are concerned an outdated sewer and water infrastructure will be unable to handle the projects     The Village at Temple Farm is pursuing a commercial  retail and residential project representing approximately  150 million in investment  A second parcel of property on Temple Lane is slated for future development that could approach  100 million  and Regeneron  a pharmaceutical RD firm located in the town  is planning a  30 million renovation  But in order to bring them to fruition the town needs to make major improvements to their aging sewer and water infrastructure    In addition  the neighboring communities of North Greenbush and the City of Rensselaer each have large development projects that total an additional  400 million    Since all three communities share the same water distribution infrastructure  the projects place an enormous strain on the already outdated system East Greenbush is currently considering bonding  12 million to fund the major overhauls  and has already worked successfully with New York State Senator Joseph Bruno  Assemblyman Ron Canestrari and Rensselaer County to ease the burden on local taxpayers Still  local governments will be hard pressed to single handily finance such overhauls    Schumer today warned that the sewer structure problems in Rensselaer County are reflective of a crisis that is afflicting the entire state  where business leaders and companies are eager to expand but new development is hamstrung by outdated sewer and water infrastructure systems   The environmental and public health hazards posed by the aging sewer systems are also serious  Groundwater degradation has resulted as contaminants leak into the soil and waterways from failing treatment plants  pipes and septic tanks  Pathogens and viruses are released into waterways  affecting local wildlife and fisheries and threatening drinking water   Compounding the financial problems associated with upgrading sewer systems in Rensselaer County and across the state have been starved of adequate federal funding to repair its system  The state has seen its funding slashed in recent years A 2002 study by the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  estimates that every year  money available for municipal wastewater infrastructure falls  13 billion short of what states and local governments need in order to maintain working systems and protect the health of citizens and the environment  Federal funding for wastewater infrastructure has decreased 55  since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972  With communities striving to meet new EPA guidelines  the need for federal funding is now greater than ever   The American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that New   York State has  20 42 billion in wastewater infrastructure needs    In light of the drastic decline in federal funding for municipal sewage projects  Schumer today announced his plan for addressing New   Yorks crippled sewage infrastructure     Schumer will sponsor legislation in the      Senate  S 836 The Water Quality Investment Act of 2007  to increase      federal grant funding for municipal sewage infrastructures by providing      funding for upgrades of sewage treatment plans across the state  It has      already passed the House      Schumer announced his support for      H R 720  the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007  which would amend the      Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize appropriations for state      water pollution control revolving funds  This is a  14 billion low interest      loan program for wastewater infrastructure improvements  It was referred      to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in March      Schumer this week sent a letter Jim      Nussle  Director of the Office of Management and Budget  pressuring him to      increase funding for water infrastructure in the Presidents Budget for      Fiscal Year  FY  2009      Schumer in the New Year will also push      the Senate Appropriations Committee to increase funding for sewage      projects  and specifically citing the precipitous drop in federal funding      since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972
