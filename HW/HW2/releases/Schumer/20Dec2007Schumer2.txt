IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 20  2007 Schumer Scores Victory in Bid to Save Middle Class Housing at Castleton Park  Convinces HUD to Take First Steps to Ensure Affordability of Building                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Following Numerous Letters  Calls and Meetings Between Schumer and HUD  HUD Agrees to Apply Section 250 of Housing Law to Castleton Park Under Section 250  All Rent Changes Must Be Approved by HUD Within Affordability Guidelines  Ownerhsip Changes Must be Agreed to by HUD  and Owners Must Commit to Building Improvements Schumer  This Marks a Big Win for Middle Class Hou Following a months long fight to ensure middle class housing affordability continues on Staten Island  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced that he has convinced the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  to apply Section 250 of the National Housing Act to Castleton Park  ensuring the continued affordability of the development  Castleton Park is a 454 unit complex in St  George and one of only two Mitchell Lama developments on Staten  Island  Under Section 250  the current owner must set aside funding for rehabilitation and repairs of the buildings  any rent increases must be approved by HUD within affordability guidelines and all potential buyers of the complex must be approved by HUD  HUD committed to applying the standard following a meeting with Schumer in October    This is a very positive development that will preserve affordability for the families and seniors in Castleton Park  HUD has been a welcome partner in protecting much of the vanishing middle class housing in New York  and I am proud to announce that HUD has agreed to continue that work on Staten Island by applying tenant protections at Castleton Park  Schumer said  I will continue to work with HUD to ensure that Castleton Park remains affordable for the next generation of Staten Islands hard working  middle class families to maintain their way of life   Since it was constructed in 1974  Castleton Park has relied on a variety of government subsidies to ensure the developments affordability and upkeep  including a HUD insured mortgage  Under Section 250 of the National Housing Act  HUD generally can only approve the prepayment of a HUD insured mortgage if the agency determines that the housing is no longer needed as affordable in that community  However  HUD may also allow the prepayment of a mortgage if there is a need for capital rehabilitation at a complex   Since Castleton Park is in need of repair and rehabilitation  HUD may approve a prepayment  but due to the application of Section 250  several tenant protections will also be applied  First  any rent increases must be approved by HUD and fall within affordability guidelines  Second  any potential buyer must be approved by HUD  allowing tenants and HUD the opportunity to examine the record of potential buyers and to determine if they have and will maintain the affordability and livability of the complex  Finally  any owner under Section 250 must either escrow or take out a line of credit for necessary repairs of rehabilitation of units  For Castleton Park  an owner would be required to put  15 000 per unit into repairs  or  6 8 million for the complex    Because of the impressive activism of Castleton Park residents  HUD has laid out a blanket of protections that will preserve affordability and provide much needed peace of mind in this holiday season to all who live there  said Schumer    Under Section 250  any prepayment application will have to be considered for 150 days  giving Schumer and the tenants an opportunity to work with HUD to determine the affordability guidelines for any potential rent increases  While HUD maintains that rent increases could be approved at a monthly rate of 30  of 80  of area median income  Schumer will continue to push that standards be set at 30  of 60  of area median income   Schumer will also use the time to work with HUD to determine the suitability of the proposed buyer  Larry Gluck of Stellar Management  While Mr  Gluck had already submitted papers for prepayment  Schumer and the tenants are concerned at his troubling record running other affordable housing buildings  During Mr  Glucks tenure as Castletons building manager since 2006  the building has failed its physical inspection for the first time in years  and just this month  tenants received a notice that the gas bill was not paid  a failure that creates needless dread during the winter season  Mr  Gluck is also reported to have numerous outstanding code violations on the Mitchell Lama buildings that he has purchased in the last several years   Schumer has been a leader in the fight to save Castleton Park beginning in April when he joined tenants and activists to announce that he would be urging HUD to reject any buyouts that would threaten the affordability of Castleton Park  Since that time  Schumer has written numerous letters  met with senior HUD officials and spoken with HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson to urge HUD to maintain the affordable units on Staten Island  which has suffered from a housing crunch due to the population boom and rising real estate prices
