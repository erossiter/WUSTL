IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 18  2007 Schumer Announces Congress Passes Budget That Restores Devastating Cuts For Medical Care For Thousands Of Upstate NY Vets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In the Wake of the Walter Reed Scandal and with Thousands of Veterans Slated to Return Home in the Future  Upstate New York Vets in Dire Need of Medical Care   Congress  Budget will Offset Administration s Cuts that Cost Upstate New York Veterans an Estimated  101 4 million in Medical Services   Earlier this Year  Schumer Toured the Canandaigua VA Medical Center and Pledged to Re Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that the Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2008 budget to restore funding for hundreds of thousands of veterans across upstate New York who are currently in jeopardy of losing an estimated  101 4 million in medical services under the President s proposed budget cuts   In the wake of the Walter Reed scandal and with thousands of active soldiers slated to return home  Senator Schumer toured the Canandaigua VA Medical Center earlier this year and pledged to restore funding for all upstate veterans who are in need of vital health care        The  43 1 billion budget for veterans programs includes funding for medical care and VA hospitals across the country and upstate New York  where thousands of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan will receive medical treatment         This budget was crafted explicitly with the medical care of our returning soldiers in mind   said Senator Schumer    After the revelations of the disgraceful conditions at Walter Reed  we were determined to make sure every veteran from Buffalo to Binghamton wasn t forced to make another sacrifice after bravely serving their nation abroad        Earlier this year  Schumer revealed that the current Administration s budget shortchanges veterans  health care needs by more than  100 million  part of a  2 8 billion potential nationwide shortfall  The bulk of this shortfall comes from the fact that the number of physicians  nurses  and all other health professionals currently employed by the VA cannot keep pace with increasing demands on the system from current wars abroad       With more than 30 000 veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9 11 currently living in upstate New York  the Senator had called for the cuts to be restored and for a new commission to investigate conditions at military health care facilities across the country in the wake of the scandal involving outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center       Too offset the President s proposed budget cuts  Congress  budget provides  43 1 billion for veterans programs and was developed with the assistance of four leading veterans groups and the recommendation of the American Legion  The funding is  3 6 billion more than the Presidents budget in 2008 and more than  20 billion above the President s over five year  It also represents the largest increase for veteran s medical care ever        Schumer said the President s cuts could have cost upstate New York veterans an estimated  101 4 million in medical services   There are over 637 400 veterans currently living in upstate New York with 263 600 currently receiving VA health benefits   The numbers below were obtained from the New York State Division of Veterans  Affairs which breaks out medical expenditures for veterans in every county in the state  Below is how the numbers break out across the state            Right now  there are 83 273 veterans living in the Capital Region with 34 302 enrolled in the VA health service   Under the Congress  new budget  15 310 020 in cuts will be restored             Right now  there are 73 840 veterans living in Central New York with 30 558 enrolled in the VA health service   Under Congress  new budget  15 074 826 in cuts will be restored            Right now  there are 93 456 veterans living in the Rochester   Finger Lakes Region with 37 731 enrolled in the VA health service   Under the Congress  new budget  10 478 514 in cuts will be restored            Right now  there are 144 846 veterans living in the Hudson Valley with 63 076 enrolled in the VA health service   Under the Congress  new budget  18 482 346 in cuts will be restored            Right now  there are 53 286 veterans living in the North Country with 21 116 enrolled in the VA health service   Under the Congress  new budget  4 627 917 in cuts will be restored            Right now  there are 58 842 veterans living in the Southern Tier with 24 019 enrolled in the VA health service   Under the Congress  new budget  15 453 877 in cuts will be restored             Right now  there are 129 899 veterans living in Western New York with 52 834 enrolled in the VA health service   Under the Congress  new budget  21 941 399 in cuts will be restored        As the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars continue  Schumer said that the VA has not yet seen the bulk of claims or patients resulting from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and must now take aggressive measures to ensure there are adequate facilities to handle the physical and physiological needs of these new veterans in the short term and over the long term        As of September 2006  more than 50 500 US soldiers have suffered non mortal wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan   a ratio of 16 wounded servicemen per fatality   This is by far the highest ratio of any recent war  Though advancements in field medicine and overall medical technology  more servicemen and women are thankfully surviving their wounds  however  Schumer said current and past VA budgets do not account for the dramatic new and long term burdens on VA health care  Last year  the Administration came up  2 billion short in funding for veterans and Congress was forced to pass an emergency spending bill to make up the difference   Schumer said that repeated budget cuts have created a crisis situation in the veterans  health care system
