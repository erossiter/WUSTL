IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 30  2007 Schumer Backs Bill To Give Local Authorities In Croton And Middletown The Power To Keep Solid Waste Transfer Stations On Rail Lines Out Of Communities  Backyards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Currently Federal Agency STB Has Exclusive Jurisdiction over All Rail Transportation  Allowing Companies to Use Federal Loophole to Avoid State and Local Scrutiny for the Construction of New Solid Waste Facilities  Rail Companies are Presently Considering Building Waste Stations Near Communities in Croton and Middletown  Schumer Backs Legislation to Remove STB s Jurisdiction Over Solid Waste Facilities Along Rail Lines   Gives Local Authorities Power to Regulate Construction of New Facilities Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer pushed for a federal provision that will protect the Towns of Croton and Middletown from having solid waste transfer stations constructed in their residential neighborhoods without local regulation  In the past few years  rail companies have attempted to use the Surface Transportation Boards  STB  federal authority to bypass local and state regulations in efforts to site solid waste stations transfer stations in Croton and Middletown     Today  Schumer urged the Joint Senate House Conference committee to retain a provision that would prevent the STB from approving these controversial projects  placing regulation of solid waste facilities back into the hands of state and local authorities who can protect local communities     Its imperative that we include this provision so local communities in Croton and Middletown dont see their quality of life threatened by the rail companies trying to construct solid waste facilities under the radar  said Senator Schumer  Jurisdiction over siting solid waste facilities should rest primarily with local and state authorities because they are on the ground and are best able to judge what best for their community and region  Firms should not be able to hide behind the claim of federal preemption to avoid appropriate regulation when it comes to building and operating solid waste facilities     In a letter to the Joint Senate House Conferees on the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  And Related Agencies Appropriations Act  Schumer urged the chairs and ranking members to retain a provision in the final version of the FY 2008 THUD Appropriations Act to remove the authority of the STB to have exclusive jurisdiction over the construction of solid waste facilities on rail lines  The provision would prevent railroads from using federal preemption standards to shield themselves from state and local environmental laws regarding the movements of municipal solid waste  Currently  an existing railroad may build a support facility  including a solid waste facility  without any regulatory approval     Under current law  railroad operations are preempted from certain state and local laws  making STBs jurisdiction exclusive for all rail transportation and rail facilities that are part of the national rail network  including spur and ancillary track  The Schumer backed provision would prohibit the STB from approving proposals to develop solid waste facilities  along rail lines  that currently are exempt from municipal approval  Several years ago a proposal by Chartwell International would have created a waste transfer station along a 15 mile stretch of track in Middletown  While the City was able to work out an agreement with Chartwell  the Schumer backed provision would have provided the City with the authority to regulate construction of the facility     The Schumer backed provision would also prohibit the STB from approving a potential proposal by rail companies seeking to buy several solid waste facilities in Westchester County  There have been problems in the past with rail companies trying to acquire these facilities and then get use the STB permit process to handle material at the facility without obtaining permits from the local government  This is troubling because the STB has no permit application process  no site selection process  no environmental or health impact review  and no engineering design standards  Since state permits and processes are preempted  the STB process essentially creates a situation where these facilities are subject to exclusive STB jurisdiction but no actual regulation takes place     Schumer also signed on to S 719 the Clean Railroads Act of 2007  a free standing bill to remove the STBs authority to approve the construction of solid waste facilities on rail lines  While both the free standing bill and the provision in the appropriations bill would block the STBs approval of a solid waste transfer station  the appropriations provision would expire after one year unless it was renewed in the next appropriations bill  while S 719 would permanently remove the STBs authority on solid waste stations  Schumer is also a cosponsor of S 1889  the Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2007  which also includes language to strip STB of this authority     By eliminating STBs jurisdiction over solid waste facilities located on rail lines  this provision will ensure that these facilities are held to state solid waste licensing and regulatory rules that normally apply to these types of facilities  Schumer added     In April 2007  Schumer sent a letter to the Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board calling on him to reject the New England Transrails application  writing  it can only be characterized as an attempt to circumvent state and local authorities rather than taking environmental concerns into consideration  Schumer also sent a letter to the STB expressing concern that Chartwell may plan to ignore local rules and regulations when constructing waste facilities by claiming federal preemption by STB jurisdiction
