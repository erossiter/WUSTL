IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 19  2006 Schumer To Prez  Passport Cards Not The Right Alternative To Protect Northern Border Commerce

                                   This Week  U S  State Department Unveiled The   New   Passport Card That Is Expensive  Inconvenient And Doesn  t Take Into Account The Needs Of Families   Senator  Passport Card Is Simply A Passport In Sheep  s Clothing    Feds Must Go Back To The Drawing Board Find A Real Alternative That Protects Both Security And Commerce                                                                       U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today told President George W  Bush that passport cards are not the right alternative to passports to protect Northern Border commerce   This week  the U S  Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  announced they are moving forward with plans for a passport card as the   alternative    to a passport to be used at the Northern Border under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative   In a personal letter to the President  Schumer said the passport card will take as long to obtain and a passport  is expensive and doesn  t take into account the needs of families in border communities         The passport card is simply a Passport in sheep  s clothing     Schumer said     The passport card is nothing more than a wallet sized passport  which will still take as long as a passport to acquire and is still far too expensive for American families to obtain  The feds need to go back to the drawing board and find a real alternative that protects both security and commerce          Schumer said the passport card is unacceptable because it fails to address the challenges of additional document requirements at the Northern Border  Specifically  the cost of  45 for adults and  35 for children  In addition  the application time needed to obtain the passport card  which the State Department indicated will be the same time as a passport  makes the card inconvenient to obtain and creates a situation in which families must plan for a routine visit across the border a long time in advance  The State Department  s plan does not provide any alternative procedures or special considerations for children or senior citizens  School trips  sports teams and organized excursions make up much of the tourist trade along the northern border  Requiring the equivalent of a passport will make these trips either too expensive or too cumbersome for travelers to make  The economies of communities on both sides of the border will suffer  Therefore  Schumer said whatever plan is finally developed  it must include provisions to make it easier and less costly for seniors and minors to obtain the proper documents        When the Administration first proposed requiring passports along the Northern Border  President Bush immediately criticized the plan  saying that   When I first read that in the newspaper  about the need to have passports      I said  what s going on here  I thought there was a better way      to expedite  the  legal flow of traffic and people      if people have to have a passport  it s going to disrupt  the  honest flow of traffic             However  19 months after he directed DHS and the State Department to find a different plan for WHTI  the only solution they have come up with is to make the passport smaller     said Schumer        Last month  the U S  Senate and House of Representatives passed legislation that extends the deadline for WHTI implementation until June 2009 in order to give DHS and State the time they need to develop a solution that will improve border security without so severely disrupting commercial and passenger traffic  Schumer said the State Department  s passport card proposal ignores this mandate and it is unacceptable that they would move forward on a plan developed under the previous constrained deadlines now that more time has been afforded to them to develop a system that will actually protect commerce and improve security at the same time          I fear this system will have a crippling effect on the economy of border communities  I worry will severely impact on the number of cross border trips and the tourism industry in particular  I fully support efforts to improve security along our borders  however we must at the same time protect commerce and the way of life along the border     Schumer added       In a personal letter to President George W  Bush  Schumer wrote    Today  Mr  President  I ask that you send a message to DHS and to State that they must once again go back to the drawing board to find a real solution for WHTI that will both improve security and protect commerce  You have demonstrated leadership on this issue in the past and I ask that you do so again now  Congress and your pen have given DHS and State the time to solve this problem and I hope that you will instruct them to use it
