IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 24  2006 New Schumer Analysis Of LIRR Stations Reveals LIRR Woefully Behind In Implementing Critical Safety And Security Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Schumer  Other Problems Abound In Addition to Gaps on the Platform   5 years after 9 11 and No Federal Minimum Rail Security Standards Exist  80  of LIRR Stations Surveyed Do Not Have Blast Resistant Garbage Cans  92  Do Not Have Closed Circuit Cameras   In the Wake of New Revelations that LIRR Officials Knew About Dangerous Gaps  Senator Calls for Comprehensive NTSB Investigat On the heels of recent reports of dangerous gaps in Long Island Railroad platforms that the LIRR knew about but didn  t aggressively fix  today Senator Charles E  Schumer released the details of a new study that shows that the gaps may be just the tip of the iceberg  Schumer  s study reveals that other problems abound and that Long Island Railroad stations lack the critical safety and security infrastructure to keep their riders safe  Schumer today called on the LIRR to immediately review its entire infrastructure for potential safety issues  as well as to establish regular and comprehensive inspections to continually ensure the protection of its passengers and serve as a mechanism to immediately correct any problems  He also called on the National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  to intervene and assist the LIRR in investigating its system and formulate essential new safety recommendations       In the past few weeks LIRR stations have been under fire for not properly regulating platform gaps  sadly that may only be the tip of the iceberg     Schumer said    When almost all of the LIRR stations don  t have the proper safety mechanisms in place  it unnecessarily endangers the 300 000 people who go through those stations every day  Its time the LIRR and the NTSB step in and ensure that safety regulations are followed         The recent death of an 18 year old woman who fell through an 11 inch platform gap at a station in Woodside  Queens underscores the need for the LIRR to immediately review its infrastructure throughout Nassau and Suffolk Counties for broad potential safety issues  Just yesterday it was revealed that the LIRR has known about this problem for years and  while gaps have contributed to at least 115 accidents in the last two years  they have done very little to substantively fix it     A survey of 30 of the most heavily trafficked LIRR stations performed by the Senator  s office in July and August and released today shows that the safety infrastructure is poorly maintained and common sense measures severely lacking  While the excessive platform gaps are a serious cause for concern  so too are the numerous other problems which could give rise to preventable accidents     The Schumer analysis also revealed a startling lack of physical security infrastructure even after directives were issued by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  over 2 years ago to enhance security at major transit links such as the LIRR  Little progress appears to have been made by the LIRR to follow these recommendations  Schumer said today that the inadequate security measures at LIRR stations demonstrates another example of riders being put at risk due a vulnerable and unprepared rail network  In the survey  Schumer  s office found many glaring problems with the various safety and security conditions present      The survey found  less than 7  of the stations had closed circuit surveillance cameras  only 17  of the stations had visible crisis or safety procedure signs  33  had sufficient handicapped accessibility and clearly noticeable exits  and 23  had clearly visible exit signs  In addition  30  percent were plagued with dilapidated platforms  33  with rusted through or unlocked electrical equipment  17  had either faded or no visible demarcation of a safe distance from the train and tracks  17  had access points such as stairs that were in unsuitable condition  23  did not expressly prohibit entrance into restricted track areas with signs  and at none of these stations was entry into those areas witnessed or punished  Additionally  most stations appeared to have minimal personnel and few guards  MTA police were rarely sighted     In addition to safety  Schumer said today that the LIRR must also do a better job ensuring their security from terror threats  The recently foiled plot aboard airliners has served as a wake up call that far more needs to be done to keep our rails safe and secure  In May of 2004 DHS issued a number of directives which called on major transit operators to enhance physical security by  among other measures  installing transparent bomb resistant trash cans  deploying additional police and security personnel  and installing closed circuit security cameras  The study Schumer released today showed that the MTA has made almost no progress toward following the security directives  putting millions of commuters in danger  In addition to the dearth of closed circuit surveillance  less than 7  of stations had them   only 20  of the 30 LIRR stations sampled appeared to have blast resistant  transparent  and locked garbage cans     In an effort to make the largest commuter railroad in the country safer and more secure  in a letter to LIRR president James Dermody  Schumer asked to immediately review its infrastructure for broad potential safety issues  as well as to establish regular and comprehensive inspections to continually ensure the protection of its passengers and thus quickly correct problems  He wrote   The time has come to give these safety issues the attention they demand when millions of riders  including the elderly and disabled  are clearly at risk  It is vital that the LIRR address this large range of safety issues  offering recommendations and new uniform standards to mitigate concerns on the condition of aging and dilapidated platforms and lack of cameras that are consistently monitored  among other areas        Schumer today also called on the NTSB to intervene and assist the LIRR in investigating the network and formulating essential safety and security recommendations
