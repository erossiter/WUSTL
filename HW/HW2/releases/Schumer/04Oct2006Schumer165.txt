even more necessary when local budget cuts are leaving them without enough funding   This federal money will help make sure that firefighters throughout the Finger Lakes Region get the resources they

to attain and maintain 24 hour staffing and to assure that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire related hazards   The objective of the Hiring of Firefighters activity is to award grants directly to volunteer  combination  and career fire departments to help the departments increase the number of frontline firefighters  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  AFGP
