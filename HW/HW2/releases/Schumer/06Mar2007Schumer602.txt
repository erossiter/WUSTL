IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 6  2007 Schumer Offers Bi Partisan Amendment to Delay Passport Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Schumer s Amendment Mirrors His Legislation Announced Last Week to Delay Implementation of WHTI Until At Least June 2009   Senator Says the Technology is Nowhere Near Ready to be Used and the Passport Requirement Would Cripple Cross Border Commerce for a Generation   Schumer s Amendment Require that Any and All Technology Meets Rigorous Security and Efficiency Standards          Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced he will introduce a bi partisan amendment to the 9 11 Recommendations Bill currently being debated on the Senate floor that would delay any implementation of Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  or any passport requirement at the Northern Border until at least June 2009   Schumer said his amendment is similar to legislation he announced last week during a visit to Buffalo  Schumer has raised serious concerns that DHS is trying to use a loophole in the law to act as early as January 2008 to impose a rule requiring travelers to present a passport when crossing the Northern Border  despite a troubling lack of preparation on DHS s part         We need to need to move fast to prevent DHS from ramming something through that would cripple cross border commerce for a generation   Schumer said   WHTI was poorly thought out from the get go and any effort by DHS to rush this through must be stopped dead in its tracks  I fully support efforts to improve security along our borders  however  we must at the same time protect commerce and the way of life along the border       Schumer s amendment  which is co sponsored by Senator Olympia Snowe  R ME   would move back implementation to no earlier than June 1  2009   Schumer s amendment would also codify in to law the rule that kids don t need passports which was proposed by DHS last week  require card and document readers meet rigiourous international standards for security and efficiency  and enhance coordination with between existing trusted traveler programs  NEXUS  SENTRI  etc   and WHTI       Last week  Schumer s announced new comprehensive legislation would block any effort by DHS to implement a passport requirement before June 2009   Just last year  Congress pushed back the deadline for WHTI implementation from January 1  2008 to June1  2009 due to ample evidence that DHS would be hard pressed to meet the 2008 deadline  But under this amended law  DHS still has the discretion to finalize and impose the WHTI rules earlier if it can make specific certifications relating to the technology  reliability  and security of the system   DHS is known to be exploiting this provision of the law and rushing through development and planning in order to meet these requirements and start demanding passports at land borders in January 2008  a year and half early        Schumer s legislation would minimize uncertainty and mandate that WHTI rules cannot be implemented at land crossings any earlier than June 1  2009   This extra time is sorely needed for DHS to ensure that WHTI can be implemented without disrupting cross border commerce and travel   In addition  DHS would have to certify six months in advance of final implementation that it has met comprehensive efficiency and security guidelines   If DHS fails to meet these standards prior to June 1  2009  then WHTI cannot enter into force until DHS can meet these important guidelines         The bill would state that any card or identification document required under WHTI as a passport alternative would cost the user no more than  20 for adults and would be free to children under the age of 18  If children under the age of 18 do not wish to obtain a PASS Card  then they would be exempt from the WHTI documentary requirement        The United States and Canada have the largest bi national trade relationship in the world  Trade with Canada supports an estimated 350 000 jobs in New York alone  Fully 25  of all New York State exports  accounting for  10 5 billion  go to Canada every year  The impact of tourism and spur of the moment trips is also staggering with Canadians accounting for 2 2 million visits to New York in 2002 injecting  389 million into the local economies       In January  Schumer submitted a formal comment criticizing the Department of State s proposed rule regarding the new PASS Card and laid out eight steps the State Department should take before any final rule is implemented  In his comment  Schumer said the proposed PASS Card will offer all of the inconvenience and inefficiencies of a standard passport book  while providing none of the security assurances for individuals  private information  Schumer  who added that PASS cards could be cost prohibitive for the average family  specifically asked that the State Department conduct an economic impact study on the economies in upstate New York and other border states and bring in an independent auditor to evaluate the entire program   The State Department has offered the PASS Card as a possible alternative to passports required under WHTI
