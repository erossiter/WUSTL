IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 11  2007 Schumer To Offer New Legislation Expanding Fannie Mae s And Freddie Mac s Ability To Refinance Families On Brink Of Foreclosure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Strengthened Measure Would Lift GSEs  Portfolio Caps By 10 Percent for Six Months  With 85  of Increase Devoted to Subprime Refinancings  Rep  Frank Expected to Introduce Companion Measure in the House  Senator Plans to Attach Measure to First Available Bill To Achieve Swift Passage  WASHINGTON  DCU S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  D NY  today unveiled new legislation that would significantly enhance Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs ability to facilitate refinancings for U S  homeowners on the brink of foreclosure  A companion measure was also expected to be introduced in the House today by U S  Rep  Barney Frank  D MA   Schumer said he planned to attach the Senate version to the first available legislative vehicle     The new legislation strengthens a proposal first offered by Schumer in August and comes on the heels of a series of meetings Schumer has convened with Fannie Mae  Freddie Mac  and the pairs regulator  the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise and Oversight  OFHEO   The bill would unleash approximately  150 billion in private sector funds for foreclosure prevention by temporarily lifting the limits on the mortgage portfolios held by the two government sponsored enterprises  GSEs   Under the bill  those limits would be lifted by 10 percent for six months  with 85 percent of the increase  approximately  125 billion  required to fund refinancing of subprime borrowers     This bill provides a lifeboat for the millions of homeowners left stranded by the Bush administration amid a sea of subprime turmoil  said Schumer  the Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing  The interest rates on two million home loans are due to increase radically  but the President wont adjust his radical ideology  But that doesnt have to be the last word now that Democrats in Congress are coming together to take steps the administration wont     The planned introduction of the cap lifting measure makes good on one promise made by House and Senate Democrats last week  As part of a comprehensive agenda to stem the foreclosure crisis  Schumer  Frank and other Democrats also proposed a substantial increase in federal aid to housing nonprofits that perform homeowner counseling for at risk borrowers  The Senate has already included  200 million in such aid in the Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill that passed in that chamber last month     Schumers responsiveness stands out against the backdrop of the Bush administrations inaction  President Bush has consistently opposed a meaningful cap lift for the GSEs portfolios on ideological grounds  Even as the mortgage market crisis has threatened to spill over into the broader economy  the administration has balked at any portfolio increase beyond a modest two percent hike announced in September  Schumer has publicly expressed that the two percent increase does not match the magnitude of the subprime mortgage crisis  Nor was it specifically designed to target struggling subprime borrowers  In contrast  the Schumer bill will providing meaningful relief for the hundreds of thousands of American homeowners whose monthly mortgage payments are set to jump to unaffordable rates before February 2008  the date that OFHEO has publicly set as a possible target for removing the portfolio caps altogether     Since 2005  the number of subprime loans originated has more than doubled  In 2001   120 billion in subprime loans were originated  about 5 4 percent of the total mortgages originated that year  By 2005  this number had risen to  625 billion  about 21 percent of the total  By the end of 2006  an estimated 6 7 million subprime loans remained outstanding  representing  1 2 trillion in outstanding debt  It is estimated that at least one in five of these subprime loans will end in a lost home     Over the next two years  an estimated 2 million homeowners with subprime adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs  will experience their first payment shock as their loans reset in a weakening housing market  a harbinger of more foreclosures to come     Market experts estimate that up to 40 percent of current subprime borrowers could now qualify for prime  fixed rate loans  making the crisis one that could be curtailed by strong efforts to refinance borrowers  Not only will such efforts save hundreds of thousands of families from losing their homes  it will also prevent further damage to the already weak housing market and protect the broader economy
