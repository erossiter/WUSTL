Increase Threat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Lyme Disease Cases Have Increased on Long Island in the Past Two Years  Doubled in Nassau  Schumer  Joined by Leading Researchers and Victims of Lyme Disease  To Push for Immediate Passage of New Bipartisan Legislation Funding Prevention  Education  Research Nassau and Suffolk Counties could be on track for one of the worst seasons of Lyme disease  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today  Schumer released statistics on the prevalence of Lyme disease in Long Island and showed that incidences of Lyme in Nassau County doubled while the already high incidence rate on Suffolk County has remained fairly stable  This is particularly problematic because Lyme disease has had the perception of being exclusive to Fire Island and out in eastern Long Island  But now  with the rise in deer population throughout the region    including north shore towns like Huntington  Smithtown  and some parts of Nassau  this problem has a far wider reach than previously thought  Schumer will also warn that the much more aggressive Lone Star tick  previously prevalent only in the Southwestern U S  has now spread to the Northeast and could be migrating in large numbers to Long Island          Lyme disease is a problem we  ve seen for decades  but we haven  t done nearly enough at the federal level to tackle it     Schumer said    Funding research for a disease that impacts millions of Americans should not be a Herculean task  The time is now to substantially increase Federal funding for research  educating families  treatment  and promoting prevention  We need to look no further than Long Island to see this is a problem that deserves urgent attention          Over the past eight years  between 1997 and 2005  Nassau has logged 799 cases of Lyme disease and Suffolk has logged 5 377  According to the State Department of Health the number of reported Lyme disease cases in Suffolk County doubled from 2003 to 2004  and Nassau doubled from 2004 to 2005  This year  from January until May  Nassau County has already found 19 cases of Lyme disease  a very significant number since ticks are far more active in the summer and that number does not include any of the summer months       The high increase in the deer population on Long Island may play a role in the uptick of Lyme disease cases  Deer have reportedly increased to as many as 20 000 on Long Island  increasing the risk of Lyme disease for Long Islanders  A single deer can host up to 1 000 ticks       To combat Lyme disease cases on Long Island and throughout New York  Schumer announced that he is kick starting a new push to pass the Lyme and Tick borne Disease Prevention  Education  and Research Act   S  1479   Specifically  the bill would             Authorize  100 million over five years for increasing and coordinating federal prevention  treatment and research of Lyme disease and other tick borne diseases  including developing sensitive and accurate diagnostics for tick borne diseases and increasing public education for such diseases         Provides  250 000 over two years to establish a Department of Health and Human Services advisory committee to facilitate communication between federal agencies  such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health  NIH   and members of the community  including patient organizations  doctors and scientists   as they attempt to raise awareness  treat  and cure tick borne diseases  Additionally  the committee would compile local and state data to improve information about the Lyme and other tick borne diseases        Schumer also said that there is a new type of tick threatening Long Island  called the Lone Star tick  The Lone Star tick  Amblyomma Americanum  is one of the most aggressive ticks and actually will pursue a potential human host from 30 to 40 feet away  Unlike regular deer ticks who have long been common on Long Island  the Lone Star Tick can live in a dry  hot environment  According to the Lyme Disease Association  the Lone Star tick  typically found in the Southwest  is migrating North in large numbers and now poses a significant threat to Long Island  While deer ticks commonly attach themselves to at least 125 species of birds  mammals  and reptiles  the Lone Star tick commonly preys on humans  The Lone Star  s relationship with deer in its larval  nymph and adult stages suggests that its spread across Long Island correlates with the Island  s rising deer population  Even more disturbing  is that the Lone Star tick is much more aggressive in their hunting tactics than deer ticks  The Long Star tick actively searches out its victims and its bite leaves behind irritated  red welts  Experts report that Lone Star ticks now outnumber deer ticks by a 3 to 1 ratio on Fire Island and throughout the South Fork        Though Nassau County does not classify their cases by tick type  they do have a service where residents can mail in ticks that they find or were bitten by  The proportion of Lone Star ticks is staggering  According to the lab  approximately 30  of the ticks residents mailed in 2004 and 2005 were Long Star ticks  As of the end of May this year  the County had already received 4 Lone Star ticks out of 31 sent in thus far   Schumer today announced he is urging federal health officials to investigate the rise in the Lone Star tick on Long Island and the possible health effects on the region  In his letter to CDC  s director Julie Gerberding  Schumer wrote    Too little is known about this species  but its bite is spreading across the country           Lyme disease  though highly curable if it is detected in its early stages  is difficult to diagnose as its symptoms are similar to the common flu  The   bull  s eye    rash that accompanies infection of the disease at the site of the tick bite often goes undetected especially on darker skin tones  and there is not a reliable blood test for the disease  In addition  there is no vaccine  and medical authorities disagree over how to treat the illness  particularly when it persists after short term antibiotic treatment       Long Island  s first deer tick  the Blacklegged tick  was initially discovered in 1971 on the eastern tip of Long Island  and Lyme tick disease was promptly classified as a clinical illness following the infection of 51 Connecticut residents  Deer ticks are parasites and members of the Arachnida class which also includes spiders and scorpions  Long Island  s deer tick larvae generally hatches from its eggs during midsummer  and the average lifespan of a deer tick typically lasts two years  In order to mature  deer ticks require a steady diet of blood at every developmental stage   males feed irregularly while females tend to attach themselves to hosts for weeks at a time  accumulating the nutrients they need for egg production        Schumer was joined today by Dr  Benjamin J  Luft M D   Edmund D  Pellegrino Professor and Chief  Division of Infectious Diseases  Stony Brook University Hospital  Patricia Smith  President of the Lyme Disease Association and Diane Leary  Long Island Lyme Association
