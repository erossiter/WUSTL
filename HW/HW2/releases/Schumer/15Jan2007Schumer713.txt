IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 15  2007 Schumer Reveals  Benefits For Long Island  s Nat  l Guard And Reservists Lag Far Behind Active Military Despite Same Sacrifice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     With Disability Claims by Guard and Reservists Denied at More than Twice the Rate of Active Military Members  Schumer Calls for Immediate VA Investigation    Standing at Hofstra in Hempstead  Schumer Announces New Sweeping Legislation to Double Education Benefits and Increase Access to Medical Care   Schumer  We Cannot Shortchange Brave Long Islanders who Join the National Guard  With the National Guard and Reserve members stretched to the limit  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that benefits for Long Island members of the National Guard and Reserves who are called into military service lag far behind those for active military and announced new sweeping legislation to close the benefits gap  Under the current system  a reservist who attends school and participates in fulltime training receives only a  297 month stipend while active duty soldiers receive  1097 month  To level the playing field  Schumer today visited Hofstra University  which boasts a large ROTC program  and announced his plans to introduce new sweeping benefits legislation for members of the National Guard and Reserves in the 110th Congress  Schumer also said that while 18  of disability claims by members of the National Guard and Reserves are denied  only 8  of active duty claims are denied and called for an immediate federal investigation into the disparity         Long Island residents who join the National Guard and Reserves and serve overseas are every bit as brave and sacrifice every bit as much as active military members  and thus ought to be treated fairly  no questions asked     Schumer said    With the Guard and Reserves already stretched nearly to the breaking point during this holiday season  the current two tiered system needs to be leveled immediately  We cannot and must not shortchange these heroes          Schumer today revealed that there is a shocking disparity in the benefits offered to active military members returning from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and the members of the so called   reserve component     The reserve component includes any member of the National Guard or Reserves who is called to serve with the active military overseas  From education benefits offered to returning soldiers who go back to school to the type and location of medical care available  members of the reserve component who return from a war zone lag far behind the benefits available to active military members       More than 500 000 Guard and Reserve troops have served in active duty since the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  and they ve made up nearly half of the force fighting against terrorists and in combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan   Nationwide there are 88 500 members of the reserve component currently mobilized  and on Long Island  the Nassau County Veterans Service Agency estimates there are 3 000 3 500 active Reserve and National Guard members  Many belong to the Army  s   Fighting 69th Brigade    which has armories in Huntington  Freeport  Farmingdale  and Bay Shore  Long Island is also home to the 106th Rescue Wing  New York Air National Guard at Gabreski Airport       Under the current system  a reservist who is attending school and participating in full time training receives only a  297 month stipend while active duty soldiers receive  1097 month  After a reservist is deployed for at least three months  these benefits are increased  but even a reservist who serves in Iraq or Afghanistan never receives the full amount that their active duty counterparts receive  And  the reservist must remain within the Reserves  even after returning from active duty  in order to receive these benefits  which leaves them susceptible to being called up for another tour of duty in Afghanistan or Iraq       The disparity also exists when it comes to access to medical care   When reservists return home with an injury  most are required to recuperate at military medical facilities that can be long distances from their homes  even on the other side of the country  When active duty soldiers return home  they recuperate at the military base where they live  Under the current system  if a reservist or National Guard member wants to receive treatment close to home  they are forced to resign their active duty status thereby voiding their military health benefits         Schumer also revealed that even when members of the Guard and Reserve try to take advantage of the benefits that are available  the Department of Veterans Affairs has not treated them fairly and denied their claims at a far greater late   While 37  of active duty veterans have filed for service related disability claims  only 20  of those in the National Guard or reservists have filed claims  However  18  of the claims by National Guard members and reservists are denied  while only 8  of active duty claims are denied         There is simply no logical reason that medical claims for reservists and National Guard should be denied at nearly twice the rate of active duty soldiers serving side by side with them     Schumer added       To ensure that Long Island residents who belong to the guard and reserve receive the benefits and medical care they rightly deserve  Schumer today announced that when Congress reconvenes to begin the 110th Congress in January he will introduce new comprehensive benefits legislation  His legislation would level the playing field for members of the guard and reserves in Long Island and across the country  Specifically  Schumer  s bill would            Double the education benefit   Schumer  s legislation will increase the education benefit for members of the reserve component to  600 month             Ensure members of the Guard and Reserve can receive medical treatment close to home  Schumer  s legislation will create a new system where a member of the reserve component could receive treatment at a facility near their home without losing military health benefits             Reimburse members of the reserve component for travel costs  Right now  the military does not reimburse members of the reserve component for traveling to train or for weekend drill   To ease the burden on Long Island soldiers who may have to travel long distances throughout the state or even outside of New York  Schumer  s legislation requires the military to reimburse members of the reserve for travel beyond 50 miles        Schumer also wrote to Veteran  s Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson asking him to direct the Department of Veteran  s Affairs Inspector General to immediately investigate why reserve component claims are denied at such a greater rate than active military       Schumer announced his plan at Veterans Plaza at Hofstra University  home of the Thundering Pride ROTC Battalion which has been on campus since 1951  There are currently 85 cadets in the battalion including students from other local colleges that are allowed to enroll  Schumer was joined by Ed Aulman  Director of the Nassau County Veterans Service Agency and Colonel Vincent Montera  who began in the Air Force and then re enlisted in the Army Reserve  As Commander of the 310th MP Battalion  Colonel Montera was mobilized in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in January of 2003  Schumer was also joined by Paul Mc Dermott  a family support leader with the 310MP Battalion Family Support Unit  and Lt  Col  Abb  the leader of Hofstra  s ROTC program  as well as several of his cadets and officers from the program and additional reservists and members of the National Guard  Teresa Kemp Zielenski  Interim President and CEO of the United Way of Long Island was also present  The United Way  s Military Reservists Family Fund was established to support these families of soldiers  Also in attendance was Jonathan Spier  the Director of Community Relations for the Long Island State Veterans Home  LISVH  at Stony Brook University
