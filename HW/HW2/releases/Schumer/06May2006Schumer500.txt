IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 6  2006 Schumer  Thousand Island Bridge At Alexandria Bay Right Place For Innovative Border Crossing Plan That Keeps Traffic Moving While Maintaining Secure Border                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Plans for US Canada   Shared Border Management    Already Underway At Buffalo Border   Schumer Urges US Customs and Top Canadian Officials to Select Alexandria Bay as The Second Pilot Project In Shared Border Management Program   With Major Logistical Constraints on Canadian Side  Thousand Island Crossing Is Ideal Site  Would Alleviate Traffic Congestion and Keep Commercial Traffic Flowing U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced he is supporting Alexandria Bay for the second site for implementation of a Shared Border Management plan at the U S  Canadian border  Schumer lobbied aggressively to launch the first pilot program at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo  where the inspection facility will be on the Canadian side of the border  A 2004 agreement brokered by Schumer requires a second border site at which the customs facility is located on the U S  side and today Schumer said Alexandria Bay should be selected         From both security and economic perspectives  Alexandria Bay makes the most sense for Shared Border Management     said Schumer    A joint U S  Canadian facility on the US side of the border will allow law enforcement agencies to work closely together without hurting trade and commercial traffic  The Thousand Islands Crossing is the right place for the implementation of the second pilot project in shared border management  and now is the time to implement it          Schumer led the charge to bring the U S  and Canadian governments together  lobbying them for years to develop a joint customs and border management plan for Northern Border crossings  Under the original agreement between the U S  and Canadian governments  it was determined that there would be two pilot sites for the plan  the first at the Peace Bridge  and a second at a yet to be decided location suitable for Shared Border Management  In a statement issued at the time of the agreement  the Department of Homeland Security named the Thousand Islands Bridge as a possible second site       Under a Shared Border Management plan  all of the U S  and Canadian border facilities are located on one side of the border  The pilot at the Peace Bridge will involve the re location of all U S  primary and secondary border operations for both commercial and passenger traffic from Buffalo to Fort Erie  Similarly  at the second location  Canadian border functions will be moved to the U S  side of the border  Relocating all facilities to one side of the crossing is designed to improve the flow of information between both U S  and Canadian security officials and to make the operations more efficient to improve traffic over the border       Schumer today wrote to the top U S  and Canadian official to tout Alexandria Bay as the ideal site for the second Shared Border Management initiative  Schumer wrote to Deputy Secretary Designate of Homeland Security Michael Jackson and The Canadian Deputy Prime Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness  The two governments are currently developing details of Shared Border Management at the Peace Bridge and are still evaluating options for the second location       The Thousand Islands Crossing is the right place for the implementation of the second pilot project in shared border management  and now is the time to implement it  This border crossing is the gateway of   The Capital Corridor  an initiative that involves governments  industry and the private sector and would link Ottawa and Washington  DC  through this border crossing  In 2004 approximately  12 billion in trade between Canada and the U S  went through this crossing  making it the fourth most important gateway between the two countries  Unfortunately  the geographic limitations on the Canadian side of the crossing severely limit the flow of traffic and impede trade  With the current project to expand the US side of the gateway well underway  it is the perfect time to begin planning a joint US Canadian facility on the US side of the border         Building both Shared Border Management sites in New York makes the most sense     Schumer said    Once everything is up and running  we can study how well this working and customs officials can collaborate to develop the most effective and efficient crossings          Shared Border Management at this crossing will allow U S  and Canadian law enforcement agencies to work more closely together and further cooperation  It would also allow for the further implementation of improved technology  which are currently hindered by the severe site restrictions on the Canadian side of the crossing  The current Canadian inspection facility lacks sufficient capacity to process the high volumes of passenger traffic that use the crossing  This is especially true during the summer months when travels frequently wait more than two hours during high volume periods
