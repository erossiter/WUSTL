IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 4  2007 Schumer  Monroe County Residents Need Ironclad Commitment From Iberdrola To Transform Coal Fired  Pollution Belching Russell Station Into Enviromentally Friendly  Energy Efficient Plant                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Spanish Utility Company Iberdrola Recently Issued a  4 5 billion Bid for Energy East   Parent Company of RG that Owns Greece s Russell Station One of the Nation s Most Notorious Polluters  Russell Station is Linked to Acid Rain in the Adirondacks and Operates at only 55  Capacity 32  Efficiency Disappointed with Iberdrola s Initial Plans for Russell Station s Futu Despite Rochester  NYs Russell Station being one of the nations most notorious polluters  Iberdrola  a Spanish Energy companywho has bid tobecome the facilitys new owner  has failed to offer a firm commitment tore power the outdatedplant byconverting it into a natural gas powered facility  The Spanish company is currently bidding  4 5 billion for Energy East  the parent company of Rochester General and Electric  RGE   which operates Russell Station  located on the shores of Lake Ontario  in the Town of Greece  The coal fired plant  built in 1948  operates at only 55  capacity and is ranked the nations the 12th worst polluter of sulfur dioxide  andNew York States 7th worst mercury polluter  emitting 91 pounds per year of the toxic substance    Today  in a letter to Iberdrolas CEO  Schumer expressed his disappointment in the companys response last month to his inquiry on their plans for cleaning up the plant  Convinced that the plants sale and Iberdrola s expertise in renewable energy  presentsa terrificopportunity to finally clean up one of the areas worst polluters  Schumer called onthe companyto give Rochester residents an ironclad agreement that it would re power the plant and convert it into a natural gas powered facility   Schumer warned that he will withhold his support for the takeover bid until such a commitment was made by the company    The health of Monroe County residents is far too important for us to accept vague and wishy washy answers when it comes to transforming Russell Station into an environmentally friendly plant  said Senator Schumer  If there was a top ten most wanted list for pollution belching power plants  Russell Station would be on it  For decades this plant has been one of the nations leading polluters and we finally have a golden opportunity to make sure its new owners do the right thing and transform it into a more efficient  natural gas fired plant  Rochester residents deserve an ironclad commitment from Iberdrola that it will make their health a top priority and I am prepared to withhold my support for this deal unless such a guarantee is made   While Schumer has not yet passed judgment on the proposed bid by Iberdrola   a company which has a strong track record for quality service and is currently the largest renewable energy operator in the world  last month he took the precautionary action of issuing a list of questions to Iberdrola to get a layout of how the deal will affect Rochester area customers  This followed a face to face meeting Schumer had with the companys top executives    In his list of questions  Schumer in particular called on Iberdrola to detail its plan for the future of Russell Station  a 257 megawatt coal burning power generating plant located in Greece that produces 25  of electric in the Rochester area    In Iberdrolas written response to Schumer  the company acknowledged the importance of Russell Station as well as the need to re power it  but in no way offered a concrete commitment to embark on the project  Instead  the company hinted that it would rely on government incentives for the projects underwriting as opposed to pledging to make it a priority either way In their response to Schumer s query they acknowledged the severity of the problem  writing that the plant isold and obsolete and should be rebuilt  but added the caveat  If encouraged todo so  rebuild the plant   we would expect RG E to respond quickly and responsibly   Previously  RG E President Jim Laurito has assured area residents that an upgrade at the facility was on planned and on track  Early this year  they filed paperwork with the New York Independant System Operator  NYISO  to replace Russell Station with a 300 Megawatt  environmentally friendly facility  This new plant would represent an 80  increase in energy production and reduce green house gas emissions    Schumer today pressed Iberdrola tofullycommit to re powering Russell Stationwithout qualifications  tellingthe company that theonly encouragement the company should need is the fact that the plant is one of the worst polluting coal fired facilities in the state  if not the country  and is extremely inefficient    I have said countless times that repowering is a triple win for Monroe County  It will improve air quality  it increases energy output in a place that is desperate for more power  and  perhaps most importantly  it can reduce rates for Rochester area residents who are overburdened energy consumers  added Schumer    According to the Sierra Club  Russell Station annually burns over 1 5 billion pounds of coal from West Virginia and Pennsylvania and has been ranked the 17th most polluting coal fired plant in the nation  The plant has been repeatedly accused for long standing violations of clean air laws  In 2006  Former Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner  DEC  Denise M  Sheehan announced plans to sue RGE for longstanding violations of clean air laws at Russell Station   In 2002  Russell Station was ranked as the 7th worst mercury emitting industrial facility in all of New York State  According to the EPA  it spews about 91 lbs a year into the atmosphere  In 2003 a report by the United States Public Interest Research Group USPIRG  ranked Russell Station the 12th least efficient plant nationwide in terms of SO2  sulfur dioxide  emissions  The plant emits 26 396 tonsofSO2a year  It also emits 1 689 235 tons of CO2 and 3 065 tons of NOx   Russell Station isalsoconsidered extremely inefficient  operating at only 55  capacity  which is currently257 Megawatts Furthermore  it is estimated that the thermal efficiency of the plant is only 32   Thermal efficiency measures the amount of power that was generated versus the amount that was emitted as pollutants  In the case of Russell Station  68  of the energy was released as pollutants    Iberdrola  over a century old  is one of the worlds leading private electric utilities and the largest renewable energy operator in the world  It has a strong record for using alternative energies including wind power  Its operations include generation  transmission  distribution and marketing of electricity and natural gas   In New York  Energy East is the parent company of NYSEG and RGE which together have a service area ranging from Buffalo in the west to Westchester in the east and from the Southern Tier all the way to the North Country  NYSEG delivers electricity to 838 000 customers and natural gas to 250 000 across more than 40  of upstate New York    RGE provides electricity and natural gas energy and related services to approximately 650 000 residents and businesses in a nine county region centered in the city of Rochester  According to the New York Independent System Operator  NYISO   NYSEG has 43 energy producing facilities in New York State and RGE owns 17 facilities in New York State
