IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 26  2007 Schumer Presses ATF Nominee On Why NYPD Was Stonewalled On Gun Tracing Request Related To Brooklyn Cop Killing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ATF Cited Controversial Tiahrt Amendment in Rejecting Commissioner Kelly s Request for Info on Sales of Guns Like That Used in Timoshenko Case Nominee Tells Senator   I m not sure why the request was turned down  WASHINGTON  DCToday  in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer questioned Michael J  Sullivannominated to be the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives  ATF on the Tiahrt Amendment and how it may have prevented the sharing of information in connection with the murder investigation of NYPD Officer Russell Timoshenko  Sullivan  who most recently served as the U S  Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and Acting Director at ATF  would be at the helm of an agency with jurisdiction over matters such as terrorism  violent crime  explosives and arson  As the federal agency that oversees firearms  the ATF also has the unique ability to trace gun crime data  However  because of a provision known as the Tiahrt Amendment  the ATF frequently refuses to share gun tracing information with local law enforcement investigating trends in gun crime  When asked about the practice of precluding access to trace information  Sullivan conceded that his reading of the amendment did not prevent ATF from sharing information with local law enforcement or other entities   I was glad to see some daylight on this issue with Mr  Sullivan  Schumer said  He seems willing to try to work with Congress to ensure that local law enforcement has access to the tools it needs  but the proof of the pudding is in the eating  We want an answer as to why the NYPD request for information on guns like those used in Officer Timoshenkos death was denied by ATF  I look forward to reading Mr  Sullivans more detailed answers to my questions  which he has promised he will provide in writing   In response to Schumers questioning  Sullivan said  Firearms trafficking is at the forefront of ATFs responsibility  Im optimistic that more information will be handed over  My reading of the amendment does not prevent me from sharing this information  With regard to Timoshenko specifically  and the NYPDs denied request for further gun trace information  Sullivan replied  Im not sure why the request was turned down  and pledged to look into the matter and provide further clarification in writing   Since 2003  Congress has attached riders to the Department of Justice appropriations legislation that bar ATF from using money to share information from its trace database  In practice  this prevents local law enforcement from accessing data and tracing guns used in violent crime  This is particularly a problem in states such as New York that have more stringent gun ownership laws  because the vast majority of the guns used in violent crime are trafficked in from other states  For the last several years  Senator Schumer has supported legislation to repeal the Tiahrt Amendment  The legislation has consistently been blocked by opponents in the Senate   In July  a New York Police Department detective by the name of Russell Timoshenko was shot and killed by an illegal gun that is thought to have been acquired in and trafficked from Virginia  Press accounts reported that the particular dealer had previously been indicted for his gun sales  It has been suggested that  in connection with the investigation  the NYPD requested additional trace information from the ATF  who refused citing the Tiahrt Amendment   There are approximately 192 million privately owned firearms in the U S 65 million of which are handguns  In 2004  nearly 30 000 people died in firearm related deaths   Senator Schumers opening statement as prepared is reproduced below    OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E  SCHUMER September 26  2007  Mr  Sullivan  thank you for being here today  I commend your many years of service to the government  as a United States Attorney  a district attorney  and a state representative  Having been both a federal and state prosecutor  you should know as well as anyone how gun violence and firearms trafficking is devastating communitiesnot just in big cities like New York  but in small towns around the country   I also hope you agree with me that the ATFs ability to trace gun crime data is one of its most important powers  To this end  we should never unreasonably tie the hands of law enforcement when it comes to sharing and tracing gun data  This is why Im anxious to hear your views about what have been called the Tiahrt amendments   Mayor Bloomberg has worked hard on this amendment and expressed to me particular interest in your views on this issue and on the language  As you might know  about 1  of the nations licensed gun dealers account for some 57  of traced crime guns   There is nothing wrong with the vast majority of the countrys gun dealers  But there are a few bad apples in the bunch  and we must find a way to stop them   But since 2003  Congress has attached riders to DOJ appropriations legislation that bars the ATF from using money to share information from the trace database with most anyoneresearchers  local governments  even Congress  And so  even though the police can trace a specific gun used in a specific crime to solve it  they cant look at patterns of sales of illegal guns   One example of this hits very close to home  This past July  an NYPD detective Russell Timoshenko was fatally shot in my hometown  Brooklyn  Several press accounts reported that he was shot by an illegal gun that came from Virginia  In fact  press accounts reported that this dealer had previously been indicted for his gun sales  That gun shop is now closed  and that dealer has been stripped of his license   It is my understanding that the NYPD asked the ATF for data about which dealers in Virginia supplied the most crime gunslike the one used to kill Officer Timoshenkoso they could identify the traffickers  But it is also my understanding that the ATF refused that request for data  citing the Tiahrt amendment  If this is the true  it is an outrage  If it is true  it is a horrible example of gun laws gone wrong    I want to hear your thoughts on this case  and others like it  I hope you can freely tell us today what your views are on the Tiahrt Amendment  and what you can do as head of the ATF to help ensure that innocent people do not lose their lives because of bad policy  I hope you can give us your views today on the most recent Tiahrt language that has passed the Senate  Appropriation Committee which may even subject law enforcement officers to jail time for sharing trace data  In my view  it is horrible policy to subject police officers to prosecution for making trace data requests  Id like to hear your views on the issue    We are just five months removed from the tragic events at Virginia Tech  This country knows all too well what happens when our gun laws fail  I have sponsored legislation that is backed by the NRAthat is being considered by the Senate as we speakto help modernize our background check system  We cannot let more people slip through the cracks and do harm to others  But stopping gun violence also requires a broader  national effort  I hope that as ATF head  you will be able to will help  and not obstruct  that process    I thank you for coming  and I look forward to hearing your views on these very important issues
