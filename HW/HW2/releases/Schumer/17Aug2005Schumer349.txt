                                  Schumer announces that 93 fire departments and organizations across New York State will receive over  8 2 million as part of U S  Department of Homeland Securities   FIRE GRANT program    Schumer says federal grant will help Hudson Valley pay for fire operations and fire safety in tough fiscal times    In March  Schumer fought to restore  400 million to the FIRE grants program which would be cut un US Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced over  1 2 million in federal funds for thirteen fire departments in the Hudson Valley to pay for fire operations and fire safety  The funds are being awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters program administered by the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS        This is a great day for Hudson Valley fire departments  said Schumer  In the brave new post 9 11 world  our first responders must be well trained and well equipped to deal with any problem that comes their way  This is really difficult when budget cuts are leaving them short on cash  These federal grants will help make sure that firefighters have the money they need to do their jobs       Thirteen grants for a total of  1 258 131 were awarded to fire departments and organizations in eight Hudson Valley counties  In Dutchess County  the West Clinton Fire District   76 713  and the Beacon Volunteer Ambulance Corps   50 670  received funds for operations and fire safety  In Orange County  the Highland Falls Fire Department   12 208  and the Canterbury Fire District   46 503  received funds for operations and fire safety  In Sullivan County  the Hurleyville Fire District   90 925  and the Highland Lake Fire Department   38 857  received funds for operations and fire safety  while the Lava Volunteer Fire Department   209 000  received funds for new firefighting vehicle acquisitions  In Westchester County  the Irvington Fire Department   34 960  and the Larchmont Volunteer Ambulance Corps   17 575  received funds for

for new firefighting vehicle acquisitions  The grants were part of the first round of DHS FY 2005 grants across the country  with more rounds to come       A Schumer analysis of the Administration s federal budget for FY05 found that cuts to the program could shortchange New York fire departments by  16 million  In March  Schumer urged the Congress and the White House to bolster the Administration s proposal by sending the full  900 million promised to fire departments by Congress       At Schumer s urging  fire departments and emergency services providers across New York have taken advantage of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  which sends funds directly for activities such as specialized emergency response training for situations like terrorist attacks  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  new fire trucks  and fire prevention programs        If ever our local fire departments needed an infusion of cash from the federal government  that time is now   Schumer said   Budget gaps are worse than they ve been in a long time with little relief in sight  and the strain on local fire departments is becoming too much to bear  Add to that the heightened alert our first responders are on because of the war  and this opportunity for fire departments to get financial support is just what the doctor ordered        The grant program  called the USFA Grants to Firefighters Program  awards grants directly to fire departments to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public  as well as that of firefighting personnel  facing fire and fire related hazards        The USFA awards the grants on a competitive basis to the applicants that most closely address the program s priorities and demonstrate financial need  Funding is available for activities such as specialized emergency response training for situations like terrorist attacks  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  and fire prevention programs
