IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 28  2007 Schumer Reveals  No Nationwide Reporting System For MRSA Cases Hampering Health Official s Ability to Contain Superbug as Staph Infection Spreads Across The Country Leaving Behind Devastating Results                                                                                                                                                                                                          With Dozens of Cases Reported and Now a Tragic Death in NYC Area from MRSA  Piecemeal Reporting Preventing CDC from Tracing and Containing Lethal Infection Staph Infection Now Appearing in Dozens of States As Many More May be Infected and Not Know it Schumer Unveils Three Point Plan to Improve National Reporting Requirements  Accelerate Antibiotic Research an In the wake of the tragic death of Omar Rivera from the lethal MRSA staph infection  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that there is no national reporting requirement for MRSA cases  leaving federal health officials only piecemeal information on which to track the devastating infection  Schumer already secured Senate approval of  5 million in emergency funding to combat the superbug  Schumer said that federal health officials need complete information in order to track and ultimately stop the spread of the bug    We need all hands on deck and all eyes watching to ensure this superbug doesnt pop up again and leading to the same tragic outcome  Schumer said  Unfortunately  without labs and hospitals reporting MRSA infections  well never know where the next case could pop up or if we have things fully under control  All levels of government need to be working from the same page and the same information to make sure that we catch every case before it spreads to another school   Right now medical testing labs and hospitals across the country are not required to report the cases of MRSA they discover  Several individual States and municipalities do require their labs to immediately report their findings  but the vast majority does not  Schumer said with MRSA appearing in states all across the country  the federal government must establish a better system for reporting and data collection  Meaningful national data must be collected so that MRSA and other antibiotic resistant infections can be quickly identified and contained  Without comprehensive and mandatory reporting of infections  health officials will never be able to appropriately gauge how far the infection has spread and predict where it could appear next  In addition  without immediate reporting  federal health officials are unable to respond quickly to the area where the infection appears  quarantine any contaminated schools  and prevent the bug from spreading further in to the community   There have been daily reports of new infections throughout New York State  with more than 50 serious cases reported in the state since 2004   In New York State  the first recent report of antibiotic resistant Staph in the community started in White Plains where nine student athletes at Iona College  as well as their coach  contracted MRSA  Last week  in the Southern Tier  students in the Corning Painted Post school district carried home letters on Thursday announcing that the difficult to treat bacteria has been infecting their fellow students    Schumer also said that one of the primary reasons the superbug has been able to spread so rapidly in schools is that many teachers and parents do not know the best ways to prevent an infection or spot an infection once it hits  Previously antibiotic resistant Staph infections  also called MRSA  were primarily confined to healthcare settings such as hospitals  clinics  and long term patient care centers  Now  the bug has spread in to schools and communities with devastating results    To be forewarned is to be forearmed  Schumer added  Parents and teachers are dealing with an infection that many of them have never seen before and its frightening  Government health officials cant do it alone  Parents and teachers need to know how to spot and how to stop this bug to keep it from infecting more kids   The bacteria  which generally resides in the nose or on the skin of about a third of the population  can be deadly if allowed to penetrate the skin or enter the blood stream  Schools are particularly prone to outbreaks in gyms or locker rooms  where students share towels  razors or sports equipment    In response to the tragic death of Omar Rivera and the many communities on edge fearing MRSA could appear in their schools next  Schumer today unveiled a new three point plan to improve reporting and data collection of infections and accelerate research into effective treatments and testing     Nationwide Reporting  Schumer is working with colleagues on legislation that will coordinate federal efforts to combat MRSA and antibiotic resistant infections  The legislation will strengthen surveillance and data collection of infections to enhance the governments ability to quickly identify and stop the spread of infection  The legislation also directs the government to acquire a better understanding of the use of antibiotics in an effort to reduce the misuse of the drugs  Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to the emergence of drug resistant infections     Emergency Funding to Prevent Future Infections    Schumer today on the President to remove his veto threat from the legislation containing the  5 million in emergency funding to help educate communities and health care facilities about prevention and awareness  This funding would go directly to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  AHRQ   which creates best practices for schools and hospitals to prevent the spread of the disease  and does active outreach to educate parents and educators on how to prevent and spot cases of MRSA and other infections  Since the incidence of MRSA in the community rather than hospitals and nursing homes has only recently exploded  many parents and educators do not know how to spot the disease immediately and in time for treatment  The spread of infection can be prevented with easy measures such as practicing good hygiene  We must make our communities aware of the simple steps they can take to protect themselves    Research Incentives to Create a New  More Effective MRSA Treatments and Tests  Schumer today also announced he would introduce new legislation to give targeted incentives to researchers to help find new effective treatments for MRSA and other superbugs  Right now  research into these treatments is very slow and costly  The legislation will also provide incentives for the development of quick and accurate diagnostic tests so that these infections can be identified before they have time to spread
