IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 12  2006 Schumer  Green Onion E  Coli Debacle Shows FDA Asleep At The Switch    Even After Recent Outbreaks  Vegetable Processing Plants Still Only Inspected Once Every 10 Years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         New Revelation Illustrates Desperate Need for Tracing   The Monitoring of Fruits and Vegetables is Years Behind Efforts to Protect Meat and Poultry        Tracing Has Reduced E Coli in Meat and Must be Done Immediately for Produce   Schumer Calls for Congress to Pass Sweeping Legislation for New FDA Rules and Oversight As Soon as it Reconvenes in January With news that the second produce related E  coli outbreak in just over 2 months has sickened over 200 New Yorkers  today U S  Senator  Charles E  Schumer called for Federal oversight of the nation  s food supply  Two months ago  in the aftermath of the nation  s largest E coli outbreak which sickened 206 people and killed 3 people across 26 states and Canada  it took federal investigators weeks before they could locate the contaminated spinach in California  s Salinas Valley  During the investigation  it became increasingly clear that federal efforts to monitor the food supply  track contaminated food  and notify the public are significantly hampered due to jurisdictional tangles  and shortages of manpower and resources at the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   the agency responsible for overseeing non meat food products  Schumer today announced his plans to reintroduce comprehensive food safety legislation that would create a new unified Food Safety Agency that would establish inspection protocols and tracing regulations to protect farms and consumers  Schumer  s call comes on the heels of news that though the E  coli outbreak originated over a week ago  the cause of it is still unknown        Two major E  coli outbreaks in three months have obviously rattled consumer confidence in our nation  s food supply    said Senator Schumer    For decades  we  ve made a concerted effort to educate Americans on the nutritional importance of eating vegetables and fruits  Today  we must regain their trust by implementing strong safety regulations to protect farms and consumers from another outbreak and to guarantee that our nation  s food supply is being adequately monitored          Under current law  the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  has the responsibility of protecting the nation  s meat and poultry supply  while the FDA oversees fruits  vegetables  and other food products  In response to several major E  coli outbreaks in beef in the mid 1990  s  the USDA stepped up enforcement efforts  which are credited with reducing the frequency of E  coli outbreaks in meat and poultry        Unfortunately  FDA oversight has been inadequate in protecting fruits and vegetables from contamination and has dramatically reduced the number of produce inspections  There are less than 2 000 FDA inspectors for over 12 000 facilities  and there are currently over 200 fewer inspectors than there were in 2003  According to the New York Times  produce related outbreaks of disease rose to 86 in 2004 from 29 in 1997   Adding to the problem is an increased amount of food imports and greater consumption  and wider domestic distribution  of fresh cut fruits and vegetables    intended to be consumed raw  unlike meat products where the bacteria can be killed through proper cooking       While the USDA conducts thousands of inspections in a matter of days  the number of food inspections conducted by the FDA have dropped from 50 000 in 1972 to less than 4 500 in 2005  leaving U S  food processors to be inspected only once every 10 years on average  In addition  the USDA requires that all animals be inspected before and after slaughter and that every meat processing plant in the country be inspected daily  while the FDA has no such requirements of the produce industry        This fractured approach has left the nation  s produce vulnerable to contamination  Furthermore  the FDA lacks the power to order recalls  The CDC estimates that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year  Of those individuals  approximately 325 000 will be hospitalized and more than 5 000 will die  Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to foodborne pathogens        Today  Schumer announced his intention to reintroduce comprehensive food safety legislation that would overhaul federal oversight of the food supply at the start of the next Congress in January  The Food Safety Act  S  729   authored by Senator Richard Durbin  D IL  and co sponsored by Schumer would            Make one new federal agency responsible for food safety monitoring  The legislation would give the agency recall authority  require food processing plants to implement procedures to prevent and reduce food contamination  require regular inspection of domestic food facilities with frequency based on risk  and prioritize federal food safety efforts and deployment of resources to achieve the greatest possible benefit in reducing food borne illness            Establish requirements for a national system for tracing food and food producing animals from point of origin to retail sale         Establish new  regular inspection protocols for vegetable processing plants
