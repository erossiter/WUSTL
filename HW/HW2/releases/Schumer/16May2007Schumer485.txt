IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 16  2007 Schumer Announces Stalled Navy Contract Won By Rome Research Will Finally Begin This Month                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Just Three Weeks Ago  Schumer Fired Shots Over Navy s Bow Urging it to Quit Dragging its Feet and Finalize its Contract with RRC   Rome Company Won Competition to Perform Critical Navy Functions Last October  but the Navy Had Inexplicably Pulled Back   Schumer  Our Message was Heard Loud and Clear  and Now a Robust RRC Can Put Oneida Residents to Work                            Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that the Department of the Navy will finalize its contract with the Rome Research Corporation  RRC   locking up a coveted contract for the company and its 200 local employees  Today s announcement came three weeks after Schumer pressured the Navy to immediately finalize the contract  which had stalled following RRC winning the competitive bidding process in October 2006  RRC will now manage and oversee certain operations of the elite Naval Satellite Operations Center  NAVSOC       We fired some warning shots over the Navy s bow and they did the right thing and will finalize the contract with Rome Research  Rome Research won the contract fair and square and jumped through every required hurdle  I am pleased that now they will be able to put people to work on this vital national security endeavor   said Senator Schumer   Today s news is terrific for the entire Oneida County community and means that a key local company will remain dynamic and generate good paying jobs   added Schumer    In a letter today from BJ Penn  Assistant Secretary for Installations and Environment  the Navy announced its intention to finalize the contract and allow RRC to commence work by the end of May  2007  Although RRC won the competitive bidding process in October 2006  the Navy frustratingly failed to provide the requisite Congressional Notification that represented the last hurdle before the contract could begin   In January  2007  RRC was officially awarded the contract to manage and oversee certain operations of the Naval Satellite Operations Center  NAVSOC   This  33 million performance decision was made after a competitive bidding process during which RRC demonstrated that they could perform the NAVSOC functions for 11  less than the Navy  providing a  4 3 million savings to the government  As part of the Navy s A 76 competitive sourcing process  RRC spent over a year working with the Navy  making 9 different submissions to the department to demonstrate that they could do the work effectively and at a lower cost than the government     In an effort to push the Navy to complete the deal  on April 25  2007  Schumer sent a personal letter to the Secretary of the Navy  Donald C  Winter calling for the Navy to move forward with the contract  In his letter  Schumer wrote   In order for the contract to commence  it is my understanding that the Navy must now provide congressional notification of the award   As the award was made over 6 months ago  I would urge you to do this with all due speed          Under the terms of the award  Rome Research Corporation would be charged with managing four existing facilities operated by NAVSOC  including outlets in Port Magu  California  Colorado Springs  Colorado  Bangor  Maine and  Finegayan  Guam  NAVSOC is responsible for operating  managing and maintaining a variety of strategically important satellite systems on behalf of the Navy  These satellites provide critical information and intelligence gathering resources  as well as navigational and logistical support to military outposts throughout the globe      Overall management of NAVSOC would be performed in Rome  NY  RRC has approximately 600 employees around the world and 200 in New York  They currently provide support functions to several Department of Defense projects throughout the United States and around the world   This A 76 contract would provide work for existing employees and allow RRC to hire 10 new managers      Since the initial decision  this contract has received  and stood up to  the utmost scrutiny both before and after it was rewarded  After the contract was granted a protest was filed by an Agency Tender Official with the General Accounting Office  GAO  objecting to the deal  The GAO dismissed this protest   As recently as last Friday  April 20th  an internal investigation by the Navy again cleared RRC to undertake this work
