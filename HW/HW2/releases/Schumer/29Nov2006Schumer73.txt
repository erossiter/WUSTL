IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 29  2006 Schumer  Army Corps To Dredge East Rockaway Inlet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In Response to Schumer  s Request Yesterday  the Army Corps has Agreed to Reprogram the Funds Necessary to Immediately Dredge the Inlet   With Winter Fast Approaching Oil Prices on Long Island Could Skyrocket if the Inlet Cannot Sustain Shipping   Dangerous conditions at East Rockaway  Jones  and other Long Island Inlets Threaten Costs of Home and School Heating Oil  Oil to Fuel P In light of the fact that a 281 foot tanker carrying 672 000 gallons of heating oil ran aground in East Rockaway earlier this month rendering the inlet unusable for fuel delivery  today Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Army Corps to immediately reprogram funding and expedite sorely needed dredging at the inlet  East Rockaway is a major route for the delivery of home heating oil    oil to schools and municipalities  diesel fuel  and oil for power plants throughout Long Island  including the nearby E F  Barrett power station in Island Park  Without immediate dredging the inlet cannot sustain the barges that come through to deliver oil  If barges cannot use the inlet energy costs could skyrocket on Long Island         As of now barges can  t deliver much needed home heating oil via the inlet  and without dredging the inlet will be unusable  driving the cost of heating homes on Long Island way up  With winter on our doorstep dredging the inlet will be a win win for Long Island  We will be able to keep the cost of home heating at bay and make inlets safer for fishing  boating  navigation and emergency response       On November 10th the tanker  Kristin Poling  got stuck in East Rockaway Inlet at the entry point to Reynolds Channel about 450 yards from shore  The channel is a major route for fuel tankers and the Kristin Poling frequently travels to the Sprague Energy terminal in Oceanside which supplies oil for western Long Island  The channel  however  is only 12 feet deep and requires frequent dredging due to shifting shoals  According to a measurement taken by the ACOE this past spring  the inlet was filled with sand 5 5 feet higher than it was after it was last dredged in 2004  After receiving bids to dredge  the Army Corps is now approximately  500 000 short in funding  Schumer said that money must be reprogrammed immediately and dredging expedited  For a high priority area such as this  an indefinite delay would be devastating  Here  as is the case with numerous inlets throughout Long Island  both the Army Corps and Coast Guard agree that unsafe and inadequate conditions threaten economic activity  commercial and recreational fishing and boating  navigation  and emergency response       According to reports  this is the second time in less than two years  and the third time in the last four years  that the same barge has run aground in the same area  On December 3rd  2004  the vessel was carrying 756 000 gallons of home heating oil before it nearly spilled  prompting temporary restrictions on fuel barges in the area  In this most recent incident  the tanker was making a heating oil delivery to Sprague Energy s terminal  Several hundred thousand gallons of heating oil had to be transferred to another barge to lighten the tanker so it could be free of the sandbar  The significance of this event is not only the effect it has on home heating oil deliveries  but also that K Sea Transportation uses the same inlet to make residual oil deliveries to the E  F  Barrett power station        This near disaster is the second that we have nearly averted in as many years  It is only a matter of time until our luck runs out and these aren  t just stuck barges  they are large scale oil spills     Schumer said    This is a classic example of an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure    we must dredge East Rockaway inlet and others now  before it is too late         The bottom line is that the shutdown of the Oceanside terminal would have a negative impact on oil prices  Prices would certainly go up for consumers across the board     said Kevin Rooney  CEO of the Oil Heat Institute of Long Island         I want to thank Senator Schumer for his quick response to a critical regional energy infrastructure issue  As a major route for oil deliveries to heat homes and schools  and fuel power plants  the inlet must be kept safe and reliable     Bob Catell  Chairman and CEO of KeySpan         Thanks to the great work of the Coast Guard  a catastrophe was averted in the East Rockaway inlet   However  another similar incident could provoke an Island wide environmental and economic crisis unless changes to our inlets are made     said Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy  I look forward to working with Senator Schumer  the Coast Guard  and the Army Corps of Engineers to secure the funding needed to solve this problem before a grounded tanker causes real damage to one of our inlets and the surrounding community          The E F  Barrett power station is a dual fuel fired facility using either natural gas or residual fuel oil  During the year  it generally burns natural gas because it is more economic and available  However  during the winter months  November through March  when the weather is extremely cold  natural gas is expensive and sometimes unavailable for use at the power station  When this situation occurs  oil is needs to be burned  Schumer said today that is imperative that the Barrett Station is able to receive oil deliveries via barge to replenish its oil supply       Both the vessel operator and Sprague Energy have expressed serious reservations about attempting to deliver the oil through this impassable inlet again  Alternatives such as trucking from longer distances or making fewer shipments are potentially cost prohibitive to the companies or devastating to consumers  It is rather likely that Sprague  s Oceanside terminal will be shut down entirely and have a devastating impact on supply and cost        If oil cannot travel through the inlet  costs for home and school heating oil  diesel fuel  and oil to fuel power plants will rise  If there are no available supplies out of the Oceanside terminal  there will be a major supply and price problem that will be particularly pronounced in the upcoming winter months  These shipments account for anywhere between 10 20  of the heating oil sold on a daily basis to central and south Nassau County  According to Sprague Energy 60 different local resellers are supplied from Oceanside with 40 000 000 gallons per year distributed and 50 000 homes served       If oil cannot be transported via East Rockaway  KeySpan estimates this could result in  500 000 in higher costs per day  Moreover  the loss of the ability to use residual fuel oil due to a lack of deliveries at Barrett could increase costs by  8  12 million per year which would likely be passed on to consumers  Additionally  if natural gas were also unavailable  the station may not be able to generate any electricity at all  Barrett supplies 10  of the on island steam powered electric generation and is critical in the reliability of the Long Island electric system       While the inadequate conditions at East Rockaway has jeopardized its capacity to receive oil barges  other inlets throughout Long Island are in equally poor shape  Despite the obvious negative impacts on erosion  navigation  commercial and recreational fishing  boating  and most importantly  emergency response  the country does not give the issue the attention it demands  The USCG has faced serious problems in responding to incidents at Jones Inlet  Problems also plague Fire Island  Shinnecock  and Moriches Inlets       In a letter to the Army Corps  Schumer wrote   This problem has flown under the radar for far too long  Without permanent curative measures and a long term plan  the situation will only worsen on Long Island  I urge the ACOE to work with the USCG and my office in creating a new program to address these concerns  It is vital that a real plan with a different funding mechanism be implemented to allow the ACOE to prioritize and take action at inlets and shallow draft harbors throughout the region          In an effort to ensure that waterways crucial to the economic health of Long Island remain usable as an essential short term solution Schumer requested that the Army Corps reprogram funding to make up the shortfall and dredge on an expedited basis  He also said that the 2 year dredging cycle should be changed to an annual cycle  For the long term  the Senator called on the ACOE to work with the USCG in creating a new permanent and fully funded Regional Inlets Program to reassess the conditions and problems at every single inlet  the appropriate dredging cycles  the funding needed on a consistent basis  and then provide recommendations for new curative measures        With Long Island energy consumers facing the prospect of higher prices  boaters facing untenable waters  and the USCG facing obstructed emergency response  immediate action and permanent solutions are critical     Schumer said    Schumer was joined by Bob Catell  Chairman and CEO of KeySpan  Lt  Commander Alan Blume  United States Coast Guard  Steven Levy  Sprague Energy  and Kevin Rooney  CEO of the Oil Heat Institute of Long Island
