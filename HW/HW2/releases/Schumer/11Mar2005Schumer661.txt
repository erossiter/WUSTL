IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 11  2005 Schumer Collins  15 Senators Demand U S  Take Stronger Action Against Saudis For Egregious Violations Of Religious Freedoms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bipartisan  Sent in Anticipation of March 15th Deadline for State Dept  to Act on Saudi Religious Freedom Violations    Freedom House Report Reveals Saudi Government Exports Extremist Religious Teachings in America Today  Senators Charles Schumer  D NY  and Susan Collins  R ME  were joined by thirteen colleagues from both sides of the aisle in sending a  to Secretary Condoleezza Rice to express appreciation for the Department of State  s 2004 designation of Saudi Arabia as a   country of particular concern     CPC  for its systematic  ongoing  and egregious violations of religious freedom  The Senators also expressed a strong desire to see the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia defined more clearly  This letter was sent in anticipation of the March 15 deadline for the State Department to act on their own 2004 designation of Saudi Arabia as a severe violator of religious freedom as defined by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998       Sen  Schumer said    It is a massive contradiction that a country we call an ally could be both so regressive in their own country and so brazen in its propagation of anti American  anti women  anti Semitic books  publications  and practices  American security is undermined as the Saudi government exports these hateful commodities to millions beyond its borders  planting the seeds for new generations of terrorists and totalitarian Wahhabi leaders            This report raises some disturbing concerns about the spread of extremist materials in American mosques and Islamic centers     Senator Collins said    If we are going to win the war on terrorism  these types of actions cannot be tolerated  It is important that the Saudi Arabian government join us in this fight and stop supporting the spread of ideologies that promote hatred and intolerance around the world          The Schumer Collins bi partisan  refers in part to the Freedom House  s Center for Religious Freedom report which gathered vast amounts of Saudi government publications on the ideology of hate in America  as well as Saudi intolerance towards its own citizens        Samples of over 200 books and other publications from American mosques used to educate its members that preach a   Nazi like hatred for Jews    and   promote contempt for the United States because it is ruled by legislated civil law rather than by totalitarian Wahhabi style Islamic law           One such document  distributed through the Saudi Arabian Embassy  s Cultural Dept  in Washington  is a fatwa against the taking of American citizenship by Muslims and thereby   acquiescing to their infidelity and accepting all their erroneous ways           The report explicitly concludes that Saudi Arabia is the state most responsible for the propagation of these publications within our borders and that these publications are often official publications of a Saudi ministry or distributed by the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington  D C  to mosques and Islamic centers in American cities        Recent municipal elections completely shut women out of the process  Saudi Arabia severely limits the freedom of movement of women and discriminates against women in education  employment  access to healthcare  marriage  and inheritance       The Senators urge Sec  Rice to   to persuade the Saudi Arabian government to work with the United States in curtailing their distribution      and call for specific actions taken to condemn and curtail Saudi Arabian support for extremist ideology  promote equality and reform within Saudi Arabia  and to clearly outline a broad based foreign policy strategy that will support these goals          In agreement with and in support of the U S  Commission on International Religious Freedom  the Schumer Collins letter also calls for the State Department   to respond decisively to Saudi support for extremist religious ideologies    as required by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for countries found to be severe violators of religious freedom  by        Identifying Saudi agencies and officials responsible for violations of religious freedom and issuing a proclamation barring Saudi officials who propagate hateful and intolerant ideology from entering the U S         Issuing a demarche urging the government of Saudi Arabia to cease support for activities throughout the world that explicitly promote hate and human rights violations        Ordering the heads of U S  agencies not to issue licenses or authorities for the export of items on the Commerce Control List of dual use items to an agency or instrument of the government of Saudi Arabia that is responsible for committing particularly severe violations of religious freedom        Raise concerns at the highest levels with the government of Saudi Arabia regarding the ongoing and repeated violations of internationally recognized human rights and to develop specific initiatives to advance human rights  including the rights of women  religious freedom  and the rule of law       The letter concluded    Saudi Arabia  s efforts to export militant Wahhabi ideology throughout the world inflame the type of anti American sentiments that lie behind the potential of terrorist attacks that continue to be the greatest threat to our national security  Therefore  it is essential that Saudi Arabia be held accountable for its support of radical Islamic ideology          The Senators signing the letter are   Schumer  Collins  Bayh  Chambliss  Smith  Brownback  Ensign
