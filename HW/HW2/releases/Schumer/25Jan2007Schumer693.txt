IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 25  2007 Schumer Calls On Norfolk Southern To Pay For Rail Infrastructure Improvements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    NS Must Follow Through on Its Commitment to Put Up  375 000 to Secure Viaducts Carrying Trains Through Downtown Elmira    Support Could Release  1 million in Additional Funding   As Norfolk Southern Increases Freight Rail Speeds From 30 To 50 MPH  Old And Decaying Infrastructure Must Be Updated Immediately U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called on Norfolk Southern President Charles W  Moorman to pay for vital infrastructure improvements in Elmira after its unilateral decision to permit their freight trains to increase their travel speed from 30 to 50 mph   Schumer  who voiced concerns over the increased speeds in populated areas  said that Norfolk Southern needs to do whatever it takes to prevent a derailment and ensure that the city  s infrastructure can handle the higher speeds   Elmira officials and citizens believe that several viaducts and overpasses are too old and decayed to accommodate this speed increase       If Norfolk Southern is going to have its trains speeding through Elmira  then they need to step up to make sure they roll through safely    and that the tracks they run on can handle it     Schumer said     That means moving now to spend the money they have pledged to fix up decaying infrastructure  Some of these trains are carrying hazardous materials and we cannot risk the possibility of an accident if these old overpasses and viaducts can  t support this speed   I am glad to see NS step up to the plate  but now they need to follow through        Schumer said the viaducts that the faster trains would be passing over are 75 years old with little or no maintenance done to the underside   Right now  there is spilled concrete  exposed reinforcing and failed drainage systems all along the system   In a personal phone call between Norfolk Southern representatives and Elmira officials  Norfolk Southern said it would invest  375 000 to improve the infrastructure along the route     Schumer  along with Elmira Mayor John S  Tonello  said that  300 000 of the  375 000 promised could be leveraged in to  1 million total for improvements  Specifically   300 000 of the NS contribution could be used as local matching funding to release a  1 25 million federal transportation enhancement grant that is available to the City  In November  the City received a  1 25 million federal Transportation Enhancement grant for the Elmira Promenade Project   The first phase of the project aims to restore the viaduct between Water and Second streets by cleaning it  repairing chipped and cracked areas  applying a modern weather resistant coating  and improving lighting and signage       By applying  300 000 of the money Norfolk Southern intends to spend in 2007 to this project  the City would have access to an additional  1 million in federal and local funds   In order to make this work  the City and Norfolk Southern would enter into an agreement whereby Norfolk Southern would contribute  300 000 to the City  which the City would then immediately dedicate to Phase I of the Promenade Project   This would help us fulfill our local portion of the project and give us access to  712 500 of the  1 25 million federal grant     In his letter  Schumer asked Charles W  Moorman  Chairman  President and CEO of Norfolk Southern Corporation  to ensure that NS follow through quickly and completely on that promise and exceed that amount if repairs warrant    While I am disappointed that Norfolk Southern will not be reducing the speed of its trains back to the original 30 miles per hour  I am encouraged by your Good Neighbor policies and hope you will follow through by investing in Elmira  s future        Norfolk Southern operates freight only elevated route through the Elmira community  which sometimes carries hazardous materials   In September  Norfolk Southern announced that it would increase the speed of its trains traveling through Elmira  from 30 mph to 50 mph  in order to remain competitive  That same month  Schumer urged Moorman to send a representative to Elmira to meet with city officials  hear their concerns regarding freight train speed and work with community leaders to find an equitable solution to this situation   In October  a block of Railroad Avenue had to be closed after a piece of concrete fell off a viaduct as a Norfolk Southern train passed overhead   In light of these infrastructural dangers  city officials have expressed concern about the possible risks associated with these higher speeds to rail cars carrying hazardous waste through Elmira     Freight trains traveling throughout New York State could pose many safety risks  Last month  two tanker cars carrying butane derailed in Gang Mills   Though the tanker cars did not leak the hazardous chemicals  local first responders reported that the cars were highly unstable because the gravel that supports the track had been damaged   Several employees were evacuated from the scene   Had the chemicals leaked  the accident could have been very dangerous   This accident is one of a slew of derailments that have occurred in upstate New York in just the last few weeks     Schumer is the author of The Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act which would set tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology   The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and require the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents
