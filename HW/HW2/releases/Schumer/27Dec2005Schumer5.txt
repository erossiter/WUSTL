IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 27  2005 Schumer  Oldest  Most Vulnerable Seniors In Rochester Nursing Homes Hit Hardest By Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Confusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Medicare Plan Automatically Enrolls Some Seniors In Plans Without Notifying Nursing Home  Assigned Plan Might Not Even Work At Nursing Home Pharmacy  Some Residents Without Caregiver Can  t Change Enrollment   Typical Nursing Home Resident Is 84 Years Old  Has Eight Significant Health Problems And Takes Nine Medications  Medicare Plan Tells Nursing Home Operators To Give 800 Number To Residents With approximately 7 000 nursing home residents in the grater Rochester area  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that as confusing as the new Medicare drug plan is for healthy seniors  confusing regulations and arbitrary enrollments make it nearly impossible for nursing home residents and operators to get the right plans  For the two thirds of nursing home residents who are both Medicaid Medicare eligible  the problems are stark  Many of these people are randomly enrolled in plans without the knowledge or participation of the nursing home medical staff or pharmacies  Often the randomly selected plan might not cover all the drugs that a particular resident needs  Many nursing homes operate their own pharmacies and residents have been assigned to plans that do not include their pharmacies  Many isolated residents without a authorized decision maker nearby can  t even change their plan to a more appropriate one  To make matters worse  nursing home operators are prohibited from giving residents recommendations about which plan to enroll in          While the new Medicare prescription drug plan is bad enough for healthy  educated seniors  it  s total chaos for the most vulnerable seniors living in nursing homes     Schumer said    For almost two thirds of nursing home residents  it appears that some Medicare computer in Washington automatically picks a plan for a senior without regard for what drugs they take or what drugs the pharmacy at the nursing home they live in can provide  To make matters worse Medicare tells nursing home operators to give an 800 number or website to some of the very seniors who need help eating  getting dressed  and moving around  These regulations border on insanity and seem almost intentionally designed to throw our long term care facilities into total disarray  I  m writing to the Center for Medicare Services and demand they immediately streamline the process for long term care facilities          Across the United States here are about 18 000 nursing homes in the United States  about 2 million nursing home residents  In Monroe County approximately 20 000 seniors are Medicare Medicaid dual eligible  over 4 500 of whom live in nursing homes        The New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging said that    Medicare Part D is creating a tidal wave of concern on the part of nursing home residents  their families and the providers who are trying to serve and protect those in their care          Dual Medicare Medicaid Eligible Seniors  Roughly two thirds of nursing home residents are   dual eligibles    meaning that they qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare  Starting at the beginning of the year  all of these dual eligibles will have the new Medicare drug plan paying for drug coverage instead of Medicaid  Medicaid has previously covered drugs for dual eligibles   Current dual eligible nursing home residents must enroll in a Medicare drug plan before Jan  1 or the Center for Medicare Services  CMS  will automatically  and randomly  enroll in one of possibly dozens of plans in their area  Nursing homes often only have one pharmacy that serves the residents of the nursing home  If a beneficiary is automatically enrolled in a plan that does not work with the nursing home pharmacy  come Jan  1  that beneficiary will not have access to drug coverage        Most nursing home residents are on an average of 8 drugs  All 8 drugs would need to be covered by the plan a nursing home resident is enrolled in  this is unlikely to happen if a beneficiary is randomly assigned to one of fifteen plan  Furthermore  because of CMS guidelines  nursing homes must search online or fax a request to CMS to ascertain what plan the residents have been auto enrolled in  This request takes up for 10 days for CMS to process       Restrictions On Nursing Home Operators  CMS guidelines prohibit nursing home staff providers pharmacists from   steering    their residents to specific plans  Nursing homes have been instructed to use toll free numbers and internet resources  A typical nursing home resident is 84 years of age  suffers from eight different diseases and is on nine medications at any given time  Over half of all nursing home residents have some level of cognitive impairment  Many of these elderly  sick residents do not have a local friend or family member to assist them in this choice  However despite the isolation  illness  and mental impairments of many nursing home residents  nursing home staff are unable to help each resident find the right plan for them  Nursing home staff are told to give their aged  infirm residents the 800 number and Medicare website  Seniors without healthy attentive relatives have no outlet for help        Today  Schumer sent a letter to CMS asking the department to for certain changes to expedite the Part D enrollment process for nursing home residents and operators  Those changes include            Establish a dedicated hotline for nursing home providers to expedite nursing home requests for information on their residents        Prevent CMS from auto enrolling nursing home residents in random plans  Increase coordination between CMS and nursing homes to choose the most comprehensive plan available in that area  and use that plan as the default for auto enrollment for those residents        Require nursing homes to ensure that their residents   medications are covered in their plans   formularies and that their plans allow for participation with dedicated long term care pharmacies         Allow long term care facility health providers or social workers more flexibility in helping a resident to choose a plan       Provide reimbursement to nursing home providers for time spent advocating for their residents
