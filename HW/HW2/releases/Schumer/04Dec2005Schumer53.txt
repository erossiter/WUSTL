IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 4  2005 In Wake Of Tragic Death Of Police Officer With Stolen Gun  Schumer Calls For Reinstating Gun Tracing Laws To Shut Down Rogue Gun Traffickers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     92   of the illegal handguns recovered in New York City from 1988 2003 were from out of state   Schumer also calls for federal legislation requiring law enforcement officials to report all stolen guns and guns used in crime to the ATF  gun used this week was stolen in Florida over 6 years ago and was used in another Brooklyn shooting 6 months ago    Schumer stands with policemen  vows to introduce legislation As just this week a policeman was killed by a stolen gun that had been used in a crime only six months ago  but stolen over 6 years ago  today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called for a law that will allow more access to gun tracing data  he also called for a mandatory reporting of stolen guns and guns that were used in crimes to the ATF database  Currently the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms  ATF  National Tracing Center  NTC  has the data on where each reported stolen gun originates and its path into the wrong hands  But  because of a stealth amendment that was slipped into an appropriations bill last year and renewed this year  the ATF can not share much of the information which makes it more difficult to identify and shut down gun sellers  purchasers and possessors and most importantly  traffickers of stolen guns across state lines         It doesn t take a rocket scientist to realize that more illegal guns mean more gun crimes  And this week s death was tragic reminder of the devastation these crimes bring to entire communities   Schumer said   The ability to trace a gun after a crime is committed helps us solve it  but excessive restrictions placed on access to the data ties our hands in preventing any of these violent crimes from taking place         Gun tracing serves two main purposes  Aside from being able retrace the history of a gun that is connected to a crime after it is committed  it helps to identify patterns of illegal gun trafficking and shut down rogue gun traffickers who are responsible from running guns illegally from state to state  Through tracing  law enforcement can find trends of multiple sales of firearms to buyers and look for patterns of theft from licensed gun dealers  Multiple traces to the same dealer or buyer are generally can help police find exactly who is responsible for mass quantities of guns crossing state lines  By looking at the full picture of traces and the patterns that emerge  law enforcement is able to find opportunities to stop gun running on the supply side of the gun market  before they are run all over the country       By tracing guns law enforcement is able to identify buyers  sellers  and possessors of guns and is able to identify a  straw purchaser     someone who can legally buy a firearm and is hired by someone who either is prohibited by law from doing so or does not want to be traced  Straw purchasers are usually linked to gun trafficking and identifying them and stopping them brings down gun trafficking enormously  Both dealers of large quantities of guns used in crimes and purchasers can be tracked over time and stopped through tracing databases        Until 2003 the information in the ATF s National Tracing Center was available to the public and to law enforcement but in the 2005 Commerce Justice Science appropriations bill  Congressman Todd Tiahrt from Kansas slipped a stealth amendment in to limit access to the tracing information  As a result of this amendment  the ATF is prohibited from releasing information about where guns have originated from which severely impedes gun crime prevention         The bottom line is  the Tiahrt Amendment has put an enormous wrench in stopping gun trafficking before it starts   Schumer said   Now the police can only trace certain guns after a crime is committed which doesn t do anything to fix the bigger problem of having countless illegal guns on our streets  We need to stop the problem where it starts and because of this stealth and reckless amendment  our hands are tied         Today Schumer also called for federal legislation requiring law enforcement officials to report all stolen guns and guns used in crime to the ATF database for tracing  New York has a law requiring New York law enforcement to report guns used in crime to the ATF  The gun that was used in the crime this week was stolen from Florida but had never been reported  Florida law does not require that  Enacting reporting requirements  such as the ones required in New York  for all 50 states would ensure that guns used to commit crimes would be traced to find out how they made their way to the scene of the crime       In addition  Schumer called for legislation that would        Allocate additional funding for ATF to give the agency the resources it needs to effectively investigate rogue gun dealers across the country         Give ATF discretion over the number of inventory inspections it conducts on gun dealers  Current regulations allow ATF only one such inspection visit per year         Increase the maximum penalty for gun trafficking from ten to twenty years         Make federal gun trafficking laws a predicate offense for prosecution under the RICO law  giving law enforcement the same tools to prosecute gun traffickers that it currently has to fight organized crime        According to the ATF  there were 5 766 guns submitted to the ATF for tracing in the calendar year 2004  This includes both long and hand guns  and all guns seized by combined state and local law enforcement agencies  According to New York City sources  92  of the illegal handguns recovered in New York City from 1988 2003 were from out of state sources  The top five states for origination of illegal handguns in New York City were Virginia  Florida  Georgia  South Carolina  North Carolina  Shootings and gun arrests have declined in New York City over the last three years  but there were still almost 1400 shootings in New York City in 2004 and 3 826 gun arrests  Between 2002 2004  there have been over 4500 shootings and almost 12 000 gun arrests        Senator Schumer stood with Pat Lynch  President of the Patrolman  s Benevolent Association
