Assistance to Fire Depa U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced that the Capital Region has received four federal grants totaling  176 587 from the FY06 Assistance to Firefighters Grant  AFG  Program administered by the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS    The Town of Colonie Department of EMS in Albany County will receive a  53 664 grant  Onesquethaw Volunteer Fire Company  Inc  in Albany County will receive a  77 733 grant  and Tribes Hill Fire Department  Inc  in Montgomery County will receive a  25 315 grant   All three grants will be used to improve operations and safety and are part of the seventh round of DHS FY06 AFG program awards to several fire departments throughout the country   The East Greenbush Fire District   3 in Rensselaer County has received a  19 875 Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response  SAFER  Award for firefighter recruitment and retention as part of the ninth around of SAFER Awards      This funding will go a long way in supporting the first responders in the Capital Region   said Schumer   We can never truly repay our firefighters and first responders for their heroic efforts and dedication to duty   However  we can ensure that they have the training  equipment and resources they need to do their job well   This money will also help fire departments continue to recruit and train new volunteers that bravely serve our communities by keeping them safe       Schumer was among the first senators who recognized the need for the federal government to establish a funding program for local governments and fire departments to help defray the rising costs of equipment and fire prevention  Since its inception in 2001  the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program has delivered over  122 million to New York s fire departments     For Fiscal Year 2007  Congress has authorized  1 billion for the program   707 million more than the  293 million included in the Administration s budget proposal  The FY07 DHS Appropriations bill  passed by the House and Senate  appropriated  662 million for firefighter assistance grants  of which  115 million will go toward SAFER Act grants     The Operations and Firefighter Safety Program funds will go towards training  equipment  personal protective equipment  wellness and fitness  and modifications to fire stations and facilities     The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  AFGP  assists local fire departments in programs and activities to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations through specialized emergency training for response to situations like terrorist attacks  enhancement of emergency medical services programs  development of health and safety initiatives  establishment of fire education and prevention programs  creation of wellness and fitness programs  and equipment and facility upgrades      The goal of the SAFER program is to enhance the ability of grantees to attain and maintain 24 hour staffing and to assure that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire related hazards   The objective of the Recruitment and Retention of Volunteer Firefighters activity is to create a more favorable working environment for volunteer firefighters   Such an environment would encourage current volunteers to continue with their volunteerism as well as entice new volunteers to join   Ultimately  it is hoped that the recruitment and retention activity will create a net increase in the number of trained  certified  and competent firefighters capable of safely responding to emergencies likely to occur within the fire department  s geographic response area   The primary focus of this activity is to enlist and or retain volunteer firefighters who are trained in the operations of firefighting and emergency response     This grant ensures that the firefighters in the Capital Region continue to have the basic resources they require to do their jobs  improve safety and save lives  said Schumer   Local fire departments have been strained from budget cuts  rising costs of equipment and stress from being on heightened alert because of the war on terrorism   These funds are truly a life saving investment that will provide local fire departments with essential resources and support  so they can be better prepared for emergencies      The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in cooperation with the Department s United States Fire Administration  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to the applicants that most closely address the program s priorities and demonstrate financial need   For more information on the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  please visit the website at
