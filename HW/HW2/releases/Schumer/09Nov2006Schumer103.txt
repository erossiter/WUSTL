IMMEDIATE RELEASE  November 9  2006 Schumer Demands DHS Keep Buffalo Niagara As High Risk Area    Eligible For Federal High Threat Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Department Of Homeland Security Is Set To Announce UASI Eligibility As Early As Next Week   Schumer  Given Multiple High Risk Factors in WNY  There Is No Excuse For Excluding Region From Grant Program                                                                                                                                                                                               U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today demanded that the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  keep the Greater Buffalo Niagara region as a high risk area and therefore eligible for federal high threat funding under the FY 2007 Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI    DHS is set to announce eligibility and guidance for applications as early as next week   Schumer said that it is imperative that the Buffalo Niagara area be deemed eligible in recognition of the threats that face this border area  its vulnerability to terrorist attack  the history of nascent terror networks in the area  and in adjacent border areas   and the critical importance of its assets       Greater Buffalo Niagara is a high risk area  and the federal government has a responsibility to help secure the region     Schumer said    This year the Buffalo area is at risk of losing altogether its access to UASI funding  Given the multiple high risk factors in this are  there is no excuse for excluding the Greater Buffalo Niagara area from this grant program for which it should properly be eligible        The Buffalo Niagara area contains numerous assets that are vulnerable to attack and are critically important to the state and the nation  Buffalo is home to a busy border crossing with Canada that provides a port of entry into the United States for 13 million people a year and approximately  300 million in goods  This commercial and tourist traffic flows across four international bridges    the Peace Bridge  the Rainbow Bridge  the Queenston Lewiston Bridge and the Whirlpool Bridge    all of which are symbolically significant and present potential terrorist targets   Moreover  the nation  s highest concentration of hydroelectric power sources is located in this area  providing a major electricity source for the Eastern United States  The counties of Erie and Niagara and the City of Buffalo  combined  contain one nuclear facility and over 260 facilities that are considered   EPA Tier II    facilities based on the presence of significant hazardous chemicals or materials including chlorine  Finally  the region is home to the iconic Niagara Falls  visited by approximately 14 million people annually  These vital assets  clustered near a major international border crossing  are far from immune to terrorist threats  The area  s Joint Terrorism Task Force has informed local authorities of multiple credible threats that led to terrorism investigations  and the   Lackawanna Six    who pled guilty to terrorism related charges were arrested in the Buffalo area     In FY 2005  the Buffalo Niagara area was deemed high risk and then applied for and received UASI funding  In FY 2006  however  DHS determined that Buffalo Niagara was one of 11 candidate areas that were not eligible for UASI funds under the new risk analysis used by the Department  Only one other border region among the candidate areas was deemed ineligible in FY 2006  Last year  s DHS decision to overlook the Buffalo Niagara area was especially shocking given that other areas with less apparent risk  such as Kansas City  MO  remained eligible   Local representatives have expressed concern that DHS misapplied its own risk analysis methodology in FY 2006  and that these inaccuracies affected the outcome of the eligibility determination   Fortunately  last year  s UASI determination that Buffalo Niagara was not high risk did not have immediate consequences because the Buffalo Niagara area was still able to receive sustained funding in FY 2006   This year  there is no such protection      Schumer today urged DHS to evaluate the Buffalo Niagara area with great care to ensure that FY 2007 UASI eligibility  which is a prerequisite for the federal funding so desperately needed by our threatened urban areas  is determined in a way that is fair and accurate according to the rules set out by the Department  At a briefing on September 25  2006  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff explained his philosophy regarding the distribution of homeland security grants as follows    First and foremost  to the extent the law permits  we use risk as the basis for giving money out  And risk is a combination of what the threat is  what the vulnerability is and what the consequences would be of a successful attack     Schumer said that according to each of these criteria  the Buffalo Niagara area is unquestionably among the nation  s highest risk urban areas and should be eligible to apply for UASI funds      In a personal letter to Chertoff  Schumer wrote    I have no doubt that the high risk Buffalo Niagara area deserves access to Federal UASI funding in FY 2007 and beyond to prevent and prepare for terrorist threats  As you are well aware  the burdens of securing our homeland since the attacks of 9 11 have fallen heavily on local authorities and agencies  The Federal government must help to shoulder these burdens  and when it does so  it must use a fair and accurate process to ensure that funding reaches those areas that are most at risk  I believe that if such a process is applied  it will clearly demonstrate that the Buffalo Niagara area should be eligible to seek UASI funding
