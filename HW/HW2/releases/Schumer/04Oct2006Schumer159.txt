IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 4  2006 Schumer Announces New Federal Financing Initiatives For Fort Drum And The Greater Watertown Community To Help Address Housing Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The Fort Drum Community Is Growing Dramatically Due To Military Personnel Shifts   In June  Schumer Demanded Fannie Mae Step Up To The Plate  And No It Is Delivering A Concrete Plan   Senator  This Is A Step In The Right Direction To Make Sure Housing Is Available and Affordable For The Community  Soldiers And Their Families U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced new federal financing initiatives for Fort Drum and the greater Watertown Community to help address the growing need for affordable and available housing   As a member of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee  Schumer has been working to provide the federal resources and expertise necessary to make sure affordable housing is in place for Ft  Drum  s new troops  their families  and the greater community at large   In January  Schumer attended the Fort Drum Housing Summit with local community and business leaders to address the impending influx of people into the community and its effects on housing  education  health care  and economic development   Then in June  Schumer called on federally chartered housing entities  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to develop concrete plans to help address the Fort Drum housing issues   Today  Schumer unveiled a strategy developed with Fannie Mae          Today  we have big news for the tens of thousands of soldiers and families stationed here at Fort Drum  the thousands more that are on their way  and the entire community in Watertown     Schumer said     Four months ago  I urged Fannie Mae to step up to the plate for the Fort Drum area  and now we are here announce its part of the solution for this housing challenge   We have reached a crossroads here in Watertown and Fannie Mae is going to help go down the right road   There is no doubt  that  this influx of military personnel will be a shot in the arm for the local economy  and now we are making sure that housing is available  safe  and affordable          Schumer and Fannie Mae designed a plan to provide off base housing options which expands homeownership  strengthens the communities and integrates soldiers and military personnel into the communities in which they live and serve  while addressing the entire region  s need for more housing   Fannie Mae has brought to the table financial tools and products that will help address the region s specific housing needs       Fannie Mae will be able to assist soldiers and military personnel interested in becoming home owners  through a program called My Community Mortgage  MCM   which makes home buying easier and more flexible   Three improvements have been made to make homeownership more affordable   This program will be available through M Mortgage Corporation and HSBC Bank   First  MCM will now allow 100  financing  or   0 down   payment    low cost financing   Second  mortgage insurance premiums have been reduced  and Fannie Mae will require the minimum levels allowed by its charter  Third  Fannie Mae is working with the Development Authority of the North Country  DANC  and Jefferson Community College in their development of   on base   home buyer education initiatives that will better inform people how to go about becoming home owners    At the Summit in January  it was decided that a resource that was strongly needed was funding for renovations  including the cost to administer such a program   According to the Army Corps of Engineers 68  of the housing in the Watertown area is substandard   Fannie Mae listened and responded  finding a way to incorporate that into their programs  To help soldiers and military personnel interested in renovating existing single family homes  Fannie Mae is working with Neighbors of Watertown  Inc   NWI  to offer special home renovation products    3 million will become available for the renovation of single family homes within the city of Watertown   This financing will be made available from National City Mortgage Corporation to NWI who will administer the program  Under this program special financing will be made available for home owners and home buyers who are interested in renovating their property   Fannie Mae is also providing a  20 000 grant to NWI to assist with the administration of the home renovation program           This is a strong first step  but we still have more to do   I am looking forward to continuing to working with my colleagues in Congress and our partners at Fannie Mae  and with all the local leaders on the ground to make sure there is a strong supply of affordable housing for decades to come   I have been working very hard to get this done  and anticipate making more announcements  just like this  in the near future     Schumer added       Last January  at the Watertown Fort Drum Housing Summit Conference  Schumer called upon the secondary housing markets  including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to devise a strategy to help bring financing solutions to meet the housing needs of the area   Since January  Schumer has been working with Fannie Mae and a number of stake holders on the development of an investment strategy to help meet the housing needs Fort Drum and the Watertown area   In June  Schumer and his staff sat down with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and asked them to create affordable mortgage products for military consumers in the Fort Drum area   Schumer also asked that they develop formal partnerships with area direct lenders including banks  credit unions and mortgage brokers  and requested they commit resources to create a homeownership education and financial literacy program for Fort Drum soldiers  their families  and the community  since this will be the first purchase of this size for many    Schumer and Fannie Mae have been working with many local stakeholders throughout the process including the Fort Drum Regional Liaison Organization  FDRLO   DANC  and NWI          In 2005  Congress passed and the President approved the expansion of troops assigned to Fort Drum under the BRAC process   These personnel shifts will increase the population of Fort Drum and Watertown by 10 000 individuals  which will add significantly to the need of new housing   Bringing more people to the area would presumably lead to greater economic development  increased retail sales  and a larger tax base  Without adequate housing  families could be discouraged from relocating limiting the positive economic impact       Schumer was joined by Congressman John McHugh  Mayor Jeffrey Graham  Robert Bannister of  Fannie Mae  Dr  John Deans of
