IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 25  2006 Schumer Reveals  Feds Have Reneged On Their Commitment To Provide Adequate Tamiflu Stockpiles

                                   HHS Is Planning to Purchase Tamiflu for Far Fewer Than the 100 million Americans that Need to Be Protected Against Bird a Potential Flu Pandemic   With Roche Living Up to Its Promise to Dramatically Increase Production Capacity  Schumer Calls on HHS to Make Good on its Commitment to Stockpile Enough Tamiflu for Americans Today U S  Senator Charles Schumer revealed that the federal government has reneged on its commitment to provide enough Tamiflu stockpiles to safeguard Americans from a potential bird flu pandemic  Schumer sent a letter to Michael Leavitt  Secretary of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   urging him to dramatically increase stockpiles for Tamiflu  the only anti viral currently available to treat Bird Flu  Schumer has been a leader in getting Roche Pharmaceuticals  the manufacturer  to increase Tamiflu production capacity and he has repeatedly urged the Federal government to stockpile enough of the bird flu anti viral treatment to cover at least 100 million Americans  which is how many people experts tell us the government should stockpile the treatment for  Schumer also helped to secure over  2 billion in federal funding for HHS specifically for pandemic preparations  but HHS has spent only a very small portion of those funds to stockpiling Tamiflu  leaving millions of Americans unprotected        Schumer said    The bottom line is that the Feds are falling way short of their commitment to protect Americans from a bird flu pandemic  HHS needs to significantly boost its Tamiflu orders so that they at least meet the minimum safeguards suggested by most experts    anti viral stockpiles to protect 100 million Americans          Schumer  s letter to Sec  Leavitt stressed that simply shifting the burden to states to purchase Tamiflu without full reimbursement undercuts their commitment to safeguard Americans with significant stockpiles  HHS has the funding to purchase enough antivirals  but under its new plan  it leaves the states with the expensive and difficult task of buying Tamiflu on its own  without full or quick reimbursement        And even worse  HHS is rebuffing questions from states that are trying to access the paltry 25  subsidy that HHS did promise  States have received more assistance from the manufacturer and a non profit organization  the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials  than they have from HHS       In recent weeks  bird flu has spread to Turkey which now has 21 reported cases  Most of the cases have been in children  All but two of the 21 confirmed human cases  it said  have involved children aged four to 18       The bird flu  knows as H5N1  has killed tens and maybe hundreds of millions of animals since it appeared in Asia in 1997 and has infected 120 people  killing half  The strain has been identified as a type A influenza virus which is both genetically versatile and able to elude a variety of defenses making it extraordinarily dangerous  This specific type of virus constantly changes as it replicates  Additionally H5N1 has never been a strain of flu before  so nobody has any form of immunity to this type of flu       Even birds that survive the infection excrete the virus for at least 10 days  orally and in feces  thereby facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by migratory birds  The spread of infection in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans  If more humans become infected over time  the likelihood also increases that humans  if infected with both human and avian influenza strains  could serve as the   mixing vessel    for the emergence of a new strain with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person  Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic       In October  Schumer provided the names of four companies to Mr  George Abercrombie  the CEO of Roche in the United States  Roche has reached agreements with two of those companies along with 13 other entities around the world  Roche agreed in October to sub license the production of Tamiflu to any of these companies that can produce it in quantities large enough to help meet the anticipated demand in case of a flu outbreak  and the determination as to who gets licensed will be made in cooperation with the U S  Government and other governments around the world        Schumer  s letter to Secretary Leavitt is below      January 25  2006      The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20201      Dear Secretary Leavitt       I am writing today to urge you to immediately provide clear guidance and assistance to states that wish to stockpile the antiviral Tamiflu in preparation for a potential avian flu pandemic  I am concerned that states seem to have received far more guidance from the manufacturer of Tamiflu and from a non profit association regarding this Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  initiative than from the Department itself       In the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza  HHS revealed an initiative to subsidize states for 25  of the cost of developing antiviral stockpiles  At that time  two impediments remained to enacting this initiative  ensuring that the Roche Pharmaceuticals    the sole manufacturer of the only antiviral currently known to be effective against avian flu   could produce an adequate supply  and providing appropriations to HHS for the subsidy       Both obstacles have since been removed  I have worked with Roche over the past several months to assist in forging partnerships with outside companies to fill gaps in its supply chain  and Congress appropriated  2 75 billion in the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations that the Secretary may use for avian flu vaccines  antivirals  and other necessary medical supplies  I wrote to you on December 23  asking you to immediately allocate  1 8 billion of that money for a federal antiviral stockpile  but have not heard back from you       Although I believe that an antiviral stockpile is a federal responsibility that should not be passed on to the states  we should ensure at the very least that states have the ability to access the 25  subsidy proposed in the National Strategy  However  I understand that New York  along with several other states  has been unable to access this subsidy or to receive any information from HHS as to how or when it may do so       Disturbingly  states have received much more information from Roche Pharmaceuticals and from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials  ASTHO   than they have from HHS  Roche proactively contacted each State Department of Health and has reportedly been very responsive to them  and ASTHO has made itself available to answer states   questions as well  Where is HHS in this process       In fact  of the eleven State Health Department officials who have been in contact with my office  five states are purchasing Tamiflu with funds diverted from other programs because they have not been able to access the HHS subsidy  Although ten of the eleven states had contacted Roche to ask for help  only four had spoken to HHS  and two of those four reported that HHS was unhelpful or non responsive  And worst of all  four of the eleven states did not even know that a federal subsidy existed       I urge you to immediately contact all fifty State Health Departments to inform them of the subsidy and assist them in accessing it  I further urge you to use  1 8 billion of the  3 2 billion appropriated to HHS by the United States Congress for antiviral stockpiling  rather than passing the costs of this expensive and vital public health project onto the states  Thank you for your consideration       Sincerely       Charles Schumer  U S  Senator
