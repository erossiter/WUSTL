IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 8  2007 Senators Feinstein and Schumer Call on Attorney General Gonzales to Support Legislation to Ensure Senate Confirmation of U S  Attorneys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   In light of new revelations about the firings of at least eight U S  attorneys  U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and Chuck Schumer  D NY  today called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to support legislation they sponsored that would require Senate confirmation of all U S  Attorneys       This legislation was approved in Senate Judiciary Committee last month by a vote of 13 6   It is on the senate floor and can be called up for a vote at any time         Under a provision inserted without notice into the USA Patriot Act reauthorization last year  the law was changed so that if a vacancy arises  the Attorney General may appoint a replacement for an indefinite period of time   thus completely avoiding the Senate confirmation process   The legislation approved by the Judiciary Committee would restore the process in place before 2006   It would allow the Attorney General to appoint interim U S  Attorney for 120 days   If after that time the President has not sent up a nominee to the Senate and had that nominee confirmed  then the authority to appoint an interim U S  Attorney would fall to the district court   This was the law from 1986 to 2006         The following is the text of the letter   March 8  2007    The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  Attorney General of the United States  United States Justice Department  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Attorney General Gonzales    This letter is to express our strong disappointment with how your Department has handled the cases of eight U S  Attorneys who have been asked to resign over the past few months  and to take issue with a number of assertions you made in an op ed in yesterday s USA Today    We have come to believe that this was a clumsy effort to force these U S  Attorneys out for reasons that have little or nothing to do with their performance as prosecutors   The U S  Attorneys who testified before the House and Senate had solid records as independent prosecutors   They are good people   And they didn t deserve to be treated this way    Now you write that these forced resignations were based on  policy  priorities and management    You also stated unequivocally before the Judiciary Committee that you  would never  ever make a change in the United States attorney position for political reasons     But these assertions don t hold up   There is evidence suggesting that the intent was to replace some of these U S  Attorneys with others who might be more politically connected   This was the case with Mr  Cummins  who was replaced with a prot    g     of Karl Rove   And your Deputy  Paul McNulty  has acknowledged as much before the Judiciary Committee    There are suggestions that this may be the case with others as well    The fact is that the U S  Attorneys in question received favorable performance evaluations   This was done by several dozen independent reviewers who were asked to evaluate each U S  Attorney s priorities and policy decisions  as well as their prosecution statistics   When we reviewed the reports your office provided  it was clear that each of the U S  Attorneys were individually evaluated to have a strategic plan and appropriate priorities to meet the needs of the Department and their districts    Given these evaluations  it is difficult to now accept that the reason these U S  Attorneys were fired was because they failed to meet the Department s priorities   It is even harder to accept the answer  given each of the U S  Attorneys was a rising star   It is also hard to accept that 7 U S  Attorneys lost your confidence simultaneously  especially since all were  surprised  by the call requesting their resignation    U S  Attorneys are at the forefront of many of this country s most important cases  and as each of them testified yesterday  U S  Attorneys must have some level of independence given the seriousness of their job    While the President has the right to fire U S  Attorneys  we do not believe the American people are best served if the President chooses to fire U S  Attorneys for political reasons   whether to put in place young ideologues or because he is displeased with the cases the U S  Attorney is pursuing    We strongly believe that if a President chooses to fire U S  Attorneys for any reason  but especially for political reasons  he should explain and justify his decision    However  the change to the law last March has wiped out Congress s role to hold the Administration accountable for its actions    If the Department of Justice is comfortable justifying its reasons and is committed to going through the Senate confirmation process  then the Department should also support our efforts to pass legislation requiring Senate confirmation of U S  Attorneys    We ask that you support this legislation and restore the independence of U S  Attorneys                                                              Sincerely       Dianne Feinstein  United States Senator                                                    Charles Schumer  United States Senator
