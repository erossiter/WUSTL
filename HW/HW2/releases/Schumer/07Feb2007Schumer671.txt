Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New 2008 Administration Budget Slashes Funding for Cash Strapped Upstate Hospitals   Cuts Also Target Graduate Medical Education   Schumer  With Hospitals Struggling to Recruit Doctors and On the Heels of Eight Consecutive Years of Losses  Medicare Cuts Could Not Have Come at a Worse Time for Upstate New York Patients    Senator Releases Report Detailing County By County Cuts fo Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that cuts to Medicare included in the Administration s budget  released on Monday  would cost upstate New York hospitals nearly  700 million over the next five years   The Administration s budget includes cuts that would reduce Medicare payments to hospitals  skilled nursing facilities  SNFs   home health agencies  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  IRFs   and other providers   Today  at a Senate Finance Committee Hearing  Schumer will grill Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt for pushing such dramatic cuts upon struggling hospitals in New York and across the country            This budget gives the meat axe to upstate New York hospitals and I am going to fight it every step of the way   Schumer said    Upstate New York hospitals depend on this funding to survive and such dramatic cuts would endanger the quality of care for years to come   We need to support our hospitals to ensure they can grow and modernize  Rather than strengthening the precarious position many hospitals are in  the Administration s budget risks further damage by weakening the programs hospitals rely on day in and day out           Schumer s   using information compiled by the Healthcare Association of New York State  details staggering cuts to hospitals large and small   The cuts proposed by the Administration and included in the analysis target hospital reimbursements for inpatient and outpatient care  nursing homes  and home based health care   They include the elimination or reduction of legally required formula increases that seek to address the rapidly rising cost of health care          Schumer stressed that these cuts are particularly damaging to hospitals  bottom lines because  as reimbursements are given out based on a predetermined formula  hospitals create their budgets based on what they expect the formula to generate for the next several years   The Administration s proposal dramatically and suddenly changes the formula  reducing significantly the level of support each hospital had expected from the federal government   Schumer said that there is no question that  should these cuts be enacted  upstate New York residents could see a decline in care and services          The Administration s total nationwide cut to Medicare would translate to a  697 921 000 cut for upstate New York hospitals   New York State s hospitals have been operating at a loss for the last eight years in a row  but are targeted for drastic reductions in payments   The proposed cuts are larger than similar cuts Bush asked for in his previous budget proposals   Below is how the numbers break out across the state              Hospitals in the Capital Region would lose  77 856 000 over the next five years             Hospitals in Central New York would lose  62 009 000 over the next five years             Hospitals in the Rochester Finger Lakes Region would lose  154 709 000 over the next five years              Hospitals in the Hudson Valley would lose  192 370 000 over the next five years            Hospitals in the North Country would lose  26 799 000 over the next five years              Hospitals in the Southern Tier would lose  52 963 000 over the next five years              Hospitals in Western New York would lose  143 773 000 over the next five years          Schumer also raised serious concerns about the dramatic cuts posed to the Medicaid program  especially through the elimination of the Medicaid Graduate Medical Education program   The budget would cut an average of more than  550 million annually in support provided to New York teaching hospitals across the state  totaling  2 7 billion over the next five years   New York teaching hospitals  including SUNY Upstate  train one out of every seven doctors in this country          Medical Education funding would also be targeted in the Medicare cuts  ending what the Administration calls duplicative payments under the Medicare Advantage program  When given the choice to end payments to either private insurance plans or hospitals  the Administration chose to end the payments to hospitals          Schumer said that it is important  now more than ever  that New York teaching hospitals be able to attract new doctors because many communities across upstate New York are facing a critical shortage of medical personnel  Both Buffalo and Rochester are facing serious and growing shortages of doctors  particularly surgeons and general practitioners   The Buffalo Niagara region lost 10 percent of its doctors from 2001 to 2005  the largest drop in the state  including a 16 percent decline in the number of general surgeons and a 13 percent decline in obstetrician gynecologists  Yet the Administration s budget goes one step further and even cuts the National Health Service Corps program  which provides financial incentives to doctors who practice in areas with shortages   Both medical education cuts and the National Health Service Corps cut would exacerbate the growing doctor shortages in upstate New York            Schumer added that the cuts detailed in his report represent a small portion of the total cuts to federal health services and coverage   The President proposes  10 billion less for the Children s Health Insurance Program than is needed merely to continue covering the children who are already enrolled   He also proposes to scale back eligibility requirements to twice the federal poverty level   This would hurt children in New York s program  called Child Health Plus  which currently covers children up to 2 5 times the federal poverty level           In response to these dramatic cuts that could reduce the quality of care across upstate New York  Schumer today will grill HHS Secretary Leavitt at a Senate Finance Committee hearing and called on the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee to reverse these cuts in the Congressional Budget to be released this spring
