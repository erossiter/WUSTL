IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 8  2005 As Cap Region Shoppers Hit the Mall  Schumer to Warn of Holiday Scams                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Schumer To Advise Shoppers  Beware Of Official Looking E mails Asking For Credit Card Information  Gift Card Trading Websites  Misleading Return Policies  and Sky High Interest Rates on Store Issued Credit Cards   Schumer To Announce Specific Steps That Cap Region Shoppers Can Take To Protect Themselves  and Ways That Feds Must Crackdown on Scammers With an estimated 23 000 Capital Region shoppers expected to be duped by phony emails eliciting bank account information  Schumer today warned of several prevalent and menacing scams  designed to rip off consumers both in stores and online  Schumer offered new ways to avoid falling prey to Internet scams and in store gimmicks that are too good to be true  Specifically  Schumer warned that consumers this season are particularly vulnerable to   phishing    e mails that seemingly come from a bank or retail store  and elicit credit card information but are really generated by criminals who instantaneously withdraw a victim  s funds or make purchases  Today Schumer also discouraged consumers from using any websites offering to trade gift cards since many have proven to be fraudulent          New Yorkers could be in for an unwelcome New Year s surprise if they fall prey to some of these scams     Schumer said    Victims of phishing not only lose their savings  but also their peace of mind        On some of these websites and even in the stores  you might think you re getting a real bargain at the register  but just wait until the bill comes  As the holiday shopping season revs up  shoppers must beware of these pitfalls        Phishing refers to a growing Internet scam in which the victim receives an e mail that appears to come from a trusted source such as a bank or retailer  and that asks for certain personal information  The e mail typically includes a link that appears to take the victim to the website of that financial institution  but which is actually a sham site  Any personal information entered is stolen and used    sometimes within minutes    for unlawful purposes such as transferring funds or purchasing goods  As online shopping grows exponentially  so does phishing  The number of new phishing sites grew 359  from October of 2004 to September of 2005  Using Gartner Research Group estimates  Schumer said today that 23 307 Capital Region consumers may be duped into providing information to scam artists       In response  Schumer announced he is co sponsoring the Anti phishing Act of 2005  S  472   which makes it a crime to use the Internet to fraudulently obtain personal information  It imposes a fine  up to five years   imprisonment  or both if someone fraudulently creates a website or domain name representing itself as a legitimate business without the approval of the registered owner of the business  and uses that website or domain names to obtain someone  s identity information  The bill provides similar penalties for sending an e mail that falsely represents itself as being a legitimate online business  links users to a site that falsely purports to be associated with a legitimate online business  and seeks identity information from the recipient       Schumer also warned today of a growing gift card trading industry  Gift cards have become big business  The National Retail Federation estimates that gift card sales this holiday season will hit more than  18 billion  a 6 6 percent increase over last year s record high  But nationally between 12 14  of them can go unused  so trading them online in the secondary market has recently sprung up on a number of websites  The problem is that many of the traded gift cards are expired  or loaded with fees  Sometimes the cards have been reduced due to dormancy fees that may apply differently in various states  Some of the websites guarantee the gift cards up to  100 if they turn out to be duds  but it  s buyer beware in the used gift card marketplace  Many sites will offer a dramatic markdown  possibly from  500 to  350  but if the buyer is only insured up to  100 he or she could be left holding the bag for the difference if the card turns out to be empty       Today Schumer revealed that interest rates charged by several store credit cards in the Capital Region are significantly higher than those charged by bank issued credit cards  Schumer s  showed that  over time  consumers who make purchases on store issued credit cards can easily pay hundreds of dollars more in interest payments  A shopper who spent  300 using a retail store credit card with an annual percentage rate  APR  of 22 8  and only paid the minimum monthly payment on their Ann Taylor credit card would pay up to  115 28 over 39 months  The average APR for these store issued credit cards is almost 22   Shoppers who charged on their regular bank credit card would pay far less in interest        Schumer said that consumers must beware of the high rates and urged shoppers to take steps to protect themselves            Shoppers should avoid using store issued credit cards whenever possible            If a consumer is interested in signing up for a store credit card  the consumer should be sure to ask the sales representative about the details of the credit line s interest rate and fees            Bills should be paid in full and on time if customers are to avoid paying exorbitant interest        In a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency  OCC   Schumer will urge for the agency to examine the lending practices of retail credit cards  In the letter  Schumer will ask the OCC to formally recommend specific steps that retail stores could take to protect their customers            Retail store promotional material should advertise the store s credit card interest rate and terms as prominently as they display the initial discount            Sales representatives should inform consumers verbally of the credit card s interest rate  and explain that the rate is higher than a typical bank issued credit card             Retailers should avoid luring college students and young adults who do not have established credit ratings into accepting store credit cards        Schumer also advised consumers to beware of hidden shipping and return policies  One of most common complaints from consumer groups is high shipping fees  or unclear return policies that set up unrealistic hurdles for the consumer to return their good  For instance  IKEA doesn  t disclose the shipping fees to the consumer until AFTER the good is purchased when it emails the buyer  Return policies can vary widely between retailers  but many online websites demand returning the product in original packaging  with a special mailing label  and some even demand a   return authorization     before you can even return the good at all  Other retailers  like Best Buy and  charge a high restocking fee when an item is returned so the consumer doesn  t get the full price back  These and other fine print hurdles prevent consumers from returning purchase merchandise
