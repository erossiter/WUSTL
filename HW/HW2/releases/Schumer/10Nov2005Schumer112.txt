                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As the effort to salvage the  125 million for injured 9 11 workers hit its most critical phase  Congressional conference negotiators received a full court press from New York to restore the money  New York s Senators and Members of Congress were joined by the New York Fire Commissioner  sick and injured 9 11 responders  and health professionals who have monitored the responders  to make the case for the money       The  125 million in question had been appropriated as part of the emergency 9 11 recovery aid  but President Bush proposed to take it back in his FY2006 budget  The House of Representatives included the president s request in its version of the Labor HHS Appropriations bill        New York Senators Clinton and Schumer were able to attach an amendment to the Senate version of the bill that would salvage the money  In the House  Reps  Fossella  Maloney and the NY delegation secured an agreement from leadership to work on this issue in conference negotiations between the House and the Senate  The fate of the money will be determined in the conference       Senator Schumer said   When the President asked us how much New York needed in the aftermath of the 9 11 tragedy   I said  20 billion  It was clear to us then that the Administration was serious about making that request a reality  I was shocked and puzzled to find out that after all our discussions that the Administration would authorize the removal of  125 million in funds that would go to workers who were injured at the World Trade Center site  including some of the chronic illnesses and health problems that may not be evident until many years after September 11  2001  I m relieved that we ve gotten the money restored in the spending bill  but we are going to continue to be vigilant in making sure the money New York s 9 11 workers we were promised gets delivered        Senator Clinton said   The heroic men and women who selflessly risked their health and safety at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills to help New Yorkers in the horrific aftermath of 9 11 need and deserve our unending support  The Senate agreed that we owe it to them to make sure they have the critical resources they require  Now we must ensure that this money remains in the final Conference Report so that people and their families who are waiting for answers on claims and who need continued medical and mental health screening  monitoring and treatment  receive essential help to deal with the health effects of their brave acts        Rep  Maloney said   Now is a perfect time for Congress to show that it will  never forget  9 11  just like everyone promised four years ago  If the conference negotiators strip out the Clinton Schumer amendment  they will be taking emergency money from 9 11 that may very well still be needed and shipping it off to some other part of the country for some other use  The New York delegation is working in unison to try to stop that from happening        Rep  Fossella said   In the best interest of the people of New York  I strongly urge the Conference Committee to restore this essential funding for our City and State  These funds will be used in the future for September 11th related workers compensation claims and also to meet the health needs of those affected by the events of that day  It is impossible to project at this time the full financial cost of those needs  but it is self evident that they will continue to be great         There are literally tens of thousands of residents and workers who were in the vicinity of Ground Zero and at the Fresh Kills Landfill during the attacks and in the weeks and months after  These individuals have required   and will continue to require   both physical and mental health treatment  The loss of the  125 million could place in jeopardy the ability to ensure New Yorkers have access to the care they need        Suzy Ballantyne of the New York State AFL CIO  who was in Washington today  said   Today  the New York State AFL CIO asks that the  125 million in funding  originally intended to help those still suffering from significant financial  medical and mental health needs  be restored to New York as emergency spending  Those who risked their lives on September 11th to rescue others didn t give a second thought to their own health and well being  So now it is our turn to  rescue them  from any and all harmful  long term financial  emotional or physical impairments        Joining the elected officials today were    Nicholas Scoppetta  New York Fire

Helping Heroes      Background   Three key reasons it would be wrong to take back 9 11 workers compensation aid include  First  there has never been a study of how much aid will be needed to pay current recipients of 9 11 workers compensation       Second  there has been no analysis of what resources will be needed for future payments to hundreds of 9 11 claims that are still pending  Medical research shows that respiratory illness from 9 11 can be long term and debilitating over time  If even a fraction of pending claims are approved in the months ahead  annual 9 11 workers compensation payments could reach multiple millions of dollars       Third  any remaining funds from the  125 million not used for workers compensation should be used for the broader purpose of supporting the health and recovery of 9 11 responders  More than half of some 12 000 responders screened through a national medical monitoring program coordinated by the Mount Sinai Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine are estimated to still experience 9 11 related illnesses  After ensuring that all needs for 9 11 workers compensation claims will be met  remaining aid should be used to support medical treatment for 9 11 responders who do not have health insurance or adequate coverage for 9 11 injuries  Remaining funds could be used to extend the national World Trade Center medical monitoring program from five to twenty years  to track and adequately diagnose long term illness from the disaster      Previous Action   Last month  Senators Clinton and Schumer scored a victory in the Senate when they successfully attached an amendment to the Labor HHS Appropriations bill that covers the  125 million  In June  the House passed a version of the bill that rescinds the 9 11 workers compensation aid  However  Congresswoman Maloney and Congressman Fossella obtained a verbal commitment on the House floor by leadership to work on the issue during conference negotiations  http   www house gov maloney press 109th 20050623Amendment911Aid htm          Earlier  Maloney organized 23 Members of the New York Congressional delegation  who urged President Bush to withdraw the proposal in his Fiscal Year 2006 budget that would rescind  125 million in federal funds designated for 9 11 workers compensation and job retraining aid  That letter is available at   http   www house gov maloney issues Sept11 20050531_rescission_ltr_POTUS pdf        In addition  Members of the New York delegation sent a letter to Representatives Jerry Lewis and David Obey  the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee respectively  asking the Committee to reject the rescission and for a review of the unmet health needs of 9 11 responders  It is available at   http   www
