IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 5  2007 Schumer Reveals  Older Cities Like New York Losing Out as Young Cities Gobble up Money For New Federal Highway and Bridge Projects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In Addition  Federal Budget Gaps Leaving Nation s Highways And Bridges In A State Of Dangerous Disrepair As President Bush Threatens Veto of New Funding  4 Billion Federal Highway Budget Hole Ties Hands of Older Cities  Preventing them from Properly Maintaining Aging and Degrading Infrastructure Schumer Calls on President to Remove Veto Threat from Spending Bi Standing at the base of the iconic and aging Brooklyn Bridge  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that federal short funding of vital highway and bridge maintenance programs has left New Yorks aging infrastructure in a state of disrepair  Schumer said that Federal Highway Trust Fund finances have deteriorated and will be insolvent by approximately  4 billion in 2009 and  10 billion by 2010 while at the same time 27 1  of the nation s 590 750 bridges are rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete  Though New York City has undertaken an aggressive and successful program to maintain and upgrade its bridges  Schumer said that current federal funding for newer projects far outpaces funding for upgrades and repairs to existing infrastructure  putting older cities  like New York  at a significant disadvantage and leaving their bridges  roads  and other infrastructure to degrade   For too long  the federal government has focused on building new bridges at the expense of fixing old ones  and now we are living with the consequences  Schumer said  Robbing Peter to pay Paul is no way to keep Americas drivers safe  It might not be sexy  but our nations transportation infrastructure is the lifeblood of Americas economy and we need to keep it healthy and flowing  The City and State have done the best they can with the resources they get to keep our bridges and highways running safely and efficiently   Schumer said that the Minnesota bridge collapse exposes a systemic problem with highway and bridge infrastructure across the country  but especially in New York and older cities  While the bridge in Minnesota was only 40 years old  bridges throughout New York can be 80 to over 100 years old and decades past their useful life  New York is just one of a host of cities across the Northeast whose infrastructure is aging and degrading and in need of a massive overhaul  In New York  35 percent of the citys more than 2 600 bridges are structurally deficient   However  Schumer today revealed that the distribution federal funding for highways and bridges significantly favors the construction of new projects in younger cities instead of upgrading existing infrastructure in older areas  like New York  A small number of massive new projects tend to gobble up a huge share of federal transportation subsidies leaving a far greater number of older bridges and highways to divide up a smaller pot   Schumer today said that the gap between what the federal government actually spends on maintaining and upgrading aging highways and bridges and what the systems needs is widening dramatically  According to a new report by the U S  Department of Transportation  the gap between needs and actual spending grew from 8 3 percent to 12 2 percent in 2004  In addition  while spending on bridge maintenance dropped from  12 5 billion in 2004 to  12 4 billion in 2006  spending on highway and bridge expansion grew from  52 9 billion in 2004 to  58 8 billion in 2006   Schumer said the current problem stems from the Administration blocking significant increases in federal transportation funding pushed by a coalition of Northeastern Senators  led by Schumer  When Congress last passed a major highway funding bill in 2005  the Federal Highway Administration estimated it needed  375 billion to fund repair and improvement projects  but the final bill authorized just  286 billion  The Senate had originally passed the transportation bill at the higher  375 million but the Administration and Congressional Republicans blocked it   By only approving a smaller bill  the Administration has created an enormous gap in federal funding for existing transportation infrastructure  with the Highway Trust Fund  the pot of money that pays for improvements  on the brink of bankruptcy  The Office of Management and Budget  OMB   noting that the Federal Highway Trust Fund finances have deteriorated  released new estimates July 11  2007 showing that the Highway Accountis expected to go insolvent by approximately  4 billion in 2009  an increase from its February estimate of  700 million  That deficit will rise to  8 1 billion by 2010   This disaster must be a wake up call to get our nations transportation infrastructure in order  For far too long  highways and bridges in New York and across the country have been allowed to degrade to the point of dangerous disrepair  The Senate has legislation to provide  5 billion for bridge replacement and rehabilitation  we will pas that bill and the President must sign it  We need a comprehensive effort at the federal  state and local level to ensure this type of collapse never happens again   To close this dramatic funding gap and prevent another disaster  Schumer today called on President Bush to remove his threat to veto the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation Appropriations Bill that includes  5 billion in new funding for bridge upgrades and maintenance  The Senate version of the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation Appropriations Bill includes  5 017 billion for bridge replacement and rehab  an increase from  4 123 billion in Fiscal Year 2007  The bill has passed the Senate Appropriations Committee and is expected to be considered by the full Senate this fall   Schumer today also announced that when the Transportation Appropriations Bill comes to the floor he will introduce an amendment to double funding up to  10 billion exclusively for current bridge repairs and upgrades  This funding would be directed to fixing existing bridges
