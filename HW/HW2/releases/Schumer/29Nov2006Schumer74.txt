                                   Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced the selection of Timmy Koeth of Staten Island Technical High School to attend the Students on Ice Antarctica Expedition 2006  The program  which sends high school students  teachers and scientists from around the world to study for two weeks in Antarctica  requested that Senator Schumer assist in choosing a stellar student from Staten Island to attend the program  Passionate in studying math and physics and the Captain of his varsity swimming team  Timmy met the criteria Senator Schumer was looking for in a Staten Island representative           Timmy has proven himself a hard working and inquisitive student  earning the right to participate in this once in a life time adventure     said Schumer    It  s a long way from Staten Island to Antarctica  and I look forward to Timmy returning home with extraordinary tales of seals  sharks  whales and glaciers that he can share with his fellow Staten Islanders              I  m most excited about meeting new people in the program  and  of course  seeing the wildlife  especially the penguins     said Timmy    I  m planning on taking a lot of pictures and taking a video diary to record what I did            Since 2002  Students on Ice has sought Schumer  s assistance in selecting a student from Staten Island to join the annual Antarctica Expedition  Students on Ice is an award winning organization that offers high school students  teachers and scientists from around the world an inspirational and educational opportunity to travel to the Arctic and the Antarctic for the purpose of encouraging a deeper understanding and respect for the planet    The Antarctic is one of the least understood and least traveled parts of the globe     Schumer commented          At Staten Island Technical High School  Timmy spends his days diligently pouring over his math and physics studies while leading Tech  s mighty Sea Gulls varsity swimming team to victory  Inspired by his parents and supported by   Staten Island  s close knit community     Timmy is currently considering a career in engineering  He also dabbles in the arts  performing in last year  s school play production  Chorus Line  which received rave reviews          One of the major benefactors of Students on Ice is philanthropist Harry Snyder  Mr  Snyder first traveled to Antarctica with Geoff Green  Director of Students on Ice  Mr  Snyder was   profoundly moved    by the experience according to Mr  Green  and wanted to open this opportunity to non privileged students in New York City  Since 2002  Mr  Snyder has put up the funding to allow 17 non privileged students to travel to Antarctica with Students on Ice  sending two students in 2002 and five each following year  one from each of the city  s boroughs  Each year since 2002  in addition to Senator Schumer selecting a student from Staten Island  Congresswoman Nydia Velasquez  D NY  has selected a student from Brooklyn  Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carri    n  Jr  has selected a student from the Bronx  and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney  D NY  has selected students from Manhattan and Queens          Tonight  Students on Ice will hold a dinner at the Explorer  s Club in honor of the five students from New York City selected to participate in the Antarctica Expedition  Each student will have a chance to speak about the upcoming trip  as will Mr  Snyder and Mr  Green  The student  s parents  teachers  and principals will attend the event as well          The Principle and Vice Principle at Staten Island Technical High School assisted Senator Schumer in identifying the student for this year  s expedition  Also lending a hand was Staten Island Tech graduate Mike Cassidy  a former intern in Senator Schumer s New York City office  In between his grueling cross country running training sessions at University of Pennsylvania  Cassidy acted as liaison between the Senator  s office and Staten Island Tech           Senator Schumer advised Timmy and the other students traveling to Antarctica  saying    Bundle up  explore  shuffle your happy feat on the glaciers  and remember the time difference when calling home
