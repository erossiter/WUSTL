IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 10  2006 Schumer  6 2 Million New Yorkers Could Lose Critical Health Services Under Senate Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Schumer Reveals New Yorkers Could Lose Access to Emergency Services  Mammograms  Hospice Care  Diabetes Supplies  and Other Life Saving Services   Major Health Care Proposal Debated On Senate Floor This Week   Senator To Push Bill That Would Offer Tax Credit To Employers for Health Coverage  But Keep State Protections Millions of New Yorkers could lose access to dozens of life saving services  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today if a bill being debated on the Senate floor today passes  Schumer announced that if the legislation currently on the floor of the Senate is passed  more than 6 2 million New Yorkers will lose the guarantee of coverage for important protections  benefits  and services that are now included in their health insurance          At a time when we  re having a health care crisis in the country  this bill is a giant step in the wrong direction     Schumer said    Mammograms for women and immunizations for children are required under New York law  Those would be washed away by this proposal  New York State has some of the strongest safeguards throughout the country  but they d be eliminated with the flick of a pen  We should be focusing on lowering the cost of prescription drugs  figuring out the Medicare Part D mess  and pursuing the promise of stem cell research  Let  s start solving problems instead of creating new ones           The Senate right now is considering Senate Bill 1955  the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act which invalidates important New York laws that regulate insurance plans  The legislation would allow insurers to offer plans without the benefits and services New York lawmakers have deemed critical  These changes would apply to the small group  large group  and individual health insurance markets        If this bill is passed and signed into law  New Yorkers with health insurance will lose their guaranteed access to            alcoholism treatment        ambulance transportation        ambulatory cancer treatment        ambulatory surgery        bone density screening for osteoporosis        cervical cancer screening        childhood immunizations        contraceptives        diabetic supplies and education        drug abuse treatment        emergency services        home health care        hospice care        infertility treatment        mammography screening        maternity care        mental health services        metabolic disorders treatment        minimum hospital stay following a mastectomy        off label drug use for cancer treatment        prostate cancer screening        second opinion on surgical procedures        well child care         Families USA  a nonpartisan national organization for health care consumers  estimates that 6 214 000 New Yorkers would lose guaranteed coverage of these services  which makes New York the second most affected state of all fifty  Coverage for roughly 142 000 small businesses  firms of less than 50 workers  will be affected  as will about 38 450 firms that employ more than 50 workers       In addition to eliminating important state mandates for minimum health insurance coverage  this bill would also eliminate consumer protections that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against older and sicker people  In states like New York  insurance recipients are pooled together into a common pool  so that everyone pays the same premium and shares the cost of health care  Under S  1955  people insured in the small group market would suddenly be subject to higher fees  paying a drastically higher premium if they happen to be older or sicker  These people could see a 67 percent variation in premiums from their neighbors  For example  using age as a factor  insurance companies could charge older people 500  higher premiums than younger people        In response  Senator Schumer has joined Senators Richard Durbin  IL  and Blanche Lincoln  AK   in promoting the Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP  Act of 2005  S  2382   which would enable small businesses across America to pool their risk and purchasing power together to expand access to affordable private health insurance options for their employees  while still preserving each states  health insurance coverage requirements  Employers would also receive an annual tax credit to defray part of the employer contribution for low income workers and a bonus tax credit for paying a higher percentage of the premium  Every small business and self employed American  rural or urban  would have access to a choice of plans       Senator Schumer is a member of the Senate Finance Committee that oversees Medicare  and is the co author with Senator John McCain  R AZ  of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act   which became law in 2003  The Act enabled generic drugs to be brought to market sooner  and lowered the cost of prescriptions for millions of American seniors
