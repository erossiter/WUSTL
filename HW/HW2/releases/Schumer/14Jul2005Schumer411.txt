    Latest News             TOPICS                                                                                                           Latest              News                           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 14  2005 Questioning Judicial Nominees  A Duty Not A Privilege  Schumer Outlines Specific Questions Senators Should Ask A Supreme Court Nominee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Major Speech to the Center for American Progress and American Constitution Society Stems from Schumer Op Ed in 2001 Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  in a speech to the Center for American Progress and American Constitution Society  outlined the specific questions that can and should be asked of Supreme Court nominees in their confirmation hearings  Schumer  the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  stating that questioning judicial nominees is a duty and not a privilege  first suggested that a nominee  s views and philosophy should be known in an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2001  The specific questions are below as is a complete text of the speech       Questioning Judicial Nominees  A Duty  Not A Privilege      I would like to thank the Center for American Progress and the American Constitution Society for sponsoring this important event  at this important time  on this important issue       As speculation swirls about who might replace Sandra Day O  Connor  it is important that we are taking this morning to address a fundamental issue  no matter how many vacancies we may face on the Court       And that fundamental issue is this    once we have a nominee  or nominees  testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee  what kinds of questions can be put to that nominee and what kinds of answers should the nominee give       I have long believed that federal court candidates    who serve for life    should explain their judicial philosophy and their method of legal reasoning       They should be prepared to explain their views of the Constitution  of decided cases  of federalism  and a host of other issues relevant to that lifetime post   They should talk about their views of the First Amendment  civil rights  environmental rights  religious liberty  the establishment of religion  worker  s rights  women  s rights  and more       So  this morning  ladies and gentlemen  let me address two points  First  why it is good and proper to ask a nominee detailed questions about his or her views of the Constitution and substantive issues       And second  what questions I personally would ask any nominee to the Supreme Court       First  why should Senators ask    and why should nominees answer    searching questions about judicial philosophy        Why  Because it is the single most important thing we can learn about a Justice who will serve for life       The Supreme Court has a profound impact on people  s lives  and the influence of a single Justice can far outlast that of a President       With just the stroke of the pen  a Justice can affect    for good or ill    millions of people  s lives in dozens of fundamental ways        One Supreme Court decision can mean the difference between equality of opportunity and second class citizenship for generations  Just look at Brown v  Board of Education     One Supreme Court decision can mean the difference between profit and bankruptcy for a class of businesses  Just look at the Grokster case  file sharing case  or Granholm v  Heald  wine distribution cases      One Supreme Court decision can mean the difference between life and death for criminal defendants  Just look at Atkins v  Virginia  mentally retarded  or Roper v  Simmons  juveniles      One decision can mean the difference between a home and homelessness  between a job and the unemployment line  between clean air and a fouled up planet     And of course  as we have seen  just one vote by one Justice in one case can mean the difference between a Democrat or a Republican in the White House  Just look at Bush v  Gore       Because of the momentousness of all that the high Court considers  we simply cannot and should not avoid delving into judicial philosophy       As I discussed in a 2001 Op Ed in the New York Times  there is no question that all good lawyers and judges interpret the law  that there is some subjectivity in that interpretation  and that one  s values and philosophy influence that process       Professor Cass Sunstein did an interesting study and found    somewhat unsurprisingly    that in ideologically contested cases  appointees tended to vote more conservatively or more liberally depending on the party of the president who appointed them       For all these reasons  this process should not be a rote and robotic review of a resume        There are many people who boast impressive resumes and academic credentials  but who would misserve the American people from the bench  because of their extremist views  misguided judicial philosophy  or disrespect for the Constitution       A good resume is important  but not dispositive  It is a necessary  but certainly not sufficient  prerequisite for serving in a lifetime post on the most powerful court in the land       The American people care less about whether a nominee went to Utah Law School or Harvard Law School and more about how he or she will affect their lives       Indeed  close consideration of a Supreme Court nominee  s judicial philosophy  ideology  and views on substantive issues has a rich and long tradition in American history    even before nominees routinely appeared in person before a Judiciary Committee to answer questions       During the 1950 s and early 1960 s  there were not a lot of questions about nominees   views and ideology  in part because there was more good will and consensus in the country  But from the beginning of the Republic  everyone has understood that these kinds of questions were vitally important   In the 1795 when President George Washington nominated John Rutledge to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court  he was defeated not because of some personal foible    not because he smoked opium as a teenager or failed to pay his nanny tax to the British    but because of his views of the Jay Treaty       And    this is notable    his opposition was led by Alexander Hamilton  who was the originator of the Advice and Consent procedure       Over the course of American history  fully 20 percent of all nominees to the high court have never been seated    in many cases because of their ideology and judicial philosophy       Ideological examination has been a feature of the nomination process forever    but often that ideological questioning goes on furtively behind closed doors by members of the party that proposed the nominee       Justice O  Connor  for example  was questioned by the Reagan White House at length on her views    in private  As reported in the New York Times in 1981  in a closed door session  she was asked specific questions by Reagan officials    including  among other things    whom she felt she was closest to on the Court philosophically  and  her opinions on the exclusionary rule  under which evidence that is obtained unconstitutionally is deemed inadmissible in court          And that kind of closed door questioning appears not to be a thing of the past  As reported this week  Senator Sam Brownback  a member of the Judiciary Committee  has asked to meet with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  who has been mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee       Asked whether Gonzales would be a good nominee  Brownback replied    I need to talk with him about his view of the Constitution to tell  That  s what I hope to do this week          If a nominee  s ideology  judicial philosophy  constitutional views are central considerations in a President  s decision to nominate  as they inevitably are  and if such questioning is going on in private  I dare say that the American people have an absolute right to have those questions answered publicly       Now  let me just review the breadth of support    from all quarters    for the proposition that questions about judicial philosophy and decided cases are fair game for nominees to the highest court in the land       Let me begin with the letter being released today in conjunction with this event    a letter signed by 100 leading legal scholars  which really hits the nail on the head  Let me quote a passage from that letter          I t is critical that the Senate  in giving its Advice and Consent  undertake a searching inquiry to assure itself that judicial nominees meet the highest standards of character and integrity      and that their views are within the constitutional mainstream          That is exactly right  But these 100 scholars are not alone  If people cared to look  there is support from many quarters for the proposition that questioning nominees about their views and ideology is vitally important       1  Arlen Specter  the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  agrees with this proposition  This is what he wrote in his 2000 book  Passion for Truth       T he Senate should resist  if not refuse  to confirm Supreme Court nominees who refuse to answer questions on fundamental issues  In voting on whether or not to confirm a nominee  senators should not have to gamble or guess about a candidate  s philosophy  but should be able to judge on the basis of the candidate s expressed views          2  Senator John Cornyn    himself mentioned as a potential Supreme Court nominee and also a member of the Judiciary Committee    also agrees with this proposition  When pressed on television last week  Senator Cornyn conceded         I think it s an appropriate question to ask what  nominees    views are on cases that have been decided and judicial opinions that have been written          3  Senator Orrin Hatch    former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee    also has agreed with this proposition because he has understood that judicial philosophy is so important          D ifferences in judicial philosophy have real consequences for the safety of Americans in their streets  homes  and workplaces      1996        Senator Hatch has himself also repeatedly asked nominees about their views  He pressed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on  among other things  her views on the death penalty   Senate Judiciary Cmte  Hearing  7 22 93       4  On Tuesday  even President Bush endorsed this proposition when he talked about the importance of philosophy in picking a Supreme Court nominee         I am going to be deliberate in the process because I want the American people to know that  when I finally make a decision  it  s going to be one based upon a lot of research and a lot of thought about the character of the person  the integrity of the person  the ability of the person to do the job  and the philosophy of the person          5  Even the current Supreme Court agrees with the proposition that nominees to the Supreme Court will naturally have    and express    opinions on the legal issues of the day  In Republican Party of Minnesota v  White  2002   the Court made clear that questions about constitutional views and decided questions are completely proper        Listen to Justice Scalia in 2002 quoting Justice Rehnquist in 1972          Proof that a Justice s mind at the time he joined the Court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification  not lack of bias          In all  this is an impressive group in support of this simple proposition       Logic and legal precedent confirm what Senators  scholars  and Supreme Court Justices all agree upon    that questions about judicial philosophy are legitimate and proper        Ideology matters  judicial philosophy matters  and questions about them are not only appropriate  but obligatory       And yet  despite tradition  despite Supreme Court precedent  despite logic and reason  there are those who insist that such questioning is inappropriate  unnecessary  unseemly  and even unethical       But  given the importance of the issue and the profound influence of the Supreme Court  I think the American people join me in scratching their heads at those who still question whether we should ask these kinds of questions        Every time I look at the arguments  I become more and more perplexed  Do opponents of questioning about ideology really even believe their own arguments       Perhaps those who are seeking to avoid asking these key questions are doing so because they fear    or know    that the answers the nominee gives may be so out of touch with the views and values of the American people that the nominee    if his or her views were public    might never be approved       Legendary law professor and civil rights champion Charles Black wrote in the Yale Law Journal 35 years ago words that would resonate today  He wrote eloquently and persuasively about the importance of knowing a nominee  s philosophy         If it is a philosophy the Senator thinks will make a judge whose service on the Bench will hurt the country  then the Senator can do right only by treating this judgment of his  unencumbered by deference to the President  s  as a satisfactory basis in itself for a negative vote       I have seen as yet nothing textual  nothing structural  nothing prudential  nothing historical  that tells against this view  Will someone please enlighten me          Thirty five years later  I could ask the same question  Will someone please enlighten me       Some have argued that questioning a nominee about his or her views of the Constitution or about decided cases compels prejudgment about a future case  They say that somehow asking a nominee about an old case or their judicial philosophy means they will not be able to be impartial if a similar issue ever comes up in their court in the future  They even cite the canons of judicial ethics in support of this argument       But I am not talking about asking a nominee to tell us in advance how they are going to rule on a specific fact situation or issue in a potential upcoming case         One should not ask a question specifically about Enron  because there are particular facts and parties involved  but one can certainly ask a question about a nominee  s views on corporate responsibility and the proper role of the federal Government in enforcing it     One should not ask about drilling in a particular oil field in Alaska  but one can certainly inquire about the proper Constitutional role of the federal government in balancing environmental interests against energy interests     One should not ask about how the Patriot Act should be applied to a specific individual  but one can certainly inquire about the limits of liberty in a time of war       A dozen leading legal ethicists confirmed in a letter to me last week that there is nothing inappropriate with Senators   asking questions about Constitutional issues  Relying on Justice Scalia  s opinion in White  these professors wrote         It is hardly possible that a person could achieve nomination for appointment to the United States Supreme Court and yet have no opinions about the significant constitutional issues and cases of our day  And the fact that the nominee does have such opinions and voices them will not undermine impartiality or the appearance of impartiality          So  I wonder about the motives of the opponents of this type of questioning  What is their rationale  What is their reasoning       It is getting clearer and clearer  some want a nominee so out of the mainstream that they want to hide the candidate  s views from the American people  They are afraid that if a nominee provided his or her honest views of the Constitution and of the way it should be interpreted  they would never be confirmed       Ladies and gentlemen  that is inimical to our tradition and incompatible with our principles       What I support  what my fellow Senators support  and what these 100 scholars support  is a dignified and respectful hearing process    open  fair  thorough  full  and above board        a hearing process dominated by direct questioning about substantive Constitutional issues  rather than nitpicking about personal peccadilloes     a hearing process that casts light on the nominee  s judicial views  rather than generates heat about their personal lives      a hearing process that lets the American people understand the kind of Justice they are getting       To do this  Senate questioners have certain ethical obligations    to treat the nominee with respect and to avoid the kind of gotcha questions that debase the proceedings        On the other hand  the nominee also has certain obligations    to answer questions fully and honestly  without prevarication or equivocation  to provide relevant opinions and writings to the committee  without delay  and to       Miguel Estrada  nominated by President Bush to the D C  Circuit Court of Appeals  was defeated because he was neither forthright in his answers  nor forthcoming with his writings  He may have been a brilliant legal mind  with a stellar resume  but his stubborn evasion and dissembling about his judicial philosophy and his legal views spelled disaster for his nomination       Let me now set forth some of the questions that I personally would ask a Supreme Court nominee  This is neither a comprehensive nor obligatory list  I may not ask all of these questions and I may ask many others not listed here  but these questions form a groundwork  I think  for proper examination of a candidate for the highest court in the land       Some of my questions are similar to the 10 proposed in the letter from 100 legal scholars being released today  I may not ask all of the same 10 questions proposed in the letter  but I will certainly ask many of them  And every one of the questions proposed is appropriate for a Senator to ask       Questions       1  First Amendment and Freedom of Expression   What  if any  are the limitations on the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution     When can Government regulate public speech by individuals     When does speech cross the line between Constitutionally protected free expression and slander      In what ways does the First Amendment protect the spending and raising of money by individuals in politics     Can Government regulate hate speech  What about sexually explicit materials   Specifically     Do you agree with the landmark decision in NY Times v  Sullivan  1964   which held that public criticism of public figures is acceptable unless motivated by actual malice  Who do you believe constitutes a public figure under this standard     Do you believe the Supreme Court was correct to strike down the Communications Decency Act in Reno v  ACLU  1997  on the grounds that pornography on the Internet is protected by the First Amendment     What is your view on the distinction the Supreme Court drew in Republican Party v  White and McConnell v  FEC  2003  between contributions and expenditures in the course of political campaigns  Do you believe that it is legitimate to construe campaign expenditures as protected speech but not donations by individuals        2  First Amendment and the Establishment Clause     Under the Establishment Clause  what  if any  is the appropriate role of religion in Government     Must the Government avoid involvement with religion as a whole  or is the prohibition just on Government involvement with a specific religion     Is there a difference between religious expression in Government buildings  documents  and institutions and Government spending on private  faith based initiatives     What do you see as the Constitutionally protected or limited role of faith based groups in Government funded activity  In Government institutions    Specifically      In the two cases the Supreme Court decided on the Ten Commandments recently  a display of the Commandments inside a Courthouse was found unconstitutional  while a statue of the Commandments on the grounds of a state capitol was deemed acceptable  Do you agree with the distinction the Court drew between Van Orden v  Perry and McCreary Country v  ACLU  2005   In your view  are these decisions consistent with each other     What is your view of the Supreme Court s opinion in Santa Fe Independent School District v  Doe  2000   which held that prayer in public schools is prohibited even where it is student organized  non denominational  and at a football game     Do you agree that states can regulate activities at religious ceremonies  as the Supreme Court held in allowing Oregon to prohibit the use of peyote for Native American tribal ceremonies in Employment Division v  Smith  1990        3  Commerce Clause   Beginning in 1937  when it upheld the National Labor Relations Act  the Supreme Court has granted Congress great latitude in passing laws under the Commerce Clause  The Court has upheld a wide range of federal laws  including those that regulate labor standards  personal consumption of produce  racial discrimination in public accommodations  and crime  In the last ten years  however  the Supreme Court has shifted course  doing something it had not done in sixty years  striking down acts of Congress on Commerce Clause grounds     Do you think the trend towards striking down laws on this basis is desirable     What do you believe is the extent of Congress  s authority to legislate under the Commerce Clause     Can Congress regulate local trade in a product that is used nationally     Can Congress regulate labor standards for states and cities under its Commerce Clause power     How closely connected must the regulated action be to interstate commerce for Congress to have the authority to legislate     Where would you look for evidence that Congress is properly legislating under its Commerce Clause authority  Do you rely exclusively on the text of the legislation  Do you look at the legislative history  Do you consider the nature of the regulated activity     What is the extent of the limitations imposed on state regulation by the Commerce Clause   Specifically     Do you agree that it is the Commerce Clause that allows Congress to prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations  as the Court held in Heart of Atlanta Hotel v  United States  1964      Do you agree with the Court  s decision in United States v  Lopez  1995   which struck down the Gun Free School Zone Act because education is traditionally local  Is there any circumstance under which Congress could regulate activities in schools using its Commerce Clause authority       4  Under what circumstances is it appropriate for the Supreme Court to overturn a well settled precedent  upon which Americans have come to rely     Does your answer depend at all on the length of time that the precedent has been on the books     Does your answer depend at all on how widely criticized or accepted the precedent is     What if you agree with the result but believe the legal reasoning was seriously flawed  Does that make a difference      Does it matter if the precedent was 5 4 in deciding whether to overturn it  Does it matter if was a unanimous decision   Specifically     Do you agree with the 1976 decision in which the Supreme Court held that Congress could not extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and city employees  National League of Cities v  Usery   or do you agree with the later 1985 decision  which held that Congress could  Garcia v  San Antonio Metropolitan Transit  overruling Nat  l League of Cities   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent nine years later  Why or why not     Do you agree with the 1989 decision in which the Supreme Court held that it was constitutional to execute minors  Stanford v  Kentucky   or do you agree with the later 2005 decision  which held that it was unconstitutional  Roper v  Simmons   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent 16 years later  Why or why not     Do you agree with the 1986 decision in which the Supreme Court held that states could criminalize private sex acts between consenting adults  Bowers v  Hardwick   or do you agree with the later 2003 decision  which held that the states could not  Lawrence v  Texas   Was the Court right to overturn its precedent 17 years later  Why or why not       5  Under what circumstances should the Supreme Court invalidate a law duly passed by the Congress     What amount of deference should the court give to Congressional action     Should the Court err on the side of upholding a law     Do certain types of laws deserve greater deference than others  Regulatory laws  Criminal laws      How closely tied must a law be to an enumerated right of Congress under Article I for it to be upheld    Let me ask you about a few cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down federal laws     Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s decision to strike down the Gun Free School Zones Act at issue in United States v  Lopez  1995   Why or why not     Do you agree with the Supreme Court  s decision to strike down provisions of the Violence Against Women Act in United States v  Morrison  2000   Why or why not       6  Is there a constitutionally protected right to privacy  and if so  under what circumstances does it apply     The word   privacy    is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution  In your view  does that mean it is wrong for the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution as conferring such a right     Do you believe that either the United States Congress or the states can regulate the sexual behavior of individuals within the privacy of their home     Do you agree with the reasoning in Griswold v  Connecticut  1965   which held that the Constitution protects the right to privacy in the bedroom     Do you believe that Roe v  Wade  1973  was correctly decided  What is your view of the quality of the legal reasoning in that case  Do you believe that it reached the right result     Once the right to privacy has been found    as in Griswold and Roe    under what circumstances should the Supreme Court revisit that right       7  What is the proper role of the federal government in enacting laws to protect the environment      Under the Constitution  how far can Congress go in imposing restrictions on people and businesses to protect the air and water     How should Congress balance the interests of industry against environmental interests      How far can the states go in enacting laws to protect the environment  and does it matter whether there is federal legislation on the same subject     Let me put this in the context of a specific case  Do you believe that the Supreme Court correctly decided that the EPA has the authority to pursue industrial polluters in a state where the local authority has declined to do so  as in Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v  EPA  2004      Can the Clean Air Act preempt local emissions regulations  as the Court held in Engine Manufacturers Association v  South Coast Air Quality Management  2004        8  What is the proper role of the federal government in enacting laws to protect the rights of the disabled     How should Congress balance the costs to business against the government  s interest in creating equal access to facilities for disabled persons     Should federal laws mandating access to buildings for disabled people apply to both public and private buildings     For example  do you believe that the Americans with Disabilities Act requires state buildings to be accessible to the disabled  as the Supreme Court held in Tennessee v  Lane  or do you think that sovereign immunity exempts the states       9  What is the proper relationship between Congress and the states in enacting laws to protect the rights of patients     For example  do you believe federal legislation can preempt state court laws that allow people to sue negligent insurers  as the Supreme Court held in Aetna Health Inc  v  Davila  2004        10  What is the proper Constitutional role of Government in enacting laws to regulate education     How far can the Government go under the Constitution to ensure equal treatment for all students     How far can the Court go to protect speech and or prohibit violations of the establishment clause in the schools  For example  do you believe that Santa Fe Independent School Dist  v  Doe  2000  was decided correctly     Does the Constitution guarantee parents the right to choose their children  s education  as established in Meyer v  Nebraska  1923  and Pierce v  Society of Sisters  1925        11  How do you define judicial activism  Give us three examples of Supreme Court cases that you consider the product of judicial activism     Is the   activist    label limited to more liberal leaning judges  or can there be conservative activist judges  Can you cite any examples of conservative judicial activism     In cases where federal law and state law may be in conflict  who is the activist    the judge who voted to strike down the federal law or the judge who invalidated the state law     Do you believe that the Supreme Court was engaging in judicial activism when it struck down provisions of the Gun Free School Zones Act  United States v  Lopez  or the Violence Against Women Act  United States v  Morrison   both of which had been passed by Congress     Was the Supreme Court engaging in judicial activism in   Brown v  Board of Education   Miranda v  Arizona   Dred Scott v  Sandford   The Civil Rights Cases of 1883   Lochner v  New York   Furman v  Georgia   Bush v  Gore     What distinguishes one case from the other       12  Do you describe yourself as falling into any particular school of judicial philosophy     What is your view of   strict constructionism        What is your view of the notion of   original intent       Original meaning        How do you square the notion of respecting   original intent    with the acceptance of the institution of slavery at the time the Constitution was adopted       13  What in your view are the limits on the scope of Congress  power under the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment     Does a law violate the Equal Protection Clause if it affects different groups differently  or must there be a discriminatory intent     Do parents have a Due Process right to make decisions concerning the care  custody  and control of their children  as the Supreme Court held in Troxel v  Granville  2000        14  Where is the line between civil rights questions that are political and questions that are appropriate for a court to decide      Do you agree with the reasoning in Powell v  McCormack  Why or why not     Do you agree with the reasoning in Baker v  Carr  Why or why not     Do you agree with the reasoning in Bush v  Gore  Why or why not   What power does the Supreme Court have to intervene in state election laws  as in Bush v  Gore      What role should the Supreme Court be playing in disputed elections       15  Which Supreme Court Justice do you believe your jurisprudence most closely resembles and why       16  When the Supreme Court issues non unanimous opinions  Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg frequently find themselves in disagreement with each other  Do you more frequently agree with Justice Scalia s opinions  or Justice Ginsburg s       17  Can you identify three Supreme Court cases that have not been reversed where you are critical of the Court s holding or reasoning and discuss the reasons for your criticism       These are just a dozen or so topic areas that are ripe for inquiry for any Supreme Court nominee  There are hundreds more       The sheer number of substantive areas of legitimate and important questioning is staggering  It underscores why the Supreme Court is so important  why the hearings are so central  and why these questions are so vital       And the answers to each and every one of these questions could have a profound effect on the daily lives of hundreds of thousands  if not millions  of people   That  s why asking these questions is not a whim  not a political game  not even a privilege  but the solemn obligation of the Senate to the country
