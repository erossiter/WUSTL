                                Charts Way to Build  7 Line Without Using MTA Funds  Also Lays Out Plan to Nearly Double Size of Javits Center      Schumer  We Can and Must Do Both  Build Downtown and Far West Side Today Senator Schumer laid out his vision for the West Side in a major speech to business leaders from the Partnership for New York City  He discussed how New York City s creeping  culture of inertia  could overwhelm the necessity of Far West Side development and put forth new thoughts and ideas on what should be done to move forward now that the stadium has been rejected  Schumer initiated the original Group of 35 that targeted far West Side for commercial residential growth       The text of Schumer  s remarks follows      Introduction    Is the  7 Extension and Future Commercial Development of the West Side In Jeopardy    Good morning  I  d like to talk about something very important to us all today    the future development of the West Side and the overall economic growth of our City  I  ve spoken on this topic before  but I am compelled to speak out right now in the wake of the Public Authorities Control Board  s rejection of the new stadium and because the MTA has recently submitted their current five year capital plan for approval by the MTA Capital Program Review Board  The Board is expected to approve or disapprove the MTA capital plan any day now       Recently we have heard whispers that the CPRB  which consists of representatives appointed by Governor Pataki  Mayor Bloomberg  Majority Leader Bruno and Speaker Silver  may not agree to approve the extension of the  7 subway line to the Far West Side  We hear that there are concerns that both the City and the MTA are overextended and that the commercial development the  7 will spur on the far West Side isn  t needed right now  or will compete with the rebuilding of Downtown       I believe the  7 line should and must be approved and I want to urge the members of the Board to approve the extension of the  7 and the MTA  s entire capital plan to keep the momentum going for the redevelopment of the Far West Side  I was religiously agnostic on the West Side Stadium because I felt it was so important that the other parts of the plan    the rezoning  expansion of the Javits Center and extension of the  7 line    happen  regardless of the stadium controversy       And so I chose to work with both sides    Mayor Bloomberg and Deputy Mayor Doctoroff  who were pushing the stadium  as well as Speaker Miller and other Council members  some of who opposed the stadium    to keep momentum going on the plan overall       The stadium debate is over now and we have come to a fork in the road  We can continue to delay projects    critical projects like the  7  turn our backs on the future  and feed the culture of inertia or we can move forward       Public transportation is what separates New York from almost every other American city  It is the reason that our city is growing once again in the 21st century  Mass transit allows our city greater density of population than any other in our country and with it comes a density of job opportunities  economic cross fertilization  cultural  educational and social opportunities  It is this very density  which only mass transit allows  that has always allowed our city to attract the wealthy  the middle class  and the poor  all seeking one or more of these opportunities  The density that mass transit facilitates is even more important to attracting these groups in our 21st Century information age society       It comes as no surprise then that the history of the City of New York teaches us that development follows subways  The Hudson Rail Yards is the last significant developable parcel in Midtown Manhattan and building the  7 extension will light a stick of development dynamite under the Far West Side       We must summon up not only the will to pursue the  7  rebuild Downtown  and pursue other grand plans  but I believe we must also commit more public dollars to large transportation oriented public works  New York faces stiff economic competition from other U S  cities and major cities across the globe and we need to invest in our own economic future  To do so we must push ahead with our long term goals    unlocking the potential of the less developed parts of the City like the Far West Side    while continuing the most vital work of rebuilding Downtown  We can and we must do both       The late Senator Pat Moynihan used to observe that while New York receives a lot of what he termed   disaster relief    from the Federal government    welfare  Medicaid and Section 8 housing dollars    we do not receive enough Federal dollars for things that generate economic activity and create jobs  like transportation and military bases  And just as Pat Moynihan fought to bring New York major transportation dollars  I have joined with our entire delegation in the fight to ensure that New York gets its fair share of Federal transportation funding       The House and Senate are currently in conference on the next major Federal transportation bill and we do not yet know what the final allocations will be  But even though Pat Moynihan is no longer here with us  New York will still do well  Our highway funding will likely increase around 20 percent to over  10 billion for the next six years  Our transit funding will increase well over 30 percent  providing at least  6 billion for the next six years  And in addition to those formula funds  New York will receive hundreds of millions in project earmarks       But to realize all the important projects we need  we must also boost our own capital investments at the City and State level  We used to be a City that was willing to make major investments in our economic future  but we have let inertia set in and a reluctance to make the fiscal sacrifices needed to build a better future for our City and the generations of New Yorkers to come      Group of 35   As many of you here recall  several years ago I helped create a task force  called the  Group of 35   which I chaired with former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin  It included chief executives and leaders in business  real estate  academia  labor and government  At that time  New York s real estate market was booming and the Group s mission was to identify areas within the City where we could build new office space to both attract and retain businesses  When the Group released its report in June of 2001  it projected the City would need 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to keep pace with projected job growth of almost 300 000 new office sector jobs       The Group s main recommendation was the creation of three new and expanded  Central Business Districts  in Downtown Brooklyn  Long Island City and the Far West Side of Manhattan  For the Far West Side  the Group specifically proposed creating at least 20 million square feet of new office space within the area west of 9th Avenue between 28th and 42nd Streets  expanding the Javits Center  rezoning the area  assembling development sites  creating open space and pedestrian friendly corridors  creating an Urban Business Campus  and most importantly extending the  7 Line to connect with Grand Central  Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal  The  7 line extension was to be the base upon which the other recommendations would successfully take root       When the Group of 35 report  entitled  Preparing for the Future  A Commercial Development Strategy for New York City   was released in June of 2001  there was general agreement that many of recommendations were urgently needed and both the public and private sectors should create a partnership to pursue them       Three months later our City was attacked and the country s economy started to slow  with New York being especially hard hit  Naturally and correctly  the recovery and rebuilding of Lower Manhattan became the focus for so many of us  In Congress we worked to obtain the  20 billion in funds needed to rebuild the City and that process continues today as we seek to get the last piece of that funding   2 billion for the Downtown JFK Airport Rail Link       But as we all know  New York is estimated to have lost approximately 250 000 jobs after 9 11 and I  and so many others  have made it our number one mission to help the City not only recover all the jobs lost after that horrible  tragic day  but grow and create even more jobs  History has shown that if New York City doesn  t grow  it dies  Those who say New York  s only goal and focus should be only bringing us back to where we were on September 10  2001 do not appreciate New York  s glorious past and our potential for an even greater future  Three and a half years after 9 11  my focus on job creation has only grown stronger  as I have seen too many New Yorkers still out of work and still in need of our help      Economic Growth in New York City   Every 40 years or so New York sheds its skin with a burst of public and private investment in transportation infrastructure  At the turn of the last century  New York built much of its remarkable subway system  which helped make the City one of the world s greatest  In the 1940s   50s and early  60s  Robert Moses was responsible for a massive expansion of New York s transportation infrastructure  until New Yorkers finally rebelled against his refusal to address the human costs of his projects  Nevertheless  Moses helped further build the New York region into an economic powerhouse       Now  as the 21st century dawns  New York must once again make major investments in its transportation system which will fuel the region s economic growth for the coming decades       Between 1990 and 2000  New York City s population grew by about 800 000 people and the metropolitan area grew by over 1 million people  more growth than our region had seen in decades  And that growth is being fueled largely by two dynamic groups of people    new immigrants from all over the world and creative  well educated  young people  flocking to New York from all over the country  Both groups of newcomers have spurred a fantastic renaissance of so many of our City s neighborhoods    Harlem  Green Point  Williamsburg  DUMBO  Red Hook  Bedford Stuyvesant and even the South Bronx   To make sure these newcomers succeed  our City must grow and must create new jobs  Much of our present growth is being fueled by this influx of newcomers and the concomitant residential real estate boom they create  But if they cannot find good paying jobs they and their successors will leave And I believe that we cannot create significant new and good paying jobs without significant new investments in transportation  Without them we will literally and economically stand still  And in today s competitive economy  to stand still  as I said  is to die       I believe we have a rare moment here in New York    we have strong political consensus on a number of key transportation projects needed for our region  including East Side Access  Second Avenue Subway  linking Lower Manhattan with Kennedy Airport   extending the  7 Line to the far West Side  and the cross harbor freight rail tunnel       And right now  fortuitously  funding for these projects can be found in a number of different pots    the reauthorization of TEA 21 and the annual Federal Transportation Appropriations process  our remaining September 11 funding  and bonding future revenues from the Far West Side       It is especially remarkable in that the City has not built a new rail line for 60 years  despite all the growth we have experienced  In so many ways we have never been more ready to expand our City  s transportation network  but I am fearful that there is a certain culture of inertia creeping into City  s efforts  That culture of inertia threatens to mar this grand experiment of the possible that we call New York City  Criticism predominates over construction  critics are given more weight than those trying to build and we all find it far too easy to second guess every decision    in political circles  in the news media  and in the public debate       We  ve always been a City that loves free thinking criticism  but it  s always been countered by a   can do    spirit  The culture of criticism doesn  t completely stop New York from growing because of capitalism  Someone can go ahead and build a small business or even a skyscraper on his or her own  The goal to make money overcomes the culture of criticism  But when it comes to large public works  where the profit motive vanishes and public pressure has great effect  we seem paralyzed and lacking in confidence       That is why there can be no   either or    question of Downtown vs  the Far West Side  We can  t choose one over the other or let one area lay fallow until the other is completed  I say this as someone who has devoted some portion of nearly every day of my life for the last three and a half years to helping our City rebuild and triumph from the devastating attack of 9 11  To insure our City  s future success it is our duty to see that our City continues to meet future economic demand and provide choices for employers and residents  Developers  companies  residents will each have their own needs and preferences for location  space and amenities  Some will be better served Downtown and some on the Far West Side  If New York is to keep growing and thriving  we must be ready to provide the broadest menu of options for employers and residents alike       Providing several different venues and then letting businesses and residents decide which they prefer is the tried and true free market way of New York and America  To simply have government choose one place and tell businesses and residents to take it or leave it will not inure to New York  s long term benefit      Enter the West Side    That is why I was so delighted when Mayor Bloomberg and Deputy Mayor Doctor off embraced so many of the Group of 35 s recommendations for the Far West Side and became such big boosters of that area  s potential  I want to compliment the Mayor and his team on their efforts so far  which I firmly believe will spur job creation  new housing development and benefit the entire City and metropolitan region       I also want to compliment Speaker Giff Miller and the members of the City Council  who not only provided their strong support back in January for much of the Mayor  s proposal  but made many improvements to the City  s plan  Thanks to the Council  s work  the project  s overall cost was reduced by  1 billion and significantly more affordable housing for low  and moderate income New Yorkers was added to the mix  While agreement could not be reached on the stadium  the teamwork of the entire City on the rest of the plan has already produced exciting results       The rezoning of the 42 black area west of Eighth Avenue for large scale development  has spurred widespread developer interest  Earlier this month  the New York Times reported that land prices in the area have more than doubled and developers are planning to build large new residential buildings  a 1 500 room hotel and even some commercial property       I also agree that the renovation and expansion of the Javits Center from its current 790 000 square feet to eventually 1 75 million square feet is long overdue and will have clear and immediate economic benefits to the entire region  New York City has been missing out on some of the largest and most lucrative conventions and trade shows  New York City reports that the Javits Center is currently unable to host the 60 largest conventions and trade shows in the United States  And there are also many smaller conventions that bypass Javits due to its lack of meeting rooms       The current proposed expansion will increase the number of meeting rooms tenfold and enable New York to attract the type of conventions  like the American Federation of Teachers or the American Veterinary Medical Association  that each account for over 15 000 hotel room nights and all the spending  from Broadway shows to restaurants to shopping  that accompanies those visitors  And I hardly need to tell this audience what the impact of that spending is    jobs and tax revenues for the City       But now that the stadium project  which would have included a large plenary space for conventions  is off the table  I believe it is worth revisiting the Javits expansion design and considering adding more space  possibly on the former stadium site over the Western Rail Yards  Plans for the stadium limited Javits to 1 75 million sq  ft  and only northward growth  with the rejection of the stadium we can think more grandly  The convention business is fast moving and competitive and we need to build in anticipation of where it is headed  Many other cities    Chicago  Orlando  Las Vegas  and Atlanta  for example    have invested far more in their convention infrastructure  Can  t New York do better       Why not consider expanding the Javits Center even further  perhaps to as much as 3 million square feet  which would make us the largest convention center in the United States  Why shouldn  t New York become the number one destination for both U S  and international conventions  Medium sized cities and their convention centers may be struggling  but we are in a different league  People the world over want to come to New York  Given the attractions of our city we can become the number one convention city for the world  And if the current convention center expansion may add 10 or 15 hotels  just imagine what a 3 million square foot project could do  The hotel jobs alone  which are such an important   ladder    into the workplace for low income and immigrant workers  would be worth benefit to our growing City       And just as we should think big on the Javits Center  we must think big on transportation  which will always be the most important driver of economic growth of our City  our region  and our State  As Senator  I have seen not only how a project like East Side Access or a Downtown link to JFK could spur economic growth in our region  but I have seen what a dramatic effect JetBlue s low cost flights from Kennedy Airport to Buffalo  Rochester and Syracuse have had on Upstate s economy or the exciting promise of the Rochester to Toronto fast ferry       And so to slow down or deny the necessary support for the  7 line extension would be shortsighted  and feed the dangerous culture of inertia that threatens to subsume our City  s appetite for grand public works projects      What the Critics Are Saying   Many thoughtful people have raised good questions about the need to extend the  7 line and where it fits into the City  s overall financial and economic development plans  We should certainly address their arguments  The chief concern raised is that investing in the  7 will spur commercial development in the Far West Side at the expense of Downtown       I certainly share the fear that many have that we are losing our focus on Downtown  The plans for a Goldman Sachs headquarters are on hold and security concerns threaten to bog down the Freedom Tower and other projects  And I have called on the Mayor  Governor and all our civic and business leaders to break the culture of inertia that seemed to envelop downtown rebuilding and to rededicate themselves to revitalizing Downtown  That is a clear moral imperative for us all       But I refuse to believe that this great City of eight million people cannot do the equivalent of walking and chewing gum at the same time    rebuild Downtown while also redeveloping the Far West Side       At the dawn of the last century  we built a subway system and grand public works like Grand Central Station  In the 1930s through 1960s we built a city highway system  Lincoln Center  and the World Trade Center  But there hasn t been a major public work built in this city for 50 years  Surely we can do both Downtown and the West Side  In fact  we must do both       Others take issue with different elements of the City  s and MTA  s financing proposal  Because neither the City nor the MTA can afford any more direct capital investments  this project relies on the creation of a new entity  the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation  HYIC   to float approximately  3 billion in bonds to fund the  7  construction of the platform over the Eastern Rail Yards  and creation of open space and streetscape improvements  HYIC  s bonds will be largely supported by allowing developers to purchase additional development rights and through an innovative type of financing known as   value capture     which closely resembles tax increment financing       Instead of collecting property taxes on new development in the area  the City will actually take ownership of any new buildings and lease them to developers for 30 years  While the  7 extension and the platform over the Eastern Rail Yards are being built  the City will cover the debt service for the bonds for a total estimated cost of around  1 billion over 10 years  Once developers start putting up projects  they will then make payments in lieu of taxes  PILOTs  and those payments will back the HYIC bonds and eventually provide the City with additional revenues  The City has discretion in the PILOTs it charges the developers and can offer them a substantial discount over what they would pay in property taxes as an incentive       Let me say right here that I think the   value capture    financing plan that the City created will succeed and Speaker Miller and the City Council deserve credit for shaving  1 billion off the costs of the original version  But I do not believe we need to give developers tax breaks    the reduced PILOTS    to get them to the West Side  That money should be used for the building of the  7 line if needed       There is already growing developer interest in the area and I see no evidence that reductions in PILOT payments    de facto tax breaks at the City  s expense    are needed  Traditionally in this City  infrastructure alone is sufficient to induce development  In the early part of the last century  when the City announced it was building the IRT subway line in the Bronx  the Grand Concourse was bought up and developed within a year  I expect the similar interest on the Far West Side  Once developers believe the  7 line expansion is for real they will flock to the area and property values and concomitant property tax collections will soar       As far as I am concerned  the  7 line IS the subsidy for that development and West Side developers should pay   full fare     The funds saved can be plowed back into the  7 line construction if overruns develop  or if not needed for the  7  into infrastructure investments elsewhere that benefit everyone  Generally  the City does best when it creates favorable conditions for development    adequate transportation and city services    and lets the market decide who comes to the table  rather than pick winners and losers with individual incentive packages       And by not offering extraordinary inducements to developers in the Far West Side  the City also ensures that our development efforts for Downtown will succeed  Downtown  which must overcome unique security concerns in the wake of 9 11  is the natural choice for providing deep tax incentives to lure employers in  I agree with those  such as Speaker Silver  who have said that we must provide extra assistance to businesses locating Downtown  We do not need to and should not provide similar breaks for businesses that locate on the Far West Side       There are also those that argue that we do not need to worry about the commercial development of the Far West Side now  the demand for office space is low citywide and residential development will be sufficient for now  But in truth  the timelines differ for the two areas and over the coming years  as New York City continues to grow  there will be enough demand for office space both on the West Side and in Lower Manhattan  These two important areas of the City do not have to compete       Many of the Lower Manhattan infrastructure projects are ready to start soon    the Santiago Calatrava PATH terminal and the MTA  s redesigned Fulton Center    and  we hope the Goldman Sachs building and other buildings on the World Trade Center site will commence construction soon  By comparison  the MTA would not start construction on the  7 line extension until 2006 and we wouldn  t expect to see a new commercial building until 2010 or 2011       New York City  s latest estimate  assuming that the metropolitan region grows at its past rate of 1 4 percent per year  is that the City will need 68 million sq  ft  of Class A office space by 2025  We can expect to build around 14 million sq  ft  in Lower Manhattan and another 24 million sq  ft  in the Far West Side  So even if we fully develop both areas  we will still need another 30 million sq  ft  just to keep up with current growth rates over the next 20 years       And if we fail to keep building at a healthy pace  we may find ourselves making the same mistake we made during the 1990s  when high vacancy rates and a lack of large developable sites led us to all but stop building large new developments  We all know what happened  from 1991 to 2003  Demand for space increased dramatically  there was a shortage of parcels for development  and the price for office space in Manhattan skyrocketed  As a result many new developers and businesses who wanted to stay in New York but could not afford it  went elsewhere  Northern New Jersey added 19 million sq  ft  of office space and lured quite a few businesses across the Hudson  Tens of thousands of other jobs went to more distant locations  like Tampa and Dallas and beyond  And while we can build new space for new and expanding businesses  the jobs lost to New Jersey and other locations are not coming back       Building the  7 will avoid this problem from repeating itself as the City starts growing again  The availability of new parcels on the Far West Side will increase supply    lack of new sites and their stratospheric costs is the number one hindrance to new development in the City  In 2015 instead of prime office space costing  for example   120 a square foot  it will only cost  95  keeping prime space affordable and keeping jobs growing  Thus the  7 line expansion will do more to retain and attract jobs to our City than individual tax breaks aimed scattershot at select companies seeking to locate on the far west side  The combination of tax breaks going to Downtown only  and the West Side getting the  7 line  is serendipitously complementary      MTA Finances   The other question about the   value capture    financing plan is whether it will offer sufficient safeguards for the MTA  s budget and ensure that the extension of the  7 does not compete with other key priorities such as East Side Access and Second Avenue Subway  I would submit that if done right  expansion of the  7 line will not interfere with other mass transit priorities   Given the precarious state of the MTA  s finances  and its earlier willingness to sell off the development rights to Hudson Rail Yards without a competitive bidding process  it is certainly legitimate to question the details of the City  s proposal for extending the  7  The MTA  s Capital Plan says that the City will cover 100 percent of the  2 billion cost of extending the  7  but the details are a bit more complex than that  Two issues have not yet been resolved that could potentially cost the MTA money    development of the Eastern Rail Yards and coverage of potential project cost overruns       It is especially important that the City make a commitment that the extension of the  7 does not drain funds away from other MTA priorities  While I believe the   value capture    financing plan should cover the costs of the  7 extension and other infrastructure improvements  the City should have a backup plan if there are unforeseen cost overruns  The city can and should pledge what may be one billion in the reduced PILOT tax breaks to construction of the  7 instead should there be cost overruns  The MTA should pledge the dollar from the sale of air rights over the East Rail Yards to go to the  7 as well if they are needed  And as a last resort  we should consider an increase in the hotel tax  should the  7 project  s costs skyrocket  The extension of the  7 will produce clear and quantifiable benefits for the hotel industry as it makes the convention center and the City in general more of a destination for visitors around the world  The industry should pledge some of those benefits back if they are needed       The MTA has serious capital financing problems with both keeping its existing stock in good shape and in building important new projects like East Side Access and the Second Avenue Subway  I believe the City  State  and Federal governments should be doing more to help the MTA out with this large and important problem  But those very real and equally important problems should not be an excuse to holding up the  7 line  The  7 line project can and will be a tub that floats on its own bottom and pays its own way  With   value capture    financing  asking developers to pay their full PILOTs  the increased proceeds from the East Rail Yards airspace  and  as a last resort a temporary increase in the hotel tax  the  7 will pay its own way  It should not interfere with MTA financing of other needs  like East Side Access and Second Avenue Subway      Conclusion   As I have also said recently  I am fearful that there is a certain culture of inertia creeping into City  s recent efforts at public works projects  I am also fearful that as a City and region  we are no longer willing to make the public investments necessary to foster economic growth       Throughout our City  s history  development and economic growth have followed the same pattern    we build a subway line and businesses and jobs follow  We are now about to determine the fate of that  7 line  and subsequently  the fate of the whole Far West Side Central Business District  We must build it       Once again  I call on the MTA Capital Program Review Board to approve the Agency  s capital plan and for all of us to join together to do whatever it takes to move the  7 line extension and all our other important priorities forward  To do otherwise would be shortsighted  and feed the dangerous culture of inertia that threatens to subsume our City  s appetite for grand public works projects
