Surge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Math And Science Skills Are Key to Ensuring that Upstate NY Remains on the Cutting Edge   High Skill  High Tech Jobs Expected to Jump More than 15 percent by 2012  while Low Skill Jobs to Drop 10 percent        Senator Pushes  America Competes Act    Could Send Millions to Upstate NY Businesses  Research Centers  and Schools        Schumer Report Shows Significant Surge in High S U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced that the U S  Senate is expected to approve his  Math for America  legislation tomorrow as part of the America COMPETES Act later today   Schumer s bi partisan legislation would dramatically bolster local and federal efforts to recruit the best and brightest to become math and science teachers  and increase retention of excellent math and science teachers  Schumer also released a new  detailing how the number of high tech jobs in every region of the state is expected to grow significantly by 2012  as the number of low skill jobs declines  Schumer will say that well   trained math and science students are the fuel that will power the upstate New York economy into the future and without them  the recent surge in the high tech industry could falter         The bottom line is our tech boom could be on the verge of bust  The number of high tech jobs in upstate New York is going way up  but if we don t act fast  we won t have the well trained workers need to fill those jobs   Schumer said   Current high school students are the fuel that power New York s economic engine and without better training they won t be able to compete on the international stage   My legislation will go a long way toward improving math and science education for students in upstate New York and across the country         Schumer s bi partisan legislation would create two separate programs  the National Science Foundation  NSF  Teaching Fellows program and the NSF Masters Teaching Fellows Program  The first fellowship is available to math and science professionals  while the second is designed for existing teachers who already hold a masters degree in math or science education  Both fellowships require applicants to take a highly rigorous test to demonstrate their expertise        If selected  professionals receive a scholarship to attend a one year Master s degree program in Teaching that results in certification   They then commit to teach for four years in a high need school  and receive bonus payments on top of their salaries  Existing teachers receiving fellowships will get the bonus payments in return for acting as leaders in their schools        Prospective teachers with strong math and science backgrounds  as well as working teachers who have solid expertise in their fields  are often lured away from teaching by more lucrative and prestigious opportunities in the private sector         The goal of the program is to create a new flood of highly qualified math and science teachers  ensuring that students in upstate New York and across the country receive the best preparation possible in these most vital fields         The global market place demands that the next generation of America s workers receive top notch training in math and science   Schumer added   Without it  high tech companies will look outside of upstate New York or even the United States to fill their workforce   We want to attract businesses to come to upstate  but they will look the other way if they don t have a highly skilled workforce from which to hire         Today  Schumer released a new report showing that demand for highly skilled  high tech jobs is expected to skyrocket and demand for low skilled and manufacturing jobs is on the decline   Currently  there are over 40 000 unfilled

decrease in manufacturing jobs since 2000        In order to help upstate New York businesses  research centers  and schools compete on the international level  Schumer today also announced his strong support for The America COMPETES Act   set to be approved by the U S  Senate this afternoon that would provide much needed resources to bolster advanced research and American competitiveness        The America Competes Act  s 761 would provide billions in new federal funding to enhance research in advanced and experimental research  strengthen educational opportunities in science  technology  engineering  and math from elementary through graduate school  and develop an infrastructure that will enhance innovation and competitiveness in the United States  Schumer and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton teamed up to have the Math for America program adopted as part of this the America COMPETES legislation        Among other programs  the comprehensive legislation would                    National Science and Technology Summit   The legislation would require the President to convene a National Science and Technology Summit to evaluate the nation s science and technology enterprises   After the summit  the President would be required to issue a report identifying key research and technology challenges and recommending areas of investment for federal research and technology programs                    Expand Mathematics  Science  and Engineering Education at the Dept  of Energy   The bill would create a Director of Mathematics  Science and Engineering Programs within DOE   The director would oversee a  160 million competitive grant program to assist states in establishing or expanding public specialty schools for math and science  The director would coordinate a  100 000 per year  per awardees  grant program for early career scientists and engineers pursing innovative  independent research                    Innovation Promotion  The bill directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  to   1  establish an Aeronautics Institute for Research   2  coordinate basic and fundamental research activities related to physical sciences  technology  engineering  and mathematics  and  3  establish a Basic Research Executive Council
