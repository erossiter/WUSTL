IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 30  2006 Schumer To Gargano  Scrap New Javits Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator asks Gargano to Go Back to the Drawing Board and Create a 2 Million Square Foot Convention Center Today U S  Senator Charles called on Charles Gargano  Chairman of the ESDC and the Javits K  Javits Center Development Corporation  to scrap the expansion plans released this week and go back to the drawing board to create a bigger  more enticing convention center  Expansion details for the Javits Center were rolled out this week  but the plan for the new building fall short of the original northern expansion goals  creates a les than ideal vertical space  cuts off future southern expansion  and fails to create the kind of convention center capable of effectively competing with other top U S  cities  Schumer said          Thinking small won  t keep New York the capital of the world     Schumer said    The greatest city in the world must have a convention center grand enough to attract the biggest and most lucrative conventions  The bottom line on the plan released this week is  it is too small  and is poorly laid out  meaning we will lose ground to our competitors and we still won t land the mega conventions we now miss out on  The ESDC proposal is a huge disappointment  half a loaf has never been what New York is about          Though original estimates had the expanded building at 1 45 million square feet  the plans unveiled this week showed a significantly smaller space at approximately 1 3 million square feet that will cost far more than originally planned  and results in a convention center that is still far smaller than the convention centers in Chicago and Las Vegas  Orlando  Atlanta and others that repeatedly bring in the biggest and most lucrative conventions        In his letter to Gargano  Schumer outlined the key reasons that the proposed new convention center is not big enough for New York City  They include       The proposed Javits Convention Center expansion is too small to attract the marquee shows  conferences and exhibitions that a larger expansion would draw to New York City  This expansion would add roughly 250 000 square feet of exhibition space to the existing 760 000 square feet currently usable at Javits  New York  s exhibition space would lag significantly behind Chicago  s McCormack Park with 2 3 million square feet and Las Vegas with 3 2 million square feet as well as several other convention centers around the country       New exhibition space in the proposed Javits expansion is not prime exhibition space  Convention planners  exhibitors and attendees value contiguous  grade level space for their shows  This prime space allows visitors to   walk the show    on one level and exhibitors to be right in the center of the action  The Javits expansion is adding only 110 000 square feet of prime contiguous space  Earlier proposals for expansion of Javits called for nearly twice this amount of space and in reality  New York needs much  much more to attract bigger shows        A vertical expansion at Javits will be costly and difficult to use  To replace the prime exhibition space that has been stripped from the current proposal  the new plan calls for more than 100 000 square feet to be added to a newly constructed Level 6  Accessing this space will require exhibitors to bring trucks and loading materials up a 5 story corkscrew ramp and visitors to leave the main show area to view those vendors  This will inherently add a significant loading cost for vendors and inconvenience visitors        Building residential and office towers south of the Javits Convention Center limits future growth  The plan to subsidize the Javits expansion by building two residential and two commercial buildings directly adjacent to the facility will preclude a natural expansion of Javits to the south  Nationally  the convention center business is growing and New York  s inability to grow with it will make us less competitive in the long term        Relocating the Marshalling Yards to 39th Street just doesn  t make sense  Instead of rehabilitating the current yards on 34th street or relocating them to State or City owned property off the site  the current proposal would place them to the north of the convention center  This prevents the addition of nearly 100 000 sf of prime exhibition space between 39th 40th St  and hinders future expansion to the north of Javits        New York City is in jeopardy of losing current shows that need to grow and were counting on a significant expansion of Javits  While some new shows may come to New York  many that are currently here are banking on a significant expansion of Javits that they can grow into  These shows may look elsewhere rather than be crammed into sub prime  inaccessible space        In 2004  consulting firm Price Waterhouse Coopers  PWC  was commissioned by the New York Convention Center Operating Corporation to study the feasibility of an expanded Javits Center  PWC concluded that the demand for space in New York City could potentially accommodate a 2 million square foot convention center  of which 1 million square feet would be prime contiguous space    The bottom line is  New York can sustain and profit from a 2 million square foot convention center     Schumer said        The study worked from the assumption that the maximum expansion of the Javits center would create 1 341 million square feet of exhibition space  727 000 of which would be prime  contiguous space  The current Javits exhibition space total is 760 000 square feet with 410 000 square feet of prime contiguous space  The proposed expansion would be 1 02 million total exhibition space with 520 700 prime  The current proposal is 240 000 square feet short of prime  contiguous space that PWC recommended and believed was feasible to build          I would urge the ESDC to take another close  hard look at how we can achieve a northern and southern expansion to meet this ambitious goal     Schumer said       In 1993 New York hosted 25 of the top 200 trade shows  Today New York City hosts 14  Practically every other city is investing in their convention center facilities  so New York City will continue to slip competitively
