IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 26  2005 Schumer  Gonzales Genuinely Good Man  Lacks Independence And Openness To Be Good Attorney General

                                   Hearings Show Still Sees Role as Presidential Counsel  Not Attorney General US Senator Charles E  Schumer delivered the following statement at today s Judiciary Committee vote on the nomination of the Honorable Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States        Mr  Chairman  I have to be honest with you  this has been one of the most difficult votes on a nominee I ve had to make since coming to the Senate       I like Judge Gonzales  I respect him  I think he s a gentleman and a genuinely good man       We ve worked well together  especially when it s come to filling the vacancies on New York s federal bench  He s been candid with me  he s been open to compromise        Our interactions haven t just been cordial  they ve been pleasant  I ve enjoyed the give and take we ve engaged in       When President Bush nominated Judge Gonzales to be Attorney General  my initial reaction was positive  Unlike with judicial nominations which are for life  Cabinet officers serve the President and I generally believe we should show deference to his choices       I was inclined to support Judge Gonzales  I believed   and I said publicly   that Judge Gonzales was a much less polarizing figure than Senator Ashcroft had been        But being less polarizing than John Ashcroft isn t enough  alone  to get my vote        Even if you are    as Judge Gonzales is    a good person with top notch legal qualifications  you still must have the independence necessary to be the nation s chief law enforcement officer       The Attorney General is unlike all the other Cabinet officers  For those other Cabinet officers  simply carrying out the President s agenda is enough  But to be a good Attorney General  unqualified deference to the President isn t enough       Unlike all the other Cabinet positions where your role is to implement and advance the President s policies  as Attorney General    as the nation s chief law enforcement officer  your job is to enforce the law  all the laws  whether they help or hurt the Administration s objectives        The position requires a greater degree of independence than  for example  the Secretary of State  whose obligation is to advance the President s interests abroad       When the White House asks the Justice Department   Can we do X    the Justice Department is charged with giving an objective answer  not one tailored to achieve the President s goals        There are two models for an Attorney General  loyalist and independent       We all know that there have been Attorneys General over the years who have been close to the President   there s no better example than Robert F  Kennedy who served his own brother        That said  no one ever doubted that  in the confines of the Oval Office  Bobby Kennedy would oppose his brother if he though the President was wrong       Judge Gonzales is more of a loyalist than an independent  That alone certainly doesn t disqualify him  But it does raise concerns       After an extensive review of the record  unfortunately and sadly  and despite my great personal affection for Judge Gonzales  his testimony before the Committee turned me around and changed my vote from yes to no       He was so circumspect in his answers  so unwilling to leave a micron of space between his views and the President s  that I now have real doubts whether he can perform the job of Attorney General  In short  Judge Gonzales still seems to see himself as counsel to the President  not Attorney General  the chief law enforcement officer of the land       I d like to give a little history       Judge Gonzales came and saw me back in December  We had a good conversation about a range of topics        I respected and appreciated his commitment to recuse himself from the investigation into the felony disclosure of then covert CIA agent Valerie Plame s identity       I told him that I understand that 9 11 created a brave new world and the war on terror required a reassessment of the rules of war        I told him that given the enemies we now face  we can t afford to be doctrinaire        I told him that I support the Administration when it comes to aggressively re examining the way we do business and interrogate witnesses  I agree that we have to make sure we re doing everything we can to protect American families from those who would do us harm        But I also told Judge Gonzales that I was troubled that the Administration had undertaken its reworking   or reinterpretation    of the rules of war behind closed doors rather than engaging Congress  the American public  and the international community in an open and direct fashion        Time and time again  this Administration has gotten itself in trouble by trying to go it alone rather than doing business out in the open  Whether it was the Total Information Awareness Project  the TIPS program  or torture  they ve been burned by their peculiar penchant for secrecy        So I encouraged him to be candid with the Committee when discussing these issues  I encorauged him to give us some hope that he would run a very different Justice Department than John Ashcroft s       Unfortunately  even a cursory review of his answers reveals strict adherence to the White House line and barely a drop of independence       A set of answers very important to me came in response to my questions on the nuclear option       When we met privately  I asked Judge Gonzales about his position on the constitutionality of the nuclear option  He said he hadn t recently reviewed the applicable constitutuonal clauses and that  in any event  it was a matter reserved for the Senate       I asked Judge Gonzales to look at the Constitution and told him I d ask the question again at the hearing  I informed him that his answer on this question would weigh heavily in my decision whether to support his confirmation       At the hearing  when I asked Judge Gonzales about the nuclear option  rather than being candid  he ducked  dodged  and weaved        I asked him three times to give us an opinion and each time he refused       I asked him twice more in writing and again he refused to answer       In one of those questions  I asked him to imagine he was counsel to a United States Senator who was seeking his opinion on the constitutionality of the nuclear option  Again  he refused to answer       This is a crucial issue for me for two reasons  first  the importance of the nuclear option and second  the importance of Judge Gonzales  independence as Attorney General       I believe the nuclear option would be so deeply destructive that it would turn the United States Senate into a legislative wasteland  Madison s  cooling saucer  would be shattered into shards  It s something you d expect to see from banana republics  not the Grand Old Party       The nuclear option is Alice in Wonderland meets the Twilight Zone  but with very real consequences       It s patently obvious that the Constitution doesn t require an up or down vote on a judicial nominee  And it should have been easy for Judge Gonzales to say so       But he refused  And that pattern repeated itself  On question after question  on torture and nearly everything else  it almost seemed like Judge Gonzales was going out of his way to avoid answering us  He demonstrated a lack of straightforwardness and independence  For me  that is the straw which broke the camel s back        If his answers are any indication  Judge Gonzales still sees himself as a White House counsel  rather than a nominee to be Attorney General       The Attorney General  as chief law enforcement officer  requires independent judgment and an ability at crucial times to stand up to the President       I was hoping that we d see an independent Alberto Gonzales  Instead we saw someone who  almost robotically  continues to hew to the Administration line        When push comes to shove  the Attorney General needs to be able to stand up to the White House  Judge Gonzales  answers don t show that kind of independence       We live in crucial times  The age old struggle between security and liberty which defined so many of the Founding Fathers  debates is alive and kicking  In fact  at no time since the internment of Japanese citizens in World War II  has it been more relevant       We should have open debate about where the lines should be drawn  We should not be afraid to confront the difficult questions that face us        I ve gotten in trouble with many on the Left for suggesting that there should be a re examination of how we interrogate terror suspects  If a terrorist knew where a nuclear bomb was in an American city and we had 30 minutes to find out where  my guess is everyone in this room would say   Do what it takes        But we can t just remake the rules behind closed doors        Judge Gonzales  hearing was an opportunity for a real debate on these issues  Instead  we got canned answers       I have great respect for Judge Gonzales  He has the kind of Horatio Alger story that makes us all so proud to be Americans  It s truly an amazing country when a man can rise from such humble beginnings to be nominated Attorney General of the United States       And I am mindful of the fact that  if he is confirmed as I anticipate he will be  Judge Gonzales will become the nation s first Hispanic Attorney General  It s a tremendous success story that makes this vote even more difficult       When I called Judge Gonzales last night to tell him how I d be voting  he was understandably disappointed  but he was  as always  a total gentleman  He assured me we d continue working together to solve our nation s problems  He assured me he d prove me wrong and I hope he does       But this is just too significant a job at too important a time to have an Attorney General about whom I have such severe doubts        I really have no choice but to  with sadness  vote  no
