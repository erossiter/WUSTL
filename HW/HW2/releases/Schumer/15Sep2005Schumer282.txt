IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 15  2005 Confirmation Hearing Of Judge John G  Roberts  Jr  Statement Of Senator Charles E  Schumer   As Prepared For Delivery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  made the following statement at the conclusion of the questioning period at the confirmation hearing of Judge John G  Roberts  Jr  for Chief Justice of the United States    Let me say a few concluding words here  First Judge thanks for holding up so well during three days of grueling questions        Judge  many of us on this committee have been wrestling with how to vote on your nomination since well before the hearings started and that process has accelerated now  I for one wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it and have been unsure how to vote       My colleague from Delaware was on to something when he called this a role of the dice  But this is a vote on the chief justice of the Supreme Court  You will in all likelihood affect every one of our lives in many ways for a whole generation  This is not just rolling the dice  this is betting the whole house        So I thought I  d share with you where some of us are in our thoughts  As with any important question  there are pros and cons        On the pro side is first of all your brilliance  You have an amazing knowledge of the law  spent three days here talking about so many aspects of it without any paper in front of you at all  without a single aid whispering a word in your ear or passing you a note  Your knowledge of the law and your way of presenting it is a tour de force  You may very well possess the most powerful intellect of any person to come before the Senate for this position       Second is that you seem to be a lawyer above all  You have devoted your entire adult life to the law and it is clear that you love it  Most people in that position tend not to be ideologues  but will follow the law wherever it takes them regardless of the consequences  You have repeatedly professed that to be true for you  but given that you spent most of you r legal life representing others  and that your limited tenure on the court of appeals didn t allow you to rule on very many non technical cases there is not a long enough track record to prove that point       Third and perhaps most important is your judicial philosophy of modesty and stability  Such a theory respects precedent  the Congress  and other judge  s opinions  Modest jurists tend not to be ideologues and many of us on this side of the aisle would like the court to maintain and in cases related to the commerce clause like Morrison  increase  its modesty        But in complicated decisions like this one  there is almost always a counterpoint  Yesterday you said that the decision of Brown v  Board could be described as modest  Breathtaking  wonderful  reversing 80 years of accepted but bad law yes  But modest  Could overturning Wickard  or Roe  also be modest within your definition  Nonetheless  your philosophy of modesty is an appealing and important philosophy to many of us        On the con side is the question of compassion and humanity  I said on the first day of these hearings that it is important to determine not just the quality of you mind  but the fullness of your heart    the ability to truly empathize with those who are less fortunate and who often need the protections of the government and the assistance of the law to have any chance at all        It didn  t seem much  for instance  to concede that the wording of   illegal amigos    was unfortunate yet you refused to say so  America has in the 21st century moved beyond the cramped view of civil rights professed in the early Reagan administration  but you would not admit in 2005 that any of those views you argued for in the early 80s were misguided  That is troubling        Second  is the refusal of the administration to let us see any documents you wrote when you served as Deputy Solicitor General  when you were not simply following policy but making it  This would have given us tremendous insight into who you are and what kind of justice you would make  But  for what seemed to be self serving reasons  they were refused  This was not your decision  but you carry its burden and we must consider this refusal when weighing how to vote        Third and most important on the con side is your refusal to answer so many of our questions  I know you feel you were more forthcoming than most other nominees to the high court  but I must disagree  You were more forthcoming than a few    I do not know Justice Scalia  s opinion on Dr  Zhivago  for instance    but most answered more relevant questions than you did  Your refusal to comment on any issue that you thought may come before the court  your views on older  completely discredited cases like Lochner  Plessy  Korematsu  are of very little help to us  makes it very hard to figure out what kind of justice you will be  particularly in light of the fact that we have very little else to go on other than your assurances  You did speak at length on many issues and sounded like you were conveying your views to us  but when one went back and read the transcript each evening  there was less than met the ear that afternoon  Perhaps that is the job of a good litigator  but in too many instances it didn  t serve the purpose of the hearing        Having said that  obtaining documents and answering questions are a means to an end not an end in itself  In some cases  such as Miguel Estrada  s nomination we had no knowledge of his views  and had no idea of what kind of judge he would make  In your case there clearly is some evidence        We must now take the evidence we have and try to answer the fundamental question  What kind of Justice will John Roberts be  Will you be a truly modest  temperate  careful judge in the tradition of Harlan  Jackson  Frankfurter  and Friendly  Will you be a very conservative judge who will impede Congressional prerogatives  but does not use the bench to remake society  like Justice Rehnquist  Or will you use your enormous talents to use the Court to turn back a near century of progress and create the majority that Justices Scalia and Thomas could not achieve  This is the question we on this committee will be grappling with this week
