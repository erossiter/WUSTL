                                   Maritime Administration Agrees to An Extension Until April 2007 to Give Local Community Coalition The Time It Needs To Raise Enough Funds To Repair The Ship For Relocation To WNY   U S S  Sphinx Would Serve As A Museum For The Community And Monument To The Large Population Of Veterans In New York State                                                                                         Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Brian Higgins welcomed news from the Maritime Administration  MARAD  that it has granted an extension to the Dunkirk Historical Lighthouse and Veterans Museum to raise the money necessary to transport the U S S Sphinx  a storied landing craft  from Virginia  to its new home in Dunkirk  NY  Under the new extension  the community coalition will have until April 3  2007 to ensure adequate funding  The ship will become a floating museum for the community and training facility for various U S  Army  Navy and Coast Guard units   The current deadline is set to expire this month          This is a step in the right direction in bringing the U S S  Sphinx to its home in Dunkirk to honor our veterans     Senator Schumer said    A large population of Landing Ship Tank veterans resides in New York State  and the proposed floating museum would showcase this community  s great respect for the sacrifice of past patriots  The officers and volunteers of the Dunkirk Historical Lighthouse and Veteran  s Park Museum have made heroic efforts to raise the funds to bring the ship to Dunkirk  The veterans have worked tirelessly to save this ship  and I am happy they now have the extra time needed            This is a very positive step for everyone who wants to bring the U S S  Sphinx to Dunkirk  This extension is a testament to the hard work of the local community to raise money  awareness and support for the campaign to bring this important potential tourist attraction to Dunkirk  I am pleased that we were able to convince the Maritime Administration to grant this extension and I will continue to work with the community and with MARAD so we can give people the best chance to complete their fundraising efforts     Senator Clinton said         This extension is welcome news for New York s veterans  getting the Sphinx to Dunkirk is a testament to their service to our country   I am hopeful that the  Journey to Dunkirk  group will meet their fundraising goals and with the great support of the local community  make Dunkirk the proud home for the U S S  Sphinx     said Rep  Higgins       In October of 2005  MARAD put a one year donation hold on the disposal of the U S S  Sphinx  delaying the scheduled disposal date until October 2006  on the grounds that the   Journey to Dunkirk    group had presented MARAD with a sound fundraising plan   Another year long extension would give the group the time they need to complete their efforts   The U S S  Sphinx is one of the last remaining Landing Ship Tanks  LST  vessels  which served the U S  Navy in World War II  Korea  Vietnam and elsewhere   President Bush signed the ship over to the Dunkirk Historical Lighthouse and Veteran  s Park Museum in December of 2002  The officers intend to preserve the U S S  Sphinx as a floating museum  In addition  the U S S  Sphinx will be used as a training facility for the U S  Navy Sea Cadet Units  U S  Army Junior ROTC units  and units from the U S  Coast Guard  The ship will also house the Lancaster Ham Radio Station  In recent months  the museum  s Board of Directors has held public events featuring its plans for the ship which generated significant media attention and community support for fundraising efforts        In a personal letter last month to Sean T Connaughton  the Maritime Administrator for the United States Department of Transportation  Schumer  Clinton and Higgins wrote    Please consider granting another one year extension on the disposal of the U S S  Sphinx   We are confident that the efforts of the   Journey to Dunkirk   veterans will succeed if they are given enough time to follow through on their proposal   We appreciate your consideration of their interest and efforts  and look forward to continue working with you on this and other issues that impact the citizens of New York
