IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 22  2007 Following Last Week s Body Tissue Indictments In Rochester  Schumer Announces Legislation To Plug Gaping Holes In Tissue Transplant Industry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Last Week an Unsealed Indictment Charged 7 in Rochester with Stealing 36 Bodies to Sell Tissue to Biomedical Companies   The Body Tissue Black Market Damages the Health of Patients Seeking Life Saving Tissue Transplants and the Family Members of those Affected   Schumer Announces Legislation to Strengthen Regulations on the Tissue Transplant Industry  Surprise Inspections  Str Following last Thursday s unsealed indictment charging seven individuals in Rochester  NY for illegally harvesting 36 bodies for body tissue to sell biomedical companies  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced he will reintroduce his legislation to strengthen regulations on the tissue transplant industry  Schumer noted that yesterday s indictment highlighted the insufficient regulatory oversight for tissue transplants which allow for potentially contaminated tissue to be transplanted into otherwise healthy patients          Yesterday s indictment underscores a new problem that is not only profoundly troubling  but also threatens the health of the very individuals who believe they are receiving life saving treatments   said Senator Schumer   My legislation will take the necessary steps to tighten up regulations in the tissue transplant industry so patients can have restored confidence in the system          Thursday s unsealed indictment highlighted the current lack of restrictions regulating the exchange and sale of transplanted tissues  The indictment charged three funeral home directors and four former employees of a Rochester branch of the Biomedical Tissue Services  a biomedical supply company  with secretly removing skin  bone and other body parts without consent from 36 corpses in 2005         Despite tissue transplantation being similar to organ transplantation  the industry is regulated much more loosely in comparison  While organ donors are only identified by doctors in hospitals  tissue donations can come out of funeral homes or morgues  Although the companies that test and sterilize tissue must be registered with the FDA  they are only inspected when the FDA decides there has been a risk associated with the bank   Exacerbating the issue is that tissue transplantation is used by certain companies as a profit making machine  utilizing materials desperately needed by patients for personal monetary gain       Under the current system  the transfer of tissue between the donor and the recipient features several stages  opening up the process to improper and illegal behavior  In many instances  after a donor is identified either at a hospital  morgue  crematorium  or funeral home  it must be determined that the cause of death is not detrimental to the health and quality of the tissue  The tissue is then purchased by a tissue bank  which is responsible for retrieving  processing  storing  and distributing the tissue  Finally  the tissue banks are allowed to distribute the materials to additional companies before they finally reach a hospital  Even though the tissue has been exchanged numerous times by numerous sources before its final destination at the hospital  the hospital is not required to do any final testing on the tissue       To combat this growing problem  today Senator Schumer pushed to reintroduce his legislation to regulate the tissue transplant industry  His legislation would specifically            Require the FDA to conduct surprise inspections of tissue banks at least once every two years         Require the FDA to develop or approve an accreditation system for tissue banks         Require tissue banks to meet strict minimum standards for providing adequate information to donor families and obtaining truly informed consent        Create new civil and criminal penalties for bad actors  up to a  250 000 fine and or 10 years in prison        Require FDA to define the term  reasonable processing fee    It is currently illegal to buy and sell tissue  but it is legal to charge  reasonable processing fees    This term has never been defined  and can currently be used by for profit tissue banks to make money off of body parts       This legislation will work to safeguard patients against being implanted with possibly contaminated tissue that was acquired illegally from corpses  and will protect the family members having to be affected by these tragic incidents   add Senator Schumer        The owner of Biomedical Tissue Services  Michael Mastromarino  was charged along with three other men last year for removing bone and tissue without the permission of families from 1 077 bodies at more than a dozen funeral homes in New Jersey  Philadelphia  New York City and Rochester  In Rochester  the affected bodies included 23 bodies at Thomas E  Burger Funeral Home in the suburb of Hilton  11 bodies at Profetta Funeral Chapel in the suburb of Webster and two bodies at Serenity Hills Funeral Chapel in Rochester
