                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Schumer  a Member of the Finance Committee also Successfully Included AMT Relief  College Tuition Deduction and a Windfall Profits Tax on Big Oil The U S  Senate is poised to pass a  60 billion tax reconciliation bill that contains a  2 billion tax credit for the Downtown JFK rail link  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  a member of the Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over tax matters  successfully secured the provision in the bill to provide the  2 billion tax credit for the JFK Rail link as well as an extension of Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  relief and the college tuition deduction  which he originally authored and passed in 2001 The bill passed the Finance Committee late last night and will be on the Senate floor today         The inclusion of these provisions in the tax bill is going to be a boon to New Yorkers from every walk of life     Schumer said    The two billion dollar tax credit is a necessary shot in the arm for the rail link and downtown development  the AMT relief will save thousands of New Yorkers from facing a big tax increase next year  and the college tuition deduction is going to provide necessary help to New York Students          Senator Schumer was able to successfully include a  2 billion tax credit available to New York City and New York State to be used for public transportation infrastructure projects in or connecting with the New York Liberty Zone  This funding represents a major victory for the rail link from Lower Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport  This  2 billion was provided as part of honoring the commitment made by President Bush and the Congress to provide New York with  20 billion to aid the post 9 11 recovery  As part of that original  20 billion commitment  Congress included a  5 billion Liberty Zone tax incentive program in the   Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002     Unfortunately  due to the continuing weakness of New York  s economy  over  2 billion of the tax incentives have gone unutilized and Schumer has sought to convert those unused incentives into other projects that could benefit Lower Manhattan         We have a once in a generation chance to connect Downtown to Kennedy Airport and Long Island  which will spur new business development  create jobs Downtown  and ensure the entire New York City region s economic growth for generations to come     Schumer said    Building a rail link to Kennedy Airport and the labor pool of Long Island  will be especially important to businesses considering staying or moving to Downtown  This bill  s passing will be big win for all of New York            This is a huge victory not only for Lower Manhattan  but all of New York City  This has been a long and hard fought effort to ensure that New York receives the aid it was promised after 9 11 and the provision in the Finance Committee  s bill will give the City and State the flexibility it needs to properly plan the ongoing reconstruction and revitalization in Lower Manhattan  I will continue to work with Senator Schumer  the New York delegation and the citizens of New York City to ensure that this critical provision remains in the final bill     said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton       The rail project is expected to cost  6 billion  The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has already committed  560 million to the project and the MTA has  400 million in its capital plan for this project  Combined with these initial contributions  a redeployment of the available portions of the tax package for this project would represent a substantial amount toward the total required  and would give the momentum necessary to raise the remaining funds       This past Election Day  November 8th  voters approved a Transportation Bond Act which earmarked  100 million dollars for this project            In addition to the  2 billion dollar tax credit  the bill extends the college tuition deduction through 2009  It currently expires at the end of the year  This has been a priority for Senator Schumer for the past 6 years  and the extension of this deduction will save New Yorker college students and their families millions of dollars  IRS data from 2003 shows that more than 238 000 families in New York benefited from the provision that year  The provision provides a deduction of up to  4 000 for people earning  65 000 or less  or 130K for joint filers              The bill extends AMT relief for one more year  The 2001 tax cut had a temporary  patch  for the AMT because several of the Bush tax cuts would have the perverse effect of pushing more people into the AMT  It increased the basic AMT exemption by  6 500 for singles and  13 000 for joint filers on a temporary basis  It has been extended through 2005  but it expires at the end of the year  The Finance bill extends it one year  through 2006  It is the biggest single item in the bill  at  27 2 billion  More than 300 000 New York families will benefit from the provision            The Finance Committee bill also included a  5 billion   windfall profits tax    on Big Oil  created by changing the accounting procedures major oil companies are allowed to use for reporting their 2005 profits  The  5 billion offset was part of a Schumer amendment that was accepted by the Finance Committee
