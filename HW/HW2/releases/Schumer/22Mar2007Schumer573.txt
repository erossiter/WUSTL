                                 Record Surge in Demand for New Passports  with More Than 1 Million Passport Applications Coming in Last Month Alone   Schumer Announces New Legislation to Allow Dept  of State to Hire Back More Trained Passport Processors and New Push for a WNY Office to Deal With Record Local Demand   Staffing Shortage and Passport Application Explosion have Created Unprecedented Backlog that Th Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a new plan to counteract the growing chaos at overwhelmed passport processing centers that has caused interminable turnaround times for new passports   Against a backdrop of confusion and concern over new travel restrictions  Schumer said that the Department of State is receiving more than 1 million passport applications a month   The avalanche of requests has buried its staff and caused delays of up to a month during the peak January to April season when many people are preparing to travel over the spring and summer        The passport system is overheating  and if we don t give it some relief  it could wreak havoc for travelers across the country   Schumer said   These delays are simply unacceptable and could disrupt the lives of thousands of Western New York travelers and businesses   It shouldn t take the State Department two and a half months to turn around a new passport for an average American    According to the State Department  applications for new passports and renewals received between October and this March have risen 44 percent over the same period in 2005 2006  As a result  the Department said routine passport processing could take 10 weeks instead of the previous six  and expedited processing could take four weeks instead of two weeks  About 12 million passport applications were processed in 2006 and as many as 17 million are expected this year  the department said    Schumer said that the current bottleneck is affecting all stages of passport processing  from the initial scanning of an application through the adjudication of citizenship  The call center to assist people in Western New York and across the country with passport processing issues is also overwhelmed    In response  the State Department lengthened work hours and required overtime  but it is still crippled by a lack of qualified personnel who have undergone the background checks necessary to handle sensitive passport adjudications  It takes the Department anywhere between three months and a year to vet and train a new passport employee  but this security precaution leaves the Department with little flexibility to handle surges in demand like the current crisis      Sadly  this administration is unusually adept at imposing strict new guidelines and unusually inept when it comes to providing the resources necessary to meet them   said Schumer         Today  Schumer announced his new plan to break the bottleneck and ensure that Western New York residents receive their passports as promised            More Processors   Schumer said he will introduce new legislation to authorize the State Department to rehire  on a temporary basis  retired and fully trained passport processors to help existing processors manage the increased demand  Currently  retirees from the Civil Service and Foreign Service have little incentive to assist in crises because they lose retirement benefits if they exceed strict wage and hour caps   Schumer said the State Department has assured his office that they have a database of qualified retired processors at the ready who could be called up to help if the Department is granted this new authority to respond to crisis situations  The Department of State already has such authority but it is limited to personnel for Iraq and Afghanistan  Schumer s legislation would merely remove this geographic restriction and extend the hiring authorization from 2008 until 2010            New Western New York Satellite Office   Schumer today also called on the Department of State to establish a new satellite expedited passport processing office in Western New York   This office would be able to turn around passport applications on site in less than 24 hours   Such offices are currently located in major international travel hubs around the country   Schumer today sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice saying that the new office would allow Western New Yorkers a one stop shop to receive of new passport without having to go through the onerous bureaucratic process
