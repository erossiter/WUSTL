IMMEDIATE RELEASE  June 9  2007 Schumer  Leading NYC Chefs  Pioneering Red Hook Vendors  Icons Of Brooklyn Community  About To Be Kicked Out By City   Calls On Parks Department To Scrap Bid Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Parks Dept  Forcing Citywide Favorite Food Stands to Re Bid for Permits They ve Held for Years  Could Raise Fees Exponentially and Lead to Their Elimination by Big Corporations    Locally Owned Vendors Serve Eclectic High Quality  Affordable Cuisine that is a Symbol of Neighborhood Vitality and a Weekend Staple for Brooklyn and City Families U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today criticized a move by the Parks Department that could force out food vendors operating at the ball fields in Red Hook after years of serving the community  The new policy  which would revoke the vendors temporary permits and open the Ball fields to a competitive bidding process  could effectively shut out the vendors due to prohibitive costs  The vendors  which have received national acclaim for their pupusas and huaraches  have been instrumental in creating and fostering the now vibrant recreational destination at the Ball fields   These vendors are a Brooklyn treasure  and they should be celebrated and supported  not subject to the Citys bottom line  Schumer said today  The transformation that they have effected in this community cant be viewed solely through dollars and cents  The diverse  cultural vitality they bring to Red Hook is what makes New York the great city it is  and it should be preserved in the face of a minor profit   Every weekend  the Red Hook vendors sell high quality  affordable food  mostly Latin style  at the ball fields and have become a much beloved weekend destination for families throughout Brooklyn and the entire city  However  the Parks Department informed the vendors that they would now have to competitively bid for permits they have held for years  which could result in an exponential increase in fees or the prospect of being out bid by corporate conglomerates   Currently  the vendors  through their umbrella committee the Food Vendors Committee of Red Hook Park  Inc  pay about  10 000 a season for the temporary permits out of their  30 000 budget  with the remainder going to cleaning up the park  The vendors fear they would be crushed by a  50 000 or higher bid  and with permits at times reaching costs upwards of  300 000 per season  the new policy could make this season the vendors last   The vendors association  and therefore their dues and budget  is intentionally kept small to ensure the quality of food and manageability  with thirteen vendors hailing from Mexico  the Caribbean and Central and South American that all own their own stands  For most of the vendors  the food stands are a second job  with income just important a motivation as providing a service and being a part of the community   I knew Red Hook in the bad old days  just 15 years ago  when Principal Daly was killed and these fields were so pock marked and strewn with debris that weekend soccer games would have been unimaginable  Schumer added  Now  with city investment in the grounds and the immigrant imagination  the Red Hook ball fields are a vibrant culinary and recreational landmark that has received the national attention it deserves  It would be a travesty to dispose of it   As recently as 1992  the Red Hook ball fields were a no mans land with plagued by drug use and gun violence  exemplified by the killing of respected principal Patrick Daly  who was caught by a stray bullet while looking for a student who had left school  Beginning in the mid 1990s  families and onlookers who brought food to enjoy at newly burgeoning weekend soccer games began to organize into commercial vendors  Since that time  the Red Hook ball fields vendors have grown into a cherished community phenomenon that attract hundreds of visitors and families every weekend to enjoy the cuisine and watch or play soccer   Today  Schumer personally wrote to NYC Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe asking him to reconsider the decision to offer up the vendor permits and continue to allow the vendors to serve their food at the ball fields  In his letter  Schumer wrote  I urge you to use all the discretion within your power to preserve and promote  and not supplant  this unique and fruitful example of urban renewal and promise   Schumer was joined today at the ball parks by Cesar Fuentes  President of the Food Vendors of Red Hook  Assemblyman Felix Ortiz  food historian Ed Levine  and area chefs
