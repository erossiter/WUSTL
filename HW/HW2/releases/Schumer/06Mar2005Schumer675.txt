IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 6  2005 Schumer Warns  Feds Woefully Unprepared For Potential Avian Flu Pandemic That Could Devastate New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Inability to quickly prepare flu vaccine and lack of sufficient stockpiles of antivirals leaves New York and America in real danger    CDC concern of outbreak in humans is ominous  should send shot across the bow    Senator calls for immediate crash program  government must guarantee  200 million toward vaccines to combat the dangerous scenario As frightening reports emerge that a deadly avian flu in Asia could potentially trigger a global pandemic  today  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the federal government to take two critical steps in combating the looming disaster  stockpile antiviral medication and issue a  200 million guarantee to vaccine manufacturers to ensure their ability to produce the vaccine without fear of losing money  Schumer  s call comes on the heels of both CDC and WHO concerns that the high mutation rate of this particular strain may soon develop into a deadly pathogen in humans and cause a horrible epidemic in the United States and throughout the world         We must prepare for the worst because if we don  t once avian flu arrives we will be defenseless     said Schumer    The Feds can  t turn a blind eye to a potential disaster and hope to scrape up a solution should it strike   200 million now is a small price to pay to avoid a disaster that will certainly cost billions          Each year flu requires a different vaccine because the genetic mutation of the virus changes  Vaccines must be created from the exact strand of the illness  Because of its unique nature  and the uncertainty over avian flu  no company will invest in creating a vaccine  because if the epidemic does not strike they don  t want to be left with the financial obligation  Experts believe that Washington should provide a  200 million guarantee to ensure that the US is prepared should the pandemic strike         If there was ever a case where a stitch in time saves nine  this is it     said Schumer       The new and dangerous strain  Avian Flu H5N1  first spotted in Hong Kong poultry  has infected 55 people in the past three months  The strain has been identified as a type A influenza virus which is both genetically versatile and able to elude a variety of defenses making it extraordinarily dangerous  This specific type of virus constantly changes as it replicates       H5N1 can also swap genetic materials and merge  This   reassortment process     creates a new strain that differs from both the parent strains and as a result  no population has immunity to the new strain and no existing vaccines can protect them  According to the World Health Organization  WHO   H5N1 has a documented ability to cause severe disease in humans   Even birds that survive the infection excrete the virus for at least 10 days  orally and in feces  thereby facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by migratory birds  The spread of infection in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans  If more humans become infected over time  the likelihood also increases that humans  if infected with both human and avian influenza strains  could serve as the   mixing vessel    for the emergence of a new strain with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person  Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic   New York is a potential breeding ground for an influenza pandemic  With a population of over 8 million people and a population density of nearly 27 000 people per square mile  New York City could be easily devastated by an airborne disease like the avian flu  Once the bug jumps the species barrier  the large and dense population in the city would allow it to spread quickly and health authorities would have very little time to respond  New York  s enormous tourist industry makes the city particularly vulnerable  In 2003 there were nearly 4 million international visitors  and 2004 brought over 4 million to the city     The bottom line is  once the avian flu develops in people it will get to New York in the blink of eye     said Schumer    Washington needs to wake up  ignoring this threat won  t make it go away      To combat the scenario  today Schumer called for the Centers for Disease Control to stockpile sufficient doses of anti viral medications for immediate treatment to help curtail the spread of virus and to prevent death in the event of a possible pandemic  He also called for the federal government guarantee a  200 million commitment for contracts with vaccine manufacturers who agree to create vaccines and increase production capacity and do so without fear of losing money on unused dosages   Though an experimental vaccine is in clinical trials  no effective vaccine has been created yet and funding is needed for research and testing in addition to the money needed for Schumer  s fallback guarantee plan  Without a vaccine for prevention  which can only be developed through using the exact strain  antivirals  for treatment  are the next best solution  In speeding recovery they can help slow the spread of the virus and can also be used to lower the risk of infection when taken before exposure  The WHO estimates that it would take six months to make enough vaccine for 10 to 20  of the United States and Europe  in that time the children and elderly would be exposed to ordinary flu season  Sufficient investment in additional production capacity could help ensure that vaccine for ordinary flu could also continue to be produced   Schumer also pledged his support for the Flu Protection Act of 2005 which includes provisions to fend off an avian flu pandemic  The measure includes terms to provide funding for research into improved vaccine technologies and requires developing a protocol to disburse the vaccine to those who need it most in case of emergency  The bill would also create financial incentives to encourage investment in domestic vaccine production Lastly  the bill would increase public awareness about vaccinations and make sure families are well informed on who needs it and when   According to the Wall Street Journal  scientists believe that flu pandemics occur in 25 year cycles  the most recent pandemic was in 1968  In the past century there have been three flu pandemics  each triggered by genes in bird viruses  The 1918 pandemic left 40 million people dead  and between one and four million died in each the 1957 and 1968 milder flu pandemics   The common flu spreads through the air making it extraordinarily easy to pass from one person to another  If the avian flu mutates so that it can spread from person to person  a cough in an office or a sneeze in a subway car could have dire consequences  Avian flu symptoms in humans start off with a mild fever  joint pain and headaches and develops into fever and respiratory difficulty  As oxygen gets cut off from the brain  coma and death may follow  For months the WHO has been pleading with governments to expedite manufacture and stockpile of vaccines with little response         I refuse to stand idly by  fearing an impending public health disaster  One of the reasons we have a federal government is to deal with situations like this one  to deal with the unknown and the unexpected   Schumer said   The CDC and the federal government have got to start learning their lessons        Schumer was joined today by Dr  Neal Steigbigel  a professor of medicine at New York University in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology
