is essential that we help them to do their jobs safely and efficiently   One of the key ways to do this is to make sure that they have enough firefighters on duty to handle the job and to ensure that they have the training  equipment and resources they need to do their job well  This federal money will help make sure that firefighters in Madison  Onondaga  and Herkimer Counties get the resources they need and have enough people on hand keep our communities safe            Schumer was among the first senators who recognized the need for the federal government to establish a funding program for local governments and fire departments to help defray the rising costs of equipment and fire prevention  Since its inception in 2001  the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program has delivered over  122 million to New York s fire departments           For Fiscal Year 2007  Congress has authorized  1 billion for the program   707 million more than the  293 million included in the Administration s

and fitness programs  and equipment and facility upgrades             This grant ensures that the firefighters in Central New York continue to have the basic resources they require to do their jobs  improve safety and save lives   said Schumer   Local fire departments have been strained from budget cuts  rising costs of equipment and stress from being on heightened alert because of the war on terrorism   These funds are truly a life saving investment that will provide local fire departments with essential resources and support  so they can be better prepared for emergencies            The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in cooperation with the Department s United States Fire Administration  The grants are awarded on a
