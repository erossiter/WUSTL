                                        Over 1 9 Million Trucks Travel Through The Central New York Every Year    Many Drive On Local Roads As A Shortcut And To Avoid Weigh Stations  Tolls And Traffic   Senator  s Legislation Would Require All States To Establish Truck Routing Networks   Schumer  Truck Drivers Are Circumventing The Highway System  But Our Local Communities Are Paying The Price With hundreds of trucks leaving the Thruway and I 81 each day clogging local roads  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled his federal legislation to keep trucks out of Central New York neighborhoods and restore communities   quality of life   Over 1 9 million trucks travel through Central New York every year  but many leave the highways and drive on local roads as a shortcut and to avoid weigh stations  tolls and traffic   Throughout the past few years  there have been numerous accidents spilling fuel  garbage and chemicals  with trucks disrupting communities at all hours of the day and night         Truck drivers cannot be allowed to jump off the highway and rumble through town centers and back grounds just to save a buck     Schumer said     These trucks are evading highway tolls and weigh stations  and are instead driving on neighborhood streets  taxing the roadways and diminishing the quality of life in otherwise peaceful communities  This is a very unique and growing problem in this region  My legislation will go a long way to stem the rising tide of trucks rolling through Central New York communities        Schumer today unveiled his new legislation to require states to establish routing systems for trucks carrying hazardous materials  Currently  states can voluntarily design hazardous materials truck routes   However  very few states have taken advantage of the program so far  This bill would make truck routing mandatory   In October  during a visit to Sherwood Inn in Skaneateles  Schumer promised that if the federal DOT did not set a new truck routing requirement for states on its own  he would introduce legislation that would require states to work with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to do so      Hundreds of trucks carrying hazardous material travel through Central New York everyday transporting millions of tons of goods every year  Elsewhere around the country  trucks are mandated by state law to follow certain paths  These truck routes are created in order to keep trucks off small state and county roads  According to the New York State Department of Transportation  NYSDOT  estimates  at least 500 trucks travel on small roads around Syracuse and the Finger Lakes each day  including State Route 20  County Route 41 and other roadways      The Seneca Meadows landfill in Waterloo alone sees traffic of over 200 trucks a day   This landfill is scheduled to expand and grow  meaning more loud  malodorous trucks passing through neighboring communities  The New York State Thruway Authority reports that the number of commercial vehicles exiting the Thruway in the Syracuse area has more than doubled since 2003  However  the only place in New York State with any designated truck routes is New York City      When traveling on the New York State Thruway and I 81  trucks are required to pay tolls or stop for open weigh stations  However  trucks often take smaller state and county roads  day and night  as a less expensive shortcut  This practice is not only a nuisance to the citizens of the small communities these roads pass through  but is also an issue of safety     Freight trucks haul everything from garbage to eggs  gasoline to milk  The small roads in and around Central New York and the Finger Lakes that truckers use instead of the Thruway and I 81 cannot handle these large vehicles  The local roads were not built for the extreme weights and are inadequate to handle the volume of traffic they must carry  which has led to considerable wear and tear on the pavement   Many of the roads have sharp turns and steep inclines   The truck traffic has also had a detrimental effect on the aging buildings and the overall quality of life in the communities  The foundations of many buildings have cracked from vibrations of large trucks   A building owner in downtown Skaneateles had to replace windows from  30 000 after the steel window panes shook and cracked from the vibrations of the trucks  The owner of the Sherwood Inn in Skaneateles has received complaints from his guests that trucks passing by during the night prevent them from enjoying their stay     If a truck transporting goods were to overturn  a dangerous environmental situation could occur  New York State Routes 20  41 and 41A border Skaneateles Lake  and a spill could affect the entire county  s drinking water supply  According to the Skaneateles Police Chief  200 garbage trucks  18 wheelers  carrying up to 300 gallons of diesel fuel apiece  pass through the community every day   Recently  two separate accidents have occurred where a truck flipped over on Route 41 by the lake
