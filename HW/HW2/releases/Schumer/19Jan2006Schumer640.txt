IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 19  2006 Reid  Schumer  Durbin  Stabenow Send Letter To Bush Administration Officials Urging Disclosure Of All Abramoff Meetings  Memos  Favors And Ties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   On the heels of House and Senate Democrats unveiling the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act to reform Washington  s lobbying scene  Senators Harry Reid  Chuck Schumer  Dick Durbin  and Debbie Stabenow sent a letter today to high level Bush Administration officials asking them to fully disclose their dealings with indicted Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff  The Senate Democratic leaders want top level Bush Administration officials to disclose all their meetings  memos  favors and ties with Jack Abramoff    another example of the Republican   culture of corruption          The following is the text of the letter      January 19  2006      On Tuesday  we sent a letter to President Bush asking that he and officials within his Administration detail whatever contact they might have had with Jack Abramoff  Scott McClellan announced that the White House would not provide this information  despite earlier assurances  Therefore  we have no choice but to ask you these questions directly       As we are sure you are aware  the Justice Department is currently investigating the web of corruption surrounding lobbyist Jack Abramoff  Even at this early stage of the investigation  concerns have been raised that Mr  Abramoff may have had undue and improper influence within the highest levels of the Bush Administration and even the White House itself  Such accusations serve to undermine the credibility of this Administration and our government at large    even before any indictments or convictions  As a result  it is crucial that the American people know what role  if any  Mr  Abramoff played in the highest levels of our government       As more and more Republican officials in and out of Congress are implicated in this scandal  it has become increasingly important that the record be cleared and that any contact you or others in the Administration have had with Mr  Abramoff be fully explained to the American people  For this reason  we urge you to publicly and immediately detail all of your personal contacts with Mr  Abramoff during your time with the Bush Administration  If you know of others in the Administration who have had such contacts  please disclose those contacts as well  Please also detail any official acts that have been undertaken on behalf of or at the request of Mr  Abramoff  Perhaps there are no contacts to reveal  no favors that have been given  We hope that is the case  But it is important to set the record straight  one way or the other       Additionally  we believe is it imperative that you reveal any involvement in the   K Street Project     the initiative launched in recent years by Republicans close to this Administration who have worked hard to increase the ties between lobbyists like Jack Abramoff and Republican elected officials       We urge you to respond to this letter and help shed some light on what has happened between Mr  Abramoff and this Administration  We look forward to your response       Sincerely      Harry Reid   Charles E  Schumer  Dick Durbin   Debbie Stabenow  Bush Administration Officials Receiving the Letter         Secretary Mike Johanns
