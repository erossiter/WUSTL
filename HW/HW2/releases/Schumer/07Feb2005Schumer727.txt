IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 7  2005 Schumer  NY Delegation  Huge Danger For NY   President  s Budget Due Today Will Shut Down Amtrak  Would Devastate NY Economy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator and Members of Congress launch bipartisan push to stop plan that would shut down Amtrak in 10 months   8 7 million New Yorkers take Amtrak to New York City every year  Senator says passenger rail only conceivable backup system if Nation  s airspace is closed like it was in days after 9 11 Standing underneath the   big board    train schedule in the middle of Amtrak  s Pennsylvania Station today  US Senator Charles E  Schumer and other members of New York  s Congressional Delegation today launched an all out push to stop the Bush Administration from shutting down AMTRAK  The President  s budget   which is being sent to Congress today   includes no money for AMTRAK  s operating expenses and would effectively shut Amtrak down on October 1  the first day of the US Government  s fiscal year         The more you learn about the new Budget  the more you feel like this is a game of whack a mole  and we  re the ones trying to stamp down attempts to shortchange the Northeast and New York all over the place     Schumer said    Eliminating Amtrak wouldn  t just cost us billions of dollars in operating funds for the trains and the businesspeople and tourists they bring here  it also shreds the safety net we  ll need in case   God forbid   our airspace is shut down again like it was after 9 11          Schumer emphasized today that without Amtrak  the regional economy could be crippled in the event of a shut down of the national airspace as happened following the attacks of September 11  2001  Regional rail service provides the nation  s transportation network with redundancy  If air travel is halted  commerce must rely solely on regional passenger rail        The President  s budget  which is due on Capitol Hill today  will propose ending federal subsidies for Amtrak s operating expenses for 2006  Congressional Budget staff have told Schumer  s office that the President will propose  360 million for the maintenance costs of local commuter railroads that are concentrated mostly in the Northeast and use Amtrak lines and other equipment  but that these funds may be available only if Amtrak went bankrupt       Amtrak s 2005 capital infrastructure budget  which include maintenance costs  is about  418 million  Most of that money is for the Northeast Corridor  The President originally proposed  900 million for the current budget year  and Congress ended up providing nearly  1 2 billion  Over the last 7 years  Amtrak has invested more than  1 billion in New York State alone       In 2004  more than 10 3 million passengers took Amtrak in New York State  including 8 3 million either departing or arriving New York City  s Penn Station  Penn Station is Amtrak  s busiest destination and the Northeast Corridor line which runs from Washington DC to Boston is Amtrak  s most traveled route  Schumer said that thousands of businesses rely on Amtrak service for convenient travel not only to major cities such as Albany  Boston  Washington but also to numerous destinations throughout New York State including Buffalo  Hudson and Syracuse        In addition  Amtrak is an important vehicle for tourism  bringing millions of visitors who spend millions of dollars to New York City every year  According the NYC  over 3 3 million visitors  non residents and non commuters  took Amtrak in 2004  spending about  2 billion dollars  Approximately 10  of New York City s annual visitors travel on Amtrak  and in the past five years there has been an overall increase in the use of Amtrak service by visitors to New York City  More than half of all domestic visitors to New York City live in the Northeast corridor which is served by Amtrak  International visitors also depend heavily on Amtrak with about 18  of overseas visitors to New York City taking Amtrak to travel within the U S        Amtrak employs 1 938 New Yorkers earning more than  69 million and last year purchased  18 5 million in goods and services in New York State  To keep peace with the growing demand  Amtrak in April added an 11th round trip train on weekdays as well as more weekend service in the Hudson Valley Corridor between Albany and New York City  The President  s proposal to eliminate Amtrak  s subsidy would literally force service to shut down  cutting off this vital transportation lifeline for millions of commuters and visitors and costing the New York economy millions          Sometimes  a budget proposal is penny wise and pound foolish  This plan to gut Amtrak doesn  t even meet that low standard  and that  s why together we  re going to do everything we can to stop it     Schumer said
