IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 1  2005 Schumer  With Hundreds Of Sex Offenders On Staten Island  Patchwork Of State Sex Offender Laws Has Massive Loopholes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Out of State Predators Can Move to Long Island While Local Authorities are Left in the Dark  Last Month Convicted Sex Offender from Washington Found as a Foster Parent to Over 20 Kids in New York   Schumer Unveils New Nationwide Legislation to Create Tracking System  End State By State Disparity In Registration and Notification Procedures In light of no public federal means to track sex offenders who travel from state to state  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called for a National Sex Offender Registry to accurately and thoroughly track sexual predators  Because state laws governing sex offenders are inconsistent and inadequate  thousands of sex offenders fall through the cracks every single year  Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan joined Schumer in announcing federal legislation that will build a federal database to track all sex offenders  create stronger registration standards and link state registries          Convicted sex offenders shouldn  t be able to escape the letter of the law just by moving across state lines     Schumer said    Having access to information about sexual predators in your community is a right  not a privilege  and parents should not have to go through a bureaucratic morass just to assess whether their neighborhoods are safe           As a prosecutor who is entrusted with the safety of our children  it is frustrating to see so many sexual predators be released from prison only to again strike our most vulnerable citizens  As we have seen in the tragic stories in the news  current law differs from state to state and in sum does not do enough to monitor these sex offenders and prevent them from claiming additional victims  I commend Senator Schumer for taking the lead on this issue and fighting for federal standards for the monitoring of dangerous sexual predators   said Richmond County District Attorney Daniel M  Donovan who stood with Schumer at the news conference       Schumer today explained how sex offender registration requirements differ widely from state to state and as a result  many get lost in the shuffle  fall off the sex offender list  and are no longer tracked  Nationwide there are over 550 000 sex offenders  according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  Parents for Megans law estimates that 24  or between 100 000 and 150 000 aren  t even registered  meaning over 100 000 sex offenders are roaming the streets unknown to local law enforcement        Schumer is joining Senators Joseph Biden  D DE  and Orrin Hatch  R UT  to push for immediate passage of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act  S  1086   Specifically  the bipartisan legislation would            Create A National Sex Offender Registry  a new federally maintained sex offender DNA database will be used by law enforcement and prosecutors             Create A Stronger Registration Standards for Offenders  convicted offenders will have to register prior to release from prison or supervised release  Current law requires registration after release and sex offenders will have to re register twice a year  every three months for a sexually violent predator     not just once  And the duration to register for a first time sex offender increases from 10 years to 20 years and for second offenders and sexually violent offenders for their lifetime  Additionally if there is a change in status  job  address  etc  offenders are required to register that change immediately            Create A Searchable Statewide Sex Offender Registry  Requires the states  not local governments  to maintain a multi field  searchable sex offender registry             Establishes Strict Penalties For Failure To Register  Makes failing to register or to update registry information a federal felony             Links State Registries so that an offense committed in one state does not go unrecognized in another       Schumer used the upstate man serving as a foster parent to 20 children as an example of the need to strengthen federal tracking of sex offenders  The man  who had been convicted of two counts of rape in Washington  was able to move to New York and act as a foster parent and even adopt a child before authorities realized that he had a criminal history        We know that thousands of sex offenders are unaccounted for because of varying state laws  In fact  in the National Sex Offender Registry  NSOR   the database used by the FBI  there are only 385 343 names listed  This means that out of the 550 000 sex offenders registered with states  the government can not identify 165 000 of them  The burden of registration falls to the states to register with the FBI and not all states have the technology  training and resources to do so       For example if a sex offender moves from New Jersey to New York State and fails to register  the only way to find them is through the FBI database  While some states do a good job keeping their numbers up to date for the national database  others  like Utah have 8 names in the NSOR database  but over 8 000 sex offenders  California only has 49 000 in the NSOR database  but over 100 000 registered sex offenders  If a sex offender moved to NY and wasn  t on the NSOR no one would know his whereabouts  unless he committed another crime       Of the total 5 191 sex offenders in New York City there are 1341 in the Bronx  1555 in Brooklyn  1116 in Manhattan  960 in Queens  and 219 in Staten Island  Of the 21 514 sex offenders in New York state  5 362 offenders have Level 3 status  according to the state Department of Criminal Justice  Level 3 sex offenders have the highest rate of recidivism       Of the 219 sex offenders on Staten Island  many don  t register  and there could be up to 50 that are walking the streets without authorities having any knowledge of their existence       According to the Department Of Justice  released sex offenders are four times more likely to be rearrested for crime and  on average  child molesters only served 43  of sentences         The bottom line is each state has different laws  different standards  and different ways of keeping track of people  and without a standardized federal procedure  dangerous criminals are falling through the cracks     Schumer said   In addition to Richmond County District Attorney  Daniel Donovan  Schumer was also joined today by Yolanda L  Rudich   Chief of the Sex Crimes Special Victims Bureau at the Richmond County D A s office
