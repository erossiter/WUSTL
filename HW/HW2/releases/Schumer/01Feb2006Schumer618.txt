                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             New Courts Decision Have Voided Federal Tax Paid by Estimated 4 65 Million Cell Phone Users In Upstate New York Alone  Senator Calls for Immediate End to Century Old Phone Tax and Introduces Legislation To Stop IRS   NY Cell Phone Users would be Entitled to Average Refund of  54    Senator Will Urge IRS Commissioner to Direct Cell Phone Companies to Stop Collecting Fed Tax and Fully Refund Taxpayers With over 4 65 million upstate New York cell phone users  today U S  Senator Charles Schumer is urging the Internal Revenue Service to immediately stop collecting a recently voided tax on cell phone users in New York and issue refunds to taxpayers  The federal tax on cell phone bills has cost New York  s 4 65 million cell phone users approximately  250 million over the last three years  On Wednesday  Schumer will announce that the  the U S  District Court for the Southern District of New York along with several federal appeals courts around the country  have recently ruled the excise tax illegal  Schumer sent a letter to IRS Commissioner Everson urging him to heed the multiple federal court rulings  stop collecting the federal tax  and implement a refund program  Today  Schumer will announce that he is introduce legislation to codify the courts   rulings and get refunds into consumers hands as quickly as possible       Schumer said    When federal courts rule that a federal tax should not be paid by consumers in multiple states  the IRS should not continue to collect that tax in New York or anywhere else  The bottom line is that this century old tax doesn  t make sense and unfairly taxes New York  s cell phone users  even though it has been voided in many other states  Cell phone users in parts of New York already suffer from shoddy reception and high state taxes    this voided federal tax adds insult to injury           Cell phone customers in New York are due  251 million in tax refunds according to a series of federal court decisions  The Internal Revenue Service is still collecting the tax through cell phone companies and has announced that it will not process refund requests from taxpayers while other cases are pending        In September of 2004  in Fortis  Inc  v  United States    the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York decided the case in favor of the taxpayer  This case will be heard on appeal by the Second Circuit Court of the United States  which covers New York  beginning March 22  2006  In December a third federal appeals court in Washington  D C  voided the tax  Two other federal appeals courts  with jurisdiction over seven states  have voided the tax as well  States covered by the three federal circuit courts include Kentucky  Michigan  Ohio and Tennessee  Alabama  Florida  Georgia  and DC       The Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association  CTIA  estimated that Americans spend just over  100 billion a year on cell phone service  meaning that the cell phone tax is costing U S  consumers just over  3 billion a year     New Yorkers would be entitled to over  250 million in refunds from the IRS       Senator Schumer today released a  for how many consumers would receive a refund in each region of NYS            In the Capital Region there are an estimated 565 000 cell phone customers who could be owed over  30 million collectively in tax refunds the illegal excise tax             In Central New York there are an estimated 476 000 cell phone customers who could be owed over  25 million collectively in tax refunds the illegal excise tax             In the Hudson Valley there are an estimated 1 560 000 cell phone customers who could be owed over  25 million collectively in tax refunds the illegal excise tax             In the Rochester Finger Lakes region there are an estimated 647 000 cell phone customers who could be owed over  35 million collectively in tax refunds the illegal excise tax             In the Southern Tier there are an estimated 335 000 cell phone customers who could be owed over  18 million collectively in tax refunds the illegal excise tax             In Western New York there are an estimated 787 000 cell phone customers who could be owed over  42 5 million collectively in tax refunds the illegal excise tax        The average consumer pays an average  50 for his or her monthly cell phone bill    but the rates for cell phone users are based on the time of the call  not the distance the call travels  In other words  the courts have said that the previously mandated tax on   long distance    phone calls does NOT apply to cell phone calls        Schumer  s letter to Commissioner Everson says    Despite the holdings of several federal appeals courts that the excise tax does not apply to calls with a time based rate  the IRS continues to require that the phone companies collect the tax  This is bad for business and it is bad for consumers  Because the courts must deal with these cases circuit by circuit  the result is that customers in Ohio are exempt from the tax while customers in New York are not  We should eliminate this disparity and treat all consumers the same  regardless of the federal circuit in which they live          The federal excise tax on communications was imposed in 1898 to help pay for the Spanish American War  The tax was extended again in 1965 to cover long distance phone calls  at a time when only one telephone company existed  That is why courts addressing the issue have repeatedly held the tax does not apply to calls for which the rate varies by the time of the call  The IRS should bring its practices in line with the court rulings       Schumer is calling on the IRS to immediately        1  Issue a formal letter to telephone service providers instructing them to immediately stop collection of the tax on calls for which the rate varies by the time of the call       2  Refund customers for taxes paid over the last three years        To make this work smoothly  telephone service providers should notify their customers as to how much tax they have paid over the past three years  and then the customers should apply directly to the federal government to receive their refunds  The application process for these refunds must also be as simple and efficient as possible       If the IRS does not change its regulations  Schumer will introduce legislation that will codify the court decisions so that cell phone consumers in various parts of the country are not subject to different rules  The legislation will clarify that the excise tax does not apply to charges for calls that do not vary by distance  which would mean cell phone charges would be exempt  Schumer  s legislation will take effect 60 days after passage  and will apply to all 50 states  It will allow cell phone users to collect refunds for any taxes collected during the last three years       Click here to view
