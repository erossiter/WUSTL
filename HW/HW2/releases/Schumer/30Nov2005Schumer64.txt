                                    Standing with Frank and Gina Lieneck  Parents of Brianna  Schumer to Call on Coast Guard to Enact New Rules Before 2006 Boating Season    Schumer Urges Coast Guard to Implement New 5Point Plan for Long Island Boating Safety  Points out Minimal Protections for Operating a Boat    Federal Waters Unsafe As more than one third of all recreational boating accidents reported in New York State in 2004 occurred in Nassau or Suffolk Counties    75 of 204 New York accidents occurred near Long Island including 18 fatalities   today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the U S  Coast Guard to implement new  stringent boating regulations  Standing with the Lieneck family  Schumer urged the Coast Guard  which has jurisdiction over federal waters  to implement his plan to make boating safer         Brianna  s death was a tragic wake up call that showed us that federal boating regulations are woefully inadequate     Schumer said    It is time for the Coast Guard to step up and make some important changes so that we can be sure that a senseless tragedy like Brianna  s death doesn  t befall us again          Schumer  s call comes on the heels of a horrific accident on the waters of the Great South Bay this past summer  About half a mile off Bay Shore  Long Island  a Grady White boat crashed into a Bay Liner killing 11 year old Brianna Lieneck and injuring the rest of her family  The Senator wrote today to the United States Coast Guard to express his concern regarding the safety of recreational boating on the waters surrounding Long Island and to recommend steps the Coast Guard should take to protect the millions of people who use boats every year in the United States  More than one third of all recreational boating accidents reported in New York State in 2004 occurred in Nassau or Suffolk Counties  with 75 accidents on Long Island and 204 state wide  including 18 fatalities  Approximately 70  of all reported fatalities occurred on boats where the operator had not received boating safety instruction  Alcohol was involved in approximately one third of all boating fatalities in 2004       In an effort to combat this danger Schumer today called on the United States Coast Guard to implement important new regulations to make boating in Federal waters safer  He also asked the Coast Guard to come up with new recommendations to help ensure that boating on bodies of water like the Great South Bay is safe       First  Schumer urged the Coast Guard to expand boating safety programs and insurance incentive agreements  Complicating factors of driving a boat include the lack of proper and adequate safety training  especially for night operation  Regular boat operators should be encouraged to enroll in boating safety and training programs certified by the Coast Guard  The opportunity for incentives such as reduction in premiums offered by insurance companies varies greatly  The Coast Guard should craft regulations in cooperation with the insurance industry to ensure that boat operators are rewarded accordingly for their safety efforts  Schumer said he believed that such instructional courses should be mandatory if a driver of a boat is involved in a serious marine accident       Secondly  the Senator called for tougher requirements in order for states to receive federal boat safety grant funding  The Coast Guard has a program that gives funding to the states if they have a   boater safety education program     Unfortunately  due to the ambiguity of the program language  most states get the funds without having adequate training programs  Schumer said the Coast Guard should spell out stricter requirements for the states to receive this funding  such as better and more diverse courses and laying out more specific requirements       Schumer also urged the Coast Guard to propose new regulations that will make it harder for dangerous boaters to get behind the wheel and will crack down on boating while intoxicated  That includes a requirement that drug and alcohol testing be conducted quickly after serious marine accidents  Suffolk County  s marine patrol smelled alcohol on the driver of the boat that crashed into the Lienecks   boat and initially charged him with boating while intoxicated  He refused a breathalyser at the time and though he admitted to drinking  the charge was dropped when blood tests done 4 hours after the accident showed he was within the legal limits  Detecting drunken boat operators is far more difficult than identifying drunken drivers on the road  Indicators such as crossing a double line are not available on the water  In his letter to the Coast Guard Schumer wrote    I recommend that the Coast Guard work with State and local officials to ensure mandatory breathalyser tests for all boat passengers at the time of a crash  Furthermore  stiffer penalties should be enacted for those who are found guilty of boating while intoxicated          Night time lighting on the Great South Bay is creating a dangerous situation as light from boats can be shielded by light from the shore  Schumer called for the Coast Guard to improve visibility on the Bay by deploying additional on water safety devices and potentially constructing additional light houses on both sides of the bay  Schumer asked the Coast Guard to conduct a waterways analysis of the Great South Bay to improve recreational and commercial vessel safety       Lastly  Schumer called night time safety lighting to be standardized on all new boats  Adding lighting to older boats is both complex and cost prohibitive so Schumer is asking that all new boats are outfitted with more lighting to make visibility easier while boating at night       In a letter to Admiral Thomas H  Collins  Commandant of the United States Coast Guard  Schumer wrote   Brianna s death is a tragic representation of a dangerous safety situation on the Great South Bay  I hope you will act on these recommendations before the 2006 summer boating season and I pledge my full support in the effort to make the waters around Long Island as safe and secure as possible
