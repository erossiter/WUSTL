IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 16  2007 On The Heels Of New Salmonella Outbreak That Has Sickened Dozens In Upstate New York  Schumer Reintroduces Comprehensive Legislation To Overhaul Food Safety Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator Announces Renewed Push for Sweeping Legislation that Would Overhaul FDA USDA  Consolidate Enforcement and Tracking in to New Food Safety Agency    Peanut Butter Outbreak Has Sickened Hundreds in Nearly 40 States  Including New York  Going Undetected Since August                                                                                                                          In the wake of a new Salmonella outbreak in processed peanut butter  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that a patchwork of federal oversight has left the nation s food supply dangerously vulnerable to contamination   Schumer today said that federal efforts to monitor the food supply  track any contaminated food  and notify the public is significantly hampered because of jurisdictional tangles  a lack of staff  and a lack of funding at the Food and Drug Administration  the agency with oversight of non meat food products   Schumer today announced he was reintroducing comprehensive food safety legislation that would create a new unified Food Safety Agency to protect farms and consumers        Two major E  coli outbreaks last year and now today s announcement shows we need to get our food safety house in order once and for all   Right now  the FDA and the USDA is falling down on the job yet again   For decades  we ve made a concerted effort to educate Americans on the nutritional importance of eating vegetables and fruits  Today  we must regain their trust by implementing strong safety regulations to protect farms and consumers from another outbreak and to guarantee that our nation s food supply is being adequately monitored        Under current law  the United States Department of Agriculture has the responsibility of protecting the nation s meat and poultry supply  while the FDA has oversight over fruits  vegetables  and other food products   In response to several  major E  coli outbreaks in beef in the mid 1990 s  the USDA stepped up enforcement efforts  which are credited with reducing the frequency of E  coli outbreaks in meat and poultry       Unfortunately  the FDA isn t doing nearly enough to protect fruits and vegetables from contamination and has reduced the number of produce inspections dramatically  In 2005  the FDA conducted 4 573 on site agriculture processing inspections   For 2006  they are only expected to complete 3 400  a 25 percent drop   By contrast  the USDA conducts the same number of inspections in a matter of days  Food inspections have dropped from 50 000 in 1972 to less than 4 500 in 2005  meaning that U S  food processors are inspected on average about once every 10 years   Federal law requires a USDA inspector to be permanently placed at every meat process sing plant in the country  however  there is no such requirement of produce at the FDA        This fractured approach has left the nation s produce vulnerable to contamination   The FDA does not have to power to order recalls  while the USDA can immediately pull tainted meat off the shelves  The CDC estimates that as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year  Of those individuals  approximately 325 000 will be hospitalized and more than 5 000 will die  Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to foodborne pathogens       Schumer said that food safety monitoring  inspection and labeling functions are actually spread across 12 federal agencies and sub agencies including  the U S  Department of Agriculture s Food Safety and Inspection Service which regulates meat  poultry and processed egg products  the Food and Drug Administration s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and Center for Veterinary Medicine which regulates produce and other food products  and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  which tracks foodborne illnesses        Schumer today announced that in the wake of this outbreak  he was renewing his push for comprehensive food safety legislation that would overhaul federal oversight of the food supply   The Food Safety Act authored by Senator Richard Durbin  D IL  and co sponsored by Schumer and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  would make one new federal agency responsible for food safety monitoring  The legislation would require food producers to code their products so that those products can be quickly traced in the event of a food borne illness outbreak  requiring that food processing plants have procedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination  requiring regular inspection of domestic food facilities with frequency based on risk  and give the FDA recall authority
