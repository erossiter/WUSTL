IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 6  2005 Schumer Graham Aim To Level Playing Field On China Trade  Attach Amendment To State Dept  Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tough Approach to Force China to Stop Currency Manipulation or Risk Being Slapped with Large Tariffs on its Exports As China continues to peg its currency and the US trade deficit with China reaches record levels  a bipartisan group of lawmakers comprised of U S  Senators Charles Schumer  D NY  and Lindsey Graham  R SC  today introduced an amendment to impose an across the board tariff on Chinese imports in an effort to reduce China s unfairly undervalued currency advantage  The Senators said the Chinese undervaluation of its Yuan has played a major role in the loss of 3 million US manufacturing jobs over the last five years and is contributing to the migration of service and engineering jobs to China  The amendment will be offered to the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act  S  600   The amendment is identical to the text of S  295  which Senators Schumer and Graham introduced on February 3  2005        The Chinese want to have it both ways  On one hand they want free trade and membership in the WTO and other international trade organizations  But on the other hand  they don t want to play by the rules of those organizations  China can  t reap the full benefits of international trade and trade with the United States when they thumb their nose   Schumer said         This amendment says to the Chinese  enough already  It says to the Chinese that their unfair trade policies have got to end     Schumer continued    It says to the Chinese  this is a shot across your bow  Reform    because  if you don t  there are going to be dramatic consequences throughout the world  in our country  and in your country as well          Specifically  the amendment allows for a 180 day negotiation period between the US and China to revalue its currency  if the negotiations are not successful  a temporary across the board tariff of 27 5  will be applied to all Chinese products entering the United States   a penalty that corresponds to their estimated currency advantage  Since economists estimate that China undervalues its currency between 15 percent and 40 percent  27 5  represents the midpoint range  Furthermore  if the President determines that at the end of the negotiation period that China has developed and started actual implementation of a plan to revalue its currency  he may delay imposition of the tariff for another 12 months       The Yuan    sometimes known as renminbi    has been tightly pegged to the U S  dollar since 1994  approximately 8 28 Yuan to the dollar   During that period of time  China  s economy has grown dramatically  averaging over 8  per year  If China  s currency freely floated in the market  as is the case with virtually all major world currencies  it would have appreciated substantially reflecting China s underlying economic strength  However  it has remained at the same pegged value  and the result is that many economists estimate that the yuan is now undervalued by between 15 and 40 percent       The Commerce Department reported in February that the trade deficit with China hit  162 billion in February  up over 30  from 2003  and is the largest imbalance ever recorded with a single country  The overall trade deficit for all of last year soared to a record of  617 7 billion  24 4 percent above the previous record  For all of 2004  imports also rose 16 3 percent  setting a new record of  1 76 trillion  Many economists believe that the highly devalued Chinese currency  the Yuan  has helped make this possible       As the United States largest export industry  manufacturing has felt the impact of the Yuan  s undervaluation most dramatically  The United States has lost close to 3 million manufacturing jobs   90 percent of all the jobs lost in the last five years  New York alone has lost approximately 100 000 manufacturing jobs       In order to hold the value of the Yuan within its tight and artificial trading band  the Chinese government has intervened in its foreign exchange markets  The practice of   currency manipulation    to gain a trade or competitive advantage violates World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund agreements  of which China is now party  China  s emergence as a manufacturing powerhouse at the expense of the United States raises significant economic security concerns and the question of whether a country that loses its ability to produce tangible products will long remain an economic power
