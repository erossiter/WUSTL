IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 17  2005 Senators Schumer And Clinton Announce Transportation Funding For New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  D C     Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the transportation reauthorization bill passed today by the Senate includes a substantial increase    16 72 billion   in transportation funding for New York for fiscal years 2004 2009  Specifically  the legislation includes  9 92 billion in highway funds and  6 8 billion for New York State  s transit systems   an 18 percent increase for New York in highway funding and a 36 percent increase in public transit funding over the last transportation authorization bill  The bill also contains funding for research  safety  environment  transportation planning and security that will benefit all New Yorkers     Senators Schumer and Clinton noted that transportation funding translates into more jobs for New Yorkers  According to the U S  Department of Transportation  for every  1 billion spent on transportation funding  47 500 jobs are created in the United States  This will mean tens of thousands of jobs for New Yorkers and a boost to the economy       These funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state  These federal dollars would be a huge shot in the arm for local transit needs    new buses  repairs for buses  and fixing up our stations    and highway repairs    Without first rate highway and transit facilities  New York would literally stop short     Schumer said       As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  I have worked hard to secure the funding New York needs to maintain our highway and transit systems    said Senator Clinton    This bill will help create thousands of jobs across New York and dramatically improve our transportation infrastructure    both transit and highway   to encourage and facilitate economic development across the State        Schumer and Clinton said that the funds included in the bill for public transit could be used for new buses  bus repair  and multi modal station rehabilitation  Funding for specific mass transit projects  like the East Side Access and Second Avenue Subway  requested by individual Senators will be added once the bill goes to conference  Overall  New York received an overwhelming percentage of the total transit allotment  receiving more than 18 cents of every dollar for transit     This year  s funding formulas are almost identical to those passed in the 2004 Senate Bill  the Safe Accountable Flexible Efficient Transportation Equity Act  Prior to the last bill  Senators Schumer and Clinton fought hard for those formulas  which retained programs such as the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program  providing hundreds of millions of dollars to older subway systems  like New York  s  Schumer called Senate Banking Chairman Richard A  Shelby of Alabama at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland to get more money for New York  Senators Sarbanes  Shelby and Santorum also joined Schumer to push through language that would ensure a stronger guarantee from the Senate Finance Committee that the transit programs would receive their full allotment of funds  Traditionally  the Finance Committee    which is dominated by Senators from rural states    is more interested in providing highway funding than transit money     Senator Clinton received assurances during the Environment and Public Works Committee markup of the bill from Chairman Inhofe  Ranking Member Jeffords  and Senator Baucus that additional money would be included for states that did not grow enough and that additional money would be added for transit  As a result   11 billion was added on the floor of the Unites States Senate and Senator Clinton helped secured a change to the funding formula in the overall legislation  boosting funding for New York  s highways and transit systems     Senators Schumer and Clinton today also announced approval of several amendments to the transportation reauthorization bill     Mass Transit Benefit  Schumer and Clinton were able to secure an amendment to the transportation bill to encourage use of mass transit by bring tax free transit benefits employers can offer to their employees up to par with tax free parking benefits  Under current law  employers are only able to offer employees a tax free benefit for mass transit commuting costs up to  105  Last month  Schumer secured approval in the Finance Committee to raise the transit benefit from  105 to  155 per month  The amendment keeps the transit benefit at  155 until the end of 2009  then in 2010  the transit benefit will equal the parking benefit   200 plus in 2010  and the two benefits are linked together for all future inflation adjustments     Raising the transit benefit will simultaneously reduce traffic  congestion and smog while saving New York  s commuters hundreds of dollars every year  Schumer and Clinton  s amendment would increase this benefit by almost 100 percent and also provides the cash strapped MTA with a steady and predictable revenue stream  By 2010  the amendment would permanently eliminate the existing disparity between the benefit offered for parking costs and the benefit offered for transit costs  thereby removing the incentive for commuters to drive alone     According to a survey by The Transit Center  a leading advocate for increasing the transit benefit and creator of the nation  s first transit voucher  24 percent of MetroNorth  25 percent of Long Island Railroad  and 18 percent of NYC Transit  s daily riders take advantage of commuter benefit programs  In the New York metro area alone  commuters will save cumulatively over  150 million this year  Employers have saved significantly as well  over  35 million since the benefit went into effect in the New York area  The added subsidy will not only benefit employees  but will also provide additional tax relief for businesses who contribute to their employees   deductions and will encourage employers to offer transit benefits to their workers     University of Buffalo  The Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  Amendment  Clinton and Schumer secured approval for  1 25 million per year in funding for research on the impact of seismic activity on the federal highway system and the nation  s transportation network as well as ways to reduce our vulnerability from earthquakes  The funding will also help improve earthquake simulation facilities  This is an important economic generator in Western New York and will keep the University of Buffalo at the forefront of this important research  Senator Clinton promised to fight hard to include the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  in this version of the bill  MCEER is a national center of excellence in advanced technology applications dedicated to the reduction of earthquake losses nationwide  MCEER is headquartered at the State University of New York at Buffalo  The Center was originally established by the National Science Foundation  NSF  in 1986     High Priority Corridor Amendment  Clinton and Schumer secured approval for Route 219 in Western New York and I 86 I 99 to be designated as high priority corridors  making them eligible for specific high priority corridor funding  These roads are important routes within the State of New York and this amendment makes single and two corridors eligible for federal funding to assure long term stability  Senator Clinton proposed this Amendment during the Environment and Public Works Committee  s markup  Both roads were originally designated as High Priority Corridors in 1991  but language in this bill originally removed two state or single state corridors  The Clinton Amendment makes all single state and two state corridors eligible because they can be just as vital as multi state corridors     System Study Amendment  Clinton and Schumer secured approval to create a National Commission to determine the future transportation needs of New York and the nation  This Commission will combine the National Transportation System Study and the Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission  Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward  The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing provides a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future  A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York  It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network     I 86 named after Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  Clinton and Schumer secured language in this bill renaming all of I 86 after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  a fitting tribute to a man who once chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee and who fought hard in previous transportation reauthorization bills for the needs of New York     Amo Houghton Amendment  Clinton and Schumer secured approval to rename a portion of Route 86 near Corning  NY  after former Congressman Amo Houghton who was primarily responsible for securing the funding that made construction of this bypass possible  Senator Clinton offered an Amendment  and it was accepted  during the Environment and Public Works Committee  s markup  This provision is also included in the House bill  H R  3     Environmental Health Amendments  Senator Clinton co sponsored an amendment with Senator Inhofe that provides money to states to fund diesel retrofits of highway construction equipment  Senator Clinton also co sponsored an amendment with Senator Inhofe that authorizes increased funding for the EPA  s Clean School Bus program  Both amendments will help promote better air quality     The Senate and House transportation authorization bills will now go to a conference committee where negotiators from both chambers will reconcile them into one final package  These authorized funding levels will then go to the appropriations committees for each chamber for funding
