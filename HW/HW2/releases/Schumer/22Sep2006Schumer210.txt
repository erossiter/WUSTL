IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 22  2006 As Hewlett Packard Investigation Unfolds  Schumer Blasts Senate Republicans For Blocking Bipartisan Bill Criminalizing Sale Of Cell Phone Call Logs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              With Investigation into the Use of Pretexting at HP Ongoing  Schumer  s Legislation Would Criminalize Growing Practice That Puts Individual  s Cell Phone Records in the Hands of Criminals    Bill Already Passed House 409 0   Senator  No Laws Currently On The Books Banning This Practice                                                                                                             Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer criticized Senate Republicans for refusing to pass by unanimous consent his comprehensive legislation that would criminalize the practice  also known as pretexting  of both stealing and selling cell phone  landline and voice over Internet protocol  VOIP  records and renewed his call on Majority Leader Bill Frist to immediately bring to the floor    Hewlett Packard  s outgoing Chairwoman Patricia Dunn is currently accused of contracting with a company that used pretexting to obtain cell phone records of other board members and journalists   The bipartisan Telephone Records and Privacy Protection  TRAPP  Act  S  2178   introduced by Schumer in January along with Senators Arlen Specter  R PA  and Bill Nelson  D FL   was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously back in March  but the bill has stalled in the full Senate  Schumer sought to move the identical House version of the bill through the Senate yesterday         Stealing someone  s private phone records is absolutely a criminal act and the fact that it can  t be prosecuted as one has got to change     Schumer said    With the HP case still unfolding  it is unfortunate that Senate Republicans chose to stand in the way of ending this malicious practice and preventing it from touching more and more Americans  Stealing a person  s phone log can lead to serious personal  financial  and safety issues for just about any American  Pretexting companies are popping up across the country and we need to give law enforcement the tools to track these criminals down and put them out of business        The TRAPP Act will make it a federal offense  punishable as a felony  to obtain customer information from a telephone service provider by false pretenses or access a customer account on the Internet to obtain billing information without authorization  The bill also makes it a crime for phone company employees to sell customer information without proper authorization  The bill applies to cell  landline  and  VOIP  phone records  An identical version of Schumer  s legislation passed the House 409 0       The Senate Democratic leadership signaled its approval of the legislation  however  Republicans have not agreed to pass the measure by unanimous consent  a common procedure for passing non controversial legislation quickly   Because the House has already passed the same legislation  if the Senate passed the bill  it could be sent quickly to the President for his signature without need for a conference committee      Under Schumer  s bill  it will be a violation of federal law to obtain someone  s phone records by 1  Making false or fraudulent statements or representations to an employee of a telephone service provider  2  Making such statements to a customer of a telephone service provider  3  Accessing a customer account on the Internet without the customer  s authorization  4  Providing false documentation to a telephone service provider knowing that the document is false     Cell phone call logs are sought out for a variety of reasons  For years phone records gave been used by law enforcement and private detectives  but with the internet  gaining access to that information has gotten much easier  Websites like www  cellphonerecords org offer the service online  and with little regulation it is nearly impossible to stop      Experts say that these records can be made available through three techniques  The first is having someone that works for one of the phone companies who sells the data  Though strict rules inside most of the phone companies make this practice risky  officials say that finding someone with access to the information desired is not that difficult  The second technique is   pretexting    where a data broker or the like pretends to be the owner of the phone  In doing so  they convince the cell phone company  s employees to release the data to them      Though the problem is all too common  federal law is too narrow to include this type of crime  Pretexting for financial data is illegal  but its does not include phone records        We should protect your phone information and call logs the same way we protect your financial information or even medical records  Very personal information can be gleaned from our telephone records and criminals who steal this information should be punished     Schumer concluded
