                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              National Do Not Call List Allows New Yorkers to Restrict Telemarketers from Calling Homes and Businesses to Solicit Call List Registration Expires After Five Years  First Wave of Expirations to Occur in 2008  Thousands of New Yorkers Vulnerable to Annoying Calls Once Again Schumer Announces Legislation to Prevent Phone Numbers from Expiring Once they ve Been Pla Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that thousands of New Yorkers are at risk of receiving annoying and burdensome telemarketing phone calls  despite having added their phone numbers to the National Do Not Call Registry  The Do Not Call Registry  created in 2003  is a database of phone numbers managed by the Federal Trade Commission  FTC   When a person adds his or her phone number to the list via the toll free hotline or FTC website  telemarketers are prohibited from calling that number    However  names on the list expire after 5 years  with the first wave set to expire in June 2008  Furthermore  the FTC does not send any form of notification to individuals on the Do Not Call Registry alerting them to their upcoming expiration or explaining that an individual is responsible for his own re registration    Today Senator Schumer announced legislation  authored by Senator Byron Dorgan  to amend the original law and prevent phone numbers from expiring once they are placed on the Do Not Call Registry  He also advised New Yorkers currently on the list to check on the status of their phone numbers and make sure their registration is up to date    The Do Not Call Registry has been a slam dunk success  yet  inexplicably  thousands of New Yorkers will be dropped from the list  opening them up to a fresh wave of irritating and unprovoked calls from telemarketers  said Senator Schumer  My bill will make the Do Not Call Registry permanent  so New Yorkers wont be forced to repeatedly register just to eat dinner in peace and keep intrusive telemarketers off their personal phone lines   The Do Not Call list  created in 2003  is a database of phone numbers managed by the Federal Trade Commission  FTC   When a person adds his or her phone number to the list via the toll free hotline or FTC website  telemarketers have 31 days to remove that phone number from their call lists  In accordance with the 2003 law that created the Do Not Call Registry  consumers may file a complaint with the FTC if they receive any calls after the 31 day period  and telemarketers face fines of up to  11 000    However  most Do Not Call registrants are completely unaware that their registration expires five years to the day their phone number was registered  Because the list was created in 2003  beginning early 2008 many phone numbers currently on the list will expire  thus leaving thousands of people vulnerable to telemarketers   Nationwide  over 55 million telephone numbers have been registered with the Do Not Call Registry  Over 57  of U S  adults say that they have submitted their numbers to the registry  Of those people who have signed up  92  say that they have received dramatically fewer telemarketing calls  and 25  of those registered say that they have not received any telemarketing calls since registering  When compared to other large and populated states  New York saw among the fewest complaints during the initial three month period during which the registry was deployed  While over 22 000 complaints were filed by consumers in California  nearly 18 000 in Florida  and over 10 000 in Texas  only 4 300 complaints were filed by New York consumers in the same period    In total  there are 8 854 849 New York phone numbers on the Do Not Call list  including 2 993 645 in New York City and 1 670 503 on Long Island    Area code 212 serving Manhattan has 558 563 phone numbers registered     Area code 347 serving New York City has 164 698 phone numbers registered     Area code 646 serving Manhattan has 279 738 phone numbers registered     Area code 718 serving New York City has 1 191 369 phone numbers registered     Area code 917 serving New York City has 799 277 phone numbers registered     Area code 516 serving Nassau County has 908 180 phone numbers registered     Area code 631 serving Suffolk County has 762 323 phone numbers registered    Today Schumer announced he is co sponsoring legislation that will eliminate the automatic removal of telephone numbers registered on the federal Do Not Call Registry  This legislation will prohibit any date of expiration for telephone numbers on the list and prevent the FTC from setting any determined time limitation for telephone numbers to remain on the registry  Although the FTC has raised concerns that the 5 year registration term protects the integrity of the list  the FTC will still conduct their monthly purge of disconnected numbers remaining on the list to keep it accurate    Schumers legislation will remove the burden that the FTC has placed on the individual to re register by ensuring that numbers placed on the Do Not Call Registry are not subject to automatic expiration
