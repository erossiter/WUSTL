     This decision means that these communities can get the public assistance they desperately need     said Schumer    After being repeatedly hit with heavy rains and flooding  cleaning up the damage done in these counties is beyond the capacity of the local governments  With this additional aid  the region will finally be able to get back on their feet        Today  FEMA has awarded two Public Assistance  PA  and Hazard Mitigation funding  HM    PA aids public entities by reimbursing emergency services and funding repair or replacement of disaster damaged public facilities  roads and bridges   The Hazard Mitigation program provides aid to States and local governments to implement long term hazard mitigation measures to reduce the loss of life and property due to natural disasters       The flooding in Broome  Chenango  Delaware  Herkimer  Hamilton  Montgomery  Otsego and Tioga Counties occurred after annual rainfall averages totaled above 50 inches  well above the average for the year   As a result of the storm  highways were closed  gas and water lines ruptured  and public infrastructure was severely damaged   Hundreds of residents were evacuated or rescued from their homes  while many others were forced into shelters when their homes were left in ruins   Recovery costs are expected to surpass  32 000 000      In response to the latest November floods  Schumer made a personal call last week to R  David Paulison  Director of FEMA  urging him to advise President Bush to immediately issue a Major Disaster Declaration in order to provide federal aid for the area   On November 27  Schumer wrote a letter to President George W  Bush and Director Paulison urging them to expedite an approval for New York State  s request for a major disaster declaration for counties hit by flash flooding on November 16   On November 22  Schumer toured the Amphenol facility  located in the Village of Sidney  to survey flood damage and discuss with local officials and business leaders what kind of federal aid is needed for recovery and long term mitigation   Schumer has facilitated discussions with Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  and the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to explore long term projects to prevent future damage      This recent round of flooding compounds the damage incurred by these communities following this summer  s flooding  Directly following the June floods  Schumer urged Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison  Governor Pataki  and President Bush to rush funds and assistance to storm ravaged areas

floods  and the Department of Agriculture to grant millions of dollars in disaster related aid   Senator Schumer wrote FEMA to support the NYS Office of Mental Health  s application for funding under
