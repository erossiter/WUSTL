IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 27  2005   Modesty And Stability   On The Bench  How John Roberts Can Convince Democrats To Vote For Him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Schumer Outlines Three Potential Pitfalls that Could Throw Comity of Process off Track  How Roberts Answers Questions  Type and Scope of Documents Turned over by White House  and Making Sure There is Enough Time for Thorough and Fair Hearings Affect Confirmation Process  Senator    Roberts Told Me He  s Not an Ideologue  if that Proves to be True  I  ll Vote for Him    U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts  spoke to the National Press Club at a luncheon today to discuss the nomination of Judge John G  Roberts to the U S  Supreme Court  In particular  Schumer addressed how Judge Roberts can convince Democrats to vote for his nomination in the coming weeks and months  Below is the text of the speech         MODESTY AND STABILITY    ON THE BENCH   HOW JOHN ROBERTS CAN CONVINCE DEMOCRATS TO VOTE FOR HIM      I want to thank the National Press Club for inviting me to be here today  including Rick Dunham  Bill McCarren  and all of you       I want to take this opportunity to make some remarks about the most important domestic decision this President is likely to make during his time in office    his first  and hopefully last  selection to the Supreme Court of the United States       Today  I want to talk both about his pick  what it means  and what it portends  On the process so far  I can say it started off quite well    I and my colleagues have been pleased that Judge Roberts has made himself available to meet with Senators at length  And those conversations have been meaningful  substantive  and helpful       So far  so good  But because I  and all my colleagues  want the process to continue to be a smooth one and because I think that no one gains from a fight about the process  I want to mention three areas where I am concerned we could go off track if we all don  t get together and work it out  We are all trying hard to make this work  but there are three potential stumbling blocks       I  ve said this before and I  ll say it again    I want to vote for Judge Roberts  But he has to meet the only standard that I have    is he an agenda driven ideologue or is he a mainstream jurist  We Democrats want to make this work  Our goal is simply to discharge our duty to the Constitution and to our constituents and assure ourselves that Judge Roberts is in the broad mainstream  This is not a game of   gotcha          In bringing up these problems  it is not my intent to throw down the gauntlet  but to identify them SO THEY CAN BE SOLVED through compromise  There are lots of ways to make this hearing process work  But if you place constraints on one aspect of the process  then you must necessarily expand some other aspect      I want to be clear    these three pitfalls are not insurmountable  but they are troubling  and I think a full  fair  and calm dialogue about them will go a long way towards preserving harmony in the weeks ahead       1  The Administration  s blanket refusal to release certain categories of documents  such as memos from Judge Roberts   days as a high ranking political deputy in the Solicitor General  s office  Given the somewhat revealing nature of documents already made public  it makes sense that more recent documents authored by the nominee when he was a higher ranking official  there is less reason to withhold all these documents before there has even been a discussion about them  There may be a way around this  to the satisfaction of everyone  but I know the Administration is pretty dug in on this  They feel very strongly about the issue of executive privilege  not just in this case but elsewhere  so it will be hard to resolve  But I hope the Administration gives second look       So the documents may well not be a deal breaker  But  when a category of documents is taken completely off the table  that puts a greater burden    and a need for greater openness    on other parts of the process       2  Judge Roberts   continuing concerns about answering questions  particularly answering his views about decided Supreme Court cases  For example  what is your view of the Supreme Court  s decision in United States v  Morrison  which outlawed parts of the Violence Against Women Act  Again  most opinion leaders and scholars think that this is an appropriate line of inquiry  See Professor Amar  s piece in today  s New York Times  It would go a long way towards creating a smooth and quicker moving process if he were to answer these questions        3  Constraints on the scope or duration of the hearing  as is being suggested  such as a hard deadline for a Senate floor vote by September 29  2005  Again  if we had all the documents in a timely way or if the nominee were open to answering questions that would quickly reveal his judicial reasoning  we would not need as much time for hearings  Of the three potential roadblocks  this is the most serious in my view  A requirement that we must finish by a date certain is more of a third rail to comity in the hearings than any other issue  For example  what if a new and important issue comes up in the nomination a week before the vote has been scheduled    as has happened before  There needs to be some flexibility in the process       There is a push and pull here  If the Administration stymies us at every turn  when all we are trying to do is fulfill our Constitutional duty to vet this nominee  we will have problems  I believe strongly that we can make this work    and it will take accommodation and understanding from both sides    but the sooner we have a rational discussion about it  the better        Now  although it is still early in the process and although Senators and citizens are still being introduced to Judge John Roberts  let me start by making a preliminary observation about the President  s pick       Now  many of us had little doubt that  at the outset of his second term  this President fully intended to fill his first Supreme Court vacancy with a committed conservative ideologue whose nomination would have immediately antagonized the half of the country that did not vote for him and plunged the nation into a debilitating and divisive debate over the direction of the high Court       This  after all  was a President who seemed to go out of his way to pick fights rather than pick judges       This  after all  was a President whose idea of working with the Senate was to pointedly re nominate a slew of rejected judges when he was re elected to a second term and all but dared us to reject them again       This  after all  was a President who took the almost unprecedented step of making a recess appointment of Judge William Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals  after he was rejected by the Senate       This was a President who time and time again chose combat over consensus and one upsmanship over bipartisanship       With his rhetoric  renominations  and recess appointment  the President clearly preferred to play a high stakes game of judicial chicken rather than reach out in a bipartisan way to defuse tensions over nominations to the federal bench       And so we came to the brink of a Constitutional crisis this past May  That  s when it appeared that the President  Vice President  and the Republican Senate leadership were bent on triggering the so called   nuclear option     which would have vaporized two centuries of Senate tradition  undermined our system of checks and balances  and destroyed any hope of Congressional cooperation for years to come       But we stepped back from that precipice with the leadership of the group of 14  preserved the Senate  s role as a vital check and balance  and got back to the people  s work       Then  with Justice Sandra Day O  Connor  s retirement  the President was again at a crossroads       Would he choose a nominee who was so apparently doctrinaire and divisive  so clearly ideological and out of the broad mainstream that Democrats would have no choice but to make an immediate stand against him       There were certainly several such candidates on the President  s widely publicized short list  They included Janice Rogers Brown  Michael Luttig  and Edith Jones        There were some nominees that it would have been clear we could have easily supported    such as someone in the mold of Sandra Day O  Connor  There are others who would have clearly and immediately caused deep division and perhaps bitter partisan fighting   Although the jury is still out on Judge Roberts  we know enough about him to know that he is not in the category of the most divisive nominees       I know that Democrats are still frustrated that they cannot pick the nominee    but they can take pride in having influenced Bush  s decision  To an important degree  Democrats should be heartened and happy that our calls for moderation and for consensus  and our strong stand against the nuclear option  undoubtedly played a part in influencing the President  s pick and persuading him to forego selecting one of the most controversial possibilities        Now  let me be clear that we still don  t know if Judge Roberts fits the bill  I for one still don  t know enough about Judge Roberts to make up my mind about how I will vote       Whether Judge Roberts is in the broad mainstream remains to be seen       But  after eight days  we can say that Judge Roberts is a serious man for a serious job  and he is clearly worthy of our serious consideration       That Judge Roberts is a serious nominee worthy of serious consideration was clear from my two meetings with him       I can report that Judge Roberts is an impressive  accomplished  and brilliant lawyer  He appears to be a decent and honorable man  I liked him personally  and I thoroughly enjoyed our discussions       As you in the press have widely noted  he certainly has a remarkable resume  But that  by itself  is not enough to get my vote       This process should not be a rote and robotic review of a resume  as some of my colleagues across the aisle have seemed to suggest        There are many people who boast impressive resumes and academic credentials  but who would misserve the American people from the bench  because of their extremist views  misguided judicial philosophy  or disrespect for the Constitution       But if they use their impressive resumes or brilliant minds to take away rights that the Court has assiduously guarded for decades  then their credentials and brilliance become tools for bad things rather than good   A good resume is important  but not dispositive  It is a necessary  but certainly not sufficient  prerequisite for serving in a lifetime post on the most powerful court in the land       So  what is sufficient  What does Judge Roberts    or any nominee to the Supreme Court  for that matter    have to do to win the votes of Democrats       He does not have to pass some litmus test  and he does not have to agree with me or any other Democrat on particular political or legal issues before we can vote for him  We understand that the President won the election and that he would nominate    and has nominated    a conservative       But here is what Judge Roberts must do       Fundamentally  he must persuasively demonstrate that he is not an ideologue       He must show that he does not want to impose his personal views on the rest of America  and that he will be faithful to the Constitution and the law  rather than to some political or ideological agenda        He must convince us that he will be restrained and independent and capable of growth in the position of Justice       And he must show us that he is within the broad mainstream    even if it  s a conservative mainstream    of judicial philosophy       Now another bit of good news  I think we  ve won the argument that judicial philosophy and ideology are important and proper considerations in confirming a nominee  This started out as something of a lonely argument in 2001 with an op ed piece I wrote in the New York Times       Those were lonely days  People attacked me for suggesting something that they said was completely novel  Well  it seems    as I will outline in a moment    that there is fairly broad consensus that asking questions about a nominee  s views  especially questions about his views on decided cases  is perfectly proper  both inside and outside of Congress       Senators from across the political spectrum    from Brownback to Specter to Kennedy    have emphasized the importance of knowing a candidate  s views before voting to confirm       In fact  in a sign that there is no longer much controversy over the importance of judicial philosophy  even President Bush publicly endorsed this view just after Sandra Day O  Connor retired         I am going to be deliberate in the process because I want the American people to know that  when I finally make a decision  it  s going to be one based upon a lot of research and a lot of thought about the character of the person  the integrity of the person  the ability of the person to do the job  and the philosophy of the person          So  just as the nomination of Judge Roberts was the product of an evaluation of his philosophy by the President  it is beyond doubt that his confirmation can occur only after a similar evaluation by the Senate       So  let me talk about that evaluation by the Senate       Judge Roberts has already begun the process of trying to convince me and the rest of the American people that he is not an ideologue  And he  s not off to a bad start       In fact at our meeting last night  he told me flatly that he is not an ideologue and said that he shares my aversion to ideologues  Furthermore  he said I could repeat that publicly and he said I could    that he is not an ideologue       That was certainly good to hear       It was also good to hear him say  as he reportedly told Senator Specter and me  that he believes in the values of   modesty    and   stability    on the Court       Those words signal  at least  a deference to the role of the legislature  a respect for precedent  and an aversion to judicial activism    of the left or of the right       But  if we are to confirm a nominee to the highest court in the land  we need to be sure of these sentiments       And it is up to the nominee to convince us  It is the nominee  s burden to prove that he is worthy  not the Senate  s burden to prove that he is unworthy       This is not a game  as it sometimes devolved into in the past  where Republicans looked for whether the nominee smoked marijuana in high school and Democrats looked for what movies a nominee checked out of the video store  Rather  this is a serious inquiry during which a nominee must show that he is not out of the mainstream in applying the law   There are some who suggest that the President  s choice is entitled to a presumption and that we should be little more than a rubber stamp  and that we should exercise our right to withhold consent only if there is some serious ethical lapse       But that view is contrary to the Constitution and to common sense        That the burden should fall to the nominee is not just my idea  Listen to the words of Timothy Flanagan  who is the President  s current nominee to be the Deputy Attorney General in the Justice Department  This is what he said in 1997 before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the confirmation process         I would reverse the presumption and place the burden squarely on the judicial nominee to prove that he or she has a well thought out judicial philosophy  one that recognizes the limited role of federal judges  Such a burden is appropriately borne by one seeking life tenure to wield the awesome judicial power of the United States          I could not agree more  So  how can Judge Roberts go about meeting that burden and securing our votes        It seems to me there are at least four sources of information about a nominee from which Senators can assure themselves of the general judicial philosophy and temperament of a nominee to the bench       1  The nominee  s personal references   2  The nominee  s prior judicial record  if any   3  The nominee  s other written record  and  4  The nominee  s candid answers to questions at the confirmation hearing       All of these sources of information  though  are not in abundant supply for every nominee  And so where one source is either lacking or unreliable  the other source becomes that much more vital when Senators fulfill their Constitutional duty of determining whether to give    or withhold    their consent       Some nominees to the Supreme Court have had no judicial record  for example  while others have spent years forging a legacy on an appeals court  which can provide an excellent guide to his or her judicial philosophy       There is a push and a pull here  If you constrain one part of the process  it naturally puts greater pressure on the other parts  For example  Justice Ginsburg had 13 years on the appeals court and had written 305 opinions and had penned 65 substantive articles  Because she had a long record  it was somewhat less critical for her to answer every question       And that is why I mentioned my concern about three places where this process could come to a head     1  on production of documents   2  on answering certain types of questions  and  3  on timing of the hearings  Let me say again  that none of us wants a fight  None of us  The reason I  m giving this speech is to help head this off and see if we can come to some accommodation and understanding in the best spirit of bipartisanship   So  let me review each of the sources of information about a nominee       First  the nominee  s personal references  though important  will always have to be taken with a grain of salt  Given the standard of etiquette in the legal community  it will not be common that a nominee  s peers  mentors  or colleagues will be publicly and brutally honest about his judicial philosophy and legal thinking       Also  it will be the rare person  and especially the rare lawyer or judge  who will want to earn the animosity of someone who could become one of the nine most powerful jurists in the country  That is only natural       So personal references are not to be ignored  but they are helpful only to a point  And that is certainly true in Judge Roberts   case  So let  s look at the second source of information       Second  the nominee  s prior judicial record can probably be the most instructive about his judicial philosophy and method of legal reasoning       A body of written opinions literally speaks volumes about a nominee  s views of the Constitution  loyalty to precedent  and penchant judicial activism       Justice Breyer  for example  like Justice Ginsburg  had spent years on the court of appeals  written hundreds of opinions  even more than Justice Ginsburg  and authored scores of scholarly works  These were enough to provide any Senator with patience and a pair of reading glass ample evidence of his legal thinking       In Judge Roberts   case  on the other hand  he has only spent two years on the bench and authored a small fraction as many opinions as Justice Ginsburg and Breyer had at the time of their nominations       So his prior judicial record is quite scant  It provides a small basis for judging his ideology and legal thinking  but less than for many  many recent nominees to the high court       So  let  s look at the third source of information  documents that come from the nominee  s past       Third  when the prior judicial record is scant  naturally a nominee  s other legal record becomes that much more prominent  This can include documents such as law review articles  opinion pieces  and briefs written in the practice of law       In the case of someone who  like Judge Roberts  spent years in high level Government positions  that most important part of that record may include memos and other documents written about significant legal issues while in Government service       Here  too  the record is copious because Judge Roberts served a long while in Government       This has been the first pitfall the White House has created  While the White House has dumped a large number of documents from Judge Roberts   days working for the Reagan Administration  much of which was already public  it appears to have taken a hard line stance against producing ANY documents from his time as the political deputy at the Solicitor General  s office under the first President Bush       It is the latter documents  which are more recent  that could well be more important  as they are more likely to reveal Judge Robert  s legal philosophy because he held a crucial policy position at the time  And it is certainly unclear at this stage whether there is any appropriate claim of immunity or privilege with respect to those documents because previous administrations have turned over such documents       It is too early to tell whether those documents would shed light on our inquiry about Judge Roberts   fitness for the Supreme Court  but the Administration has summarily cut off a critical source of information about a nominee who  if confirmed  will be able to    with the stroke of a pen    affect tens of millions of lives       Of course  the document issue many not be fatal  As I  ve said  there is a push and pull here  Something has to give    if the nominee does not want to answer questions  then we need more documents  If there is a moratorium on documents  then we need the nominee to answer questions more forthrightly and we need more time to ask those questions       I hope the White House will work with the Senate and reconsider its hardline stance  but in the meantime  we really are left with the last    and by process of elimination    most important source of possible information about Judge Roberts  answers to questions at the upcoming hearings       Fourth  Necessary questions and answers at the hearings  Because of the generally unilluminating nature of personal references  because of the scant judicial record  and because of the unilaterally restricted documentary record of Judge Roberts  the upcoming hearings in the Judiciary Committee will be VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN USUAL       They will be the most important source of information for Senators and the most important way for Judge Roberts to prove to the country that he is not an ideologue       The good news is this  If ever there was a nominee who was well equipped to meet his burden of proving he is suited for the Supreme Court  it is Judge Roberts       As you all have been reporting  Judge Roberts   skills as a litigator and advocate before the Supreme Court are legendary  and according to his mentor Chief Justice Rehnquist  perhaps unparalleled       Judge Roberts has made his reputation  and his fortune  by answering tough questions from the nine toughest questioners in America    the nine members of the Supreme Court  Compared to those nine  eight Democrats on the Judiciary Committee should be a walk in the park       I called Judge Roberts on Monday and told him that I knew he was a great litigator and that he should use his formidable skills to convince us that he is not an ideologue    and we can then all live happily ever after       Now  here  s the bad news  While Judge Roberts has earned a reputation for giving direct and responsive answers during oral arguments before the Supreme Court  he was much less forthcoming when he was last before the Judiciary Committee       Judge Roberts at his last hearing expressed concern about answering certain questions about his judicial philosophy  In particular  he did not want to answer questions about which past decisions of the Supreme Court he disagreed with and what he thought of the specific holdings in those decisions       Now  on this issue I think he is just wrong    and many conservatives and Republicans agree with me  There  s really no debate here       Last week when I met with Judge Roberts  some of the questions I gave him were about past cases  For example  one asked him his opinion of the Morrison case  which goes to the heart of the Commerce clause  a vital questions that goes to the heart of his judicial philosophy  I also asked questions regarding cases relating to the right to privacy  freedom of religion  and a host of other issues       And there is a growing consensus that I should be able to ask    and that Judge Roberts should answer    these questions       1  Just this morning two articles reflect that growing consensus  One was an op ed piece in the New York Times from a law professor making this precise point         In its confirmation hearings  the Senate should ask Judge John G  Roberts to analyze specific cases that have come before the Supreme Court in the past  That is the only way to get a meaningful sense of where he may move the nation s jurisprudence     Law Professor Vikram D  Amar      2  Former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger made the very same point today in the Washington Post  How can it be improper for a nominee to give his views of a decided Supreme Court case when sitting members of the Supreme Court    who continue to hear cases    may have criticized the same decided cases in dissent          What is wrong with asking a nominee whether he or she agrees with Justice Antonin Scalia s dissenting opinion in Planned Parenthood v  Casey when we know that Scalia agrees with it and Scalia will be able to take part in future related cases without anyone suggesting that to be a problem           3  A dozen leading legal ethicists confirmed in a letter to me recently that there is nothing inappropriate with Senators   asking questions about Constitutional issues  Relying on Justice Scalia  s opinion in White  these professors wrote         It is hardly possible that a person could achieve nomination for appointment to the United States Supreme Court and yet have no opinions about the significant constitutional issues and cases of our day  And the fact that the nominee does have such opinions and voices them will not undermine impartiality or the appearance of impartiality          4  The consensus is now so broad on the propriety of these questions that conservative commentators    some of whom are still kicking themselves because David Souter was not asked searching questions about his philosophy    are also coming to the conclusion that I am right  Just this past Sunday  the conservative Ryan Sager wrote this in the New York Post          Judge Roberts  should be asked his views on everything    from the Second Amendment to the Commerce Clause to the Takings Clause  And he should answer  We  re not buying a computer  We  re trusting a human being with the care of our Constitution  Someone besides the president should have some idea what  s going on inside Judge Roberts   head          5  Another conservative  Matthew J  Franck  recently wrote this     For the record  I like almost all of Senator Schumer s questions  and I too would like to know Judge Roberts s answers  Of course  I  d like different answers from the ones I expect Sen  Schumer would like  But almost without exception  the questions are fair game and even fairly stated  I see no ethics problem with answering any of them      Matthew J  Franck is chairman and professor of political science at Radford University in Radford  Virginia       But it  s not just commentators and scholars who believe that it is right and important to find out the answers to these questions       The American people    whose lives and livelihoods will be profoundly affected by the next Supreme Court justice    believe that they have the right to know where a nominee stands on important legal and Constitutional issues       That  s why 61 percent of Americans say that at his confirmation hearing Judge Roberts should answer questions about how he  d have ruled on past Supreme Court cases       They have an innate wisdom about these things  and here their views are consistent with those of Senators and scholars       The absurdity of the argument that asking for a nominee  s views on decided cases is wrong is highlighted by the long tradition of nominees being asked questions about what they think of past cases  Senators Hatch  Grassley  and Specter  and many others have asked these questions           Listen to Senator Mathias questioning Lewis Powell in 1971  He referred Powell to two criminal law cases    Miranda and Escobido    and asked   I am wondering if       you think these cases should be overruled             Powell responded  not by giving a commitment as to how he would rule in a particular case  but testified that   I just happened to have the view that the minority opinion was the sounder one             That was a real and substantive answer  and no one to my knowledge has ever suggested that was an ethical breach or that Justice Powell ever had to recuse himself from a case because of his testimony          Listen to Senator Hatch to Stephen Breyer in 1994    Do you believe that Washington v  Davis  an equal protection case  is settled law  and second  do you believe it was correctly decided          Again  Justice Breyer answered that question         Senator Grassley asked Clarence Thomas about a specific decided case  He asked if Judge Thomas   had any objections to    the test established in Bowers v  Hardwick   as a method of determining the extent of protectable private interests  Judge Thomas said that the methodology was one   certainly f ou nd agreeable          Despite his clear expression of his views on this case  Justice Thomas wrote a strongly worded dissent in defense of Bowers when it was overruled by the Supreme Court in 2003  No one asked Justice Thomas to recuse himself based on his testimony         Senator Leahy also asked then Judge Thomas about his views of a particular case  Specifically  he asked if the standard for libel established in New York Times v  Sullivan   provide s  sufficient protection for public figures in your mind     and if Judge Thomas saw   any need to change that standard     Judge Thomas also answered that question         Senator Metzenbaum asked then Judge Ginsburg    In your view  does the Casey decision stand for the proposition that the right to choose is a fundamental constitutional right     Judge Ginsburg answered       And the list goes on and on       Now  at my meeting with Judge Roberts yesterday  I went through some of my questions with him  Again  he expressed concerns about answering detailed questions about particular cases       For example  at his earlier hearing  Judge Roberts did not want to give me his opinion of the Supreme Court  s decision in United States v  Morrison  which not only struck down provisions of the Violence Against Women Act  a piece of legislation very dear to my heart as I was sponsor of the House bill  but goes to one of the fundamental issues facing the Court and the country today    the Commerce Clause       When I met with him  we discussed the Commerce Clause and I explained how important it was to me  but he said he was unable to answer direct questions about prior cases       So I tried another tack  and spent 30 minutes asking his views about the Commerce Clause and how it fit in with his statements about   modesty    and   stability     At the end of the discussion  I was convinced that Judge Roberts would not overturn decades of established law and shrink the Commerce Clause to a position it held in the 1890 s and 1930 s  Our meeting was detailed  interesting  and fruitful       As I  ve said  I think Judge Roberts   reticence is wrong  but I clearly have no way to compel the nominee to answer my questions  I hope and pray he will reconsider  This is a crucial part of determining whether we have the information we need  It is the second pitfall we face       4b  Timing of the hearings  So  given that at the moment the scant judicial record  given the scant documentary record  and given the scant hope that Judge Roberts will answer pointed questions at the hearing  it will be that much harder for him to meet his burden of proving he is not and ideologue and is within the judicial mainstream       So if all these constraints are placed on us  this is going to consume a great deal of time  It can be done  I suppose  but only with great difficulty  I can ask questions generally about the Commerce Clause  for example  as I did during my meeting with him yesterday  But that will take time       Without the ability to get to the heart of the matter by asking pointed questions about his views of cases decided by the Supreme Court  I and other Senators will be left to asking incremental questions about the text and structure of the Constitution and about the few decisions that he has written on the lower court  And  as I have said  that will take time       If Judge Roberts gives me the same answers in public that he gave me in private    as he assured me he would    much of my concerns would be abated  But it took a half hour to get some comfort on a single issue  So we will need ample time at the hearing to go into these issues       There are a dozen or more other issues    free speech  privacy  the separation of church and state  just to name a few    that would require equal treatment at a hearing  Each will take time       The bottom line is this  given the scantness of the record  to get my vote and the votes of many Democrats  Judge Roberts either has to become more willing to answer questions that everyone else seems to understand he can answer OR the hearings have to go on long enough so that I and others can be satisfied he has met his burden  And that may be very long indeed       If it  s the latter  any move to limit the time of the hearings will be extremely detrimental to the process and to our obligation to the Constitution and our constituents       If we do not receive documents and there is no direct answering of questions about decided cases and there is a deadline for a vote on a set day  that would be unfair to the process and would undermine our Constitutional duty       Let me say this  Judge Roberts does not have to answer every question or any particular question in any particular way  This is not a game of gotcha  it is not an end in itself  It is a means to finding out how he thinks       A false and artificial deadline could well be the third rail        If there is a rush to a vote  or a time limit  that would be a strong signal that there is an effort to railroad the nominee  rather than help discover the nominee  s philosophy  That is not necessary  especially given that Sandra Day O  Connor has agreed to stay on until a replacement has been confirmed       So if we don  t get documents  strike one       If we don  t get direct answers to questions  strike three       Let  s not tempt fate and risk strike three    by creating an unnecessary and artificial deadline for concluding the hearing       Let me repeat  So far  so good  So far things are going well  I want to be convinced to vote for him  as I believe almost every one of my Democratic colleagues does       We simply want to be convinced that he is not an ideologue        So let us set up a structure that makes it possible for that to happen
