IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 29  2005 At Start Of Busy Summer Travel Season  Schumer  Dangerous Hole In Air Security   Terrorists On Watch List Can Board U S  Bound International Flights Unchecked                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Flight Manifests of Passengers Who Board Planes Headed for U S  from Abroad Not Checked until after Plane Takes Off  Congress Mandated Solution by February 14  2005  still no Change from DHS      Two U S  Bound Flights in Last Several Weeks Coming from Europe Had Passenger Names Similar to those on the Terrorist Watch List  Both Had to be Diverted      New Schumer Study Reveals 125 Flights a Day Land at JFK and Newark Originating from 12 Countries Known to Harbor Terrorists In the last several weeks  two flights entering the United States from abroad were diverted because they were found to be carrying passengers with names on the terrorist watch list  Today  U S Senator Charles E  Schumer said that the practice of checking flight manifests against passenger lists only after the flight is already airborne should be stopped as soon as possible and called on DHS to enact a rule to ensure that manifests are checked before the plane leaves the ground  Schumer also released a survey this week of New York area airports that found over 125 flights a day with passengers originating from just 12 terror hot spot countries landing at JFK and Newark Liberty International Airport         It doesn  t seem like a mission impossible to require that we check all passengers against the terrorist watch list before a flight heads to the United States     Schumer said    The incredible danger and tremendous inconvenience caused by not clearing names with the terrorist watch list before a flight takes off is unacceptable          Current law requires airlines to transmit their international flight manifests to DHS within 15 minutes of take off so that it can be checked against the terrorist watch list  Recognizing the potential for terrorist exploitation  Congress  in December 2004  passed into law  with the Intelligence Reform bill  a requirement that DHS offer within 60 days of passage new regulations mandating airlines transmit their international flight manifests before an international flight takes off  This would allow Customs and Border Protection enough time to check passenger information in order to stop a terrorist from even boarding the plane         The bottom line is  the time has come and gone     Schumer said    If there was ever a time that a stitch in time saves nine  this is it          According to the Bureau of Transportation statistics 80 104 direct international flights came in to New York  s two major international airports    JFK and Newark Liberty    from January through November of 2004  JFK had 46 830 international flights land and Newark Liberty 33 174 both from over 50 different foreign countries         Flying airplanes to American airports is a privilege  not a right  If these flight security standards don  t measure up to those we have in place here  we need to end those flights immediately   said Schumer   Terrorists are smart  and they don t hit us where we are strong  but where we are weak  We ve done a lot of work bringing U S  airports up to snuff but if terrorists know they can just easily board a US bound plane halfway across the world carrying a bomb    and they can    then that s what just what they are going to do        Because federal statistics track country and not airport of origin  the total number of airports serving JFK and Newark Liberty is significantly higher  because at least a bare majority of foreign countries have more than one airport serving the United States  either directly or through several connections  There are countless connections travelers can make to get to the United States from even the most remote locations  Every one of these flights  if not thoroughly checked  offers a prime opportunity to strike the United States       But a study by Schumer s office this week found that on just one day    Tuesday May 31  2005    just after the holiday weekend  there are 125 flights from known terrorist hotspots arriving at JFK or Newark Liberty Airports including            18 from Istanbul  Turkey       4 from Riyadh  Saudi Arabia       8 from Damascus Syria       12 from Beirut Lebanon       22 from Dubai       11 from Kuwait       2 from Algeria       9 from Amman  Jordan       12 from Nairobi  Kenya       4 from Kazakhstan       12 from Bahrain       11 from Cairo  Egypt      To try and counter this threat  Schumer today Department of Homeland Security Secretary  Michael Chertoff to ensure that a new rule is devised  submitted  and implemented to close this loophole  and guarantee that flight diversions don  t become an all too common occurrence       In his to Chertoff  Schumer wrote   I am very concerned both that international manifests are checked only after a flight takes off and that DHS has exceeded this deadline  This is not only because of the immediate security concerns  but also as a sign of DHS  s inability to quickly respond to nationally agreed upon gaps in our security          Click here to view
