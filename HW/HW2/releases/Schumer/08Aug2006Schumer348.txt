IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 8  2006 As Senate Authorizes New Funding For Autism  Schumer Visits Renowned Jowonio School To Urge House To Do Same So Bill Can Become Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator  Joined By Leading Autism Researchers And Families Affected By the Autistic Spectrum  Announces the Passage of Senate Legislation Funding Autism Research  Education     Schumer Pushes House to Vote on Bipartisan Combating Autism Act  Which Would Provide  860 Million In New Funding Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer toured Central New York  s Jowonio School  a renowned school that focuses on the inclusion of all children  where he announced the Senate s unanimous approval of the Combating Autism Act  which would authorize  860 million over five years to increase and coordinate federal autism research and education   Late last Thursday  the bill unanimously passed the Senate  Now Schumer will push the House of Representatives to do the same so that the bill can become a law  The Combating Autism Act  would authorize  860 million over five years to increase and coordinate federal research and education about autism  Nationwide  autism has a tremendous impact on the lives of children and their families   The rate of autism diagnoses has grown in the past few decades  with 1 out of every 166 children now being diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder         Autism is a nationwide epidemic that has lived in the shadows for too long     Schumer said     The Jowonio School and facilities like it across the country help thousands of children and their families every year cope with the devastating affects of autism  but they need more help   Our bill would not only provide critical funds to schools and other organizations as they help families affected by autism receive counseling and education  but would also give public and private researchers the tools they need to find a cure for this terrible disease          Since 1975  when The Jowonio School initially received special support from the New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities  the school has operated as an inclusive educational facility where typical children and children with special needs can learn in the same classrooms  The school has close to 90 full time and part time employees  including classroom teachers and aides  a resource staff which includes therapists and a family support team  and clinical and administrative support staff   Jowonio s staff is committed to an inclusive education for all students         While Jowonio provides outstanding services to its students  in general there are not enough resources for children with special needs in New York State   1 700 kids a year are placed at facilities outside New York State  at a cost of  2 million to  3 million a year     In addition  studies by the U S  Centers for Disease Control   Prevention suggest that the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders has significantly increased  from approximately four in 10 000 children born in the early 1990s to as many as one in every 166  children born today  Despite its strikingly high prevalence  autism research remains one of the least funded areas of medical research by both public and private sources  Currently  the causes of autism are unknown and there are no specific medical treatments for autism  or a cure   Furthermore  physicians have no blood test or diagnostic scan that can definitively diagnose autistic spectrum disorders       The Combating Autism Act would create a national education program for doctors and the public about autism  provide grants for statewide autism screening  create a NIH center of excellence for research on autism  and create a nationwide data clearinghouse   Additionally  the bill would increase the collaboration of individuals and groups who are working on autism  extend the activities of the Autism Coordinating Committee that manages efforts of various federal health agencies  and require the NIH to create a strategic plan to combat autism       Schumer was joined today by Jamie Burke and his mother Sheree   Jamie  who has autism  just graduated from Westhill High School and will be attending Syracuse University this fall  where he is interested in studying genetics and autism research  Also joining Schumer will be Dr  Douglas Biklen  Dean of the School of Education at Syracuse University  Dr  Carroll Grant  Director  ML Williams Developmental Evaluation Clinic  Linda Karmen  Director of Special Children s Services at Onondaga County Department of Health  Dr  Greg Liptak  Neurodevelopmental Pediatrician at the Upstate Medical Center  Sharon Salvo  parent and Director of the Central New York Autism Society of America
