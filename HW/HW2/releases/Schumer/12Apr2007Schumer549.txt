complete     I don t know   will not be an adequate response to any question by the Committee   Schumer said   At a hearing on March 29  the Attorney General s former Chief of Staff  D  Kyle Sampson  said  I don t know  122 times in his testimony  leaving many looming questions        Schumer also said that the Justice Department must promptly turn over unredacted and missing documents requested by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee so that the Attorney General can discuss these documents at the hearing        Below and attached is Sen  Schumer s letter to the Attorney General outlining ten central questions that the Senator will ask the Attorney General next Tuesday        April 12  2007    Attorney General Alberto Gonzales   United States Department of Justice   950 Pennsylvania Ave  NW   Washington  DC 20530     Dear Attorney General Gonzales      It has been reported that you are actively preparing for your April 17 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  and I appreciate your recognition of the importance of your appearance  As you prepare  I write to share several key topics on which I intend to question you at next week s hearing     I am profoundly disappointed that  to date  you have been unaware of or unable to recall certain fundamental aspects of how and why the Administration dismissed a group of U S  attorneys last year  Therefore  I am taking the unusual step of providing some of my questions ahead of time so that you can do whatever is necessary to refresh your recollection or to gather information on these points prior to your testimony  Without clarification on these basic but important questions  I find it difficult to imagine how the Judiciary Committee or the American public can have confidence in your management of the Department of Justice  I sincerely hope that you will be able to provide full and detailed information at our hearing on April 17     A February 23  2007  letter written to me on your behalf stated that   t he Department is not aware of Karl Rove playing any role in the decision to appoint Mr  Griffin   This directly contradicts a statement by your former aide  D  Kyle Sampson  that Mr  Griffin s appointment was  important  to Mr  Rove   Please provide a full account of all communications regarding Tim Griffin between the Department of Justice and Mr  Rove or aides communicating on Mr  Rove s behalf     You have not clarified the involvement of Mr  Rove in the process of dismissing a group of U S  attorneys  Yet in response to my questioning at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on March 29  2007  Mr  Sampson stated under oath that he remembered  learning from the Attorney General that Mr  Rove had complained to the Attorney General about U S  Attorneys in three districts  who were not aggressively pursuing voter fraud  Please provide a full account of all your communications with Mr  Rove regarding the performance or possible dismissal of any United States attorney  and state whether Mr  Rove ever expressed the view that a particular U S  attorney should be removed from office     President Bush has personally confirmed that he passed complaints to you last fall about certain U S  attorneys  handling of voter fraud cases  yet you stated on March 26  2007  that you do not recall this conversation  Please provide a full account of all your communications with President Bush regarding the performance or possible dismissal of any United States attorney     Although you reportedly do not recall speaking with President Bush about complaints regarding voter fraud cases in three jurisdictions  the White House has confirmed that one of the districts President Bush mentioned to you was New Mexico   Washington Post  March 19  2007  Department of Justice documents and Mr  Sampson s testimony confirm that David Iglesias  formerly the U S  Attorney for the District of New Mexico  was added to the list of prosecutors to be fired sometime between October 17  2006 and November 7  2006  On what precise date  why  and by whom was Mr  Iglesias placed on the list of U S  attorneys to be fired      Department officials have reported that you do not recall a November 27  2006  meeting with your top advisors to discuss U S  attorneys  but departmental documents support Mr  Sampson s testimony that you did attend that meeting  Please give a full account of the meeting about U S  attorneys on November 27  2006  including all of your statements at the meeting  and clarify whether you personally approved the dismissal of specific U S  attorneys on that occasion     At a press conference on March 13  2007  you stated that you  never had a discussion about where things stood  in the process of removing certain U S  attorneys  However  Mr  Sampson testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he spoke with you on at least five occasions about dismissing a group of U S  attorneys  How many times  and when  did you discuss the plan or process to dismiss certain U S  attorneys with any official at your Department  any official at the White House  or any other person  Over what period of time did these discussions occur     You have also stated that you  don t recall being involved in deliberations involving the question of whether or not a U S  attorney should or should not be asked to resign   How many times  and when  did you discuss whether a specific U S  attorney should be removed from office with any official at your Department  any official at the White House  or any other person  Over what period of time did these discussions occur     A Justice Department spokeswoman has stated   The Attorney General has no recollection of any plan or discussion to replace U S  attorneys while he was still White House counsel    New York Times  March 16  2007  However  Mr  Sampson wrote on January 9  2005   before you had taken office as Attorney General   that  Judge and I discussed briefly  the issue of removing and replacing U S  attorneys   OAG0180  Please describe any and all discussions  with Mr  Sampson or any other person  which you initiated or participated in while you were Counsel to the President regarding any plan to remove and replace U S  attorneys during President Bush s second term     On March 26  regarding the role of the White House in removing U S  attorneys  you stated   As far as I know    they did not play a role in    in adding names or taking off names   Yet Mr  Sampson s testimony indicated that he discussed the names of specific U S  attorneys who could be fired  including Patrick Fitzgerald  at meetings with White House Counsel Harriet Miers and her aides  Please provide a full account of communications between any member of the Department of Justice and the White House regarding which specific U S  attorneys would be asked to resign     Following the Deputy Attorney General s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 6  2007  your spokesman sent an e mail to Mr  Sampson stating   The Attorney General is upset with stories on the U S  Attorneys this morning  He thought some of the DAG s  Deputy Attorney General s  statements were inaccurate   You also admitted at a press conference on March 13  2007  that Department officials shared incomplete information with Congress  What specific statements to Congress by the Deputy Attorney General and other officials were inaccurate      Sincerely      Charles E  Schumer   United States Senator
