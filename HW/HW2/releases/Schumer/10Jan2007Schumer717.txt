IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 10  2007 With Upstate NY Airports Facing Significant Air Traffic Controller Staffing Shortage  Schumer Unveils New Plan To Dramatically Boost Controller Recruitment  Training  And Hiring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Despite More Flights Taking Off at Airports Across The State  Number of Controllers 25 Percent Lower than What is Needed in NY This Year and Dropping    Rampant Short Staffing and Budget Cuts Could Cause Delays  Close Calls and Even Disaster   Schumer to Push to Triple Additional Funding for Controller Hiring and Call on FAA to Increase Benefits to Boost Recruitment and Immediately Fill V With air service on the rise in communities across upstate New York  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that there are potentially 25 percent  watching the skies over New York this year than there should be  Schumer will say that  with air service growing  fewer controllers watching more flights could lead to delays  close calls  and even disaster   One of the primary reasons for this shortage is the growing number of air traffic controllers who are retiring  In the past  between 1 and 2   of the controller workforce became eligible for retirement each year   That number will reach 10 percent in 2007   In just the last week  100 air traffic controllers across the country have already retired  according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association  NATCA          Air traffic controllers are the glue that keeps our aviation system together and that glue is starting to wither away     Schumer said    Air traffic controllers exist for a reason  to ensure that the planes taking off and landing are doing so safely  Sadly the FAA continues to short staff control towers in an effort to control costs while they eschew safety and efficiency   The FAA needs to open its eyes  because as air traffic goes up  so too does the need for air traffic controllers  Half staffing towers just doesn  t cut it          One of the primary reasons for this shortage is the growing number of air traffic controllers who are retiring  In the past  between 1 and 2   of the controller workforce became eligible for retirement each year  That percentage has increased 3 and 4  per year and will peak at almost 10  per year in 2007 and remain above 5  per year through 2011        The FAA has estimated that 7 100 controllers  roughly 45  of its current workforce  will retire over the next eight years  According to NATCA  the union that represents air traffic controllers  there are 1 000 fewer air traffic controllers nationwide now than three years ago  while air traffic is on the rise      Short staffing at air traffic control facilities can cause delays  congestion  close calls  and even disaster  Last year  49 people were killed and one injured when Comair Flight 5191 crashed into the woods trying to take off from Lexington  KY  s Bluegrass Airport  The ensuing investigation has uncovered that only one air traffic controller was on duty at the time of the accident  though the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  has determined that Bluegrass Airport must have two controllers on duty at all times       Towers across upstate New York are currently facing controller shortages due to FAA understaffing  budget cuts and impending retirements   According to NATCA  in upstate New York  there are currently only 164 controllers watching the skies  including in house trainees and controllers on medical leave  instead of the 192 authorized by the FAA   This represents a more than 25 percent shortfall   Below is how the numbers break out at upstate airports and major connections            The air traffic control tower at Albany International Airport currently only has 26 full time controllers and one trainee  instead of the 30 authorized by the FAA   With seven controllers eligible to retire this year  the tower could be 33 percent understaffed this year            The air traffic control tower at Syracuse Hancock International Airport currently only has 20 full time controllers and two trainees  instead of the 30 authorized by the FAA   With one controller possibly eligible to retire this year  the tower could be more than 25 percent understaffed this year            The air traffic control tower at Rochester International Airport currently only has 24 full time controllers and two trainees  instead of the 30 authorized by the FAA   With two controllers eligible to retire this year  the tower could be 20 percent understaffed this year            The air traffic control tower at Binghamton International Airport currently only has 11 full time controllers and one trainee  instead of the 17 authorized by the FAA   With two controllers eligible to retire this year  the tower could be 40 percent understaffed this year  Elmira Corning Airport currently has 12 active controllers with two trainees  with 13 authorized by the FAA   There is one controller eligible to retire this year            The air traffic control towers at White Plains and Stewart Airport currently only have 15 and 9 full time controllers working respectively  instead of the 18 and 12 authorized by the FAA   There is one trainer also working at White Plains   With two White Plains and four Stewart controllers eligible to retire this year  towers in the Hudson Valley could face a shortfall of more than 35 percent            The air traffic control tower at Buffalo International Airport currently only has 29 full time controllers and one trainee  with 30 authorized by the FAA   With four controllers eligible to retire this year  the tower could be 15 percent understaffed this year       Smaller airports  particularly in the North Country and the Southern Tier the control towers are only staffed with one or two full time controllers   However  the main  and sometimes only  out of state connections from these airports  specifically Boston and Pittsburgh  are also dealing with significant controller shortages  Back ups and incidents and these airports would quickly ripple back to the New York airports            The air traffic control tower at Boston Logan International Airport currently only has 32 full time controllers and one trainee  instead of the 38 authorized by the FAA   With 13 controllers eligible to retire this year  the tower could be 50 percent understaffed this year            The air traffic control tower at Pittsburgh International Airport currently only has 65 full time controllers instead of the 80 authorized by the FAA   With 20 controllers eligible to retire this year  the tower could be 45 percent understaffed this year       In addition  towers in all of New York State have far less controllers working than they should have  According to NATCA  the FAA has authorized 892 total controllers to be working in towers and centers in all of New York State   However  there are only 699 fully trained and working       Today  Schumer unveiled his plan to reverse the potentially devastating effects of massive air traffic controller retirements and boost recruitment across the board            Triple funding for recruitment  training  and hiring   Today  Schumer sent a personal letter to President Bush asking him to include a significant increase in funding in his FY 2008 for air traffic controllers recruiting  training  and hiring   For Fiscal Year 2007  the Administration only requested an additional  18 2 million for recruitment  training and hiring  which would only add an additional 132 controllers   Schumer today asked the Administration to request  54 million in its budget to make up for losses and ensure there are enough controllers watching the skies             Reverse cuts to trainee salary  s and benefits   Prior to September 2006  air traffic controller trainees received a  30 000 salary and per diem stipend   Under the newly imposed contract  the FAA cut their salary to roughly  17 000 per year and eliminated the per diem   Schumer today wrote to FAA Administrator Marion Blakey asking her to reverse the FAA  s decision to cut the salary and per diem
