IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 17  2006 In Light Of Concrete Chunk Falling From City Viaducts  Schumer Demands Norfolk Southern Immediately Reverse Decision To Increase Train Speeds In Elmira                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Less Than A Month After Norfolk Southern  s Unilateral Decision To Increase Freight Rail Speeds From 30 to 50 MPH  Falling Concrete Has Forced Block To Be Closed   At Schumer  s Urging  Federal Railroad Administration Is Now Inspecting Viaduct And Overpass Infrastructure This Week   Schumer  This is a Warning Shot Over Norfolk Southern  s Bow That Must Be Heeded    For the Safety of  In light of a concrete chunk falling yesterday from city viaducts while a train was traveling overhead  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today demanded that Norfolk Southern immediately reverse their decision to increase train speeds in Elmira   When Norfolk Southern unilaterally increased the speed of their trains from 30 to 50 mph  they assured the concerned community that they would not permit their trains to run at this speed if doing so were unsafe   Yesterday  a block of Railroad Avenue had to be closed after a piece of concrete fell off a viaduct as a Norfolk Southern train passed overhead   At Schumer  s request  the FRA is in Elmira this week to conduct a study of the viaducts and overpasses and other rail infrastructure used by Norfolk Southern  s trains  Schumer said that until a comprehensive assessment of all rail related infrastructure  including viaducts  is completed by the FRA  having all trains run again at 30 mph in Elmira is the only sensible course of action          Fortunately  no one was hurt yesterday when concrete fell from the viaduct     Schumer said     Clearly  in the interest of the safety of Elmira  s residents and visitors  this is a warning shot over Norfolk Sothern  s bow that must be heeded   We need a full inspection and questions answered before the community can be confident that the infrastructure can support the higher speeds   Until that happens  the trains must slow down          The infrastructure of Norfolk Southern in the Elmira community is old and decaying   The viaducts are 75 years old with little or no maintenance done to the underside and there is spalled concrete  exposed reinforcing and failed drainage systems all along the system   Norfolk Southern operates freight only elevated route through the Elmira community  which sometimes carries hazardous materials   In September  Norfolk Southern announced that it would increase the speed of its trains traveling through Elmira  from 30 mph to 50 mph  in order to remain competitive        Last month  Schumer urged Charles W  Moorman  Chairman  President and CEO of Norfolk Southern Corporation  to send a representative to Elmira to meet with city officials  hear their concerns regarding freight train speed and work with community leaders to find an equitable solution to this situation   Last week  Schumer and Elmira City Officials urged Joseph H  Boardman  Administrator of the FRA  to investigate the condition of viaducts and overpasses in the town to determine the impact to the infrastructure as a result of an increase in speed  and to further articulate what short and long term infrastructure impacts could result from this increase in speed       Today  in a personal letter to Moorman  Schumer wrote    Norfolk Southern unilaterally and swiftly increased train speeds  and Norfolk Southern can reverse this decision with the same speed  As you know  at my request  the FRA is now in Elmira conducting a study of the viaducts and overpasses and other rail infrastructure used by Norfolk Southern  s trains  Until a comprehensive assessment of all rail related infrastructure  including viaducts  is completed by the FRA  having all trains run again at 30 mph in Elmira is the only sensible course of action           Freight trains traveling throughout New York State could pose many safety risks  In 2001  a CSX train crashed in Rochester  derailing 23 cars  three of which spilled thousands of toxic chemicals into the Genesee River  However  this accident could have been far more tragic had the chemicals spilled in to a neighborhood or a crowded community area   In 2004  a CSX freight train derailed in Rockland County  resulting in four cars spilling nearly 200 tons of silicon metal  Last year  a CSX train traveling through the Capital Region went through the gates and ran into a car        Schumer is the author of The Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act which would set tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology   The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and require the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents
