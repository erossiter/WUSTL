IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 28  2005 Schumer Levin  President  s Social Security Proposals In Trouble  Privatization Plus Deep Benefit Cuts Worse Than Privatization Alone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer and Rep  Sander Levin  D MI  held a joint conference call to respond to President Bush  s announcement last night that he wanted to not only privatize Social Security  but also include a plan that would deeply cut benefits to lower and middle class families  Schumer  a member of the Senate Finance Committee and Chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee  and Levin  the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security have both been at the forefront on the policy debate on Social Security reform and stalwarts against reckless  deficit exploding privatization plans         The President has basically said that his Social Security reform runaway train has a big sign on the back saying   Privatization or Bust   and the American people aren  t getting on that train     Schumer said         The President s offer of  sliding scale  benefit cuts would result in the biggest benefit cut in the history of Social Security   said Rep  Levin   Social Security is not a poverty program  it is a retirement system people have worked hard for  paid into and have earned  The President and Congressional Republicans are determined to replace the guarantee of Social Security with risky private accounts and massive benefit cuts       Sen  Schumer outlined a number of other points below in the conference call          These benefit cuts for the middle class are not chump change when you consider that one fifth of all individuals over 65 rely on Social Security for all of their income  and two thirds of individuals over 65 rely on it for more than half of their income          The President and his allies continue to talk about how people will be able to earn a higher rate in the market than they currently do through Social Security  This is like comparing apples to oranges  Social Security is an insurance program  not an investment plan  Comparing the market  s rate of return to the rate of return in an insurance program is a completely invalid concept          It  s hard to ignore that the stock market has essentially been flat for SIX YEARS    it is back where it was in April 1999  So the President is telling people that they will be better off in the market  but the market has risks    and what if the market is flat or down for several years in a row  like it has been now  right before people retire          It  s important for people to recognize that the same money cannot be used for two different purposes  That is one of the huge problems with the President  s plan  Current payroll taxes pay current benefits  If people are allowed to set a portion of their payroll taxes aside  and keep them for their own accounts  then trillions of dollars have to be borrowed to pay benefits to current retirees or near retirees  Given that we have record deficits already  that  s bad economics       Schumer concluded    The President has now made his privatization plan even less attractive  Mr  Pozen  s price indexing will cut benefits for people who earn as little as  20 000 a year  Privatization plus deep benefit cuts to middle class citizens is even worse than privatization alone  We urge the President to take privatization off the table and to create a bipartisan commission that can make the adjustments necessary to preserve Social Security for current retirees and future generations          The President  s so called progressive price indexing proposal will require deep benefit cuts for middle class seniors        There would be at least a

  Benefit Cuts From Progressive Price Indexing Will Come On Top of the Privatization Tax in the Bush Plan  As a result of the President  s decision to couple so called progressive price indexing with privatization  workers who choose private accounts will see their benefit cuts cut twice    Under private accounts like those the President has proposed  the cost of the private accounts is offset by reducing substantially the Social Security benefits of those who elect the accounts  If progressive price indexing is combined with private accounts of this nature  Social Security benefits will be lowered twice    once due to the indexing changes and a second time to pay for the private accounts  As this analysis explains  the result would be that millions of middle income workers would receive little or no Social Security benefits in retirement  They would be left largely with only their private account      Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  4 26 05  emphasis added
