IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 28  2005 With Staten Island Gas Prices Approaching Record Highs  Schumer Demands President Release Oil Reserves To Drop Gas Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even Though President has Previously Refused  OPEC  s Recent Manipulation of Oil Prices  Rising Gas Prices Demand Action    Schumer Analysis Finds Average Staten Island Family With 2 Cars Could Pay  402 More For Gas This Year  Schumer To Detail New Steps To Lower Price of Oil With gas prices at an all time high as Staten Islanders pay 29 cents per gallon more for gas now than they did last year  and with summer driving season just around the corner  when gasoline demand and prices peak  Senator Charles E Schumer today unveiled a new analysis showing that the average Staten Island family with two cars is paying  402 more this year than last year  Schumer called on the Administration to release stored government oil reserves that would quickly lower gas prices         Staten Islanders are being burned by high oil prices to heat their homes and run their cars     Schumer said    If we thought last year was bad  I  m afraid we haven  t seen anything yet  Prices are already nearly three dimes ahead of where they were last year at this time with no end in sight  Today I am asking the President to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because we must do everything possible to lower prices  and tapping the SPR is a proven way to drive down gas prices          On Thursday  the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at the nearly record setting level of  54 17  and crude oil has been trading at above  50 per barrel since February 22nd  In addition  the average price at the pump in New York State has hit  2 20    already 33 cents higher than it was last year on this date  National average retail gasoline prices have increased to 2 13 and some analysts predict that prices could continue to increase as the summer driving season rapidly approaches       This year the average two car family on Staten Island will pay  402 above the high prices paid at the pump last year  That is over  100 more than the average New York family with two cars who will pay  255 more this year than last year  In total  Staten Islanders will pay  47  500 000 more this year than they did last year         The bottom line is  people who live on Staten Island are getting gouged at the pump     said Schumer       Schumer said today that in spite of the economic threat created by OPEC s market manipulation  the Administration has continued to adhere to its policy of taking oil off of the market and placing it in the SPR  This policy  which further tightens oil markets by taking much needed supplies out of commerce  is slated to take 92 000 barrels per day off of the market during the height of the driving season between April and September despite the fact that the SPR is currently over 97 percent full       Last week  s tragic oil refinery blast in Texas may also help to push gasoline prices higher  Although output at the refinery  which produces 3  of the national gasoline supply  has not been seriously disrupted even minor stoppages in gasoline production can have an impact on gasoline prices due to the tightness of U S  Refining capacity  the impending summer driving season  and the concern that a potential disruption causes in the commodity marketplace       Schumer today urged the Administration to counteract the OPEC supply manipulation and calm the markets by deferring deliveries of oil to the SPR and releasing oil from the SPR through a swap  Initiating a swap of oil from the SPR to increase the supply of oil is a proven way to reduce the price of gasoline and heating oil       In the fall of 2000  Schumer successfully convinced the Clinton Administration to swap 30 million barrels over 30 days  causing crude oil prices to quickly fall by over  6 per barrel and wholesale gasoline prices to fall  0 14 per gallon  Under a swap  the federal government could decide on a set quantity of oil to release from the SPR  and accepts bids from private companies for the rights to that oil  The companies would then bid on how much oil they are willing to return to the SPR at a later date  For example  if the federal government decided to release oil and a private company wanted to obtain 10 million barrels  the company could bid for the 10 million barrels by promising 15 million barrels to be returned to the SPR at a later date         Prices at the pump are getting out control  and will get much higher unless something is done to rein them in     Schumer said    Accessing the SPR is not only smart economic policy  it also puts money back into the wallets of Staten Islanders
