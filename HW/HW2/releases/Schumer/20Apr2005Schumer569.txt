                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Skyrocketing Oil Prices Drive Up Costs By  2 500 Over the Past Three Years For Average Upstate New York Farmer    With Costs for New York Farmers Skyrocketing  Schumer Details Steps To Lower Prices    Schumer to Detail Oil Price Increases in Each County  Capital Region Farmers Have Paid  8 3 million more  Central NY  8 3 m  Rochester Finger Lakes  17 4 m  Hudson Valley  10 1 m  North Count New York farmers are paying 35 percent more to operate their farms  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed today  Schumer unveiled a new study showing that the average New York farmer is paying more than  2 500 over 2002 costs and called on the Administration to release stored government oil reserves that would quickly lower gas prices  Schumer also urged the FTC to block the ChevronTexaco Unocal merger and to review the Exxon Mobil merger and the Chevron Texaco mergers to asses their impact on gasoline prices         New York  s farmers are being stretched too thin as it is     Schumer said    The skyrocketing price of oil should be the last thing they need to worry about    The bottom line is  the price of gas is going way up and competition is going way down     Schumer said    Without regulating the mergers of these behemoth oil companies  gas prices will continue to go full speed ahead and nothing can rein them in          Schumer said today that farmers are hit particularly hard by rising gas prices because most farm planting and harvesting equipment uses diesel fuel or gasoline  When farmers apply fertilizer this year  they will be hit twice by higher fuel costs  Not only do high energy prices result in increased fertilizer prices  natural gas can account for up to 90  of the cost to produce nitrogen fertilizers   but increased costs to run the equipment needed to apply that fertilizer  In addition  this winter  farmers paid high heating bills to keep their barns and greenhouses warm  Farmers will also suffer from high costs when they bring their goods to market  as trucking prices  highly dependent on fuel costs  continue to rise       On Tuesday  the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at  52 29  and crude oil has been trading at above  50 per barrel for half of 2005  In addition  the average price at the pump in New York State has hit  2 33    already 46 cents higher than it was last year on this date  National average retail gasoline prices have increased to 2 25 and analysts predict that prices could increase as the summer driving season rapidly approaches       Schumer today released a new analysis showing how much more New York farmers in each county are paying to for gas over a 27 month period  Specifically  Schumer found that           Over the past two years  farmers in the Capital Region have paid an additional  8 26 million more for fuel over 2002 prices        Over the past two years  farmers in Central New York have paid an additional  8 28 million more for fuel over 2002 prices        Over the past two years  farmers in the Hudson Valley have paid an additional  10 13 million more for fuel over 2002 prices        Over the past two years  farmers in the Rochester Finger Lakes area have paid an additional  10 13 million more for fuel over 2002 prices        Over the past two years  farmers in the North Country have paid an additional  11 82 million more for fuel over 2002 prices        Over the past two years  farmers in the Southern Tier have paid an additional  12 26 million more for fuel over 2002 prices        Over the past two years  farmers in Western New York have paid an additional  16 51 million more for fuel over 2002 prices      In an effort to create competition to drive these already too high gas prices down  Schumer today called on the FTC to block the newly announced merger between ChevronTexaco and Unocal  The ChevronTexaco Unocal merger  like the Chevron Texaco and Exxon Mobil mergers before it  will further reduce competition in the oil industry by placing the vast majority of production and distribution resources under the control of a handful of corporate giants  Schumer also called on the FTC to look at other oil company mergers including Exxon Mobil  BP Amoco and Chevron Texaco to examine how to bring gas prices down       Schumer today called on the Department of Energy to examine ways to apply fuel efficient technologies to agricultural equipment  In addition to bringing gas prices down  this could have both a positive economic and environmental benefit  Schumer said this would be a major step toward being smarter about how we use energy resources  At a time when hybrid cars are being introduced into the market  we should explore adapting this technology to other sectors       Schumer also urged the Administration to counteract the cartel s supply cuts and calm the markets by initiating a swap from the SPR  Initiating a swap of oil from the SPR to increase the supply of oil is a proven way to reduce the price of gasoline and heating oil  In the fall of 2000  Schumer successfully convinced the Clinton Administration to swap 30 million barrels over 30 days  causing crude oil prices to quickly fall by over  6 per barrel and wholesale gasoline prices to fall  0 14 per gallon  Under a swap  the federal government could decide on a set quantity of oil to release from the SPR  and accepts bids from private companies for the rights to that oil  The companies would then bid on how much oil they are willing to return to the SPR at a later date  For example  if the federal government decided to release oil and a private company wanted to obtain 10 million barrels  the company could bid for the 10 million barrels by promising 15 million barrels to be returned to the SPR at a later date         New York  s farmers are getting burned by gas prices and there is no relief in sight  As we head into the summer gas prices will continue to heat up if the Feds don  t do something now     Schumer said       Click  to view study
