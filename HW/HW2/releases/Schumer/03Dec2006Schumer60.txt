s Privacy is Not Rip As the holiday shopping season ramps up  new credit card technology that is being marketed heavily toward New Yorkers is putting consumers at a much higher risk for identity theft  The new technology    no swipe credit cards  promise faster transaction times without the need for swiping the card or signing a receipt  However  these cards allow for personal information to be picked up by would be thieves using digital eavesdropping technology that is easy to produce  Schumer today warned consumers about this new technology and unveiled a three point plan to ensure that the technology is regulated to ensure protection for consumers  An estimated 20 million no swipe credit cards have been issued  and the technology is spreading quickly      If you are using a no  swipe credit card  when you put your card in your back pocket or in your pocketbook  you might as well print your credit card number across your back     Schumer said    Holiday shoppers need to be extremely careful with their credit cards  and these companies need to step up their efforts to protect people from identity theft       Over the past two decades  the use of Radio Frequency Identification  RFID  technology has exploded  The RFID system is an automatic identification system that allows data on credit cards and other items to be transmitted by portable   tags     A tag is a small digital chip containing a transponder and a digital memory chip that holds detailed information on the credit card and its user  including the card holder  s name and the card  s number and expiration date  This chip is embedded in no swipe credit cards  When customers use these credit cards to make a purchase  the   tagged    card is read and processed by a special RFID reader operated by the retailer or salesperson  The RFID reader is an antenna equipped with a transceiver and decoder  which emits a signal activating and reading the tag and then transferring the data from the credit card to a host computer for processing  When a tag is a short distance from the electromagnetic zone emitted by the RFID reader  the reader detects the tag and accesses its information  RFID readers have grown popular with retailers because it allows them to quickly read a customer  s credit card and process a payment rather than swiping the customer  s credit card and waiting for a signature     Originating in the 1980s  today RFID systems are commonly used as anti theft tags attached to merchandise in stores and as animal tracking tags where they are inserted into an animal  s skin  Recently  however  the development of microscopic tags has triggered a proliferation of their usage  In addition to credit card data  the RFID tags can also store personal information including home addresses  social security numbers and even information on an individual  s shopping habits  The United States intends to issue passports that will use RFID technology to store digital photos and personal information about the passport holder  In New York  RFID technology is used in Easy Passes so that money can be deducted upon going through the toll station without having to stop  and more recently has been integrated into the subway system  allowing customers to just tap the turnstyle with their card or wave it over a designated area to get through  The systems work in such a way that once you get in range of an RFID reader it is able to connect with a card    However  expanding the use of RFID to credit cards has many potential pitfalls    both in terms of security and privacy    that could dog New Yorkers during this holiday season   Whereas traditional credit cards require physical contact to be read  RFID technology broadcast the credit card information to RFID readers  which means thieves operating the readers can intercept the data without ever physically touching the card or alerting the cardholder  Though these cards are advertised as having safe levels of encryption  a recent study done by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst tested 20 cards  all issued in the past year  and showed that encryption levels were not nearly strict enough to keep interlopers out of personal information  They found that a person using a   card skimming    device made with off the shelf components and costing as little as  50 could walk around in a crowded place and steal private information from passersby just by passing the reader near a handbag or a wallet  The signal from an RFID tag can pass through clothing and wallets  That same thief could steal information out of mailboxes with the exact same technology  if they walked through a neighborhood under the guise of delivering fliers but using a card skimmer on each of the mailboxes to take data from credit cards in envelopes  Although companies claim that the cards function only at very short distances  RFID readers often function at greater distances than claimed and a stronger antenna can lengthen that distance         Schumer said today that the proliferation of this technology    in cargo security  on subways  in gas stations and the like    means that identity thieves could benefit from having more opportunities to steal the data  Rather than a piecemeal approach  companies should protect consumers by using the highest levels of security protections possible  Though some companies have worked hard to ensure their cards meet the highest standards such as J P  Morgan  Citigroup and American Express  others  Schumer said  need to do the same       In a continuing effort to combat the scourge of identity theft Schumer today unveiled his three point plan to ensure that RFID does not put cardholders at risk for identity theft  The Senator called on the Federal Reserve in consultation with other bank regulators  to protect consumers with the following measures             Require a warning box on the contract to explain the vulnerability of the technology  No swipe cards are commonly marketed as a way to increase convenience  but consumers should be informed of the risks of the RFID technology and credit card companies should disclose the known weaknesses of the technology  The Schumer Box requires basic information about terms of a credit card account such as APR and finance charges  The potential risks of RFID technology should be included as part of this standard consumer information            Require higher encryption standards  Some cards currently on the market protect consumers better than others  Schumer called for uniform regulations that will bring all cards up to the highest standards  so that consumers can carry and use the cards without fear             Companies must offer the same terms and deals to customers on a regular swipe card as they would offer on the no swipe cards  Consumers should not be asked to sell their privacy and security in order to get a better deal  especially during the holiday season
