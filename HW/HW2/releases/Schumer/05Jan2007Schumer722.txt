                                  After 48 Percent Cut in Funding Last Year  DHS Also Threatened to Take Buffalo Off the List Completely This Year     Schumer Personally Lobbied DHS Secretary Chertoff with Calls and Letters to Ensure Buffalo Stayed on the List and Receives the Security Funding it Needs and Deserves                                                                                                              U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has included the Buffalo Niagara Area on the list of high threat urban areas eligible for Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  funding for FY 2007   Last year  DHS not only cut funding for the Buffalo area under this program by 48 percent  but threatened to take Buffalo off the eligibility list completely for this year   Schumer  citing Buffalo s strategic significance  proximity to a border  and chemical and power plant facilities  personally lobbied Secretary Chertoff with calls and letters to keep Buffalo on the list  DHS made the official announcement today       This is great news for the residents and businesses of Buffalo and all of Western New York   Schumer said  Without access to the UASI funding  the Greater Buffalo Niagara area would remain at risk to potential terrorist attacks and other security risks    DHS has finally recognized the unique threats and vulnerabilities that exist in Western New York  with this designation going a long way toward closing those gaping holes    I am going to continue to fight to ensure that Buffalo and the surrounding communities receive the maximum funding possible       In FY 2005  the Buffalo Niagara area was deemed high risk by DHS and then applied for and received UASI funding  In FY 2006  however  DHS determined that Buffalo Niagara was one of 11 sustainment areas that were only eligible to receive UASI funding for on going projects under the new risk analysis used by the Department       Last year s DHS decision to under fund the Buffalo Niagara area was especially shocking given that other areas with less apparent risk  such as Kansas City  MO  remained eligible   Local representatives have expressed concern that DHS misapplied its own risk analysis methodology in FY 2006  and that these inaccuracies affected the outcome of the eligibility determination         In November  Schumer wrote a letter to DHS  urging officials to evaluate the Buffalo Niagara area with great care to ensure that FY 2007 UASI eligibility  which is a prerequisite for the federal funding so desperately needed by our threatened urban areas  is determined in a way that is fair and accurate according to the rules set out by the Department       At a briefing on September 25  2006  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff explained his philosophy regarding the distribution of homeland security grants as follows   First and foremost  to the extent the law permits  we use risk as the basis for giving money out  And risk is a combination of what the threat is  what the vulnerability is and what the consequences would be of a successful attack   Schumer said that according to each of these criteria  the Buffalo Niagara area is unquestionably among the nation s highest risk urban areas and should be eligible to apply for UASI funds       The Buffalo Niagara area contains numerous assets that are vulnerable to attack and are critically important to the state and the nation  Buffalo is home to a busy border crossing with Canada that provides a port of entry into the United States for 13 million people a year and approximately  300 million in goods  This commercial and tourist traffic flows across four international bridges    the Peace Bridge  the Rainbow Bridge  the Queenston Lewiston Bridge and the Whirlpool Bridge    all of which are symbolically significant and present potential terrorist targets   Moreover  the nation s highest concentration of hydroelectric power sources is located in this area  providing a major electricity source for the Eastern United States       The counties of Erie and Niagara and the City of Buffalo  combined  contain one nuclear facility and over 260 facilities that are considered  EPA Tier II  facilities based on the presence of significant hazardous chemicals or materials including chlorine  Finally  the region is home to the iconic Niagara Falls  visited by approximately 14 million people annually  These vital assets  clustered near a major international border crossing  are far from immune to terrorist threats  The area s Joint Terrorism Task Force has informed local authorities of multiple credible threats that led to terrorism investigations  and the  Lackawanna Six  who pled guilty to terrorism related charges were arrested in the Buffalo area
