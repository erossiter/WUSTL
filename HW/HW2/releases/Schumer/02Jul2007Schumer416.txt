Mother Cabrini High School  and Girls Incorporated  The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor for approval   This is great news for New York City  said Schumer  These funds will be used for vital programs that will help New Yorkers in need  From providing after school care or enrichment programs to at risk youth  to launching a national awareness campaign against dangerous drugs or studying emergency disaster scenarios  these programs encompass important  worthy services that will help keep New Yorkers safer   This is very welcome news for all these programs in New York City  The funds for the American Ballet Theatre  Girls Incorporated  Mother Cabrini High School and the Abyssinian Development Corporation will help them continue to assist young people from across New York City who are looking to broaden their lives and reach their full potential  Senator Clinton said  I am also very pleased that we could secure these funds for the Regenhard Center  which will be a tremendous asset to first responders across the country  providing an integrated and comprehensive analysis of emergency response to better ensure that we are prepared in the event of another disaster  Christian Regenhard is a true American hero and this Center is also a fitting tribute to him and his bravery  We also continue to see the devastating effects that methamphetamine has on our community and GMHC is providing a critical service in working to halt the spread of methamphetamine through prevention and treatment  With HIV AIDS rates among meth users more than twice as high as the general public  these funds are essential in helping GMHC continue the fight against HIV AIDS    200 000 of federal funds will go to the American Ballet Theatres Make a Ballet On Tour Program for At Risk Youth  The funds will be used to expand and implement the Make a Ballet On Tour Program  based on the highly successful Make a Ballet Program in New York  to schools in participating pilot cities  Chicago  Miami

increasing rate of HIV transmission  The use of crystal methamphetamine has reached epidemic proportions  contributing to a dramatic influx in the number of new HIV cases among certain populations of

Center for Emergency Response Studies at John Jay College will receive  500 000 of federal funds to buy equipment  technology and curriculum development materials to study emergency response  Named after the FDNY firefighter Christian Regenhard who was killed on September 11th  2001  the Center will be a research entity and information clearinghouse for the study of emergency responses to large scale disasters  While other academic institutions study disasters or emergency management  there is no central focus on the critical role of responders and the emergency response itself  especially in the urban environment  John Jay College and the Regenhard Center will fill that void  working collaboratively with other institutions to provide insight and expertise in the disaster emergency studies field    The Pupils On the Way to Excellent Results Project at Mother Cabrini High School will receive  200 000 of federal funds to enable MCHS to expand its after school program for at risk
