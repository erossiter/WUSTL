IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 5  2007 Schumer Announces New Legislation To Battle Growing Diabetes Epidemic In New York And Across The Country                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Bill Guarantees Medicaid Coverage Of Diabetes Screening For At Risk Patients And Coverage For Essential Care Measures Including Insulin  Education and Medical Exams   More than One in Every 20 Upstate New Yorkers Now Battling the Effects of Diabetes  with Type 2 Diabetes  Linked to Obesity  Skyrocketing Among Kids   Improving Screening and Early Treatment Measures Could Save Taxpayers Bil U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled new bi partisan legislation to combat the costly complications associated with diabetes by guaranteeing better Medicaid coverage and utilizing preventive health care measures   This bill  which Schumer is introducing with Senator Pete Domenici  R NM   will combat the rising number of diabetes cases by providing screening tests under the Medicaid program for high risk adult enrollees and ensuring that States offer a comprehensive package of benefits needed to adequately manage diabetes care   This bill comes on the heels of a report the Senator released in January revealing that major shortcomings in federal health programs on catching and treating diabetes early on are contributing to a staggering rise in diabetes cases in New York and across the country   The report showed that cases of adult and juvenile diabetes are up more than 35 percent in upstate New York since 1999  with the number of kids suffering from Type 2 diabetes  which is often preceded by obesity  skyrocketing          This legislation is the first step towards stopping the diabetes epidemic in its tracks   said Schumer    An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care  By focusing on screening and prevention  this bill will lower the overall burden of cost on our health care system and create a healthier  more productive society   It is essential that we take a new approach toward diabetes care by focusing on early age prevention rather than spending more on costly end of life care          The Schumer Domenici Diabetes Screening and Medicaid Savings Act uses preventive screening and enhanced Medicaid benefits to address the costly complications associated with diabetes care and prevention   By focusing on prevention and increasing access to much needed early interventions  Schumer s legislation would reduce the incidence of diabetes and reduce health care costs across the board as treatment for the effects of diabetes over a lifetime can be staggering  In addition  Schumer s legislation would enhance coverage for prescription drugs  durable medical equipment  and services related to pregnancy  vision care  podiatry  nutrition  and education and self management training  While diabetes is a manageable disease  an individual s ability to effectively deal with and suppress its symptoms is directly tied to a person s ability to access affordable and adequate health insurance coverage       The cost of treating diabetes continues to skyrocket as numbers of patients increase  In 2002  the American Diabetes Association estimated that national spending on diabetes care was  132 billion  A 2005 Centers for Disease Control study found that the average cost per year for treating a patient with diabetes was  13 243  compared with  2 560 for a person without diabetes  yet the federal government does not ensure that all its programs cover diabetes screenings and early intervention services       Medicaid especially is frequently cited as a culprit because states are not required to cover many early intervention services such as nutrition education  Private insurance companies are also to blame  many insurers will often cover the more than  11 000 cost of a prosthetic after a diabetes related leg amputation  but not cover preventive consultations with podiatrists that cost  100 and could save a patient s leg       Schumer cited a landmark National Institute of Health clinical trial  the Diabetes Prevention Program  DPP   that showed modest changes in diet and exercise can prevent diabetes in 58 percent of people at high risk for the disease        Schumer s new legislation would shift the federal government s focus more toward prevention of diabetes by dramatically expanding access and Medicaid coverage of diabetes screening    Specifically  the legislation will        Guarantee Medicaid coverage of diabetes screenings for patients who are at risk        Guarantee Medicaid coverage of a package of diabetes services for patients who are diagnosed with diabetes   Examples of these services are diabetes education  insulin  and foot exams         Ensure that these diabetes services for Medicaid patients would not be subject to cost sharing requirements   Among teenagers and adolescents specifically  the numbers are staggering   An estimated one in six overweight New York children and teens are considered to have pre diabetes  a condition that puts them at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes  Preliminary findings from an ongoing study by the Centers for Disease Control show that 18  of diabetes cases in juveniles are now Type 2  a stunning increase in a condition that was rarely found in children before   Studies show 15 percent of children in New York are overweight  and more than 680 000 children in New York are in danger of developing pre diabetes symptoms  The rapid increase in Type 2 diabetes in children is considered to be a direct result of the obesity epidemic among children  and experts fear that many Type 2 diabetes cases in children go undiagnosed because symptoms develop slowly   This rapid increase in diabetes in children could present unforeseen health care costs to cover the long term care of diabetes patients  in the past  the average age of diabetes diagnosis was 46        Last month Schumer released a report showing that the diabetes epidemic is on the rise across upstate New York   According to 2005 data from the New York State Department of Health  an estimated 473 495 upstate New York men  women  and children are currently battling the potentially debilitating disease   That number is up more than 35 percent from the 311 949 cases reported in 1999    Statewide  more than 1 2 million New Yorkers currently suffer from diabetes        Below is how the numbers break out across upstate New York            Right now  an estimated 54 471 men  women  and children in the Capital Region suffer from diabetes  up 18 584 from 1999   Roughly 519 children in the region suffer from diabetes            Right now  an estimated 50 382 men  women  and children in Central New York suffer from diabetes  up 17 189 from 1999  Roughly 271 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 75 149 men  women  and children in the Rochester   Finger Lakes Region suffer from diabetes  up 25 639 cases from 1999  Roughly 687 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 134 203 men  women  and children in the Hudson Valley  up 45 787 cases from 1999   An estimated 1 170 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 32 245 men  women and children in the North Country suffer from diabetes  up 11 001 from 1999  Roughly 311 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 36 073 men women and children in the Southern Tier suffer from diabetes  up 12 307 1999   Row  roughly 362 children in the region suffer from diabetes             Right now  an estimated 90 970 men women and children in Western New York suffer from diabetes  up 31 037 from 1999   Roughly 810 children in the region suffer from diabetes
