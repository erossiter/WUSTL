IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 30  2007 Schumer To Host Truck Traffic Summit In An Effort To Keep Noisy  Dangerous NYC Garbage Trucks From Rolling Through Finger Lakes Communities And Hurting Quality Of Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Schumer to Hold Meeting with NYC Department of Sanitation and IESI Haulers to Create Tracking System  Establish Enforceable Agreement  to Keep NYC Garbage Trucks off Small Roads and Out of Towns in Finger Lakes Region Each Day  Scores of IESI Garbage Trucks Traveling from NYC to Upstate Landfills Cut through Finger Lakes Communities to Avoid Paying Tolls and Extra Gas Money Schumer  First Step to Eradicating Truck Traffic Problem in Finger Lakes Region is to Create an Accountable System to Keep NYC Garbage Trucks Off Rural Roads and Get Them Back on the Interstates With scores of trucks carrying NYC solid waste dangerously driving through Finger Lakes communities everyday  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that he is hosting a meeting between the NYC Department of Sanitation  DSNY  and IESI  the major truck hauler under contract with DSNY to transport garbage through the region  The meeting follows Schumers call to NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg seeking his support crafting a solution to the problem of NYC waste haulers taking short cuts through rural roads in Central New York  Schumers upcoming meeting with DSNY and IESI will focus on brokering a deal that puts into place a real time tracking system to keep sanitation trucks off local roads and out of communities across the Finger Lakes and Central New York  The move follows recent efforts by community leaders  including State Senator John DeFrancisco  to pressure the City of New York and Mayor Bloomberg to force trucks hauling NYC waste to use interstate highways     Currently  in order to avoid paying tolls  or to save money on gas  trucks traveling from NYC to landfills in Upstate New York leave the interstates  that are better equipped to handle their weight and size  in favor of small country roads that wind in and out of the Finger Lakes Central New York region  The trucks harm the regions quality of life by exuding foul odors and noise  create safety problems and cause considerable wear and tear on roads designed for local traffic     Its no secret that garbage trucks originating in New York City are circumventing the states highway system and dangerously driving through communities across the Finger Lakes  leaving behind a trail of fumes  noise  and worn down infrastructure that diminishes the rural regions quality of life  said Senator Schumer  Today  the good news is that Ive secured the cooperation of Mayor Bloomberg  the NYC Department of Sanitation and IESI to meet to hammer out an enforceable agreement that will keep these garbage trucks off our local roads and put them back on the major highways where they belong  The goal of this meeting is to create a system rooted in accountability so we know these garbage haulers are living up to their end of the bargain     Every day  over 200 5 axle single trailer trucks transport solid waste from New York City to landfills in Central New York and the Finger Lakes region  However  trucks can often be seen on country roads evading a toll or weigh station  In order to avoid paying tolls  or to save a few extra dollars on gas  these trucks leave the larger  better kept interstates that can handle their weight and size in favor of smaller country roads  While the waste hauling companies save only minimal funds  it burdens local communities in terms of noise  deteriorating roads and significant safety concerns     In addition  local residents are concerned that the giant trucks will clog and strain smaller roads that arent constructed to handle trucks of their size and cause a hazard for local drivers     IESI is the largest garbage truck company that hauls trash from New York City to the Seneca Meadows landfill located in Upstate New York  IESI has the hauling contract  but subcontracts to trucking companies to do the actual hauling  According to a recent study by Wells College  617 multi axle trucks were observed traveling through the town of Aurora  NY  Of multi axle trucks documented in the study  322 were positively identified as waste haulers and nearly two thirds were giant 18 wheel vehicles     The current contract between the NYC Department of Sanitation and trucking agencies stipulates that  whenever possible  trucks should take routes that stay on primary highways and avoid local streets and residential areas  It also states that the contractor shall route trucks away from environmentally sensitive areas such as parks  historic sites  and wetlands to the maximum extent possible  in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations  However  the contract does not force the trucking companies to abide by the spirit of the contract  and  presently  trucks have been straying away from the main highways in favor of utilizing local roads that cut through small towns and communities  In essence  the companies are taking advantage of the flexible language that creates a loophole within the contract     Schumer today said a main goal in his upcoming meeting is to establish a system that can monitor and bring accountability to trucks hauling NYC waste that travel upstate  While New York City has indicated its desire to see its contracting firms abide by the letter and spirit of their contract  there is currently no monitoring in place to ensure that the trucks are sticking to the main interstates and avoiding local roads     Schumers office is currently locking down a date for the meeting which will be held in November     Trucking firms are circumventing the highway system  but our local communities are paying the price  Schumer added  These trucks are evading highway tolls and weigh stations  and are instead driving on community streets and country roads  We need a system in place to ensure these trucks are fulfilling their promises and sticking to the main roads     This summer  Schumer sent a letter to New York City Department of Sanitation Commissioner John J  Doherty urging him to work with local and state agencies to steer the garbage trucks away from these small roads and communities     Schumer has been a longtime advocate for keeping trucks away from traveling through Central New York and the Finger Lakes communities  Last year he unveiled a three point plan to keep trucks on the highway and off of local roads  Earlier this year  Schumer introduced a bill requiring the states to designate permanent routes for trucks carrying hazardous materials and the long distance transportation of solid waste  Schumer is urging that Interstate 90  the Thruway  and Interstate 81 be designated as truck routes  These routes would be designed to keep trucks on large highways and interstates  and off of smaller local roads  Currently  states can choose to set up truck routes  but it is not mandatory     Over 1 9 million trucks travel through Central New York and the Finger Lakes region every year carrying freight  but many drive on local roads as a shortcut and to avoid weigh stations  tolls and traffic  Throughout the past few years  there have been numerous accidents spilling fuel  garbage and chemicals  all posing a potential threat to the Onondaga County watershed and surrounding neighborhoods  In addition  the trucks disrupt communities at all hours of the day and night
