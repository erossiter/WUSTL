                                      U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  today sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking for further explanation and a reconsideration of the Department  s decision to not investigate Maryland Republican candidates  distribution of misleading literature   The full text of Senator Schumer  s letter is below    November 29  2006    The Honorable Alberto R  Gonzales   Attorney General of the United States   Department of Justice   950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW   Room 5111   Washington  DC 20530    Dear Attorney General Gonzales     I am extremely disappointed in the Department of Justice s decision not to pursue a formal investigation of Maryland Republican candidates  distribution of misleading literature  I write to ask for further information about how this decision was reached  and to respectfully request that you review the Department s decision making process in this instance to ensure that all possible legal bases for an investigation were considered  The right to vote is perhaps our most essential civil right  the wellspring of our democracy  Unfortunately  the mid term elections held on November 7  2006  were tarnished by countless dirty tricks and ugly tactics  The ploy used in Maryland stands out for its sheer cynicism and brazenness        According to press accounts of the repugnant scheme in Maryland  the senatorial campaign of Michael Steele and the gubernatorial campaign of Robert L  Ehrlich joined forces to bring some 300 African Americans in buses from Philadelphia  These out of state visitors were promised  100 plus meals to spend the day distributing fliers at Maryland polling places on Election Day  Deployed to central Baltimore and to Prince George s County  they handed out highly misleading fliers that contain the prominent headings   Ehrlich Steele Democrats  and  Democratic Sample Ballot   Inside the fliers  the names of Republican candidates Ehrlich and Steele were listed without their party affiliation and alongside Democratic candidates for Maryland office  The fliers were clearly designed to imply that Ehrlich and Steele are members of  or were endorsed by members of  the Democratic Party  The fliers stated that they were  paid and authorized by  the Ehrlich and Steele campaign organizations        I am concerned that your response to the Ehrlich Steele scheme in Maryland was not commensurate with the seriousness of this incident  The Department of Justice  in a letter to me dated November 16  2006  stated that your Department  looked into  the Maryland scheme and  concluded  based on what we know  that there is an insufficient legal basis to initiate a formal investigation   The Department did not provide any further information about the nature of its initial investigation or the basis for its legal conclusion  I am astonished by this outcome  and troubled by the prospect of this egregious conduct going unpunished        I request that you answer the following questions  with regard to the deceptive scheme in Maryland       1          Did the Department undertake any preliminary factual investigation whatsoever to reach the conclusion that there is an insufficient legal basis for a formal investigation  If so  please describe the nature  extent  and results of that factual investigation       2          Please describe the legal sources and analysis underlying the Department s conclusion that there is insufficient legal basis for a formal investigation       3          When the Department  looked into  this incident  what indication  if any  did the Department find that this tactic was targeted at African American voters       4          Which Division of the Department of Justice was responsible for the decision not to pursue a formal investigation of this incident  Please describe any consultation between the responsible Division and any other Division s  in reaching the decision not to investigate formally        As you are well aware  federal law prohibits voter intimidation  threats and coercion by individuals or state actors  the use of the mails or an interstate carrier to further a scheme to defraud voters  conspiring to injure or oppress individuals for exercising a constitutional right  and state action that denies or abridges the right to vote on account of race  color  or minority language membership  Therefore  I ask that you also respond to the following questions about what  if anything  the Department did to rule out these possible legal bases for a formal investigation into the Maryland scheme        5          Please describe the Department s preliminary investigation  if any  into whether the Maryland scheme involved coercion  force  intimidation  or threats of force  What were the results of that investigation        6          Please describe the Department s preliminary investigation  if any  into whether the Maryland scheme involved the use of the mail or an interstate carrier to defraud voters by depriving them of their right to a fair and honest election  What were the results of that investigation       7          Please describe the Department s preliminary investigation  if any  into whether the Maryland scheme involved a conspiracy to injury or oppress voters by obstructing their right to vote  What were the results of that investigation       8          Please describe the Department s preliminary investigation  if any  into whether the Maryland scheme involved state action by Ehrlich  Steele or their agents  What were the results of that investigation        Thank you for your attention to this matter  and I look forward to your reply         Sincerely      Charles E  Schumer    United States Senator
