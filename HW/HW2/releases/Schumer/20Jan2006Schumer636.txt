IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 20  2006 Schumer And Coleman Call For Immediate IAEA Referral Of Iran To U N  Security Council                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senators introduce bipartisan resolution condemning Iran  s nuclear program and call for immediate suspension of uranium enrichment activities Today U S  Senators Charles Schumer  D NY  and Norm Coleman  R MN  introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning the Iranian government  s nuclear program and calling for the immediate suspension of Iran  s uranium enrichment activities  Citing numerous Iranian violations under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  the Coleman Schumer resolution also calls on the U S  and its allies to hold an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  where Iran can be referred to the U N  Security Council        Schumer said    Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and is led by a religious extremist who has spoken out against relations with the United States and has called for Israel to be wiped off the map  Iran  s recent actions make it clear that it will continue to resist the will of the international community unless we take direct action  A nuclear Iran would pose an untenable threat to global security and we must act now to meet this challenge            The Iranian regime  s latest nuclear provocations and continuous hate filled rhetoric warrant decisive action by the international community     Coleman said Thursday    Even more worrisome is the regime  s track record of terror and tyranny  which indicate that its behavior will only worsen once it becomes a nuclear power  Common sense and responsibility demand that we take action now          After the existence of their nuclear program was discovered in 2002  Iran has repeatedly attempted to deceive the international community about the progress and intentions of their uranium enrichment facilities  Iran  s latest stunt involved removing IAEA seals from a uranium enrichment facility and announcing the resumption of   research    on nuclear fuel  Mohamed El Baradei  the Director General of the IAEA  has publicly stated that once it perfects its ability to enrich uranium and completes a weaponization program Iran will only months away from building a nuclear bomb        Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and E U  Foreign Policy High Representative Javier Solana stated Wednesday that there is no reason to further negotiate with Iran  as two years of attempted diplomacy have collapsed  It also appears that Russia and China  who have previously failed to display a sense of urgency with Iran  have expressed agreement with the United States  Britain  France and Germany that the Iran  s recent provocations constitute a brazen affront to the international community        The EU 3  Britain  France and Germany  have called for a February 2 meeting with the IAEA Board of Governors to discuss the referral of Iran to the U N  Security Council          I believe America must work with its European allies  Russia  China  and others to take immediate and decisive diplomatic action to address the challenge of a nuclear Iran before its program reaches a point of no return  It is important that we begin the process of rallying the global community as quickly as possible to deal with this threat     Schumer concluded         I strongly support the call from our government  as well as those of Britain  France and Germany  to hold an   extraordinary    meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors     Coleman stated    Any attempts by Iran to gather nuclear weapons must be considered both extremely serious and immediate  We can  t simply wait for them to get weapons before calling them a threat          Other cosponsors include Senators Diane Feinstein  D CA   Sam Brownback  R KS   George Allen  R VA   Mike Crapo  R ID   Mike DeWine  R OH   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Ben Nelson  D NE   and Bill Nelson  D FL   The text of the resolutions follows       Iran Resolution   Findings       Whereas Iran concealed a nuclear program from the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  and the international community for nearly two decades until it was revealed in 2002        Whereas Iran has repeatedly deceived the IAEA about a variety of nuclear related activities  including uranium enrichment and laboratory scale separation of plutonium       Whereas Iran has most recently removed the IAEA seals from a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and announced the resumption of  research  on nuclear fuel  in a brazen affront to the international community        Whereas members of the international community have agreed that the pursuit of uranium enrichment capabilities comprises a   redline    for Security Council referral that has now been unequivocally crossed       Whereas Iran  s latest nuclear provocation represents only the latest action in a long pattern of intransigence relating to its nuclear program  including        Its violation of an October 2003 agreement reached with the EU 3 within months of its being signed        Its unilateral end last August to the 2004 Paris Accord struck with the EU 3 in which it agreed to suspend its enrichment program        The failure of the Iranian government to provide IAEA inspectors access to various nuclear sites and its refusal to answer outstanding questions related to its nuclear program       Whereas the Iranian regime has made clear the nefarious intentions behind its nuclear program in a series of inflammatory and reprehensible statements  including        A call to   wipe out Israel off the map    at a conference titled   A World without Zionism           The assertion that the Holocaust was a   myth    and that Israel should be transferred to Europe       Whereas the Tehran regime  s previous activities indicate that a nuclear armed Iran would pose an unprecedented threat to American national security  Examples include   o The sponsor of terrorist groups including Hezbollah  Hamas  and Islamic Jihad  Iran has provided significant support for these groups in the form of funding  training  weapons and safe haven   o The destabilization of neighboring countries  including Iraq  Israel and Lebanon        Whereas the Director General of the IAEA  Mohamed El Baradei  has publicly stated that once Iran perfects its capability to enrich uranium  it would be only months away from building a nuclear bomb       Whereas the Institute for Science and International Security  a Washington antiproliferation group  released a January 2 satellite photograph showing extensive new construction at the Natanz facility       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution on September 24  2005 indicating that Iran  s noncompliance would result in its referral to the U N  Security Council  called for by Article XII C of the IAEA governing statute        Whereas the United States   partners leading diplomatic efforts with the Iranians  Britain  France and Germany  the EU 3   have all publicly stated their firm intention to refer Iran to the Security Council and have called for an  extraordinary  meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on February 2nd       Whereas China and Russia have expressed agreement with the United States  Britain  Germany and France that Iran has violated its commitments to the IAEA       Whereas Russia and China sit on the U N  Security Council  and their cooperation would be required to enact any substantive measures against the Iranian regime       Whereas Iran has shown no interest in Russia s offer enrich Iran s uranium feedstock into power plant fuel on its own territory  further demonstrating its aversion to compromise  Now  therefore      Be it resolved that        The U S  categorically condemns the Iranian regime  s flagrant violations of its obligations under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty        The U S  calls for the immediate suspension of all of Iran  s uranium enrichment activities        The U S  Congress supports calls for an emergency meeting of the Board of Governors for the IAEA where Iran should be immediately referred to the Security Council        The US Congress calls on all nuclear suppliers to cease nuclear cooperation with Iran immediately       The U S  Congress also calls on Russia and China to demonstrate that they are responsible stakeholders in the international community by supporting efforts to refer Iran to the Security Council and take the appropriate measures in response to Iranian violations of its NPT commitments
