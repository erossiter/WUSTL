IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 17  2007 Schumer Announces Senate Passes New Bill Requiring Army Corps To Conduct Immediate Study Of Utica Oneida Water And Sewer Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  With Wastewater Issue Looming Over Utica and Oneida County  Army Corps Will Conduct Three Part Federal Study to Spell out Problems and Formulate Much Needed Solutions   Inadequate and Ancient Waste Water System Threatens Vitality and Growth of the Entire Region   as well as health of Mohawk River   if Aggressive Measures Aren t Taken   Schumer Provision Passes as Part of Water Re Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that the United States Senate has passed a provision he authored requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the waste water drain and disposal crisis in the Utica and Oneida County area  Schumer had called for a similar study last week   The legislation cleared the Senate late last night and was passed as part of the Water Resources Development Act   The full legislation now will go to a joint House Senate Conference before final passage by Congress       This is a critical step forward toward resolving this crisis   Schumer said   My legislation puts the Army Corps  wheels in motion and requires their experts to come in and inspect the entire system  This crisis threatens the economic and public health of Utica and Oneida Country  but with yesterday s action  we are one step closer to resolving it     I discussed the problems that have resulted from the State Consent Order that has been placed on Oneida County with Senator Schumer less than two weeks ago when he visited the Mohawk Valley  and I commend him with finding a solution   This study will help to define the problem and its costs to our community   said Assemblywoman RoAnn M  Destito  D Rome     I am already receiving calls from businesses considering expansion that have been affected by this moratorium  so it is urgent that we begin to solve this problem immediately        Due to outdated infrastructure and limited capacity  untreated sewage from the sanitary and storm water sewage disposal is being dumped into the Mohawk River from the Oneida County sewer district  which consists of 13 different towns and villages  As a result  New York State slapped Oneida County with a proposed consent order that puts a stopper on new development  and would require the County to fix the problem by 2011  Schumer today said the federal government via the Army Corps must step in to create a plan with concrete solutions for state and local environmental officials      Schumer s legislation specifically requires the Army Corps to come in and study the problem and deliver concrete recommendations to state and local officials  The three part study would evaluate the sanitary and storm water sewage disposal flows for the Oneida County sewer district  which consists of 13 different towns and villages  evaluate the sewage flows management from each of the individual municipalities to determine the source of the excess water into the sewer district interceptor sewer system and evaluate the results of the studies  identifying potential solutions to treat  store and or eliminate excess flows and then reducing these conclusions to writing      Schumer offered an amendment to the Water Resources Development act that included language requiring the study   Last week  Schumer called on the Army Corps to come in and evaluate the system  but the Senate s action now requires it to come in and inspect       The estimated cost to repair the waste water problem is  66 million  Until the problem is fixed  the New York Department of Environmental Conservation will not approve additional sewer extensions  As a result  the County is unable to approve building permits for commercial projects  In addition  there are serious health concerns from the sewage  including  fish and aquatic life in the water  animals wading in the water  and people who use the water for recreational uses  including swimming        Sadly  over the past decades the federal government has retreated from its responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and other legislation to be a full partner with state and local government to maintain first rate water treatment systems  In this instance  local officials have been very active  but now we need the full resources and capabilities of the federal government to get this situation under control   said Senator Schumer        In 1972 the Clean Water Act was passed  Among its provisions were grants for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment plants  Under this program  the Federal government funded 75  of the construction costs for these projects   In 1981  Municipal Wastewater Treatment Construction Grant Amendments were passed   These reduced the federal share of the construction costs to 55    In 1987  the Clean Water Act was reauthorized   Federal support for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction was converted from grant assistance to a State Revolving Loan Fund   Over the years  funding for this loan program has been decreased and may even be phased out entirely by 2011      America faces a shortfall of  11 billion annually to replace aging facilities and comply with safe drinking water regulations  Federal funding for drinking water in 2005 remained level at  850 million  less than 10  of the total national requirement
