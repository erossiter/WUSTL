                                 Schumer s New Study Details Dramatic Rise of AMT Burden on Long Island  Making it Among Nation s Hardest Hit Areas    Number of Residents Affected will Soar from 155 480 in 2006 to 202 000 in 2007   Unless Action is Taken  This Year AMT will Cost a Family of Five in Massapequa  8 640 and a Family of Four in Jamestown  5 040   Schumer Introduces Comprehensive Legislation to Provid Armed with a new study revealing that Long Island residents are among the nation s hardest hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  and that the number of residents affected will soar in 2007 unless action is taken  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer unveiled a sweeping new package of middle class tax cuts  The extensive study  which was conducted at Schumer s request by Martin Cantor  Director of the Long Island Economic and Policy Institute at Dowling College  estimates that this year 202 000 Long Island residents will be ensnared by the AMT  compared to the 155 480 residents that paid the AMT in 2006        To ease the tax burden for residents across Nassau and Suffolk counties  Schumer s comprehensive legislation will extend AMT relief for middle class families through 2008  The bill also eases the financial burden middle class families shoulder to send their children to college and take care of aging parents         As middle class families across Long Island continue to feel the financial squeeze of affording a home  raising a family  and sending their children to college  the outdated and unfair AMT only tightens the noose further   said Senator Schumer   This tax cut package includes simple and fair changes to our tax code that will lend middle class families a much needed helping hand         In the late 1960s  Congress added the AMT as a backstop to the income tax after it was discovered a number of extremely wealthy Americans had failed to pay income taxes in 1966  However  the tax was never indexed to inflation  resulting in thousands of middle and upper middle income families being unfairly subjected to it every year  The Bush Administration s tax cuts have only exacerbated the problem         It is estimated that that by 2010  30 million American taxpayers will face the AMT  up from 1 million in 1999  According to Schumer s study  New York State is the second most AMT impacted state in the nation  with the Long Island area one of the most impacted regions in the state  In 2004  the New York City metropolitan area contained 7 of the top 30 counties in the United States impacted by the AMT        In 2004  Long Island had 91 932 tax filers affected by the AMT  the second most impacted AMT region in the country after the Stamford Norwalk Connecticut region  In 2006  155 480 Long Islanders were subject to the AMT and the number is expected to dramatically climb to 202 000 in 2007 with the direct economic impact estimated at up to  843 million        To ease the financial strain that the AMT imposes on middle class Long Islanders  today  Schumer  a member of the Senate Finance Committee  highlighted his Middle Class Opportunity Act which includes two years of relief for middle class families from the AMT  The plan will also provide targeted tax relief at key phrases of a family s life  Schumer said his legislation  which has already been introduced in the Senate  will financially assist a record number of middle class families across the Long Island currently trapped by the tax       Schumer s Middle Class Opportunity Act will also aid families experiencing the financial strain of sending their children to school and taking care of aging parents  His legislation focuses on four critical areas where families are seeing skyrocketing costs             AMT Relief    Families with incomes between  75 000 and  100 000  who fall into the AMT for the first time  would face a tax increase of nearly  1 000   eliminating the effects of any tax cuts received since 2001  The Middle Class Opportunity Act extends AMT relief through 2008  providing two full years of relief this year  rather than forcing Congress to go through the same exercise every year             Increasing the Child Tax Credit   Schumer s legislation provides relief to families with new babies by doubling the child tax credit to  2 000 for the first year of a child s life or in the first year after a child s adoption  To help ease the burden of childcare costs  the bill offers a tax credit to cover 35  of childcare expenses for families earning up to  75 000             Help Pay for College    In previous years  New York families have been eligible for the HOPE credit  the Lifetime Learning credit  and the tuition deduction  These provisions have provided real relief  246 000 families took advantage of the HOPE credit in 2004  shaving  338 million off their tax bills  294 000 claimed the Lifetime Learning credit  for a total of  301 million  and 326 000 New York families took the tuition deduction in 2004  deducting  868 million  Under the Schumer bill  these credits and deductions would be combined into one credit  with a maximum of  2 500 per student to help cover tuition  fees and course books             Caring for Aging Parents   Schumer said that as baby boomers become senior citizens  one of the greatest issues  and burdens  facing middle class families is the ability to pay for the care of their aging parents  Seventy percent of people between the ages of 45 and 55 have at least one living parent  and almost half of women in that age range provide some form of support to an aging parent        Right now  only families who have elderly parents living with them are eligible to claim the dependent care tax credits for expenses they face caring for elderly parents  The Schumer bill would ensure that all families who are caring for aging parents  whether they live with the family or not  would be eligible for the credit  Families caring for elderly families could save families an average of  200 per month with this credit        At Schumer s request  the report was conducted by Martin Cantor  Director of the Long Island Economic and Policy Institute at Dowling College
