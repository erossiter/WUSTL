IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 22  2007 Schumer Reveals  As Insurance Companies Flee Long Island  Thousands Of Homeowners Forced to Take Out Expensive  Extreme  Coverage Meant For High Hazard Businesses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Number of LI Homeowners Forced to Take Out  Extreme  Insurance Because Conventional Insurers Dropped Them Up 100 Percent in Recent Years With Premiums Spiking Standing with Huntington Homeowner who Allstate Dropped and Now Pays More than Double for Less Coverage  Schumer Blasts Insurance Companies for Leaving LI Families Holding the Bag Schumer Backs Expansive Standing with Denise Materazzo  a Huntington homeowner who is one of thousands of Long Islanders recently left in the lurch by their longtime home insurers  U S  Senator Charles Schumer today blasted major insurance companies for dropping Long Island customers citing bogus hurricane and flood concerns and backed new legislation designed to prevent premiums from skyrocketing  Schumer also released a new report showing that the number of New Yorkers forced to take out extreme insurance after being dropped by a conventional insurance company has more than doubled  forcing homeowners to pay thousands more each year on premiums  Schumers report also detailed that those still with traditional insurers will see their rates jump more than 10  this year alone   Long Island families work long and hard for a piece of the American dream  their own home  But increasingly  once they get that home  insurers are now telling them that theres no way to protect it  said Schumer  By addressing the current state of catastrophe insurance  the commission can find a comprehensive fix so that homeowners will have the security to know that their homes are safe  and insurers wont have the guise of catastrophes to hide behind when attempting to charge outlandish premiums  In recent years  at least half a dozen companies have either stopped writing policies on Long Island  or refused to renew existing policies  some of which were decades old  Allstate  MetLife  Travelers  Liberty Mutual and Nationwide are among the insurers who have begun to pull out of Long Island  citing overexposure and risk due to a potential hurricane strike  Despite a state law that prohibits companies from dropping more than 4  of policies in a year  some companies have found a way around the rule  convincing customers to move to other companies  or offering bonuses to agents who persuade high risk customers to drop coverage  However  even the customers the companys keep face spikes in their premiums this year  with Allstate Indemnity hiking its rates a staggering 11  this year alone  Approved rate hikes this year include      INSURER   HIKE     Allstate Indemnity   11 0      Allstate Insurance Co    8 0      Nationwide Mutual Fire   7 5      First Liberty Corp    6 9      Liberty Mutual   6 0      State Farm   4 5      For those homeowners who are dropped  finding traditional coverage from another company can be either costly or impossible  with those unable to find traditional insurance forced to resort to extreme insurance  known as excess line or surplus insurance  This extreme insurance is only available to homeowners who have been denied coverage by every licensed insurer in New York  and is provided by insurers licensed in other states or foreign countries  Despite the fact that this insurance is typically meant for high risk commercial enterprises  like a fireworks factory  more and more Long Island homeowners have been forced to purchase this extreme insurance  typically paying double or more for less coverage than they previously had  In fact  over the past five years  the number of New York homeowners with this insurance of last resort has more than doubled  with the highest concentrations in Nassau and Suffolk        NEW YORK STATE HOMEOWNERS WITH EXCESS SURPLUS INSURANCE      YEAR   PREMIUM   NEW   RENEWAL   TOTAL     2007  thru Sept      21 433 390 00   4 518     2 503    7 021     2006     20 987 326 00   3 416   2 832   6 248     2005    16 270 756 00   2 253   2 168   4 421     2004    14 070 255 00   2 123   1 962

approximately four years  and paid  960 annually for her policy without replacement charges  with a  1 000 deductible  Ms  Materazzo filed her first and only claim with Allstate in January of last year after her furnace broke and damaged her basement  Allstate paid the claim without incident  but last April she received a letter from Allstate notifying her that the company was dropping her policy  Allstate cited risk of flood as the reason for nonrenewal  despite the fact that Ms  Materazzo lives miles from the water and her house has never flooded  Since Ms  Materazzo was unable to obtain homeowners insurance from an insurer licensed in New York State  she was forced to open an excess line policy with Utica Insurance  where she now pays  2 400 annually for her policy with replacement charges  with a  1 000 deductible    Schumer today unveiled the following plan to combat this rising tide of insurance premiums on Long Island     Push to add changes to the National Flood Insurance Program  NFIP  that would provide relief for coastal areas at risk of hurricanes  Currently  the NFIP only covers flood damage and does not cover wind damage  leaving this to the private insurance market  As private insurers have indicated that they are unwilling to cover hurricane damage  it has become clear that the federal government must step in to provide wind insurance coverage in addition to the flood insurance coverage it already provides  The House of Representatives passed a bill adding so called multiperil coverage to the NFIP  but the Senate Banking Committees bill did not contain this provision  Schumer promised to try to get this coverage added to the final bill   Support for higher coverage limits in high cost areas  which would help homeowners in areas with higher construction and rebuilding costs  such as Long Island  Currently  the maximum coverage amount allowed on a homes structure is  250 000  This is simply not high enough for high cost areas like New York  which is why Schumer is looking to raise the maximum coverage amounts to  335 000   Schumer will also call on Allstate to restart writing new homeowner claims and not raise premiums
