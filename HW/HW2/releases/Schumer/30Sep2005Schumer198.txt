IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 30  2005 Schumer  Clinton  Key Senate Panel Backs  15 15 Million For Defense Projects To Benefit The Greater Rochester Finger Lakes Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Funding is part of FY 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee   Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York State Economy and National Security US Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved over  15 1 million in the FY06 Defense Department Appropriations bill for projects to benefit the Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes regions       Projects to be funded under the bill include   1 65 million for Oblique Angle Hyperspectral Image Fusion and Analysis for Change Detection research at Virtual Scopics   1 5 million to Integrated Nano Technologies for Bio Warfare Testing   4 million to RIT  s Defense Systems Modernization and Sustainment Initiative   2 million to GM for Next Generation Non Tactial Vehicle Propulsion   2 million for Photon Gear  s Agile Laser Eye Protection project and  4 million to the National Center for Infotonics          This is great news for the Finger Lakes   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Finger Lakes and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Finger Lakes defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge          The Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes Regions have already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support          Photon Gear will receive  2 million in federal funds for Agile Laser Eye Protection research  Hostile use of lasers against U S  military assets to inflict injury  damage targeting sensors  and mission denial through dazzling of personnel   sensors are growing threats  The eyesight of aircrew and electro optical sensors are of particular concern due to their susceptibility to damage  Currently available laser eye protection targets known  fixed wavelength laser threats  While a fieldable  day only Agile form of laser eye protection is nearing completion  there is an urgent need for an integrated frequency agile form of laser eye protection that simultaneously protects during both day and night operations  An intensified frequency agile device would ultimately provide cost savings to the military by eliminating the need for different protection to cover all the potential wavelengths suitable for day and night time use  Funding will go towards the development of an intensified frequency agile device that would eliminate the need for different protection to cover all the potential wavelengths suitable for day and night time use        Virtual Scopics will receive  1 65 million in federal funds for Oblique Angle Hyperspectral Image Fusion and Analysis for Change Detection research  Current hyperspectral targeting systems must fly directly over targets and are therefore vulnerable to shoot down  They are also vulnerable to deception using two dimensional decoys  These funds will support the development of systems that will permit targeting at long range thus reducing risk to targeting system from shoot down  These systems will also develop novel image registration capabilities in order to perform change detection and three dimensional modeling         1 5 million is provided in the bill for Integrated Nanotechnology of Henrietta for its Bio Warfare Testing program  This funding would support the development of a Special Operations Field Biological Agent Identification System  a light weight  portable  highly reliable system for detection and identification of specific biological agents in support of Special Operations Command  would locate  identify and render safe weapons of mass destruction       The Rochester Institute of Technology  RIT  will receive  4 million in federal funds for the Defense Systems Modernization and Sustainment Initiative  The objective of this research program is to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems  The Department of Defense  while developing new systems that will enable a leap ahead or transformation in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems  The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the staggering replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems  This research program provides DOD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles  Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems        2 million in federal funds will go to General Motors for the Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion initiative  Funding will support the design  development and demonstration of next generation non tactical vehicle propulsion technology to enhance mission performance capability  increase fuel economy and reduce exhaust emissions of U S  military non tactical vehicles at U S  military installations  Following on development begun last year  the initiative proposes to demonstrate two commercially based non tactical SUV style vehicles with a single front wheel drive utilizing the latest designs in the fuel cell power unit  The General Motors light truck evaluated in this demonstration will utilize fuel cells designed and built in Honeoye Falls  NY        4 million in federal funds will be awarded to the National Center for Infotonics  Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems of the military  Funding will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies  Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications    The Senate Appropriations Committee included  440 billion in the bill which now heads to the floor for a full vote before the Senate  A vote is expected in the coming weeks  and after final passage a Conference Committee will reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill before Congress gives final approval to the legislation and sends it to the President to become law
