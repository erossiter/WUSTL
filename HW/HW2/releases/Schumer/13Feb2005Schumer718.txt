IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 13  2005 Schumer Reveals New Gaping Hole In Air Security  In Simple Steps Terrorists On Watch List Could Board Flights No Questions Asked                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Shocking discovery  simple way to doctor boarding pass allows ANYONE to board airplane undetected  Instructions on how to foil terrorist watch list appeared on internet this week  Schumer proposes simple and cost free fix of checking IDs at gate would keep terrorists grounded New Yorkers boarding planes at either JFK or LaGuardia may be sitting among terrorists because of a flaw in airport security systems  U S  Senator Charles E Schumer revealed today  The danger lies in a loophole in the Department of Homeland Security  s Terrorist Watch List and air security and leaves New Yorkers and all Americans vulnerable in the air and on the ground  Schumer today outlined a situation in which anyone with basic computer skills can print a fake boarding pass and avoid scrutiny by airport security  and laid out a detailed plan to combat this hazard         It  s unbelievable that after over three years of recalibrating aviation and airport security so that we can keep a close eye on suspicious individuals  this enormous hole remains in the system  It has rendered the terrorist watch list nearly useless     Schumer said    In this post 9 11 era  the terrorists will find our weakest link and we can  t leave any stone unturned          Schumer today laid out the following scenario in which someone on the terrorist watch list can get through airline security undetected       1  Joe Terror  whose name is on the terrorist watch list  buys a ticket online in the name of Joe Thompson using a stolen credit card  Joe Thompson is not listed on the terrorist watch list       2  Joe Terror then prints his   Joe Thompson    boarding pass at home  and then electronically alters it  either by scanning or altering the original image  depending on the airline system and the technology he uses at home  to create a second almost identical boarding pass under the name Joe Terror  his name       3  Joe Terror then goes to the airport and goes through security with his real ID and the FAKE boarding pass  The name and face match his real drivers license  The airport employee matches the name and face to the real ID       4  The TSA guard at the magnetometer checks to make sure that the boarding pass looks legitimate as Joe Terror goes through  He she does not scan it into the system  so there is still no hint that the name on the fake boarding pass is not the same as the name on the reservation       5  Joe Terror then goes through the gate into his plane using the real Joe Thompson boarding pass for the gate  s computer scanner  He is not asked for ID again to match the name on the scanner  so the fact that he does not have an ID with that name does not matter   Since Joe Thompson doesn  t actually exist it does not coincide with a name on the terrorist watch list  Joe Terror boards the plane  no questions asked       To combat this scenario  which revealed in published reports last week  Schumer today proposed a cost free solution of requiring another identification check to the boarding pass scan at the gate to ensure that the name on the scanned boarding pass  the passengers identification  and the person boarding the plane are the same  This proposal would replicate the security precautions taken immediately after September 11th  but are no longer in practice  Anybody trying to board a flight would present their boarding pass and identification together two times  upon going through the security line and then again when boarding the plane  foiling the   Joe Terror    scenario outlined above         The terror threat has not decreased since September 11th  it has only increased  The fact that we are less conscientious about who we are letting board our planes  boggles the mind     said Schumer    It  s clear that we are missing a critical step at our airports  and unless we recognize the shortcoming  and are willing to sacrifice the slightest bit of convenience  we may be left with blood on our hands  The people that are out there to do us harm are not stupid  and this loophole is a glaring opportunity for them to exploit          Schumer also sent a letter to TSA today asking it to review the situation and implement the solution as soon as possible    To close this dangerous loophole  I urge you require airline employees stationed at the gate to check every passenger  s ID against the passenger  s face and his boarding pass and ticket  This simple step  required immediately after September 11th but now no longer practiced  would prevent a terrorist from boarding a commercial aircraft     Schumer wrote to TSA Administrator  David Stone   The discovery of this technological flaw comes on the heels on a 9 11 Commission report released this week that showed aviation officials were lulled into a false sense of security before 9 11  The report noted that FAA officials did little to ramp up security precautions before 9 11 including beefing up screening procedures and said that officials were more concerned with convenience for passengers than they were with deterring danger       Online check in has proliferated in recent years allowing customers a more convenient option of printing their boarding passes at home  rather than waiting online for a ticket clerk or a check in kiosk at the airport  Most airlines have adopted the practice and experts expect that online check in will only continue to grow in the coming months and years to over half of passengers  Most airlines have had online check in for at least several months and usage runs the gamut from about 5  of eligible passengers at Delta  to 9  at US Airways  to 11  at Northwest and 15  at AirTran         The bottom line is that nearly 10 million people travel through New York  s airports every single day  If we aren  t diligent  it is very easy to blend in  We have to do better     said Schumer       Schumer  s letter to Administrator Stone is
