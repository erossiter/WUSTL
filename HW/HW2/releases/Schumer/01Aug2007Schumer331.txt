IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 1  2007 Schumer Reveals Already Financially Strapped Upstate Airports Could Get Stuck Footing Bill For Security Costs   Federal Reimbursement Program About To Be Underfunded                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Despite the Addition of 25 Airports to Program  Overall Pot of Money Won t be Increased  Leading Upstate Airports to Lose up to 53  of Reimbursement Funding  Schumer Releases Data on How Much Each Upstate Airport Could Lose    Schumer Announces Passage of Amendment that will Raise Overall Funding for Program So Upstate Airports Don t Get Buried in Security Costs Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer revealed that the federal program responsible for reimbursing Upstate New York airports that pay for on site security will soon be underfunded  leaving the states already financially strapped airports footing the bill for security costs  Currently  a Transportation Security Administration  TSA  programthe Law Enforcement Office Reimbursement Programreimburses Upstate airports that hire local law enforcement officials  However  TSA recently announced a plan to include 25 additional airports to the program without boosting the overall funding   Schumer  concerned that airports across Upstate could lose up to 53  of their reimbursement funding for security costs  announced the Senate passage of his amendment that will add  3 million to the reimbursement program  minimizing the impact of any potential shortfall faced by the airports    The last thing Upstate New York airports need right now is to be picking up the tab for security costs that the federal government should be paying for  said Senator Schumer  Upstate airports have lived up to their end of the bargain by hiring local law enforcement officials to ensure the safety of their travelers  but now we have a potential problem with additional airports joining the reimbursement program while the funding level remains the same  TSAs math just doesnt add up  My amendment will ensure that the federal reimbursement program has the necessary funding in the place so Upstate airports arent stuck holding the bill   In an effort to ensure passenger safety and national security at each airport security passenger screening location  TSA requires that the airport provide law enforcement personnel who are authorized to carry firearms    Although these security personnel dont specifically participate in passenger or baggage screening  they are responsible for all other general security aspects of the airport including monitoring terminals and regulating passenger drop off and pick up areas    To meet this requirement  many airports  including many across Upstate New York  coordinate with local police and sheriff departments to fill these security positions  This makes them eligible for the funding under the Law Enforcement Office Reimbursement Program  LEOP   which is designed to cover the costs associated with these TSA mandated security guards    This year  however  despite TSA announcing its intentions to add 25 new airports to the program  from 275 to 300  the overall funding is not slated to be increased  The direct result would force Upstate New York airports into a shortfall in funding for their much needed security personnel For many of the states smaller airports that are already struggling to make ends meet  their financial problems will only be exacerbated    Today  Senator Schumer revealed that many of Upstate New Yorks airportsincluding Buffalo Niagara  Syracuse Hancock  and Rochester Internationalare about to be shortchanged by a federal funding program aimed at paying the cost of employing extra security staff required under a post September 11th law    Below is data for each participating upstate airport   Binghamton Regional Airport stands to fall short by  52 471 45 or 25  of its total budget for security   Buffalo Niagara International Airport stands to fall short by  75 053 16 or 19  of its total budget for security   Elmira Corning Regional Airport stands to fall short by  129 635 40 or 53  of its total budget for security   Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport stands to fall short by  83 934 08 or 38  of its total budget for security   Niagara Falls Airport stands to fall short by  19 325 60 or 27  of its total budget for security   Ogdensburg International Airport stands to fall short by  5 022 40 or 6  of its total budget for security   Oneida County Airport stands to fall short by  1 726 40 or 24  of its total budget for security   Rochester International Airport stands to fall short by  69 143 56 or 22  of its total budget for security   Syracuse Hancock International Airport stands to fall short by  62 474 13 or 12  of its total budget for security     Watertown International Airport  Chautauqua County Airport  and Massena International Airport all participate in the program but data was not available    Today Schumer announced the Senate passage of his amendment which will increase the Aviation Security Direction and Enforcement fund by  3 million  from  964 445 000 to  967 445 000  This fund includes the LEO program  and the Senators amendment increases the LEO program to  67 million  ensuring that thelevel of reimbursement offered by TSA will not suffer as more airports become part of this important program Across Upstate NY  his amendment minimizes the impact of any potential shortfall faced by the airports   Schumers amendment included in the Department of Homeland Securitys  DHS  appropriations bill will now go to conference with the House   In November of 2001  the President and Congress enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act  ATSA   which established TSA as a new federal agency  As an agency  TSA is responsible for civil aviation security including the supervision of screening passengers and property at airports
