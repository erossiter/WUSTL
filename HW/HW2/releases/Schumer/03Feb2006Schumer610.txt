IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 3  2006 Schumer  Allstate  Citing Bogus Concerns Of Hurricane Exposure Stops Writing Policies In Ny  Will Unfairly Raise Homeowner Premiums Across The State                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In Effort to Get Feds to Pick up the Tab  Allstate Stops Writing New Policies   Because of Hurricane Threat     Senator to Expose Scam   Senator Demands Allstate Continue Selling Homeowner Coverage without Raising Premiums Today Senator Chuck Schumer slammed Allstate Insurance  the largest provider of homeowners insurance in New York for no longer selling new homeowner policies to New York City  Long Island and Westchester citing bogus hurricane risk  in an effort to boost their profits  Though there is no risk based hurricane prediction for the future  Allstate offering these homeowner policies on the first of the year and has no plans to offer them again soon  Today Schumer sent a letter to Allstate demanding that they reinstate writing new coverage without raising premiums  He also called on the General Accounting Office undertake a review and write an objective report on catastrophic hurricanes and insurance industry profits over time       Allstate is the poster child for terrible corporate citizenship  They won  t write new policies for fear of hurricanes when the odds of a severe hurricane hitting in New York City is one on every 500 years     Schumer said    They should be ashamed of themselves        On the first of this year  Allstate announced that they would not write new homeowner policies in New York City  Long Island and Westchester as a part of an overall   hurricane risk management strategy    that they implemented at the start of 2006  However the new policy allows them to write new policies for condominiums and coops in the very locations that they are not insuring homes  Its claims however of a hurricane risk are bogus  Recent statistics from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  show that the odds of a category four or higher hurricane hitting New York City is once every five hundred years and on Montauk Long Island once every 130 years  Miami  by contrast is once every 15 years  The risk of a hurricane hitting Miami is 900  greater than on Eastern Long Island and 3300  greater than in NYC     One of the reasons that may be behind this effort is the desire by insurance companies like Allstate to create a catastrophic fund that would indemnify them from costs of devastating events like Hurricane Katrina  A catastrophic fund would put the Federal government and in turn  taxpayers in charge of footing the bill for events like enormous hurricanes  The theory behind dropping markets in the way that Allstate did  is that when they do exit  residents get angry and lobby for the creation of catastrophic fund  This is all part of the effort by these insurance companies to make as much money off of premiums that they can and not payout on claims       The hurricane data hardly demonstrates a risk     Schumer said    It already costs a massive amount of money to buy a home in New York City  LI and Westchester  Allowing homeowner insurance prices to spike will only make that situation more unbearable  The hard working homeowners of Westchester   Long Island and New York City should not be made pawns by an rapacious insurance industry looking to manufacture a false crisis to pressure designed to pressure the federal government to create a taxpayer financed disaster bailout system        Allstate  s reach in the markets that it has pulled out from is wide  It has an 18  share of the homeowner  s market in New York  and 25 9  of the market in the eight affected counties meaning that there is far less competition and prices for homeowners insurance will go through the roof     After Hurricane Andrew in 1992  Allstate attempted to cancel 300 000 homeowners   policies  and then sought a rate hike of up to 65  on remaining policies  The State of Florida declared a moratorium forbidding insurance companies from abandoning policyholders until the state could make alternative plans    From 2001 to 2004  Allstate  s profits have spiked from  990 million in 2001 to over 3 8 billion in 2004  for an increase of over 300   In New York State  Allstate  s   loss ratio    which measures the percentage of premiums paid out in claims  was better than the national average in 2004  In New York State it was 55  while nationwide it was 59  A score of under 60 is considered very good  and above 80 is considered problematic     Today  in an effort to combat this burgeoning crisis Schumer sent a letter to Allstate demanding that they restart writing new homeowner claims and not raise premiums  He also requested that the GAO undertake a review and report on the profitability of the property casualty insurance industry between the 2002 and 2005 hurricane season  Specifically to review the reasons and rate at which they increase their premiums in markets less impacted by natural disasters
