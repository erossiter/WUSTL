IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 12  2007 With The Long Overdue Dredging Of Jones Inlet Not Assured For   07  Schumer Calls On Senate Appropriators  Army Corps To Immediately Redirect Uncommitted Funds For Emergency Dredging                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Last Dredged in 1995  Shallow Waterway Currently Endangers Boaters  Fishermen  Emergency Responders  and Leaves Point Lookout and the Town of Hempstead  s Beaches Vulnerable to Storm Damage   With Key Decision Pending  and Unused Funds Potentially Available  Congress Must Give Army Corps Flexibility to Shift Dollars to High Need Projects Like Jones Inlet   Schumer Sends Letter to  With Jones Inlet long overdue for dredging  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the Senate Appropriations committee to provide both the necessary funding and the flexibility and discretion to utilize funds on high need projects so that the Army Corp of Engineers can speedily initiate dredging  Schumer also called on the Army Corp of Engineers  ACOE  to redirect funding in their 2007 budget for the dredging of the inlet      Jones Inlet jeopardizes the safety of boaters and fishermen while leaving the Town of Hempstead  s beaches vulnerable to severe storm damage  We have a golden opportunity to get Jones Inlet dredged now  if Congress acts fast to grant the Army Corps the funds and flexibility they need to allocate potentially unused funds to high need Long Island projects like this one     said Senator Schumer    Without critical funding and budgetary discretion to move this project forward and dredge the Inlet  the Hempstead community will also continue to be at risk of escalating and imminent threats during this year  s storm season     he added    While it has historically been dredged on a 2 3 year cycle  Jones Inlet hasn  t been dredged since 1995 and is not slated for dredging this year unless funds are made available  Over the past decade  the waterway has filled with sand  making both the channel perilously shallow and water conditions unpredictable for mariners  A primary concern is also for the safety of thousands of recreational boaters who are either forced to use other water channels or navigate outside Jones Inlet  s designated ones  since the water depth has shifted making the official lanes unsafe        Senator Schumer today sent letters to the ACOE and the Senate Appropriations Committee urging them to take all appropriate action to expedite dredging at Jones Inlet  While this year  s ACOE budget is identical to last year  s  the ACOE has finished  or nearly finished  several projects    leaving funding and resources potentially available to dredge Jones Inlet in 2007   But to access the funds  the ACOE need flexibility and discretion to allocate the next round of funds appropriated to high need projects  like Jones Inlet        The House and Senate Environment   Water subcommittees are set to offer rules and guidelines for the Fiscal Year 2007 appropriations received under the upcoming Joint Continuing Resolution  CR   which is expected to take effect in February  If Congress allows the ACOE flexibility and discretion in allocating funds under the Joint CR  they will be more able to redirect funds to Jones inlet  But if undue restrictions on allocating funds are placed on them from Congress  the ACOE  s ability to move funds to projects like Jones Inlet may be more limited      The threat of a shallow Jones Inlet affects commercial boaters  charter and party boats  fishermen  and emergency responders  This critical and long delayed dredging project will restore safe navigation and direct passage for emergency  commercial  and recreational vessels     said Senator Schumer    The Inlet also protects the Town of Hempstead  s precious beaches by absorbing the brunt of storms  It is estimated that by dredging Jones Inlet  approximately half million cubic yards of sand can be deposited back on the hamlet  s three beaches  According to Schumer  the sand nourishment will help reverse the relentless erosion negatively affecting the area  and protect residential and commercial property  local business and its economy  the ecosystem and its habitat and recreational interests  Senator Schumer also noted that the sand drawn from the inlet could replenish nearby Point Lookout which suffers from erosion   Schumer has long been an advocate for comprehensive beach erosion protection and a promoter of navigable channels  He has championed  along with fellow delegation members  funding for the Army Corps   Fire Island to Montauk Reformulation Study  He also recently worked with the ACOE to reprogram funding to expedite dredging of the East Rockaway Inlet after a barge carrying home heating oil ran aground in November  2006  Dredging began on January 10th and is scheduled for completion no later than January 26th  thereby ensuring that home heating oil will be available for the rest of the winter  On May 15  2006  Senator Schumer and Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray made a bipartisan push for funding to dredge Jones Inlet  and for an erosion project at Point Lookout
