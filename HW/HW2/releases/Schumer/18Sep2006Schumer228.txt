IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 18  2006 Schumer Urges Feds To Relocate Social Security Administration Office To Downtown Ogdensburg

                                     Newly Hired Branch Manager Can Relocate Offices Downtown When Current Lease Expires In January    Local Officials And Residents Support Move   Last March  Senator Called On GSA To Move Operations    They Agreed To Temporary 9 Month Lease Extension At Current Property While Considering New Facility   Schumer  This Would Be A Shot In The Arm For Downtown  s Revitalization And Make Cri U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today urged the Federal Government to relocate the Social Security Administration  SSA  Office to downtown Ogdensburg when their lease extension expires in January   A new regional branch manager for real estate services at the General Services Administration  GSA  was hired last month  and can recommend that the SSA offices be moved downtown  Schumer explained that the move downtown would be beneficial to the entire community as part of downtown  s waterfront development and its central location and proximity of many senior citizens  making critical Social Security services more accessible   In addition  Schumer said the SSA  as a major main street tenant  will contribute directly to the vitality of the downtown Ogdensburg community  Last March  Schumer called on the GSA to either move their offices downtown  or sign a temporary lease that would enable them to move  and GSA agreed to sign only a 9 month lease       With a new manager in charge  it  s time to move the Social Security offices downtown     said Schumer     This move would be a shot in the arm for downtown  s revitalization and is essential for the community and the people of Ogdensburg who rely on its Social Security services  The new downtown site will be ready to go when the lease expires  and local officials are already working together to find another company to move into the Commerce Park location  The sooner SSA can come downtown  the sooner those on Social Security and the downtown community can start to benefit from its new proximity        Downtown Ogdensburg is a growing area ready for new businesses to move in  The City of Ogdensburg has identified space at the old post office building for the Social Security offices  Just steps from city hall  this building would provide a central location  near all of the other government buildings located in downtown Ogdensburg  There are also two eleven story senior  s only apartment buildings are situated two blocks away from the facility  Most importantly  there are no public transportation options to take residents to the Social Security offices at their current location  By moving the office downtown close to a bus line  the social security beneficiaries who rely on public transportation will have much greater access to SSA services  Local officials hope moving SSA will become part of the local investment happening in downtown Ogdensburg  which includes plans for a  2 million waterfront     The lease at SSA  s current office  located at the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority  s Commerce Park  expired on April 18  but was extended by nine months  with a month to month option following that  at the request of the GSA   The Ogdensburg engineers predict that it would take a mere four months to make the former post office ready for the SSA  making this a quick and easy transition that would ensure no lost benefits or complications for those who rely on Social Security       In a personal letter to Richard Fazzulo  the new Regional Branch Manager for Real Estate Services at the GSA  Schumer wrote    This plan is supported by William Nelson  the mayor of Ogdensburg  and Martin Murphy  the city  s Director of Planning   In turn they are committed to helping the Bridge and Port Authority find another industrial company to move into Commerce Park  which is already nearing capacity   This would allow an employer more suited to the amenities of Commerce Park to move into the area     Therefore  I ask that you begin preparations to move the SSA operation to downtown Ogdensburg as soon as possible so that no time is spent at Commerce Park after the nine month extension        In March 2006  Schumer wrote to the previous GSA Administrator  David L  Bibb  calling on him to agree to relocate to the downtown site and to change the terms of the lease extension   The GSA granted the latter request by extending the lease by only nine months and then engaging in a month to month lease thereafter  instead of making a two year commitment with the Bridge and Port Authority  GSA is the federal agency in charge of renewing leases for federal agencies
