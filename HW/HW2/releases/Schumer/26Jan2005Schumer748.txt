IMMEDIATE RELEASE  January 26  2005 Schumer Blasts New Fed Proposal That Would Strip Thousands Of Upstate Students Of College Tuition

                                   New Schumer Study Shows Dramatic Effect on Upstate New York College Students   Schumer Unveils Plan to Prevent Change In Pell Grant Formula  Schumer Reveals Local Impact  In Western NY 6 500 Students Affected  6 000 in Finger Lakes Region  4 200 in Central NY  4 200 in Capital Region  5 700 in Greater Binghamton area  2 200 in North Country  9 200 in Hudson Valley Thousands of college students in upstate New York could lose a significant source of tuition assistance if a new Administration plan is enacted  US Senator Charles E  Schumer warned today  Schumer also announced his support for bipartisan legislation that will ensure no students lose any aid due to the Administration  s changes to the Pell Grant formula          As tuition costs continue to soar  we must help working families    not make college even harder to afford     Schumer said    We need to make sure students have the resources they need to go to school and succeed  The federal government should do everything possible to make college more affordable for working families and I will fight tooth and nail to make sure that upstate students who need Pell Grants don  t have them taken away          According to recent reports  the Bush Administration is moving forward with its plan announced in December to change the way student aid under the Pell Grant program is calculated  According to the American Council of Education  the new calculations would disqualify 89 000 low income students from the Pell Grant  an estimated 6 500 of whom are New Yorkers  An additional 1 3 million    including 95 000 in New York    would see a reduction in their student aid        Federal Pell Grants are the government s largest form of financial aid to help low income undergraduate students and certain post baccalaureate students pay for their college education  The grant does not have to be repaid and can be used at approximately 6 000 participating institutions nationwide  Pell grants range from  400 to  4 050  depending on the student s financial need  their cost to attend school  and whether they are enrolled as part time or full time       In December  the Department of Education announced plans to change the way students and their families calculate their expected family contribution  or EFC  for the 2005 2006 school year  The EFC is the amount that students and their families are expected to contribute from discretionary income towards college in a given year  A family  s EFC determines eligibility for Pell Grants and other forms of federal aid  Schumer said that while the President has also indicated plans to increase the maximum grant awarded  it does not justify the harm done to thousands of students by the calculation change made by the Department of Education and that the increased aid should be a supplement to the current grants        To illustrate the potential harm that could come of the Administration  s changes  Schumer today released a report detailing the school by school on students at upstate New York colleges and universities  Specifically  Schumer  s study showed the following             In Western NY  an estimated 6 500 students could either be disqualified from receiving a Pell Grant or see a drop in their aid       In Rochester Fingerlakes  an estimated 6 000 students could either be disqualified from receiving a Pell Grant or see a drop in their aid        In Central New York  an estimated 4 200 students would either be disqualified from receiving a Pell Grant or see a drop in their aid       In the Capital Region  an estimated 4 200 students would either be disqualified from receiving a Pell Grant or see a drop in their aid       In the Greater Binghamton area  an estimated 5 700 students would either be disqualified from receiving a Pell Grant or see a drop in aid        In the North Country  an estimated 2 200 students would either be disqualified from receiving a Pell Grant or see a drop in aid       In the Hudson Valley  an estimated 9 200 students would either be disqualified from receiving a Pell Grant or see a drop in aid       To prevent these changes from stripping this critical financial assistance from upstate New York college students  Schumer joined with Senators Jon Corzine  Ted Kennedy  and Gordon Smith to introduce bipartisan legislation today that would only allow the new EFC rules to be applied to students who would not see a reduction in their financial assistance as a result of the change  Schumer and the Senators also sent a letter to President Bush today urging him to restore these cuts in his Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal which is expected to be released in early February          Tuition prices are going through the roof and at the same time the federal Government is planning to cut off financial aid to thousands of students who need help to make their dream of a college degree come true     Schumer said    And for parents working hard on a budget to pay these bills  skyrocketing tuition costs mean debt and second mortgages  The federal government has to do more  not less  to help these parents and students out          In September  Schumer released a  showing that college tuition has increased by 224  in upstate New York over the last two decades and detailed his plan to let New Yorkers deduct up to  12 000 of college tuition  For the last two years  New Yorkers have been taking advantage of Schumer  s college tuition tax deduction which will be worth  4 000 this year and saving hundreds of dollars to help pay for a college education for their children  Schumer said today that tripling the deduction to  12 000 remains a top priority for 2005
