letter to Schumer is attached    STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E  SCHUMER Senate Judiciary Subcomittee on Antitrust September 27  2007  Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing  Given the high stakes and important issues on all sides  it is appropriate that we hold a hearing to look at the antitrust and other implications of mergers in this sector   I am concerned about consumers privacy as these companies  who hold vast amounts of information  do consider merging   It has been amazing to watch computer technology develop  It wasnt long ago when nobody had personal computers  and when the only computers in the world were the size of a small house   Now  just a few decades later  you can browse the Internet on a device that can fit in the palm of your hand   Of course  each of these new innovations brings new challenges  One of these is the complicated but interesting issue of online advertising that brings us here today   We cant ignore the fact that an increasing portion of the advertising dollar around the world is going to online advertising  These are the text or picture ads that show up every time we do a search or go to an ISP like AOL or Google   The companies at issue here are some of the largest and most profitable in America  It is my sincere hope that as they continue to grow  they will use their expansions for the good of consumers   But I want to make sure three things are addressed in the online advertising deals  antitrust laws  privacy and jobs in New York   On the antitrust side  there are certainly questions about what impact a merger such as this will have on the advertising market  And those questions should be answered by this Committee  the Justice Department  and the FTC as they review this merger   In addition  I have several concerns on the privacy side  As the internet expands  the amount collected about our personal life grows  Some of it is collected to better target ads to each of us   In light of my concerns  I met with Google CEO Dr  Eric Schmidt  I asked for a specific commitment from Google that it will protect privacy following the merger   At this time  Mr  Chairman  Id like to place into the record a copy of a letter from Dr  Schmidt to me that lists some of the steps Google tells me it plans to take to protect privacy   Google tells me that it is looking at ways to provide users with better forms of notice to help users understand who is behind the ads they see   Google is looking into an opt out mechanism in the future so that individuals can choose not to have cookies placed on their computers  and that it is experimenting with new privacy protection features  For instance  they are looking into the idea of using crumbled cookies so that user data isnt stored in a single cookie   Mr  Chairman  these steps would represent important measures toward addressing my privacy concerns  I hope Google will take these steps and others  I thank Dr  Schmidt for responding to my requests in this way   Mr  Chairman  thank you for having this hearing  and thank you to all of the witnesses for coming
