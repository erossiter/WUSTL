IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 2  2007 Senate Committee Passes School Safety Bill Including Schumer Plan To Tighten Background Checks For Gun Buyers  Require States To Submit Information To National Database                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Would Require Mental Health Information Be Turned Over to the Feds and Shared Between State to Ensure Guns are Not Sold to Dangerous Individuals    Had This Practice Already Been In Place  the Tragic Shooting at Virginia Tech Might Have Been Prevented Today  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced that a school safety legislative package including his plan to tighten background checks for gun purchasers made its first step towards becoming law  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvements Act  which was authored by Senator Patrick Leahy and includes Senator Schumers language to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System  NICS  was passed unanimously today by a Senate Judiciary Committee vote  The shooting of 32 people at Virginia Tech last spring  perpetrated by a gunman who had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and deemed a danger to himself and others by a judge  exposed grave shortcomings in the system meant to prevent criminals and other dangerous individuals from obtaining firearms  The legislation would strengthen requirements for states to pass critical mental health information along to the federal government for inclusion in NICS  so that a pre purchase background check would show a person falls into the category of those prohibited from owning firearms  Had Cho Seung Huis mental condition shown up in his federal background check  he may never have been allowed to buy a handgun  Similar legislation  sponsored by Rep  Carolyn McCarthy  NY 4  recently passed the House of Representatives    Our first line of defense against another national tragedy is ensuring that guns stay out of the hands of violent people  Schumer said  Many of the rules to do exactly that are already on the books  and the NICS system is key to ensuring that gun buyers know when not to sell a gun to a particular individual  But unless states are diligent in collecting  updating and submitting information to the national database  the system cannot work  I have been working on this issue for many years  and I am happy to see that Chairman Leahy has made it such a priority for the Committee   When a person attempts to purchase a firearm  a background check is run through the National Instant Criminal Background  or NICS system  A NICS call center representative  or automated system  runs a check of several databases to see if the purchaser has a record prohibiting him or her from buying a gun under federal law  The majority of potential gun buyers are either approved or denied almost instantly  But if the computer search is unable to reach a final determination  a NICS representative will conduct a manual search for missing information that will allow NICS to make a final determination  In such a situation  the NICS representative must attempt to get the missing information by calling state and local courthouses  judges  clerks  or even law enforcement officers to get the information  If the NICS representative cannot get an answer in three days  the gun dealer automatically has permission to sell the gun to the buyer   A criminal background check is only as good as the records that the states provide to the system  Millions of criminal and mental health records are inaccessible to the NICS system  mostly because state and local governments lack the money to submit the records  Furthermore  the process is often spotty  as states are not required by law to turn over all pertinent information that could potentially prohibit a person from buying a gun  As a result  many people who simply should not have guns are allowed to purchase them  In the case of the Virginia Tech shooting  Cho allegedly acquired the two firearms in two separate transactions  both within weeks of the massacre  For both purchases  he was required to show the store clerk a driver s license and complete paperwork before passing the background check  Because no mental health information was in the system  he was able to pass his background checks  However  two years before buying the guns  Cho was accused of stalking two of his fellow female students at Virginia Tech  and had been civilly committed  At the time  a judge found that Cho presents an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness  He was then briefly admitted to a psychiatric facility for an overnight stay as an outpatient  This information was never conveyed to the federal government and never appeared on Chos background checks   This bill would provide  400 million to state agencies and  125 million for state courts to upgrade their computers to ensure speedy delivery of information  Using a carrot and stick approach  states who poorly comply with the law will risk losing 5  of their funding under the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968  Significant incentives will be provided to states that have good reporting records  States who comply would be required to share informationsuch as an individuals relevant  disqualifying history of mental illnesswith the FBI  The law would also requires federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security to make their records available to the NICS database to ensure timely and thorough background checks of those who purchase guns  The bill also requires states to set up procedures whereby a person who previously had been deemed mentally ill can petition to regain the right to own a firearm  Similar legislation  sponsored by Rep  Carolyn McCarthy  NY 4  is currently pending in the House of Representatives   Federal law clearly prohibits the purchase of firearms by those who have been adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental health institution  Also forbidden from possessing guns are people who    Are      subject to a court order restraining them from domestic violence    Are      under indictment for  or have been convicted of a felony  Are      fugitives from justice  Are      users or addicts of controlled substances  Have      been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor Have      been dishonorably discharged from the military  Are      illegal aliens  or Have      renounced U S  Citizenship    It is unfortunate that it would take a tragedy of the magnitude of Virginia Techthe worst shooting massacre in U S  historyfor us to finally address this problem and counter it with sensible  responsible legislation  Schumer said  The bottom line is that someone who has been adjudicated a danger to himself and to others has no business owning a firearm  period
