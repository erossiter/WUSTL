IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 16  2005 Schumer Announces Strong Opposition To LNG Terminal On Long Island Sound  Cites Potential Terrorist Target  Damage To Environment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Senator Raised Many Questions for Broadwater to Answer on Security  Safety  Commercial and Environmental Concerns    Region too Populous and Environmentally Sensitive to Risk Major Hazard As plans for a large and potentially dangerous Liquid Natural Gas  LNG  terminal on Long Island Sound move forward  today U S Senator Charles E  Schumer came out in formal opposition to building it  Two months ago Schumer asked John Hritcko  project manager of the Broadwater project to answer a list of 15 questions on security  safety  commercial and environmental issues surrounding the project  After careful consideration of those answers and after meeting with Broadwater  TransCanada and Shell  Schumer concluded that he could not  in good faith support the effort to build a liquid national gas terminal on the Sound        It s true that we must find a way to satisfy the ever increasing demand for energy  but we should be focusing on alternative sources of energy  not on building a security risk and an eyesore in the middle of Long Island Sound that could decimate the ecosystem  has wide ranging public health implications  and could be an inviting terrorist target        Schumer has long supported finding new sources of energy for Long Island  He was an advocate for the Cross Sound Cable and the Millennium Pipeline and supported building a new power plant in Melville  After seriously considering the issues surrounding the potential LNG terminal in the sounds  he concluded that the negatives outweigh the positives        We do need a smart and comprehensive strategy to meet energy needs here on Long Island  but this LNG terminal will take so long and be so controversial that it s going to take our attention away from the real issue at hand  We just don t need another Shoreham   Schumer said       The proposed LNG facility would be located on the Long Island Sound  nine miles from Long Island and 11 miles from Connecticut  Broadwater  a floating storage and regasification unit  FSRU   would store imported LNG and ship it as a gas through underwater pipelines to New York and Connecticut       LNG is the liquefied form of natural gas  It is cooled to below minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit and is desirable because it takes up 1 600th of the volume of natural gas in its vapor form  It is pumped into enormous tankers  The terminal would connect with the existing sub sea Iroquois pipeline via an underwater connecting pipeline that would be about 25 miles long  Tankers would import gas from the Atlantic Basin  including western Africa  Venezuela  and Trinidad and Tobago       Schumer cited various Homeland Security issues  such as responsibility for patrolling around the terminal  when explaining his opposition to the project  When he asked the Broadwater team in a meeting  they replied that it would come under the purview of the Coast Guard  The Coast Guard had previously promised to do more patrolling of Indian Point Energy Center and they were unable to devote the resources to it   The Coast Guard just doesn t have the resources to devote to projects they are already committed to  how can they possibly be able to commit to this   Schumer asked       Schumer discussed concerns over the terminal becoming a potential terrorist target  Other safety concerns include pool fires which occur when LNG spills onto water and ignites in the air  They cannot be extinguished  they burn until all of the LNG is consumed and because it s so hot  its thermal radiation can injure people and damage property a considerable distance from the fire itself       Schumer is also opposing the project based on concerns over the environment  Building the terminal would begin the industrialization of the Long Island Sound which would allow corporations to take control of a public resource  It would close major portions of the Sound to much of the boating and fishing and other recreational activities that residents enjoy there  It would also place a heavy burden on the Sound s ecosystem  which is already fragile  The LNG terminal would negatively impact the sea floor  the sound water  and could potentially endanger some of the rare marine species found in the sound       To address those issues  when meeting with Broadwater Schumer expressed interest in lengthening the pipeline so that the sensitive Sound wouldn t be as vulnerable  and so that it could be in a less populous area  Broadwater responded that doing so would require the construction of additional infrastructure to compress the natural gas along its journey to the existing pipeline system        It seems to me that though Broadwater may have come up with the easier plan to build  it is not the safest or most environmentally sensitive     Schumer said       Building the LNG terminal could also undermine the tourism industry which  brings in about 5 5 billion dollars for the regional economy  Additionally  there is no immediate need for a project of this size in the region       LNG is natural gas cooled to  260 degrees F  The LI sound facility would store the LNG  and warm it as needed back to its gaseous form  It would then pump it through a 25 mile underwater pipeline it will build that will connect to the Iroquois gas pipeline that runs from Milford  Connecticut to Northport  New York       Broadwater would have a storage capacity of about 8 billion cubic feet  and ship about 1 billion cubic feet daily to New York and Connecticut
