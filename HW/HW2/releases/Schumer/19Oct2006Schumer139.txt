The Highway System  Bu With hundreds of trucks leaving the Thruway and I 81 each day unnecessarily and clogging local roads  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled his new plan to keep trucks out of Central New York neighborhoods and restore communities   quality of life   Over 1 9 million trucks travel through Central New York every year carrying freight  but many drive on local roads as a shortcut and to avoid weigh stations  tolls and traffic   Throughout the past few years  there have been numerous accidents spilling fuel  garbage and chemicals  all posing a potential threat to the Onondaga County watershed and surrounding neighborhoods  In addition  the trucks disrupt communities at all hours of the day and night           Truck drivers are circumventing the highway system  but our local communities are paying the price     Schumer said     These trucks are evading highway tolls and weigh stations  and are instead driving on neighborhood streets  taxing the roadways and diminishing the quality of life in otherwise peaceful communities  This is a very unique and growing problem in this region  It  s time for the government to step up  and preserve the way of life in these communities          Hundreds of trucks carrying hazardous material travel through Central New York everyday transporting millions of tons of goods every year  Elsewhere around the country  trucks are mandated by state law to follow certain paths  These truck routes are created in order to keep trucks off small state and county roads  According to the New York State Department of Transportation  NYSDOT  estimates  at least 500 trucks travel on small roads around Syracuse and the Finger Lakes each day  including State Route 20  County Route 41 and other roadways  The Seneca Meadows landfill in Waterloo alone sees traffic of over 200 trucks a day   This landfill is scheduled to expand and grow  just increasing this problem  The New York State Thruway Authority reports that the number of commercial vehicles exiting the Thruway in the Syracuse area has more than doubled since 2003  The only place in New York State with any designated truck routes is New York City  When traveling on the New York State Thruway and I 81  trucks are required to pay tolls or stop for open weigh stations  However  trucks often take smaller state and county roads  day and night  as a less expensive shortcut  This practice is not only a nuisance to the citizens of the small communities these roads pass through  but is also an issue of safety       Freight trucks haul everything from garbage to eggs  gasoline to milk  The small roads in and around Central New York and the Finger Lakes that truckers use instead of the Thruway and I 81 cannot handle these large vehicles  The local roads were not built for the extreme weights and are inadequate to handle the volume of traffic they must carry  which has led to considerable wear and tear on the pavement   Many of the roads have sharp turns and steep inclines   The truck traffic has also had a detrimental effect on the aging buildings and the overall quality of life in the communities  The foundations of many buildings have cracked from vibrations of large trucks   A building owner in downtown Skaneateles had to replace windows from  30 000 after the steel window panes shook and cracked from the vibrations of the trucks  The owner of the Sherwood Inn in Skaneateles has received complaints from his guests that trucks passing by during the night prevent them from enjoying their stay       If a truck transporting goods were to overturn  a dangerous environmental situation could occur  New York State Routes 20  41 and 41A border Skaneateles Lake  and a spill could affect the entire county  s drinking water supply  According to the Skaneateles Police Chief  200 garbage trucks  18 wheelers  carrying up to 300 gallons of diesel fuel apiece  pass through the community every day   Recently  two separate accidents have occurred where a truck flipped over on Route 41 by the lake        Schumer today unveiled a three point plan to keep trucks on the highway  and off of local roads   Specifically  Schumer called for            Permanent routes for trucks carrying hazardous materials ranging from garbage to gasoline  Schumer is urging that Interstate 90  the Thruway  and Interstate 81 be designated as hazardous materials truck routes   These routes are designed to keep trucks on large highways and interstates  and off of smaller local roads   Currently  states can choose to set up truck routes  but it is not mandatory  The United States Code allows for these routes to be created  and requires the New York State Department of Transportation  NYSDOT  to work with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA  to create an appropriate routing plan  Such routes are already in place in states including New Jersey  Ohio  Pennsylvania and Maryland  This would keep trucks off of smaller roads and on larger highways built for handling large trucks             The federal government to require all states establish routing systems for trucks carrying hazardous materials  Schumer promised that if the federal DOT does not set this new requirement on their own  he would introduce legislation that would require states to work with FMCSA to do so   Schumer also asked that they conduct a Truck Route Management and Community Impact Reduction Study  which would include a truck route analysis  truck route policies  regulations and stringent enforcement  truck route education  outreach program and signage   The study is to incorporate recommendations to improve the operation and management of the truck route network and mitigate the negative impacts of commercial truck traffic on local routes   In addition  the study should suggest short term initiatives to enact immediate improvements that would better manage the truck route network            A new effort to support the bipartisan Transportation Security Improvement Act  S 1052    This legislation would provide for several measures to increase the safety of the nation  s truck fleet  including requiring truck drivers transporting hazardous material to have written route plans  requires USDOT to promote GPS tracking systems on trucks carrying high hazard materials  establishes a program for reviewing hazardous materials security plans  and sets civil penalties for failure to comply with certain requirements for the transportation of hazardous materials  It would also require the Secretary of Transportation to submit to Congress a report assessing truck security
