Void                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Service at Airports is Plagued by Volatile Ticket Fares  Inconvenient Travel Times and Limited Options for Connecting to Major Airports    Big Sky Proposal would Offer 18 flights a Week under Delta Banner to Boston   Central Hub would Allow Passengers to Connect to Flights to More Destinations    As Current Carrier looks to withdraw from Market  Schumer Calls on DOT Secretary to Approve Big  In the wake of CommutAirs decision to terminate its federally backed air service at the Plattsburgh Airport and the Saranac Lake Lake Placid Airport today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer threw his support behind Big Skys proposal to fill the regions air service void  Schumer is concerned that economic development and tourism in the region will be stifled due sub par air service that hampers growth in the region    In a personal letter to Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters  Schumer argued that Big Skys experience and their code sharing agreement with Delta makes them an ideal air service provider to fill the void left by CommutAirs departure  Schumer today called on the Secretary of Transportation to approve the airlines application to provide Essential Air Service  EAS  to several communities in northern New   York State   We have a golden opportunity to fill the void in air service at Plattsburg and Lake Placid airports that has burdened travelers with high ticket prices and limited travel options said Senator Schumer  Big Sky would give residents in Upstate New Yorks Northern regions access to regular air service to major travel hubs  which is why today Im calling on the Department of Transportation to quickly approve their proposal   Big Skys proposal to serve Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake Lake Placid includes providing 18 flights weekly with service to Boston  a central hub that would allow residents of these communities to connect to a wider selection of connecting flights  The company has also proposed a plan to ensure a consistent pricing structure for these routes  providing a regularity that will help further grow these air service markets   Big Sky currently flies routes to Boston from Watertown  Ogdensburg and Massena  New York under a code sharing agreement with Delta Airlines  This agreement allows travelers to book tickets from the North Country to destinations around the world  directly on the Delta website or through customer service representatives Their service flies directly into Deltas hub in Boston  giving passengers an easy way to make connecting flights  all while amassing frequent flyer miles  An identical code sharing agreement would also be instituted by Big Sky if awarded the EAS contract to fly the Plattsburgh Lake Placid Saranac Lake routes Schumer met with Big Sky CEO Fred DeLeeuw in March of this year and personally urged him to consider expanding the airlines service to the newly renovated Plattsburgh International Airport   Delta has been a key target of ours  given their success at Bellingham  Washington and other border locations  states Garry Douglas  President of the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce  We met with Delta officials in Senator Schumer s Washington office late last year  leading to a site visit by Big Sky in January  We ve been quietly and steadily working with them ever since  and we see them in part as the potential nose of the Delta camel under the Plattsburgh tent  said Douglas  Big Sky Delta is very committed to growing here  and is already working with us on active marketing plans and promotions for this fall  We hope to see even more service and destinations with them a few years out  including potential service by Delta itself if we can demonstrate success   Clinton County is very excited with the prospect of Big Sky Airlines being awarded the Essential Air Service contract for passenger service out of Plattsburgh International Airport  said James Langley Jr  Chairman of the Clinton County Legislature  After a thorough review ofBig Sky s proposal andhaving met withits President Fred deLeeuw  we are convinced that Big Sky will significantly enhance passenger service in our community  This message of support has been communicated to U S  Department of Transportation  and it is our hope that the Essential Air Service contract be awarded to Big Sky Airlines as expeditiously as possible   CommutAirs decision to withdraw from the EAS contract left Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake without an air carrier with long term interest in the region  While CommutAir will still provide service until a new carrier is picked  their decision to leave these markets is an indication that they either no longer want to  or are unable  to fly these routes effectively   In a personal letter to Department of Transportation Secretary Mary Peters  Schumer wrote  It is important that CommutAir is replaced with a carrier who is committed to flying passengers into and out of New Yorks North  Country  Based on local support and the need to quickly find a new carrier  I wholly support Big Skys proposal to fly the Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake Lake Placid route  The Big Sky proposal has received the strong support of civic leaders and community residents in Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake Lake Placid
