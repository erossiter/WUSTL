Yorkers may have been duped into taking on costly subprime loans even though they could have qualified for more affordable  prime mortgages  Schumer placed the blame on the shoulders of brokers and

brokers and deceptive subprime loans  Schumer announced a bill to ensure that mortgage brokers give consumers simple and straight forward information on loan terms    In every county and in every corner of New York State weve seen residents swindled into taking on inflated and grossly expensive mortgages  burying families in debt for years  Meanwhile  disingenuous brokers have made off like highway bandits  said Senator Schumer  This bill will peel back the shroud of deception on thousands of subprime loans  making sure New York residents can easily get the best deal possible when taking out a loan   Today  Schumer revealed that an estimated 50 000 Upstate New Yorkers currently locked into a subprime loan could have been eligible for prime mortgages  based on national averages   meaning that they may have been duped by brokers and lenders into taking out less affordable loans  Schumer said that increased transparency and simpler disclosure on the now incredibly complicated subprime mortgage documentation could have helped thousands of families avoid forecloses    Schumer today issued a report detailing the latest  startling statistics regarding the subprime mortgage crisis in upstate New York  Over 160 000 upstate New Yorkers are locked into unaffordable subprime loans  Subprime borrowers in upstate New York took out an average loan of nearly  120 000  This has resulted in a total outstanding subprime debt of over  26 billion in upstate New York alone    Furthermore  recent estimates by industry experts have revealed that approximately one third of all subprime borrowers may have been eligible for traditional mortgage options  thereby avoiding the excessively high subprime interest rates  as well as the hassles of refinancing when the loan becomes unaffordable    Below are county by county statistics regarding outstanding subprime mortgages in upstate New York     The Capital Region has an estimated 28 878 borrowers with subprime loans  The

 To ensure Upstate New Yorkers are protected against deceptive mortgage loans  Schumer today announced a bill that will bring accountability to the industry and empower consumers    Schumers bill will create a Schumer Box to help borrowers better protect themselves from unscrupulous and predatory lending practices by mandating that the lender disclose the following key details in one  easy to read page that must be signed by both the borrower and the lender    The initial interest rate and monthly payment on the mortgage  including taxes and insurance    The date s  that the interest rate resets   The estimated fully indexed interest rate and monthly payment after reset  including taxes and insurance    The fees that the borrower pays to the lender at closing   Any prepayment penalties   Disclosure of any balloon payments  negative amortization  or subordinate or piggyback loans that are features of the loan  Schumers bill will amend the Truth In Lending Act  15 U S C  1601  to include the provision requiring a one page disclosure form at least seven days before closing  and contains specific language regarding the format that would be required by all lenders for proper mortgage disclosure  The seven day window will give homebuyers sufficient time to assess whether they want to accept the terms of the mortgage being offered to them  as well as to find another mortgage if necessary  The Schumer bill would also require that lenders provide this information to borrowers at the time the loan is approved   The idea of a disclosure document originated as a provision of the Fair Credit and Credit Card Disclosure Act of 1988  which Senator Schumer authored while a member of the House of Representatives  It was the first law to mandate that credit card agreements include a simple table or box that clearly displays important information such as APRs  transaction fees  annual fees and grace periods  The disclosure form has come to be known within the credit card industry as a Schumer box   Schumer is also the author of the Borrowers Protection Act  which would  for the first time  bring independent mortgage brokers under federal regulation  The bill would impose a fiduciary responsibility on the broker  require originators to underwrite loans at the fully indexed rate  prohibit steering of borrowers into unsuitable loans  and hold lenders responsible for policing their associated appraisers and brokers
