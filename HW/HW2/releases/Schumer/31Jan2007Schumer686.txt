                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mayors  DAs  and Local Law Enforcement Officials are Reporting a Spike in Gang Violence and a Need For Better Security at Schools  But They Don t Have the Tools or the Resources to Get the Job Done   Bi Partisan Effort Would Provide More than  1 billion in New Funding for Gang Enforcement  Prevention and Intervention Programs Over the Next Five Years   Schumer Releases Report Det With concerns over the growing gang presence across upstate New York and an increase in school violence in the United States  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today released a new   showing that there has been a 10 percent increase in reports of violent crime and a nearly 20 percent jump in the number of drug arrests in cities and communities across upstate New York   According to Schumer s report  there were nearly 14 000 arrests for violent crimes in 2005   In addition to gangs  local law enforcement  teachers and parents are also raising serious concerns about recent violence at elementary and high schools across the country   Schumer said incidents in Pennsylvania and Las Vegas show that the federal government is not doing nearly enough to provide schools with the tools and resources they need to keep our kids safe    Gangs are starting to spread like a virus in upstate cities and communities   Schumer said   The best vaccine to combat the rise of gangs and gang violence is a comprehensive assault to break those gangs up and provide support for law enforcement  from the cop on the street to the Department of Justice  who are on the front lines with the resources they need and deserve  Our legislation will give law enforcement officials and our schools new resources to combat the growth of gangs   Upstate New York has seen an increase in violent crime and drug related offenses across the board  In 2005  25 113 violent crimes were reported according to the New York State Department of Criminal Justice Services   This represents an increase of nearly 10 percent from 23 310 reported in 2000  Schumer said that there has also been an even greater increase in the number of felony and misdemeanor drug arrests   In 2000  19 113 arrests were made for drug related crimes  both felony and misdemeanor    That number rose to 22 449 arrests in 2005  a 17 5 percent increase   Arrests for violent crime were also up to 13 812 in 2005  up from 13 422 in 2000   Below is how the numbers break out across the state   In the Capital Region  there were 3 443 violent crimes reported in 2005  and 2 846 drug arrests  In Central New York  there were 2 876 violent crimes reported in 2005  and 2 203 drug arrests       In the Rochester Finger Lakes region  there were 3 456 violent crimes reported in 2005  and 2 278 drug arrests  In the Hudson Valley  there were 6 055 violent crimes reported in 2005  and 7 763 drug arrests  In the North Country  there were 1 151 violent crimes reported in 2005  and 793 drug arrests  In the Southern Tier  there were 1 268 violent crimes reported in 2005  and 1 318 drug arrests  In Western New York  there were 6 864 violent crimes reported in 2005 and 5 338 drug arrests   According to local law enforcement  there are tens of thousands of gang members operating in areas across upstate New York  The first type of gang threat is from independent street gangs that are modeled after  but have no formal affiliation with  national gangs   The second wave of activity is concentrated in small sets of national gangs that have moved north from downstate   Though activity is mostly centered in inner cities  gang activity has been reported in smaller cities  towns  and suburbs    Schumer today also raised serious concerns about the rising tide of violence in elementary schools across the country and said that the federal government has not done nearly enough to provide local school districts and law enforcement with the resources necessary to beef up security if it s needed  Schumer cited recent shootings at schools in Colorado  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as evidence that the problem of school violence is still very real   Schumer said that the Administration has repeatedly cut funding for programs meant to provide vital safety and security funding for schools in upstate New York and across the country   From a high of  180 million in 2002  the COPS in Schools program has been steadily reduced until funding was completely eliminated for FY 2006  and it is zeroed out in this year s budget   When the federal government draws back funding  it means our schools have to take money away from other vital programs that we all care about   School districts should have to rob Peter to pay Paul in order to protect our kids   To combat the growing threat of gang violence in cities and communities in upstate New York and across the country  Schumer today announced a new plan to combat the rise in gangs and growing fears over violence at schools   He announced two new pieces of legislation that would provide more than  1 billion in new federal funding to combat the rise of gangs and impose tough new penalties for those who participate in gang violence  Schumer announced that he will be a lead co sponsor  among a bi partisan group of Judiciary Committee members  of new comprehensive gang prevention and enforcement legislation that is being authored by Senator Dianne Feinstein and will be introduced today  The Feinstein Hatch Schumer Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007 includes more than  1 billion over the next five years for Federal  State and local law enforcement efforts against violent gangs  for witness protection programs  and services geared toward gang prevention  Included in the  1 billion is  100 million over five years to expand crime control grants to state and local governments  so they can hire additional prosecutors  staff and technology as needed to bring more cases against gangs and violent criminals  The bill is endorsed by the National Association of Police Organizations         The new legislation also creates new criminal gang offenses to prohibit recruitment of minors in a criminal street gang  and to punish violent crimes related to gangs  The bill also replaces the current federal law s mere sentencing enhancement for gang related conduct   a provision rarely used   with a new federal anti gang law that directly criminalizes and penalizes criminal street gang crime  and related conspiracies and attempts to commit crimes in furtherance of a criminal street gang   Also included in the Gang bill is a provision based on legislation authored by Senator Schumer during the 109th Congress called the Short Term Witness Protection Act   The bill would create a new federal grants program to pay for protecting witnesses in state and local criminal trials  providing  90 000 000 for short term grants to provide witness protection  either through the U S  Marshall s service or using local law enforcement   Funds from the Schumer grants program will be distributed to local and state prosecutors at the discretion of the Attorney General  Schumer said that most of the funds will be distributed to states like New York that have 100 or more murders a year   The second piece of legislation  School Safety Enhancements Act  lead by Schumer and Senator Barbara Boxer  would also create a new grant program to provide local educational agencies with grants for programs to prevent and respond to violence in elementary and secondary schools  The bill would provide  50 million a year in grants to schools for hiring and training of police and safety officials  metal detectors and surveillance cameras  and capital improvements to make schools more secure   Last year  Schumer also wrote to President Bush asking him to include an additional  200 million for federal school safety programs in his FY 2008 budget  which is set to be released next week   The bill will be introduced in the coming days
