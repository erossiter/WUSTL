IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 11  2007 With Holiday Travel Season Fast Approaching  Schumer Reveals  There is a Quick Way Out of Crippling Flight Delays    Airlines Have Been Begging FAA to Convene Vital Scheduling Meeting to Even Out Crowded Flight Schedule  But The FAA Failed to Act                                                                                                                                                           Schumer Demands FAA Immediately Call Summit of All JFK Airlines to Overhaul Overcrowded Schedule and Provide Immediate Relief As Traffic Surges Schumer to Unveil New Plan  JFK Airline Summit to Overhaul Current Schedule  Creation of Air Czar for the Northeast  and Opening up Military Airspace to Commercial Flights to Reduce Congestion Over the Long Term With the worst summer air travel season now over  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today unveiled a new plan to dramatically cut delays at John F  Kennedy International Airport and prevent another disastrous summer  Schumer called on the FAA to immediately convene a so called scheduling meeting with representatives with all the major airlines now serving JFK to negotiate a new  more balanced schedule in order to reduce the congestion and delays that have crippled the New York City areas airspace   Growing flight delays arent just an annoyance  They threaten to bring the New York City economy to halt and could cut us off as a destination for global travelers  Schumer said  Action to break the logjam at our airports is long overdue  My plan will cut through the bureaucracy and provide real relief over the short and long term  The growth at JFK in particular has been phenomenal and it is the kind of growth that will allow NYC to retain its preeminent place as an international business and travel destination   Over the long term  Schumer said that the new Open Skies agreement between the United States and the European Union will allow scores of previously barred European Carries unfettered access to JFK  only increasing congestion and possibly delays  Schumer also said that thousands of square miles of mostly unused military airspace off the East Coast could be used to reduce growing congestion and call for a joint FAA Air Force to study opening up portions of the airspace to commercial flights at certain times  particularly in severe weather conditions that delay traffic along the northeast corridor   Schumer also said that the primary reason for delays at New York City airports  particularly JFK  is gross FAA mismanagement of traffic in the air and on the ground  The FAAs mismanagement of operations has resulted in diminished use of JFK and LGA  In fact  despite growing demand by carriers for both airports usage  they have actually been able to handle fewer and fewer flights per hour in recent years  With two intersecting runways  LGA can manage a single take off at a time and up to 81 total operations per hour  JFK  with four runways  has design specifications that can handle 100 operations per hour    Every morning the FAA publishes a call rate for the local airport which determines a target number of hourly operations based on weather  turbulence and system delays around the country  Between January and June 2007  the JFK call rate averaged 84 operations an hour and LGA 74  well below what the airports are designed to handle  In reality  the actual average daily operations were only 68 an hour at JFK and 65 an hour at LGA  This means that JFK is only operating at 68  of its maximum capacity on a typical day  Schumer said its bad enough that we arent using the airport to its capacity  but whats worse is that we are even falling well short of hitting the daily call rates   Schumer also warned that congestion and air traffic could skyrocket early next year when the landmark Open Skies agreement between the United States and European Union goes in to affect  The agreement would allow all European Carriers unfettered access to American airports  Schumer said that while this increased traffic is vital to the economic future of the airports and the city and should be welcomed  there needs to be a comprehensive and concrete plan in place in order to manage the traffic  Under current conditions  the introduction of scores of European jumbo jets in the New York City airspace would dramatically increase already unbearable congestion   After one of the worst air travel summers on record  Schumer announced his new three point plan aimed at reducing delays  overhauling FAA managements of the airports and airspace  both over the short and long term    Scheduling Meeting Schumer called on DOT Secretary Mary Peters to immediately convene a long overdue scheduling meeting of all the airlines currently serving JFK  Under current law  airlines are legally barred from meeting independently to coordinate flight schedules and must instead have the FAA call the meeting  Though the major airlines  particularly JetBlue  have repeatedly requested the meeting  the FAA has ignored the request  Other airlines  like Delta  have taken the initiative to make their own scheduling changes to reduce congestion and delays  but these changes cannot be made in a vacuum  Schumer said that a collective scheduling meeting could provide immediate relief to delays in advance of the holiday travel season by better distributing flights away from peek hours   Though the President and Secretary Peters signaled last month that they would be in favor of calling the meeting  it was never officially called  Schumer said the meeting is vital to resolving over crowding at peek hours and could show results as early as the holiday travel season    Northeast Air Czar  Schumer called on the FAA to create a Northeast Air Czar  a new position whose sole focus would be overseeing and coordinating operations at the major air traffic facilities in the New York City area and at the airports along the northern part of the east coast corridor  Air traffic is currently overseen and managed by three separate and distinct entities at the FAA  1  Towers oversee airborne aircraft and ground movement of aircraft and vehicles  2  The TRACONs control air traffic in a 30 50 mile radius from the airport  from the surface to 11 000 feet  3  The En Route Centers guide traffic during the high altitude cruise phase of a flight  Right now though  Schumer said these entitieshave limitedcommunicationwith each other  so as planes move between modalities they often get detour signs but absolutely no direction on which way to go  In fact  commands across the various entities of the ATC system must travel from the controllers on the ground all the way up to the highest operating levels of the FAA and back down to the local controllers before any broad changes to the system can be implemented    Schumer said the Air Czar would work for the Northeast because they could investigate and change endemic problem in the northeast  but also cut through bureaucracy in real time  Air Czars are a proven tool  two years ago  South Florida  particularly the area around Ft  Lauderdale and Miami were experiencing meteoric delays  A regional air czar was appointed  on a temporary basis  and several airlines saw significant performance improvements  For instance  Delta arrival performance in South Florida improved 44   and delays of over 90 minutes dropped by 69  over the year     Open Up Underutilized Military Airspace  Currently  there is a 15 20 mile band of air space directly off the coast of the eastern seaboard that is restricted almost exclusively for military operations  This space is used for training by military aircraft  as well as naval exercises  While it is critical that our armed services have all the space they need to train  its becoming clear that they arent using all of this space all of the time    For flights flying north south  this air space could represent a new super highway that would allow them to avoid congested areas over NYC  Washington  Atlanta and Florida or bypass bad weather when it arises on the east coast    Schumer called on the FAA and DOT working with DOD to investigate if portions of this airspace could be made available for commercial aviation at certain timesby determining the DOD s actual utilizationof this space  In addition  Schumer called on the agencies to investigate whether it is feasible to establish north south and East West arteries within this airspace that can function as new routes for commercial aviation  Schumer said after initial conversations both the Port Authority and the FAA would be eager to work with the DOD to explore these options
