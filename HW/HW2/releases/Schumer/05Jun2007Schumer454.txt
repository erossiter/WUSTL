                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Recent Service Cuts have Shrunk Daily Route Capacity from 630 to Less than 300 Passengers  Sent Ticket Prices Spiraling to as High as  1400  and Left Central New Yorkers Jam Packed on Small Aircrafts   Syracuse to Atlanta Route is Vital to Stoking Region s Economic Rebound and Serving the 1 8 Million Central New Yorkers who Rely on Hancock Airport   After Setting up Next Week s M With Delta AirLinesservice between Syracuse  NY and Atlanta   GA  plagued bydecreased capacity and skyrocketing fares  today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer called on the airlines CEO GeraldGrinstein to upgrade air service between the two cities  Schumer citedthe airlines recent service cuts between the two cities that have left passengers paying between  900 and  1 400 to fly on small  uncomfortable aircraft  and could potentially hamperCentral New York seconomic growth    In a personal letter sent to CEO Grinstein  Schumer requested that Delta provideaffordable  regular and reliable air service to the national hub  Atlanta  for Central New Yorkers  Schumer also assisted in arranging a meeting scheduled for next week betweenthe MDA Mayor Driscoll and executives from Delta AirLines to discuss improvingserviceand reducing fares between Syracuse  and Atlanta andimprove overall relationship between Delta and Hancock International Airport    In recent years  service between Syracuse and Atlanta has deteriorated to such a level that passengers are paying through the nose just to be sandwiched on to small  uncomfortableplanes  said Senator Schumer  This is a major route formany of the1 8million passengerswho useHancock Airportevery year  And its vital to business travelers and to the revitalization of the regions economy  Central New Yorkers need and deserve reliable andaffordable air service to a major hub like Atlanta   Delta is a long standing provider of reliable air service at Syracuse  and I look forward to meeting with Delta officials and working towards a solution that benefits both the airline and its Syracuse passengers  said Mayor Driscoll  Atlanta has always been a top destination for the business traveler  and I am optimistic that we can discuss what options are available to the Syracuse market    These fares must change to be more competitive with flights to comparable markets around the country  said Irwin Davis  president  CEO of the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York  I look forward to meeting with Delta to reach a solution that will be mutually beneficial to the airline and travelers between Syracuse and Atlanta   Over the past several years  the quality and frequency ofDelta service between Syracuse and Atlanta has substantially declined  leaving passengers with fewer options and higher ticket prices  In 2005  Delta operated 5 flights a day to Atlanta  four of the flights were served by MD 80 aircraft which have a capacity of 142people  the fifth flight was served by a 70 seat flight regional jet  giving the route a total capacity of 638people per day  Tickets were generally priced between  500 600 roundtrip  a price that  while expensive  fit within budget for business travelers   By 2006  Delta wasoperating5 flights a day  but instead using smaller  less comfortable planes  which reduced the overall daily service between the two cities to 400 people  Making matters worse beginning Friday of this week Delta will further scale back service by using four 50 seat regional jets and one 70 foot plane to fly the route  This new schedule eliminatesthe one MD 80 still making the trip andtrimsthe total daily capacity to270passengers    Further burdening passengers is the fact that average prices for the route now ranges from  900 to  1400  Senator Schumer added  Its absurd that the short flight between Syracuse and Atlanta can be more expensive than flying to London  Hawaii or Hong Kong    In recent years  job growth in Syracuse has increased faster than the national average due to the strength of the regions budding technology  bioscience and financial services sectors  For many new and existing businesses flying out from Hancock  Atlanta is a critical business destination  A recent survey by the MDA found that 64  of respondents rated Atlanta as an important or highly important destination for their business  Located just minutes from downtown Syracuse  the airport serves 1 8 million travelers inacatchment area inCentral New York    Today  Senator Schumer called on Delta CEO Grinstein to reverse the cut backs in service between the two cities and work to provide Central New Yorkers with affordable  regular and quality air service to Atlanta  In his letter to the CEO  Schumer wrote  In recent years  thelevel of servicebetween these two cities has decreased  the size of the aircraft flying the routecut back  and the fares raised  These cut backs represent an unnecessary burden to Central New York travelers and have limited economic growth in Central New York    Schumer also worked to arrange a meeting next week betweenMayor Driscoll the MDA and executives from Delta Airlines to discuss improving the overall relationships between Delta and Hancock International Airport    Rochester  a similarly sized city 65 miles to the west of Syracuse    had cheaper fares to Atlanta and 44 000 emplanements in the 3rd Quarter of 2006  Over the same period  Syracuse had only 21 000emplanementsand chargedmuch more expensive fares  a strong indication that many Syracuse based air travelersaredriving to Rochester to take advantage of the cheaper fares
