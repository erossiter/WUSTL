IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 21  2006 Schumer  Menendez  Weiner Demand National Parks Service Reopen The Statue Of Liberty By July 4th                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Lady Liberty was Closed Following 9 11 and Has Only Been Reopened at the Base   Schumer to Offer Amendment to Immigration Bill to Reopen the Statue of Liberty if Interior  Parks Department Don  t Immediately Guarantee Opening Date Today Senator Charles E  Schumer  Senator Robert Menendez and Congressman Anthony Weiner called on the National Parks Service to reopen the Statue of Liberty by July 4th  Lady Liberty was shut down  like other monuments following September 11th and has since only been partially reopened  Visitors are still prohibited from climbing up to the Crown  one of the monument  s most popular attractions         America  s symbol of freedom has sadly become a symbol of fear     Schumer said    When I was a child my father would take us up to the crown  and I would stare  on my tiptoes  to what I thought were the ends of this earth  It is time that we reopen this beacon of hope            To simply say that you can go visit the island and pat Lady Liberty s toes is not enough   said Rep  Weiner   The National Parks Service should heed the will of Congress and the desires of Americans  and restore the Statue of Liberty to her full glory by Independence Day            The Statue of Liberty is close to the hearts of many Americans  including myself     Menendez said    Countless Americans have taken their children up to the crown to see the magnificent view of the harbor  but no American has been able to share that experience since 9 11  In 2004  the National Park Service declared the Statue open again  but they only opened the island and the pedestal  I believe the Interior Department needs to fully reopen the Statue of Liberty to the public          The Statue of Liberty closed on September 11  2001  and Liberty Island remained closed for 100 days  After airport type metal detectors were installed to screen visitors boarding ferries from Lower Manhattan  the US Parks Service reopened Liberty Island in December 2001  The number of visitors to Liberty Island had dropped precipitously since before the attacks  mostly because tourists had only been allowed around the perimeter of Lady Liberty and have been prohibited from entering the statue itself       On August 3  2004 the Statue of Liberty re opened for first time since 9 11  but visitors were and continue to be restricted to the Statue  s base and still aren  t able to climb the 354 steps to the Statue s crown  Instead  only the observation deck on the Statue  s pedestal were opened  Visitors can view the Statue s interior framework through a glass ceiling portal  but they cannot actually enter the Statue  While the observation deck is 150 feet  approximately 16 stories  above the water line  it is near the base of the statue and does not offer anything like the view from the top of the Statue        Schumer today said that if the National Park Service doesn  t give them am immediate guarantee of an opening date by Independence Day  he will offer an amendment to the Immigration bill while it is on the floor of the United States Senate or in conference to have the statue reopened by an act of Congress         The bottom line is that it  s been too long for the entire statue to not be fully open  NPS  s foot dragging has gotten us nothing but a view of Lady Liberty  s toes  and it  s not good enough     Schumer said    I  m going to fight tooth and nail to make sure we get this done          Schumer  Menendez and Weiner today sent letters to the Interior Department the National Park Service  demanding that the Statue of Liberty is reopened by July 4th of this year  with new and improved security precautions  In their letter to Interior Nominee Dick Kempthorne and Director Fran Mainella they wrote    For countless immigrants who sailed into New York harbor  Lady Liberty was their first encounter with a country who valued democracy and freedom over tyranny and repression  Since the terror attacks of 9 11  visitors have been prohibited from climbing the 354 steps that lead from the base of the Statue of Liberty to her crown  I am asking you implement the necessary security protocols needed to re open this American treasure by the 4th of July  2006          In August  2004  Schumer and Wiener called for improved security measures so the entire Statue of Liberty    not just the statue base  would be accessible  They called for using the TSA Do Not Fly lists to screen all visitors  These TSA list is currently used to pre screen White House pre checks potential tour guests  They renewed their call for the security mechanism today
