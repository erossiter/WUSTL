Evacuations   New York Metropolitan Region  s Freight Rail Infrastructure is Archaic and Deteriorating   Lacks Structural Review and Strict Age Limits for HAZMAT Rail Cars   Schumer Will Reintroduce Comprehensive Rail Safety Bill  an Two days after a freight train car carrying 30 000 gallons of propane was derailed in Maspeth  Queens  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer warned that more potentially lethal accidents could occur if the federal government doesn  t move quickly to improve freight rail infrastructure in the New York metropolitan area and across the country  Schumer today announced he will reintroduce in the 110th Congress his bi partisan Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  comprehensive rail safety and security legislation  which would direct millions of dollars in new funding to improve rail infrastructure  Schumer also called for a Federal Railroad Administration  FRA  investigation into rail security in the Maspeth area which has a history of rail safety trouble          On Tuesday  communities in Queens and Long Island dodged a bullet when a freight train car carrying 30 000 gallons of propane derailed     said Senator Schumer    This potentially disastrous incident was just the latest example of the federal government being asleep at the switch when it comes to rail security  With trains carrying dangerous chemicals rumbling through New York City and Long Island  we need a real plan for rail security  and penalties with real bite for railroad companies who disregard our safety          Tuesday morning a freight train car carrying 30 000 gallons of liquefied propane gas was derailed at the Fresh Pond Junction yard in Maspeth  Queens  The car was derailed after the train  s brakes failed as an operator reversed the train  Fire officials evacuated approximately 150 businesses and homes in the area  The freight train is operated by the Glendale based New York   Atlantic Railway and the shipment of 30 000 gallons of liquefied propane was slated to be delivered to AmeriGas in Wyandanch  New York        On Tuesday  New York State also experienced a second dangerous derailment when thirteen cars on a C S X train jumped the tracks in the village of East Rochester  While there were no reported injuries  at least two motorists were nearly hit by falling trailers that were dislodged from their train cars  According to Federal Railroad Administration statistics  there were 63 rail accidents  30 derailments  14 casualties and 383 total injuries last year nationwide       Schumer said these incidents were just the latest results of inadequate safety precautions that place hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near rail lines at risk  He announced that he will reintroduce his bipartisan comprehensive railroad legislation that he wrote after the deadly Graniteville  South Carolina rail disaster in 2004  Schumer  s legislation  the Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act  co sponsored by Senator Lindsey O  Graham  R SC   sets tougher minimum and maximum fines for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology  The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and requires the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents       Senator Schumer also called for the FRA to investigate safety concerns in the Maspeth  Queens area  which has a history of rail security problems  On March  10  2004  a runaway LIRR train at the Maspeth Fresh Pond Yard rolled freely for two miles  crashing through several street crossings  destroying cars and injuring four people  two critically  The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the accident occurred after workers failed to secure a hand brake on the unattended 125 ton train       Schumer noted that current rail safety measures and the prevalence of manual switches along rail lines provide inadequate protection for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living near the state  s 3 695 miles of freight rail tracks  Manual switches were blamed for the deadly 2005 Graniteville  South Carolina derailment where chlorine leaked from the rail yard into the neighboring community        Schumer  s bill sets strict age restrictions for cars carrying hazardous materials by requiring every car be inspected and upgraded every fifteen years  In addition  all rail cars fifteen years or older that are currently in use must be inspected and brought up to federal code within one year  Schumer  s legislation would also create a new infrastructure grant program that would authorize  50 million in federal funding to complete vital infrastructure improvements
