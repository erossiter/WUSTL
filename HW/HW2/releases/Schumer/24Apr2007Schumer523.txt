IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 24  2007 As Stewart Soars  Schumer Reveals TSA Still Won t Send The Airport The Screeners And Security Equipment It Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 With Passenger Traffic Set to More Than Triple  Stewart Still Has At Least 20 Fewer Screeners Than It Needs   and Not One Automatic Baggage Screening Machine     Senator Calls on TSA to Immediately Fill Vacant Screener Slots and Provide New High Speed Screening Systems to Reduce Already Growing Lines   Schumer  TSA Still Doesn t Get It                                             U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  still refuses to send Stewart Airport the passenger screeners and baggage scanning equipment it needs to prevent growing security lines from crippling the airport  Schumer said passenger traffic could more than triple over the next year thanks to surging growth from new JetBlue and AirTran service  Right now  the airport still must screen checked baggage manually and does not have a single high volume bag screening machine  Because of a shortage of screeners and equipment  airport officials are concerned that screening personnel levels will not be enough to accommodate the new the flights     TSA still doesn t get it   they are skimping on screeners and state of the art baggage equipment for Stewart   Schumer said   Stewart Airport is on the rise  but if the TSA doesn t send the personnel and equipment it needs to efficiently process passengers  Stewart s wings may just get clipped  The federal government should support the airport  not hold it back  I have been proud to lead the fight to put Stewart on a path for growth and will hold TSA s feet to the fire until this situation is resolved     Schumer today revealed that the airport doesn t even have an automatic baggage screening system in place  forcing every piece of checked luggage to be screened by hand  Using hand held explosive trace detectors  ETD   screeners can process  at most  only 31 bags per hour  However  during peak hours these days at Stewart  Schumer said that several hundred bags will move through screening  This labor intensive process requires the airport to shift workers from passenger screening to bag screening duties  As a result  Stewart airport frequently only has the resources to operate one passenger line         Given its growth  TSA should provide Stewart with cutting edge baggage machines  not leave it stuck in the dark ages manually searching bags and causing unnecessary waits  It is absurd and unacceptable that this can be done quicker and safer  and yet TSA has failed to act   said Schumer       Schumer said that Stewart airport must have the proper technology to make this process as quick and efficient as possible  Airport officials have determined that a set of machines able to screen 600 bags an hour would best suit their needs   These machines would not only expedite the screening of baggage  but would free Transportation Security Officers  TSO s  to perform other functions in the airport  like screening additional passengers      Schumer said that TSA has a remarkably poor track record in keeping pace with Stewart s steady growth  In January  when Stewart officials requested that the number of full time equivalent TSOs be increased from 30 to 52  the TSA actually cut their staffing to 24 TSOs  This decision was reversed soon after and Stewart s allocation was raised to 35 3 after Schumer personally lobbied TSA Administrator Kip Hawley      Unfortunately  this level of staffing still falls far short of Stewart s needs   Factoring in days off  vacation time and sick leave  Stewart officials report that they only have 30 TSOs on duty during any given week   This personnel allocation has caused delays during peak morning hours and has forced the airport to restrict airlines from allowing flights to take off after 7 30 pm in the evening         This troublingly low level of service has persisted despite remarkable growth in passengers flying into and out of the airport  Over 190 000 boarded planes departing from Stewart in the first three months of this year  up from 52 000 in 2006    By years end  the airport expects to emplane between 475 000 525 000 people  3 times more than the 154 000 air travelers who boarded airplanes at Stewart in 2006  The total number of people using the airport is expected to increase from 310 000 last year to 900 000 this year  This growth is poised to continue   Delta recently announced new service at Stewart Airport that will commence in May of this year and existing carriers are looking to expand their service        The lack of adequate personnel has become so acute that during the busy morning hours  the line for passenger screening is literally out the door   Airports in the region with comparable passenger volume to Stewart have TSO levels that far exceed theirs        In his letter to Administrator Hawley  Schumer wrote   With an increased number of travelers  new service and already dreadfully long lines  the TSA must act to place at least 52 full time equivalent TSOs at the airport as soon as possible     In just the last few months  Stewart has welcomed brand new service from two national low cost carriers   On December 19  JetBlue began the first roundtrip flights to Ft  Lauderdale and Orlando  and on January 5 expanded to two round trips  plus one round trip to West Palm Beach  In October  AirTran announced its new service will provide two daily roundtrips to Atlanta  which is AirTran s hub  and one daily around trip each to Orlando  Ft  Lauderdale and Tampa
