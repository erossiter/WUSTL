IMMEDIATE RELEASE  February 7  2005 Schumer  Meat Axe Slashes Federal Budget   Cuts Core Out Of Big Apple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Early Schumer Analysis Reveals Slashes Programs Up and Down the Line    Medicaid  COPS  Housing  AMTRAK  Heating Assistance   Community Development Gutted 48 Education Programs Terminated for Unprecedented  4 3 Billion Cut    Even One Bright Spot for NY is Dim    Homeland Security Percentage Goes Up  But Overall Dollars Go Down US Senator Charles E  Schumer today said that the Bush Administration  s budget proposal for fiscal year 2006 would slash a number of key programs relied on by New Yorkers  The Administration s failure to provide dollars for Medicaid  local law enforcement  housing  heating assistance  education  and key economic programs falls way short of what is needed  Vice President Dick Cheney said this weekend that the Administration didn  t take a meat axe to the federal budget this year    Senator Schumer disagrees          This is the worst budget for New York that I  ve seen in my 25 years in the Congress    it cuts the core out of the Big Apple  and leaves scraps for the neediest Americans across the board     Schumer said        If this isn  t a Federal meat axe to the budget  I don  t know what it is   Schumer said   The Administration slashes programs to help the elderly  children  students  and the sick  From Medicaid to dozens of educational programs  from home heating assistance to Amtrak  this budget breaks promises to New Yorkers and to the entire country  It is now up to the Congress to make sure that ideological cuts to critical programs survive this budget meat axe          The following is a breakdown of some key programs and how the Bush Administration  s budget proposal would impact New York  according to an early analysis by Schumer  s office       Medicaid  The Administration s budget includes  60 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending  Although the total impact on New York State cannot be calculated until the details of the proposals are available and analyzed  if cuts are applied according to the proportion of total federal funding each state currently receives  New York would lose upwards of  7 6 billion in federal Medicaid funds over the next 10 years  Based on a preliminary analysis of the specific areas that the Administration has targeted for cuts  however  Schumer estimates that annually  over  1 billion in federal Medicaid funds to New York are at risk  This represents nearly 5  of the  20 3 billion in federal Medicaid funding New York received in 2003       Schumer stated    This sharp decrease in federal Medicaid funding shifts even more responsibility for providing Medicaid services to New York State and our 62 counties  With cuts at the state level already announced  New York  s hospitals and those in need of health care may are the first to bear the brunt of this heartless budget        Homeland Security  There are three major streams of Homeland Security funding that are vital to New York s fight against crime and terrorism    funds for State and Local First Responders  and grants to High Threat Urban Areas  and grants for Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention  In FY05  these three program categories received  2 7 billion  in FY06 the Administration proposes to reduce that overall funding to  2 62 billion       The Grants to State and Local First Responders is comprised of the Basic Formula Grant Program  These monies are allocated according to guidelines of the USA PATRIOT Act   a funding formula which requires a mandatory minimum of 0 75 percent to each state  over 40 percent of the total   In past years  the DHS Secretary has then divided the remaining 60 percent of the funding by population  a funding formula that is unfair to both large states and high threat areas  In FY 2005  the three programs received  1 1 billion in funds  The Administration proposes to reduce the funding for these programs in FY 2006 to  1 02 billion  However  they propose reducing the per state minimum to 0 25 percent  which would greatly benefit New York and other large population and high threat states  Furthermore  the Administration proposes distributing the rest of the funds according to threat       The High Threat Urban Area program  officially known as the Urban Area Security Initiative program  provides more targeted funds areas at greater risk of terrorist attacks  This money is also allocated among urban areas solely at the discretion of the DHS Secretary  In FY 2005  High Threat Urban Areas received  1 2 billion  including  208 million for New York City and  7 2 million for Buffalo   In FY 2006  the Administration has proposed  1 62 billion for the program    1 02 for grants to urban areas and  600 million for infrastructure protection grants       Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grant Program received  400 million in FY05  In FY06  the Administration zeroes out the program s line item and instead carves out 20 percent of the above grants fund the program  for a total of  408 million  But  again  that  408 is not new funds  just a carve out of existing funds       COPS Program  While reducing the overall amount granted from the President  s budgetary authority from  378 million to  117 million  this overall 69  cut in the COPS program funding will have disastrous effects for state and local law enforcement  The President  s budget completely eliminates two vital discretionary spending programs  both the COPS hiring program and the COPS Interoperable Communications Technology  Other drastic cuts include a 62  proposed reduction in anti Methamphetamine grants from  52 6 million to  20 million  Both the Safe Schools program and the Law Enforcement Technology program are also zeroed out in the President  s 2006 budget  This budget represents across the boards dramatic cuts for many programs essentially to our state and local law enforcement officers and vital to the security of our nation       FIRE GRANTS  For the second year in a row  the President has proposed significant cuts to the FIRE program  calling a  215 million reduction from  715 million in FY2005 to  500 million in FY2006  The FIRE program sends money directly to local fire departments to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public and firefighting personnel facing  Funding is available for activities such as hiring additional firefighting personnel  specialized emergency response training for situations like terrorist attacks  the creation of wellness and fitness programs for firefighters  equipment and facility upgrades  and fire prevention programs  So far this year  under the 2004 FIRE program  346 New York fire departments have secured over  25 5 million  exact number is  25 574 633  million in FIRE grants    9million less than the total amount received the year before  Schumer helped write the original legislation creating the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program in 2001 and also played a central role in preventing the Bush Administration from eliminating funding for the program from the 2001 budget         The Administration can  t continue to nickel and dime our first responders because they are our front lines in the war on terror   Schumer said        Education  The Administration s budget proposal once again fails to raise education spending to the levels promised by Congress in both the landmark No Child Left Behind legislation and the recently reauthorized Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  In addition  the President s proposals reduce or eliminate 48 other important education programs  including vocational education  the safe schools program  and Perkins Loans       IDEA  In the 28 year history of IDEA  the federal funding contribution has always fallen far short of the full congressional commitment  The President s FY 2005 budget request is no exception  calling only for an increase of  508 million  Three months after signing the IDEA Improvement Act  the President has ignored the law by under funding the IDEA by  3 6 billion below the FY06 authorized level  The President s proposed increase of  508 million would only fund IDEA at 18 6 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for educating students with disabilities   still less than half of the 40 percent  full funding  promised by Congress when the law was enacted 30 years ago  Schumer estimates that New York s share of the program would increase only  30 million over the FY05 level   from about  701 million to  731 million in FY06  This is   219 million short of the increase called for in the reauthorization of the law  and  752 million short of fulfilling Congress s  full funding  promise  Under the President s FY06 budget  New York City would see an increase of only  11 million   from  250 million in FY05 to  261 million in FY06  This is  78 million short of levels set forth in the new law and  269 million short of 40   full funding  levels        NCLB Title I  Title I Grants to local educational agencies are the largest component of the NCLB legislation and are designed to help raise student achievement in the most impoverished communities  Under the President s proposal  Schumer estimates that New York s share of the program would increase by only  61 million over the FY05 level   from  1 232 billion in FY05 to  1 293 billion in FY06  This increase falls far short of fully funding the No Child Left Behind Act   shortchanging New York State by  947 million compared to the level set in the law   and fails to reach all students who are eligible for the program  Under the President s plan  New York City s funding would increase by only  40 million   from approximately  804 million in FY05 to  844 million in FY06    615 million less than what New York City is promised under the law  Under the President s plan  over 269 648 children in New York State will not receive promised Title I services        Terminated programs  The Bush budget eliminates 48 programs  for a total of  4 3 billion  They include education technology state grants   496 million   GEAR UP   306 5 million   Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities State Grants   437 4 million   selected TRIO programs   457 5 million   Even Start   225 million   and all the vocational education programs   1 3 billion   Continuation costs for grantees that received awards through GEAR UP and the TRIO programs in previous years   a total of  682 8 million   comprise more than half of the proposed  1 24 billion High School Intervention program  described below        New York receives millions in funding from many of the programs every year which would be terminated in FY2006 under the budget proposal  For example  New York is slated to receive  45 2M in Educational Technology State Grants and  33 5 million in Safe and Drug Free Schools State Grants in FY2005   both of which are NCLB programs that would be eliminated  In addition  New York will receive  2 5 million for Byrd Honor Scholarships in FY2005   60 1 million in Vocational Education State Grants and  5 3 million in Tech Prep Education State Grants   all of which would be terminated for FY2006   The complete list of programs slated for termination is at the end        Perkins Loans  Proposed phasing out the Federal Perkins Loan program   a critical source of financial aid for thousands of New York college students  For the 2002 2003 school year  66 881 New York students received Perkins Loans worth an estimated  128 million  A Federal Perkins Loan is a low interest  5 percent  loan for both undergraduate and graduate students with demonstrated financial need       Schumer continued    From Perkins Loans to Pell Grants the Administration is penny wise and pound foolish  As the cost of college tuition and textbooks far surpass the rise of inflation  we need to be giving every student a fair shot at higher education  not ripping the rug out from under those who rely on this critical aid to pay their way through college          AMTRAK  For FY06  the Administration continues their mission to eliminate national passenger rail service by proposing to end all federal subsidies for Amtrak s operating expenses  leaving just  360 million for the Surface Transportation Board to maintain the commuter rail infrastructure along the Northeast Corridor  In recent years  the Administration has tried to reduce Amtrak s funding  proposing  900 million in FY05  which Congress increased to  1 2 billion  Without substantial funding  Amtrak will be forced to declare bankruptcy and shut down  closing down the Northeast Corridor  Empire Corridor and all other intercity train routes across the country  This would have a devastating effect on the economy of New York State and the entire Northeastern United States  In 2004  more than 10 3 million passengers rode Amtrak in New York State  including 8 3 million either departing or arriving New York City s Penn Station  The President s proposal to eliminate Amtrak s subsidy would literally force service to shut down  cutting off this vital transportation lifeline for millions of commuters and visitors  clogging our highways and airways  and costing the New York economy millions of dollars       Housing Community Development Programs   CDBG   The Administration has proposed to move the Department of Housing and Urban Development  s Community Planning and Development Block Grant Program  CDBG  and 17 other community development programs to the Commerce Department  including myriad rural programs  The funding available though this combination of 18 programs in its proposed form equals less than the entire CDBG funding level for FY05  In FY05 the total of the programs combined was approximately  5 billion   4 7 billion for CDBG  The combined program will have  3 7 billion  a whopping 34 5  cut  Last year  New York received  393 million in CDBG funding  New York City received  207 million  in FY06 they would receive no funds  Under the new proposal  the entitlement status the program has held for more than 30 years would no longer exist and New York would now have to compete against the rest of the country for the available  3 7 billion        The 18 economic development programs slated for elimination in the budget have funded a number of grants and projects in NYS in FY 04  These programs have funded a number of grants and projects in NYS in FY2004  all of which could be in jeopardy in future years under the President s new plan  This creates a block grant program which will fund numerous types of grants   from agriculture to banking to Indian Tribes  takes the expertise and attention that was given to these important programs in the five separate Agencies that previously funded and ran the programs  and lumps them all into a big under funded program        NY State received approximately 23 grants  totaling  8 224 000 in FY2004 within the Economic Development Administration s program  Dept of Commerce      NY State Economic Development Funded Under Eliminate Programs            City of Oswego got  50 000 from the Rural Business Opportunity Grants program  Dept of Agriculture       Mohawk Indian Housing Corporation got  544 470 for a housing services facility from the Economic Impact Grants program Dept of Agriculture       Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi got  106 200 through the Bank Enterprise Award Program  the CDFI Fund  Dept of Treasury       Carver Federal Savings Bank got  1 500 000 through the Bank Enterprise Award Program  the CDFI Fund  Dept of Treasury       Community Capital Bank got  1 500 000 through the Bank Enterprise Award Program  the CDFI Fund  Dept of Treasury       First American International Bank got  1 500 000 through the Bank Enterprise Award Program  the CDFI Fund  Dept of Treasury       Mizuho Corporate bank got  199 958 through the Bank Enterprise Award Program  the CDFI Fund  Dept of Treasury       Akwesasne Housing Authority got  64 5000 through CFDI Native Initiatives program  Dept of Treasury       NY state received approximately 23 grants  totaling  8 224 000 in FY2004 within the Economic Development Administration s program  Dept of Commerce       CDFI   Community Development Financial Institutions Fund will get only enough money to administer existing grants  but no money for new grants  Under this proposal  funding for the competitive grant programs administered by the CDFI Fund   the Financial Assistance  Technical Assistance  Bank Enterprise Award and Native American Initiatives programs   would be eliminated  For every  1 the CDFI Fund s Financial Assistance program awards to New York   21 in private sector investments are generated for economic development in low income communities  this would no longer happen under the new proposal       Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities  Section 811     The Administration has proposed to cut the Housing for Person with Disabilities by close to 50   the second largest cut to the entire HUD budget next to CDGB  In FY06  the program would receive  119 million received down significantly from last year appropriation of  238 million  Nationally  the Disabled Housing program is responsible for developing approximately 1 400 new units of rental housing and funds approximately 1 600 five year tenant based rental assistance vouchers for persons with disabilities each year  New York State public housing authorities  PHAs  and non profit organizations operate 1 200 programs  Under the new proposal  New York organizations are expected to receive at most   half of their FY05 allocation    it is unclear if that amount will be enough to renew all existing rental assistance vouchers  But is it certain that under the new proposal  organizations would not be able to develop any new units of rental housing       HOPE VI    The Administration has once again proposed to terminate the HOPE VI program that rehabilitates and restores severely distressed public housing projects  For the past 3 years the Administration has proposed to eliminate HOPE VI  In FY05 the program was funded by the Congress at a  120 million level making available 6 grants for the entire United States  In addition to proposing to eliminate the HOPE VI program  the Administration also proposed to rescind  143 million of previously allocated funding  Currently  New York has 15 HOPE VI projects    all of which could possibly be in jeopardy of getting their funding rescinded        HOPWA    The Administration s budget proposes  268 million for the Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS  HOPWA  program  a 5  cut from the FY  05 appropriation  and a cut of over 9  from the original FY  05 budget request  If enacted  HOPWA s funding would be at its lowest level since FY 2001  Based on distribution from FY  05  New York City stands to lose just under  1 5 million  while the New York State program would be cut by almost  100 000       Section 8   Although Section 8 funding for tenant vouchers remained level in the FY06 proposal  New York public housing authorities are already starting from an FY05 budget deficit  In FY05  New York City received  50 million less than needed to fund existing vouchers  The Administration continues to fail to account for inflation  including rent and utility cost increases  While tenant vouchers are the larger of the two types of Section 8 offered  it is important to note that Project Based Section 8 was decreased by  266 million       Schumer stated   In their continuing war against urban America  the Administration wants to cut CDBG which provides critical economic development and business creation for America s hardest hit communities        Veterans Health Care  The President s budget virtually freezes funding for veterans healthcare despite rising healthcare costs and increasing demand for VA services as a result of U S  military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq  The Budget provides  28 9 billion for veterans healthcare  a slightly less than  800 million increase over last year  This increase pales in comparison to the  1 billion increase required merely to keep up with inflation and payroll adjustments in order to maintain current service levels  As a result  veterans   health care will be short by a little more than  200 million and service could decline  Based on previous funding levels for New York s veterans   heath care networks  the President s budget would shortchange New York veterans almost  13 million needed to simply maintain current service levels  The Albany veterans   health care network that covers upstate would be short over an estimated  4 million and the Bronx network that covers New York City Long Island would be short over an estimated  8 million  In addition to these cuts  the President  s budget would place increased burdens on certain veterans by more than doubling the monthly co payment for prescription drugs from  7 to 15 and charging a  250   user fee    to for the use of VA health services       Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program  The President s FY2006 budget proposal would reduce funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program  MEP   which has helped over 1 400 manufacturing companies in upstate New York stay afloat  by 57  from  117 million in FY2005 to only  46 8 million  The MEP program provides consulting and training services to small to medium size manufacturing companies to help them stay afloat  In New York  the MEP program is credited with creating 625 and retaining 2 041 jobs in New York  increasing sales by  46 million  and realizing  13 million in cost savings for participating companies in 2003 alone         Ryan White HIV AIDS Program  The budget funds Ryan White CARE Act programs  which provide vital assistance for those living with AIDS  at the same levels as last year  The only program that receives any increase at all is the AIDS Drug Assistance Program  ADAP  which helps purchase drug treatments for AIDS patients and which the budget has raised funding for by a mere 1 3   which will likely raise New York s share to only  126 7 million from  125 million  This is completely insufficient given that the number of people living with AIDS in New York is rising so quickly that it has doubled in the last nine years       Northern Border Transportation Security  The President s 2006 budget recommends a  1 million increase in Personnel Compensation for Customs and Border Protection  from  13 million to  14 million  But  when you read the fine print  this increase does not allow for any additional Full Time Equivalent Employees  FTEs    the number of FTEs at CBP has been frozen at 474 since 2004  We are still drastically under the number of total agents needed to staff the Northern Border  Meanwhile  the President has proposed moving the US VISIT program  which is currently a stand alone program under the Border and Transportation Security program  to a newly created Office of Screening Coordination and Operations account  Last year the USVISIT program was funded at  340 million  The newly created Office of Screening Coordination and Operations program was recommended to be funded at  526 million  It is unclear how much of this funding will be spent on the US Visit Program at this time        Trade Adjustment Assistance  The President s FY2006 budget proposal would also dramatically reduce funding for Trade Adjustment Assistance  TAA   a federal program that provides aid to workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages are reduced as a result of increased imports  Under the proposal  Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits would be decreased by  95 million    from  750 million in FY2005 to  655 million in FY2006  Even at current funding levels TAA cannot meet the needs of New York workers negatively impacted by increased imports and there is currently a waiting list for companies seeking these benefits for their workers  TAA provides training for employment in another job or career  weekly cash payments called trade readjustment allowances  TRA  as well as job search and relocation allowances   LIHEAP  Despite high energy prices and recent cold snaps that have necessitated the release of emergency funds  the Budget actually calls for a cut of  80 million  or 4 3  in regular funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  from what was appropriated last year  LIHEAP is a block grant that gives low income households financial help to offset the costs of heating and or cooling their homes  There are over 785 000 households that receive LIHEAP funds in New York  Under this cut  New York stands to receive over  10 million less in funding and may be forced to curtail benefits or reduce the number of people eligible for assistance         Cutting the Low Income Home Energy Assistance  LIHEAP  program is wrong headed and inappropriate  especially as the OPEC cartel continues to jack up oil prices and tip American consumers upside down   Schumer said          Education Programs that will be Terminated in the FY 2006
