                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Ancient  Insufficient Sewage Capacity Polluting  Long Island s Waterways  Closing Local Beaches  Stifling New Housing  and Threatening Region s Economic Health   With Summer Season Kicking Off  Schumer to Announce 4 Point Plan to Boost Federal Funding For Sewage Infrastructure to Keep the Beaches Open and the Water Clean   Maxed Out Sewage System Also Worsens LI Housing Crisis  P With federal funding at an all time low as Long Island faces a wastewater infrastructure crisis  today Senator Charles E  Schumer announced a plan to get federal funding to modernize Long Islands archaic sewage system  With inadequate and insufficient sewage capacity polluting waterways  closing beaches  and stifling new housing Schumer said that the outmoded infrastructure posed a tremendous threat to the economic health of the region   Sadly  over the past decades the federal government has retreated from its responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and other legislation to be a full partner with state and local government to maintain first rate water treatment systems  In this instance  local officials have been very active  but now we need the full resources and capabilities of the federal government to get this situation under control  said Senator Schumer   If we are to preserve our environment  build residential housing for our next generation of workers  and embark on commercial development to sustain our economic well being  significant capital investment in our sewer infrastructure is a fundamental need  said Michael J  Deering  Vice President of the Long Island Association  The LIA commends Senator Schumer for his actions to move the federal government forward in helping to finance improvements and expansions to sewer systems here on LI and throughout the state  It is an investment that is integral and will protect our fresh and marine waters  strengthen our economy  improve our health  and enhance our quality of life   Beach closings  waters closed to shell fishing  sewage flooding our basements after rain events  or contaminated drinking water are all examplesthat sewage pollution adversely impacts our health and environment  InNew York State  sewage is especially problematic due to aging infrastructure and scarce funding resources  said Adrienne Esposito  Executive Director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment  Our sewage woes are just beginning  Federal funding for assisting local municipalities to upgrade our sewageplants  capacity and treatment levels is imperative to avoid adversepublic health and economic impacts   Suffolk  as one of the states most populous counties  has a wastewater system similar to that of a rural area despite having 25 times the population  While nationally  only one in four households relies on cesspools or septic systems to dispose of sewage  in Suffolk a staggering three out of four households rely on on site wastewater treatment  comprising nearly 350 000 households  Similarly  in 1990 when federal subsidies for building public sewer systems ran  almost 80  of New York State and 92  of Nassaus households were served by public sewer systems  but just 28  of Suffolks were  To make matters worse  80  of Suffolks septic systems and cesspools predate county sanitary codes enacted in 1981  governing minimum land allowance and standards for nitrates in drinking water  Consequently  each day households flush 300 gallons of wastewater into the soil amounting to 112 5 million gallons total in Suffolk  with restaurants generating 30 gallons per seat  per day   Without expansion of wastewater capacity in Suffolk  building and economic development will be stopped in its tracks  In addition  there are serious health concerns from the sewage  including  fish and aquatic life in the water  animals wading in the water  and people who use the water for recreational uses  including swimming  Schumer said   Conversely  while Nassau is largely served by a public sewer system  the county now faces the challenge of updating an again infrastructure that empties into local bays  The countys burgeoning population is also putting a stress on the aged system  which must be adapted to ensure capacity for future development    Both Suffolk and Nassau have been dealing with the fallout of their respective sewer systems  impeded development  suburban sprawl  skyrocketing land prices and beach closures costing local business and government millions  In Suffolk  the impact is most severely felt  where  because of restrictions on waste output per acre  downtown areas are deteriorating  businesses are unable to open or expand in already populated areas  and houses are forced to be built on large tracts of land  sending property costs spiraling upward and communities sprawling outward  Additionally  any large development builder who cant hook up to one of Suffolks existing municipal plants must build their own  adding to skyrocketing construction costs  and dotting Suffolk with some 190 individual plants  compared to Nassaus 12  serving less than a third of Suffolks homes and businesses    Meanwhile  as the summer season opens  both counties are facing another wave of beach closures spurred by pollutants in the water from runoff and contaminated groundwater  Over the last six years  there were well over 1 000 beach closures between the two counties  costing businesses and the local economy millions  Both counties are also faced with the serious effects of groundwater degradation from contaminants leaking into the soil and waterways from leaking treatment plants  pipes and septic tanks  unleashing pathogens and viruses into Long  Islands waterways  affecting local wildlife  fisheries and potentially  drinking water   In light of the drastic decline in federal funding for municipal sewage projects  Schumer today announced his four point plan for addressing Long Islands crippled sewage infrastructure    Schumer will push legislation in the Senate       S 836 The Water Quality Investment Act of 2007  to increase federal      funding for municipal sewage infrastructures by providing funding for      upgrades of sewage treatment plans like Bergen Point in Babylon      or Cedar Creek in Wantagh       It has already passed the House   Schumer announced his support for      H R 720  the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007  which would amend the      Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize appropriations for state      water pollution control revolving funds  This is a  14 billion low      interest loan program for wastewater infrastructure improvements  It was      referred to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in March   Schumer also sent a letter to the Senate      Appropriations Committee urging increased funding for sewage projects       specifically citing the dire needs on Long Island        Schumer finally called on the      Environmental Protection Agency to do a top to bottom review of the aging      system on Long Island and recommend      modernization changes  such as a green infrastructure to reduce water      runoff  and to provide technical assistance to communities interested in      implementing the programs  The request comes in light of a Congressional      Budget Office report that found limited information available at the      national level about existing water infrastructure  and no accessible      inventory of the age and condition of pipes  even for the relatively few      large systems that serve most of the countrys households
