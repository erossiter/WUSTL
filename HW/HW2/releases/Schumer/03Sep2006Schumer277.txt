Should Have 36

at All NY Airports  Final Approval for Funding for Critically Needed New Tower                                                                                                                                                      Today  in light of a recent staffing problem with Air Traffic Controllers in Lexington that led to a tragic accident  and a history of problems LaGuardia airport  s control tower  Senator Charles E  Schumer called for full staffing of the control towers at LaGuardia and airports across the state and called for the Transportation House Senate Appropriations Conference Committee to give final approval for  60 million for a new air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport  Schumer said the new tower will help ease crippling flight delays at the airport and help controllers manage traffic on the runways in order to prevent more near aircraft collisions  Schumer said one of the most dangerous faults with the current tower is the view of certain taxiways is obstructed by the US Airways terminal    Cost cutting is not an effective strategy to manage one of an airport  s most important safety mechanisms     Schumer said    We have seen too many close calls here and just last week  a terrible tragedy  That should be a call for action to the FAA  We need more controllers    not less    to make sure we get the job done safely        In the wake of last week  s accident  Schumer blasted the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  for air traffic controller shortages in Kentucky  the New York City area  and across the country  The investigation into last week  s accident uncovered that only one air traffic controller was on duty at the time of the accident  though the FAA has determined that Bluegrass Airport must have two controllers on duty at all times  Schumer has long believed that continued short staffing and labor strife between the National Association of Air Traffic Controllers  NATCA  and the FAA has created a serious safety situation that  with ever increasing air traffic in New York area  could one day have dire consequences     According to available information  only 2 out of 12 New York State air traffic control towers are fully staffed  The current LaGuardia tower only has 26 fully trained controllers on staff with additional 4 trainees  though 36 are authorized  The New York Terminal Radar Approach Control  TRACON  tower in  Westbury on Long Island  is operating at only 75  of authorized staffing levels  The New York TRACON is responsible for controlling aircraft that arrive and depart from the New York Metropolitan area  one of the largest airspaces in the country  Other airports that are understaffed include JFK  30 out of 36   Islip  18 out of 22  and Newark  31 out of 40   Last week  Senator Schumer called on the FAA to initiate a region wide study all air traffic control towers and their staffing levels in the New York New Jersey area to determine if enough controllers are on duty at all times     In many situations the FAA is unwilling to pay controllers overtime for filling in for a coworker  Due to this policy  air traffic control stations often have to make do with an insufficient number of air traffic controllers   Schumer also pushed today for final approval for  60 million in funding for the long awaited control tower at LaGuardia     Federal funding for a new air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport will guarantee that every step is being taken to provide the best possible airport safety and efficiency measures     said Senator Schumer    Growing at an unprecedented rate and serving 26 million passengers  LaGuardia is a critical transportation hub that needs federal funding to continue developing the technology and upgrades it needs to make all its travelers safer      On July 20th the Senate Appropriations Committee passed of the FY07 Transportation Treasury and HUD Appropriations Bill which included language to approve the funding for the LGA Tower project  Schumer said the House Appropriations Committee must also approve the funding  either through a letter to the FAA or by passing the language as part of the joint Senate House conference committee report on the Appropriations bill before the funding expires at the end of this fiscal year   The LaGuardia tower project started nearly 15 years ago and  with dramatic increases in air traffic projected in the very near future  it is needed now more than ever  The final plan includes a replacement of the aging 42 year old control tower and the ability to install a Category II Instrument Approach  which allows aircraft to land during periods of inclement weather  Overall  the new tower is essential to reduce delays and improve safety on the ground and in the skies  In November 2005  the last month for which data was available  only 62 percent of flights in to LGA arrived and 77 percent left on time   From the current tower  the view of certain taxiways is obstructed by the US Airways terminal  Not having an aircraft in sight visually from the tower compromises the efficiency and the safety of the airport  The current tower at LaGuardia presents many other safety concerns and limitations  The size and capability of the current tower does not permit new equipment to be installed and  as technology is constantly improving  it is imperative that the best available equipment for aviation safety be utilized  As a result of the constant installation and removal of equipment from the roof of the tower and the age of the structure  leaks have developed inside the tower itself  Over the past 2 years  this has lead to the installation of tarps with garden hoses attached in the roof directly above the controller  s heads  Numerous times water has leaked onto the equipment and the controllers  interrupting operations and compromising the safety and efficiency of air traffic operations   There is significant funding available from the Aviation Trust Fund previously set aside for tower projects across the country  However  many of the plans for these towers remain unapproved and the funding unspent  Schumer said that this money must be allocated and used quickly to get the project started
