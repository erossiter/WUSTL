IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 13  2007 Schumer  McMahon Launch Drive To Save Middle Class Mitchell Lama At Castleton Park                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Current bid to buy Castleton Park and remove it from Mitchell Lama program puts tenants  Staten Island in danger of losing affordable  middle class housing   Schumer  Chair of Senate Banking Sub committee  today releases letter to HUD pressing agency to block sale of Castleton Park in light of Island housing crunch  proposed landlord s troubling record   Letter coincides with new Today U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  standing with Councilman Michael McMahon and Assemblyman Matthew Titone  moved to block the sale of Castleton Park  a 454 unit complex in St  George that is one of only two Mitchell Lama developments on Staten Island  The proposed buyout  and the landlord s stated intent to remove the development from the Mitchell Lama program  leaves current tenants vulnerable to skyrocketing rents and would remove an important option for middle class housing for future generations of Staten Island families  Schumer revealed today that HUD has the power to forbid the sale of this critically important middle class housing because of the development s HUD insured mortgage  and urged the agency to do so immediately  Schumer also announced a new push for state legislation that would protect the affordability of Mitchell Lama apartments even after a buyout         Affordable  middle class housing in this city is under attack  and it is high time for HUD and the New York State to put a stop to it  The people who built up these neighborhoods do not deserve to be run out as owners chase the highest bidder  It is even more galling that  in this case  the developer wants the federal government to foot the bill for future profits without committing to protect affordability for current and future tenants   Schumer said   I urge HUD to promptly reject the proposed sale of Castleton Park  and the sale of any other government subsidized affordable housing developments where those developments are needed by hard working  middle class families to maintain their way of life         It is unconscionable that while the tenants at Castleton Park have helped build the community in St  George  they are now under threat of being priced out of their own homes because their neighborhood has become such a desirable place to live   Councilman McMahon said today   I m thrilled that my office has had the opportunity to work with the Castleton Parks Tenants Association since October with strategy and funding on this truly grass roots effort  and look forward to preserving Castleton Park as affordable housing for hard working Staten Islanders for generations to come         I m proud to stand here as a united front with Senator Schumer and Councilman McMahon in our fight to save the fast disappearing availability of middle class housing on Staten Island   Assemblyman Titone said today   We all know that Staten Island is a wonderful place to live  and it s no wonder that we re the fastest growing borough in the City  but as we grow  we must also be sure to preserve the way of life of the residents and communities that make Staten Island as dynamic as it is        Since it was constructed in 1974  Castleton Park has relied on a variety of Federal  State and City subsidies to ensure the development s affordability and upkeep  including Section 8 vouchers and Section 236 rent concessions which subject the development to restrictions on the rental prices of units and the income levels of tenants  Additionally  as a development with a HUD insured mortgage  any prepayment of the mortgage must be approved by HUD  However  under Section 250 of the National Housing Act  HUD may only approve the prepayment if the agency determines that the housing is no longer needed as affordable in that community       Schumer added   The bottom line is that Castleton Park s success is owed in large part to the assistance it received over the years from the Federal  State and City governments  Whether it is the through Section 8 vouchers  this development s HUD subsidized mortgage or a sizable interest rate subsidy  government at every level has been there for Castleton Park  As the chair of the Senate s Housing Subcommittee I will make this promise  we will not walk away in your time of need        Despite the heavy government subsidies pouring into the development  the prospective landlord  Larry Gluck of Stellar Management  clearly stated his intent to remove the development from the Mitchell Lama program by financing the sale through enhanced vouchers which would only apply if a buyout of the Mitchell Lama program were to occur  In his recent acquisitions of Mitchell Lama buildings  Mr  Gluck has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per unit  In light of this  there are serious questions as to whether Mr  Gluck s proposed purchase price can be supported by the restricted rents following any sale        Essentially this owner wants to strip tenants of vital protections  raise the rent and get federal taxpayers to subsidize it  No thanks   said Schumer        Additionally  Mr  Gluck has served as the property manager for Castleton Park since July  In September  the building failed to pass its physical inspection for the first time in years  In surveys conducted by the tenant associations of a dozen other Mitchell Lamas that Mr  Gluck recently bought out  tenants have alleged that rent billing and lease errors are common problems  many reported serious non compliance with environmental safety regulations  and others reported that tenants are commonly threatened with charges for things that are the landlord s responsibility  such as stove and fridge replacement  Mr  Gluck is also reported to have numerous outstanding code violations on the Mitchell Lama buildings that he has purchased in the last several years       In an effort to ensure that Castleton Park remains affordable for the next generation of working families on Staten Island  and to make certain that the tenants will be protected by a suitable landlord in any buyout  Senator Charles E  Schumer today called for HUD to reject the sale of Castleton Park  In his letter to HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson  Schumer pressed the Secretary to reject the proposed prepayment under Section 250 in light of the fact that Staten Island has a dearth of affordable  middle class housing and in response to the revelations of Mr  Gluck s troubling history with other rent stabilized properties       Today Schumer also announced a new push for legislation in the State Assembly  A  795  that would protect Mitchell Lama tenants subject to buyouts under the Emergency Tenant Protection Act  ETPA   ETPA  often known as the rent stabilization program  disallows owners from charging market rate rents by limiting rent increases to those mandated by the rent guidelines board  Tenants living in Mitchell Lama units constructed before 1974 are eligible for ETPA upon buyout  unlike units that were built during or after 1974 such as Castleton   New York City s Department of Housing Preservation and Development estimates that under this bill as many as 19 000 tenants around the city living in post 1974 Mitchell Lamas could be eligible for rent protection if the owners chose to opt out of the Mitchell Lama program
