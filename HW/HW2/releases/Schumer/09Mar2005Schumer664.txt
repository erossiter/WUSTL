IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 9  2005 With NY Gas Prices Approaching Record Highs  Senator Demands President Release Oil Reserves To Drop Gas Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    New  Finds Average Upstate New York Family With 2 Cars Could Pay  255 More For Gas This Year  Schumer To Detail New Steps To Lower Price of Oil    Even though President Has Previously Refused  OPEC  s Recent Outrageous Cuts in Supply and Skyrocketing Gas Prices Demand Imm U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today vowed to fight to lower prices for New Yorkers who are already paying more than 21 cents per gallon more for gas than last year  as analysts warn another 24 cent hike could be just around the corner  Schumer today unveiled a new study showing that the average New York family with two cars is paying  255 more this year than last year and is leading a bipartisan coalition of Senators in calling on the Administration to release stored government oil reserves that would quickly lower gas prices         New Yorkers are being burned by high oil prices to heat their homes and run their cars     Schumer said    If we thought last year was bad  I  m afraid we haven  t seen anything yet  Prices are already two dimes ahead of where they were last year at this time with no end in sight  Today I am asking the President to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because we must do everything possible to lower prices  and tapping the SPR is a proven way to drive down gas prices          On Friday  the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at the nearly record setting level of  53 78  and crude oil has been trading at above  50 per barrel since February 22nd  In addition  the average price at the pump in New York has hit  2 06   already 21 cents higher than it was last year on this date  National average retail gasoline prices have increased by almost  0 07 per gallon over the past week to reach  2 00 and some analysts predict that prices could increase by  0 24 per gallon before gasoline prices fully reflect the recent spike in crude oil prices      Schumer today released a new  showing how much more New Yorkers in each county are paying to for gas over last year  s prices  Specifically  Schumer found that based on the price of gas in each region of the state            This year the average two car family in the Capital Region will pay  308 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in Central New York will pay  265 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the Hudson Valley will pay  188 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the Rochester Finger Lakes area will pay  297 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the North Country will pay  317 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in the Southern Tier will pay  301 above the high prices paid at the pump last year        This year the average two car family in Western New York will pay  241 above the high prices paid at the pump last year       Schumer said today that in spite of the economic threat created by OPEC s market manipulation  the Administration has continued to adhere to its policy of taking oil off of the market and placing it in the SPR  This policy  which further tightens oil markets by taking much needed supplies out of commerce  is slated to take 92 000 barrels per day off of the market during the height of the driving season between April and September despite the fact that the SPR is currently over 97 percent full       Schumer today led a bipartisan coalition of Senators  along with Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine  to urge the Administration to counteract the cartel s supply cuts and calm the markets by deferring deliveries of oil to the SPR and releasing oil from the SPR through a swap  Initiating a swap of oil from the SPR to increase the supply of oil is a proven way to reduce the price of gasoline and heating oil  In the fall of 2000  Schumer successfully convinced the Clinton Administration to swap 30 million barrels over 30 days  causing crude oil prices to quickly fall by over  6 per barrel and wholesale gasoline prices to fall  0 14 per gallon  Under a swap  the federal government could decide on a set quantity of oil to release from the SPR  and accepts bids from private companies for the rights to that oil  The companies would then bid on how much oil they are willing to return to the SPR at a later date  For example  if the federal government decided to release oil and a private company wanted to obtain 10 million barrels  the company could bid for the 10 million barrels by promising 15 million barrels to be returned to the SPR at a later date         Prices at the pump are getting out control  and will get much higher unless something is done to rein them in     Schumer said    Accessing the SPR is not only smart economic policy  it also put money back into the wallets of New Yorkers          Click here to see        Ckick here to view  to Presient Bush
