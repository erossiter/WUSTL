                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Currently No Way to Trace Poultry Contaminated by Feed    Without Tracking  No Way of Knowing if Contaminated Chickens Were Sold to Consumers in Recent Months   Schumer to Reintroduce Bill that Creates Tracking System to Trace Meat and Poultry to Source in Case of Contamination or Outbreak of Disease                                                                                           WASHINGTON   With news that at least 2 5 million chickens in Indiana may have been exposed to contaminated feed  Senator Charles E  Schumer today announced his plan to reintroduce the Meat and Poultry Traceability Act  a bill that would require the Secretary of Agriculture to be able to trace all meat and poultry back to the farms or slaughterhouses where they were raised or slaughtered  Schumer also wrote to Dr  Andrew von Eschenbach  the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Agency  asking him to take urgent action on investigating feed and feed lots at farms to ensure that animals are not being fed contaminated food         In this case  we have been lucky so far that no one has suffered health problems from eating chicken that were given contaminated feed  but we can t rely on luck next time  In the case of an outbreak of disease or contamination in our meat and poultry supplies  we ve got to be able to trace all products back to the farms or slaughterhouses they came from in order to stop an outbreak from harming consumers   Schumer said        Schumer will re introduce the Meat and Poultry Products Traceability and Safety Act to improve the safety of meat and poultry products by enhancing the ability of the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to retrieve the history  use and location of meat and poultry products through a recordkeeping and audit system or registered identification   If meat from a diseased cow were to spread  currently there is no comprehensive system in place from farm to retail to track meat products throughout the country   Schumer s legislation would allow for a meat and poultry trace back system to be set up by USDA so that  in cases where a health safety issue arises because of the presence of a food borne pathogens or disease  such as Mad Cow  E  coli  or salmonella  the meat can be traced from the farm to slaughter to retail  at each point along the food supply chain   This would help prevent other contaminated meat or diseased animals from entering the food supply chain  and assist in recall         Schumer also signed on as a cosponsor to the Pet and Human Food Safety Amendment  an amendment that is expected to pass today  Introduced by Senators Ted Kennedy and Dick Durbin in response to the recent outbreak of contaminated pet food  the amendment will also strengthen food safety standards       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   each year food borne pathogens such as Listeria  E  coli  Salmonella  and Campylobacter are responsible for over 76 million illnesses  more than 300 000 hospitalizations  and 5 000 deaths        In addition  Schumer sent a letter to Commissioner von Eschenbach of the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   the agency in charge of monitoring animal feed   In the letter  Schumer urges the FDA to step up its efforts to monitor feed supplies at farms to prevent a repeat of this frightening episode         Senator Schumer s letter to Commissioner Eschenbach is below      May 2  2007       Dr  Andrew C  von Eschenbach  Commissioner  Food and Drug Administration  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  MD  20857   Dear Dr  von Eschenbach    I write to you today to urge the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  to do everything within its power to more proactively investigate meat and poultry farms so to further protect animals from ingesting tainted feed that could then negatively impact human consumers       As you are aware  earlier this week  the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  and the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  discovered that byproducts from pet food manufactured with contaminated wheat gluten imported from China were used in chicken feed on some farms in the state of Indiana   It is believed that chickens from approximately 30 broiler poultry farms have ingested the contaminated chicken feed  potentially tainting millions of chickens   While USDA and FDA officials state that they do not believe the contaminated feed poses a risk to human consumers  the situation remains alarming    While I applaud the USDA and the FDA for the steps that they have taken to begin this investigation into the contaminated chicken feed  I believe that the FDA has the power to prevent situations like this from occurring in the future by proactively investigating farms to inspect feed and feed lots   As you know  the FDA has monitored the feed that the nation s animals eat for many years   Until this point  it has utilized its authority in monitoring the nation s feed by inspecting and investigating farms only after an outbreak or incident   However  according to 21CFR11 19  the FDA has the authority to institute special regulations  if necessary  to cover the inspection of  excluded operations   such as meat and poultry farms before an incident   I urge you to consider instituting these special regulations to allow for FDA inspection of farms in relation to animal feed before an incident    Thank you for your consideration     Sincerely    Charles E  Schumer
