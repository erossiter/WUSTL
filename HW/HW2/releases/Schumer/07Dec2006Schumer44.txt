IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 7  2006 Following Two Shocking Reports  Schumer Demands Full Investigation Of Nuclear Workers Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    GAO And Republican Congressional Reports Reveal The Office Of Management And Budget And Department Of Labor Are Limiting Payouts To Nuclear Weapons Workers Sickened By Exposure To Toxic Materials   Since 2000  Bethlehem Steel Workers And Others Have Been Fighting For Health Compensation Through Federal Program   Schumer  It Is Long Past Time That These Cold War Heroes Get The Ju U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today demanded a full investigation of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  by the Department of Labor Inspector General to determine whether the Department of Labor and the Administration have worked together to limit payouts to nuclear weapons workers sickened by radiation and toxic material   Both a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report and a Republican Congressional Report revealed that the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  and the Department of Labor were working together to limit these payments   Former nuclear weapons workers at Bethlehem Steel are currently suffering from debilitating diseases  including various forms of cancer and may qualify for compensation through this program  but have not received full benefits   Workers from several other Cold War nuclear operations in Western New York have had difficulty obtaining compensation as well   Schumer has been aggressively fighting on behalf of all nuclear weapons workers in Western New York since the program was created in 2000   Schumer is asking the Department of Labor several pointed questions to determine the extent of this obstruction and is demanding the Inspector General conduct a thorough investigation          It is astonishing that the Department of Labor and the Administration have been in cahoots in an effort to keep Bethlehem Steel Workers and other Cold War heroes from the support they need and the compensation they deserve     Schumer said    Many former nuclear workers became dangerously ill developing the country s nuclear weapons program  and should not have to wait another day for help  Too many have died already  some of them perhaps from exposure to radiation           The Government Accountability Office  GAO  has completed two major reports on the EEOICPA program this year  exposing many flaws and inconsistencies   The most recent  completed on December 5  2006  was prepared due to a recent memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  to the Department of Labor that raised concerns about potential efforts to improperly limit the cost of benefits paid to claimants   The memorandum also notes that the Department of Labor has identified the potential for a large expansion of EEOICPA Part B benefits through the designation of special exposure cohorts   Moreover  it also states that the Administration planned a White House led interagency workgroup to develop options to limit growth in the costs of benefits provided by the program         Secondly  a November 30  2006 memo prepared by Republican staff for the Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security and Claims stated   there is a continuous stream of  administration  communications     strategizing on minimizing payouts      The memo summarizes and quotes from thousands of pages of records reviewed by the subcommittee in its probe       Despite having one of the greatest concentrations of facilities involved in nuclear weapons production related activities in the nation  Western New York continues to be severely underserved by the EEOICPA program   Thousands of New Yorkers labored during the late 1940s and early 1950s in ultra hazardous conditions at the Department of Energy and contractor facilities  while being essentially unaware of the health risks   Workers at these facilities handled high levels of radioactive materials and were responsible for helping to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War   Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection and many have been diagnosed with cancer   The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  was created by Congress to compensate the unsung heroes of the Cold War who were sickened as a result of their service in radiation facilities directly managed or financed by the federal government   This law was designed to compel the government to find the fastest  most humane way to speed compensation to victims         Schumer also wrote to the U S  Department of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao  asking that she answer direct questions on how the EEOICPA program is executed   In the personal letter  Schumer asked the following pointed questions        1  Has the Department of Labor been asked or instructed in any way by the Administration to limit or deny compensation to former nuclear workers        2  Of the 24 000 approved cases for compensation payment  how many of these claims have been fully paid   How many have had a delay in payment or not been fully paid        3  How many former workers from New York State have received full compensation   How many have been denied compensation         4  On what grounds does the Department of Labor deny claims         5  Is the Administration using dose reconstruction programs as a way to limit or deny compensation to former nuclear workers          I have spoken with and received correspondence from many former works and the sons and daughters of former workers at Bethlehem Steel  and I have devoted significant efforts to fighting for the compensation they deserve     said Schumer     They have told me heartbreaking stories of friends and loved ones dying of debilitating cancers at a young age  and they have become extremely frustrated with the seemingly endless bureaucracy   It is time that this Administration gets these heroes the compensation they deserve          Former employees of the following businesses could be eligible for health compensation  Electro Metallurgical  Niagara Falls   Hooker Electrochemical  Niagara Falls   Carborundum Company  Niagara Falls   Lake Ontario Ordinance Works  Niagara Falls   Simonds Saw and Steel Co  Lockport   Titanium Alloys Manufacturing  Niagara Falls   Ashland Oil  Tonawanda   Bethlehem Steel  Lackawanna   Bliss and Laughlin Steel  Buffalo   Linde Air Products  Buffalo   Linde Ceramics Plant  Tonawanda   Seaway Industrial Park  Tonawanda   Utica St  Warehouse  Buffalo   the West Valley Demonstration Project  West Valley        Senator Schumer has aggressively worked to get aid for former nuclear workers in Western New York  In an effort to compensate these workers  Congress passed legislation in 2000 that allowed them to file claims with the US Department of Labor for individual payments of  150 000 and other benefits for medical treatments  Workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War were eligible  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history        In November 2004  Schumer successfully secured a mandate from Congress that establishes a resource center intended to provide Western New Yorkers with the support that they need to effectively navigate the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  Senator Schumer s language established a new resource center in Western New York that would help sick nuclear workers with their compensation applications
