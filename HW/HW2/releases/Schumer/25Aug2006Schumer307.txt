                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Team Lorraine   Was Created By Friends After Lorraine Valentini  A Hartsdale  Teacher  Championship Cyclist and Volunteer Firefighter  Was In A Biking Accident That Left Her With A Spinal Cord Injury    Stem Cells Could Be Her Only Hope      Team Lorraine    Composed Of Her Former Cycling Buddies  Biked From Hartsdale To Washington  DC And Met With Schumer On Day The President Vetoed Stem Ce U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today met with members of Westchester  s   Team Lorraine   to expand efforts to override the President  s veto of the Stem Cell Research Bill  Lorraine Valentini sustained a spinal cord injury in a biking accident  and   Team Lorraine   was created by her close friend Colleen Kelly and other friends to raise awareness for stem cell research and spinal cord injuries    Team Lorraine   has made bracelets in green  Lorraine  s favorite color  to support stem cell research  and Schumer will wear the bracelet from Team Lorraine until a stem cell research bill becomes law   Schumer was joined by Lorraine  s husband Chris Reyling  Greenburgh Town Supervisor Paul Feiner  who led the bicycle ride to Washington  DC and Colleen Kelly  Founder and Director of   Team Lorraine           When Team Lorraine was in Washington  I was touched by their drive to get something done on stem cells in honor of their friend     Schumer said    It s tragic that the president has chosen as his first veto this bill that could mean new hope for millions of Americans  hope that we could find a cure for a multitude of diseases  All you have to do is talk to a mother whose child is battling juvenile diabetes  someone with a parent suffering from Alzheimer s Disease  or one of Lorraine Valentini s close friends to understand how important this legislation is          In late May of this year  the House of Representatives passed the Stem Cell Research Bill  and in July  the Senate followed suit  On July 19  when President George W  Bush vetoed the Stem Cell Legislation that had recently passed Congress  Schumer met with   Team Lorraine   on the steps of the Capitol after their 300 mile bike ride from Hartsdale to Washington  DC  The Stem Cell Research Bill would increase the number of stem cell lines that can be used by researchers who are funded by federal grants  These stem cells are not new embryos that would be created for the purpose of research  but rather would be leftover embryos created by couples who are trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization  that would otherwise be destroyed        Without being able to use federal funding for their research  Schumer asserts that innovative stem cell research is being stymied  When a stem cell bill becomes law  it would accelerate the movement towards a cure for a countless different devastating diseases  while strengthening the rules on ethics that must be involved in such research  Moreover  not being allowed to use federal funding for the stem cell lines available has broader implications for all researchers  Scientists who are working on research that does not involve stem cells are being hindered because of the overly restrictive rules about stem cell research  Schumer emphasized that the best minds in the country need to be working around the clock to find cures for debilitating diseases  and the government needs to give them whatever tools they need to get the job done       According to the Christopher Reeve Foundation  approximately 450 000 people in the United States have sustained traumatic spinal cord injuries  with more than 10 000 new cases of SCI emerging in the U S  every year  Males account for 82 percent of all SCI s  which are most commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents  falls  and acts of violence  Most spinal cord injury patients are in their teens or twenties  By using embryonic stem cells  scientists hope to learn how to grow healthy cells that could be transplanted into a patient and take over for their damaged cells   This could ultimately restore communication between the brain and different parts of the body  and therefore improve motor function for SCI patients       Schumer and his Senate Democratic colleagues have sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  pushing him to show his commitment to the promise of embryonic stem cell research by helping to organize a Congressional override of President Bush  s veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  Schumer said with millions of Americans looking to the Congress for the hope of new treatments and cures for debilitating illnesses  the nation cannot afford to wait any longer for the enactment of this urgently needed legislation         On Memorial Day of 2005  Lorraine Valentini had a tragic bicycling accident in which she severely injured her spinal cord  resulting in paralysis below her neck  This was devastating  not only to Lorraine  but to her family  friends and neighbors  and sent shock waves throughout her cycling community  Lorraine is a retired English Literature teacher  Hartsdale Volunteer Firefighter and accomplished cyclist  Lorraine is now in the Yale New Haven Hospital  Although Lorraine sustained serious injury to her spine  which has resulted in paralysis below her neck  her mind is totally intact  Currently  Lorraine is unable to move or feel sensation below her neck and is connected to a ventilator  In order to speak  she uses a special voice valve that enables air to flow past her vocal cords          We will get a stem cell research bill into law  I want to assure everybody who clings to the hope that we will let research continue so that people can be cured  And whether it s this year  or with a new Senate and a new House and the next president  this will become the law of the United States     Schumer added
