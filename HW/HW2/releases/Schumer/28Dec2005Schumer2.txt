IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 28  2005 Schumer Completes Annual 62 County Tour Throughout New York For Seventh Year In A Row                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Despite Growing National Responsibilities  Schumer Maintains Relentless Schedule Throughout New York   As Candidate for U S  Senate  Schumer Pledged To Visit Every County In His First Year As Senator  But Has Done So Every Year He Has Been In Office   Even After Winning Re Election by Record Amount in 2004  Schumer Still Completes 62 County Tour This Year With a visit to Columbia County today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer completes his 62 County tour of New York for the seventh year in a row    a feat that makes him the first Senator to visit every single county for every year he has been in office  Schumer s 2005 tour of New York included 14 trips to Albany  16 to Erie  12 to Monroe  20 to Nassau  13 to Onondaga  16 to Suffolk  and 10 to Westchester  He also made multiple trips to Broome  Chemung  Cortland  Dutchess  Jefferson  Niagara  Oneida  Orange  Richmond  Rockland  and Ulster Counties        If there s one thing that s been clear to me since I became Senator  it s that being effective means hitting the road and meeting with people around the state   Schumer said   Talking face to face with local officials or visiting a factory or a farm and getting a firsthand account of what New Yorkers need is the best way I know how to serve  These visits make me much more effective when I try to get a company to invest in an area or fight for an appropriation in Congress        Despite an increasingly prominent role on the national stage  Schumer has continued maintaining his accessibility and vigorous work on behalf of New Yorkers throughout the state  In January  for example  Schumer visited Rochester  near the site of a 2001 a CSX train crash derailing 23 cars  three of which spilled toxic chemicals into the Genesee River  In response to this and other recent fatal accidents  Schumer introduced the Rail Crossing and Hazardous Materials Transport Act of 2005 which sets tougher minimum and maximum fines for railroad companies for fatal accidents and establishes new requirements for investigations  inspections and the use of new safety technology  The legislation aims to crack down on negligent railroad companies and requires the broader use of modern technology to protect the public from more fatal crossing and hazardous materials accidents       Schumer visited Syracuse University in March for the formal opening of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs  Schumer secured a  10 million endowment for the new state of the art global affairs institute in the past two appropriations cycles  As one of Schumer  s top priorities  the institute will attract some of the world  s top academics and could be a stimulus to help attract people to the region       In June  Schumer visited SuperPower in Albany to announce their Cryogenic Refrigeration System and Superconducting Wire Technology had significant passed tests  proving they will work to improve efficiency  Schumer had fought for Department of Energy funding for High Temperature Superconductivity Research to support Superpower  In January  Schumer successfully pressed Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy David Garman  to look within the Department of Energy budget for ways to restore the development of HTS research  He also supported the inclusion of funds in the Defense Appropriations Bill to support Superpower  s research       Later in the summer  Schumer attended the groundbreaking for the   Port of Excellence    at the Champlain  LaColle crossing in Clinton County  designed to alleviate chronic delays and facilitate additional cross border commerce  After Schumer visiting the border crossing in 2000  he helped secure  90 million in federal funding to date for the project       This fall  Schumer met with Orange County farmers in Pine Island where he learned from sod and turf farmers that this year  s April and October floods had severely damaged their crops  and that chronic flooding threatens their viability  Schumer pledged to help secure a visit from the Army Corps of Engineers to inspect the damage and offer suggestions on flood mitigation  Within days of his visit  senior Army Corps of Engineers officials from the New York Regional Office and a Schumer staff member toured affected farms in the Town of Warwick  Orange County   met with local officials and farmers  and surveyed the problem areas       Schumer also announced this year that he secured a measure that would allocate  45 million in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for the next generation of homeland screening technology  a move that means SureScan of Endicott will be one of a few companies able to compete for this money once they are certified by the Transportation Security Administration  TSA   Schumer first brought the TSA to meet with SureScan in 2003       Schumer traveled to Long Island to share his survey of previously undisclosed MTBE leaks that posed a grave danger to the region  s water supply  Schumer fought hard to remove a proposal that would have given makers of the MTBE gasoline additive liability protection against environmental lawsuits  In a subsequent trip to the north shore of Suffolk County  Schumer responded to the concerns of a majority of Long Islanders when he became the first federal official to join their opposition to the ill advised Broadwater liquefied natural gas plant to be located in the Long Island Sound       Throughout the year  Schumer  who has been lobbying since 2002 for a waterfront corporation to tackle the redevelopment of Buffalo s Inner and Outer Harbors  successfully urged the Empire State Development Corp set up the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp  for that purpose  In addition  Schumer secured  8 million for the Southtowns Connector project in the Transportation Reauthorization bill  Schumer also played a leading role in bringing the New York Power Authority and the Western New York delegation together to push for a better deal for Erie County  As a result  the Waterfront Commission was brought into negotiations and in the final relicensing settlement  Greenway Commission will receive  2 million a year for 50 yrs  and the Waterfront Commission  3 5 million a year for 50 yrs
