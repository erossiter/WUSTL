IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 25  2006 Schumer Secures Almost  1 Million For Suffolk County 852 COPS Response System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator Aggressively Lobbied to Include Funding In FY06 Spending Bill   Senator and Suffolk County Exec  Steve Levy Pushed for Money to Ease Burden on 911 and Provide 1 4 Million Residents with Crucial Resource for Non Emergency Needs                                                                                                                                                              Today  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer announced the release of  987 000 to fund a non emergency 852 COPS system for Suffolk County residents which will ease the burden on the local 911 system  The funding included in the FY06 Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations bill and signed by the President in November of 2005  was a major priority for Senator Schumer who championed the importance of a single non emergency number for Suffolk County residents to call for help with government services and other non emergency needs          Establishing a communication management system in Suffolk County is a no brainer  While it will cut down 911  s caller volume  ensuring it is only used for emergencies  a 852 COPS response system also provides residents with a much needed resource for any non emergency need  concern  or question     Schumer said        Having a system like 852 COPS will allow Suffolk  s 1 4 million residents to route their quality of life complaints here  freeing up 911 to better respond to real emergencies     said Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy    The release of this funding is wonderful news and I appreciate Senator Schumer  s support and enthusiasm for bringing this critical project to fruition          Suffolk County will use the money to create a non emergency phone number similar to 311 that will monitor  document and analyze calls from residents who have concerns  This communication management system will help to preserve emergency  police  fire  ambulance and all other emergency response communications systems  The development of the 852 COPS system will ease the burden on Suffolk County  s current emergency communication system and reduce the high volume of non emergency calls that are placed to the 911 call system        Currently  residents rely on the blue pages or the internet to find government listings  which is often a slow  arduous and fruitless process  Exacerbating the situation is an absence of a standardized routing procedure for calls to or within County government and phones that are only staffed between 8 30am 5pm daily  As a result  911 receives both emergency and non emergency calls  clogging the entire network       Since his State of the County address last year where he announced that Suffolk County would investigate implementing a 852 COPS system to avoid waste and delays in 911 response time that can cost lives  Suffolk County Executive Levy teamed up with Senator Schumer to create a Suffolk 852 COPS system that would serve the county  s 1 4 million residents  and nearly 50 different departments  divisions  or offices in County Government with over 12 000 employees        Across the country  311 systems have been developed to make local governments more accessible to their constituents by letting people request and receive information and government services by calling one simple  toll free number   311  Call takers at a centralized call center  available 24 hours a day  7 days a week  provide information  take service requests and refer callers to government agencies  Service requests made via 311 are transferred to the appropriate government agency for direct and immediate service        New York City 311  originally implemented in 2003  consolidated over 30 call centers and hundreds of government phone numbers including such popular numbers as the Department of Health  the Taxi and Limousine Commission  and the Department of Sanitation  into 311  In the program s first year  New York City government logged over 8 million calls  or approximately one call for each of the 8 115 135 New York City residents  As of November 2005  the average number of calls per day was about 40 000 calls  with an average length of service per call at about 26 seconds         As we can see from the success of New York City  s 311 line  this system works  It can make a world of difference in a city  s communication capabilities   Schumer said    The bottom line is  the 911 emergency response system benefits from this by being less clogged and more able to respond to real emergencies  all residents benefit from a greater service to the public
