IMMEDIATE RELEASE  December 20  2006 Schumer Reveals  Benefits For Nat  l Guard And Reservists Lag Far Behind Active Military Despite Same Sacrifice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With Disability Claims by Guard and Reservists Denied at More than Twice the Rate of Active Military Members  Schumer Calls for Immediate VA Investigation    Standing Outside the Connecticut Street Armory  Schumer Announces Sweeping New Legislation to Double Education Benefits and Increase Access to Medical Care   Schumer  During this Holiday Season  We Cannot Shortchange Members With the National Guard and reserves stretched to the limit  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer today revealed that benefits for members of the National Guard and reserves who are called in to military service lag far behind those for active military and announced his new sweeping legislation to close the benefits gap  Under the current system  a reserve solider who is attending school and participating in full time training receives only a  297 month stipend while active duty soldiers receive  1097 month  To level the playing field  Schumer today announced his plans to introduce new sweeping benefits legislation for members of the National Guard and reserves in the 110th Congress   Schumer also said that 18  of disability claims by National Guard and reservists are denied  only 8  of active duty claims are denied and called for an immediate federal investigation in to the disparity         The members of the National Guard and reserves serving overseas are every bit as brave and sacrifice every bit as much  and thus ought to be treated fairly  no questions asked     Schumer said    The current two tiered system needs to be leveled immediately to ensure the members of the reserve component receive the benefits they earned and deserve   With the guard and reserves already stretched nearly to the breaking point during this holiday season  we cannot and must not shortchange these heroes          Schumer today revealed that there is a shocking disparity in the benefits offered to active military members returning from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and the members of the so called   reserve component      The reserve component includes any member of the National Guard or reserves who is called to serve with the active military overseas   From education benefits offered to returning soldiers who go back to school to the type and location of medical care available  members of the reserve component who return from a war zone lag far behind the benefits available to active military members       More than 500 000 Guard and Reserve troops have served in active duty since the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  and they ve made up nearly half of the force fighting against terrorists and in combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan   There are 88 500 members of the reserve component currently mobilized with 1 680 of them from bases in New York    Under the current system  a reserve solider who is attending school and participating in full time training receives only a  297 month stipend while active duty soldiers receive  1097 month  until the reserve soldier is deployed  After a reservist is deployed for at least three months  these benefits are increased  but even a reservist who serves in Iraq or Afghanistan never receives the full amount that their active duty counterparts receive  And  the reservists must remain within the Reserves  even after returning from active duty  in order to receive these benefits  which leaves them susceptible to being called up for another tour of duty in Afghanistan or Iraq       The disparity also exists when it comes to access to medical care   When reservists return home with an injury  most are required to recuperate at military medical facilities that can be long distances from their homes  even on the other side of the country  When active duty soldiers return home  they recuperate at the military base where they live  Under the current system  if a reservist or National Guard member wanted to receive treatment close to home  they would have to resign their active duty status thereby voiding their military health benefits         Schumer also revealed that even when members of the guard and reserve try to take advantage of the benefits that are available  the Department of Veterans Affairs has not treated them fairly and denied their claims at a far greater late   While 37  of active duty veterans have filed for service related disability claims  only 20  of those in the National Guard or reservists have filed claims  However  18  of the claims by National Guard and reservists are denied  while only 8  of active duty claims are denied         There is simply no logical reason that medical claims for reservists and National Guard should be denied at nearly twice the rate of active duty soldiers serving side by side with them     Schumer added       To ensure members of the guard and reserve receive the benefits and medical care they rightly deserve  Schumer today announced that when Congress reconvenes to begin the 110th Congress in January he will introduce new comprehensive benefits legislation   His legislation would level the playing field for members of the guard and reserves in Rensselaer and across the country   Specifically  Schumer  s bill would            Double the education benefit   Schumer  s legislation would increase the education benefit for members of the reserve component to  600 month            Ensure members of the guard and reserve can receive medical treatment close to home  Schumer  s legislation would create a new system where a member of the reserve component could receive treatment at a facility near their home without losing military health benefits            Reimburse members of the reserve component for travel costs  Right now  the military does not reimburse members of the reserve component for traveling to train or for weekend drill   To ease the burden on upstate New York soldiers who may have to travel long distances throughout the state or even outside of New York  Schumer  s legislation require the military to reimburse members of the reserve for travel beyond 50 miles       Schumer today also wrote to Veteran  s Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson asking him to direct the Department of Veteran  s Affairs Inspector General to immediately investigate why reserve component claims are denied at such a greater rate than active military
