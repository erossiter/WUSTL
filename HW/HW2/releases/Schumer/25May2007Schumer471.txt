IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 25  2007 Schumer  Skelos   Weisenberg  Red Tape Stalling Jones Inlet Dredging   Army Corps   Dec Must Act Now To Address Safety Issues  Head Off Further Erosion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Last Dredged in 1995  Shallow Waterway Currently Endangers Boaters  Fishermen  Homes  Emergency Responders  and Leaves Point Lookout and Town of Hempstead s Beaches Vulnerable to Storm Damage   But  Millions in Available State Funds for Dredging Remain Unused by Army Corps and DEC   In Letter to Army Corps   DEC  Schumer  Skelos and Weisenberg Urge Immediate Action                With Jones Inlet long overdue for dredging  U S  Senator Charles E  Schumer  State Senator Dean Skelos and State Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg today called on the Army Corps of Engineers  ACOE  and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC  to immediately settle on a plan of action to dredge the inlet  tackle worsening erosion  and safeguard the many homes  boaters  fisherman  emergency responders and beaches that rely on the environmental stability of the inlet and Point Lookout        An undredged Jones Inlet jeopardizes the safety of boaters and fishermen while leaving the Town of Hempstead s beaches vulnerable to severe storm damage   Schumer said today   Thanks to the work of Senator Skelos and Assemblymember Weisenberg  we have the money to dredge the inlet  all we need is the Army Corps and DEC to do their job as soon as possible  Without their cooperation  the Hempstead community will continue to be at risk of escalating and imminent threats during this year s storm season         The Army Corps of Engineers and the state DEC have spent nearly a year working on the details of this project and residents of Point Lookout deserve immediate action   said Skelos    The funding is available  the agreement has been negotiated and any further delay is unacceptable   The Army Corps and the DEC must finalize this agreement as soon as possible to ensure that the beach replenishment is completed before any further damage is done   The time for excuses is over        Weisenberg added   It is imperative that this project move forward immediately  The lives and property of the people of Point Lookout are at risk  Let s prevent a tragedy        The supplemental 2006 NY budget adopted provided  25 2 million in funding designated for the Long Beach Barrier Island Storm Damage Reduction Project  and to alternative beach erosion measures in Point Lookout and Lido Beach  with  7 6 million set aside to dredge Jones Inlet  Senator Skelos and Assemblyman Weisenberg proposed that the state pay the entire cost of the dredging project with the federal government repaying its share when the federal budget is resolved  This would allow the dredging project   which would take six weeks to two months to complete   to begin as soon as possible        However  despite an expectation that the project would start in October of 2006  nearly one year has passed and the ACOE and DEC have still failed to reach an accord that would allow the project to proceed expeditiously  Since the Endangered Species Act requires that the dredging may only proceed during the period October 1st to March 1st  it is imperative that the dredging and erosion protection begin no later than October 1st of this year in order to protect the area during the Nor easter season         This wait and see approach is misguided  irresponsible and potentially dangerous  It must be replaced with a can do approach defined by the DEC and ACOE swinging into action   said Senator Schumer who has pledged to work with his colleagues to seek all available federal funds for the project       While the inlet is a federal navigation channel  and therefore under the purview of the ACOE  the DEC has the funding for the project available through money set aside specifically for dredging by the state government  Yet  as the two agencies debate which bears responsibility for the dredging  storm damage as witnessed in the April Nor easter eat away at Point Lookout and the Town of Hempstead s beaches         The Army Corps  and DEC s back and forth must stop  It s time for real action and real results for the people of Hempstead  who have had to live with the fear of the next big storm  while suffering with excuse after excuse from the agencies entrusted with protecting them   said Senator Schumer        Over the past decade  the inlet has filled with sand  making both the channel perilously shallow and water conditions unpredictable for mariners  A primary concern is also for the safety of thousands of recreational boaters who are either forced to use other water channels or navigate outside Jones Inlet s designated ones  since the water depth has shifted making the official lanes unsafe  According to a deputy commissioner at the DEC  the inlet currently  poses a grave threat to navigation and safety  and the ACOE  which last dredged the inlet in 1995 to a depth of 12 feet and width of 250 feet  readily admits that it should be dredged every four to five years       The inlet also protects the Town of Hempstead s precious beaches by absorbing the brunt of storms  Hempstead Town Supervisor Kate Murray has been a leader in addressing this issue  It is estimated that by dredging Jones Inlet  approximately half million cubic yards of sand can be deposited back on the hamlet s three beaches  The sand nourishment will help reverse the relentless erosion negatively affecting the area  and protect residential and commercial property  local business and its economy  the ecosystem and its habitat and recreational interests  as well as Point Lookout       Schumer has long been an advocate for comprehensive beach erosion protection and a promoter of navigable channels  He has championed  along with fellow delegation members  funding for the Army Corps  Fire Island to Montauk Reformulation Study  He also recently worked with the ACOE to reprogram funding to expedite dredging of the East Rockaway Inlet after a barge carrying home heating oil ran aground in November 2006  In May 2006  Senator Schumer and Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray made a bipartisan push for funding to dredge Jones Inlet  and for an erosion project at Point Lookout        Skelos and Weisenberg were both instrumental in securing the state funding for dredging Jones Inlet  which they announced in June of last year
