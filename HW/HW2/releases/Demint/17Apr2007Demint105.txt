SEN. DEMINT FORCES DEMOCRATS TO BUDGE ON EARMARKS, PLEDGES TO FIGHT FOR FULL TRANSPARENCY
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement after Democrats objected to enacting S. Res. 123, the earmark disclosure rule. Just minutes before Sens. DeMint and Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma) fought for the earmark reform on the Senate Floor, Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia) finally agreed to require his committee to follow the earmark disclosure.  
   "Once again, when faced with media scrutiny, Democrats finally budged on earmark reform," said Senator DeMint. "While I welcome the reversal by the Appropriations Committee to follow the rules we passed over eighty days ago, this is not nearly enough. This rhetoric is unenforceable and doesn't cover all earmarks. In fact, projects like the Bridge to Nowhere would still be allowed to hide from public view." 
   "American taxpayers deserve more than a wink and a nod. If the Senate is serious, it would put teeth behind these rules and enact them immediately. Instead, we get new excuses and delays from the majority. This is unacceptable, and I will continue to fight for full and real transparency," said Senator DeMint. 
   The decision by the Senate Appropriations Committee is not full or enforceable reform. The new Byrd rule: 
   * Doesn't apply to all earmarks. Many earmarks are contained in authorization bills and authorization committees have not agreed to adhere to the disclosure rule. For example, the infamous Bridge to Nowhere was an authorization earmark and would not be included under the new Byrd policy. 
   * Has no enforcement. This is a promise with no teeth. There is no recourse for senators - or taxpayers - if the Appropriations committee doesn't live up to their word. If the rule were enacted, Senators could raise a point of order against any appropriations bill that does not meet the disclosure requirements. 
   * Is the second promise by Democrats on earmark reform. After promising a complete time-out on earmarks for the rest of 2007, Democrats immediately proceeded to add billions in pork to the war supplemental (spinach, peanut storage, Christmas trees, etc.) and at least one clear violation by resurrecting a University of Vermont earmark from 2006. 
   S. Res. 123 is cosponsored by Senators Coburn, John Ensign (R-Nevada), John McCain (R-Arizona), Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming), Mel Martinez (R-Florida) and Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri).
