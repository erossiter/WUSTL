SEN. DEMINT CALLS ON ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN YUCCA MOUNTAIN
  Today, at a hearing held by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) called on the Department of Energy to move forward and open Yucca Mountain for storage of the nation's nuclear waste.  
   "Yucca Mountain is a vital component of America's energy security, and must open for nuclear waste," said Senator DeMint. "For too long, South Carolina has 'temporarily' housed a great deal of our nation's nuclear waste. Opening Yucca Mountain's repository immediately is essential to ensuring that the nuclear waste currently kept in South Carolina will be removed and permanently stored in a safe and secure location." 
   "Yucca has been extensively studied for more than 20 years and we've poured billions of dollars into it. Yet, today it still stands empty." 
   "Instead of storing nuclear waste above ground at 131 sites in 39 states, it is infinitely safer to consolidate the waste into one desolate location and bury it deep underground. Science and commonsense both dictate this solution and Yucca fits this description." 
   "The people who are opposed to Yucca Mountain are the same people who have always been opposed to nuclear energy in America. They would rather shut down an abundant, emission-free source of energy to satisfy their own agenda." 
   "The administration needs to act now and open Yucca Mountain as soon as possible," said Senator DeMint. 
   South Carolina facts: 
   * Roughly 3,174 metric tons of civilian waste are stored in South Carolina. 
   * About 3,000 metric tons of High-Level defense waste at the Savannah River Site are supposed to go to Yucca Mountain 
   * South Carolina nuclear energy consumers have paid over $1 Billion into the Nuclear Waste Fund to build Yucca Mountain. Only Illinois and Pennsylvania have paid more. 
   * 55% of South Carolina's energy comes from nuclear facilities.
