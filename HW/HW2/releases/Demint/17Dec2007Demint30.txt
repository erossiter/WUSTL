NEW LIBRARY IN ANDERSON COUNTY
  The new Powdersville Library and Government Center, named after State Rep. Dan T. Cooper, is now a reality for residents and officials of Anderson County.  
   Susan Aiken, regional director for Sen. DeMint, toured the new facility earlier this month with Lola Dickert, the manager of the new library. Aiken was impressed by the building's modernity. 
   "The state-of-the-art technology, including wireless Internet and modern meeting rooms, will benefit the citizens of Powdersville greatly," she said. "I will look forward to visiting again soon." 
   Aiken said it's important that South Carolina continues to push projects like this one, because making education a priority will increase its competitiveness as a state and thus create high-paying jobs for the future. 
   "Education is the key to both individual and national success," she said.
