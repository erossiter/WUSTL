SEN. DEMINT: ARE WE PREPARED FOR NEXT BIG EARTHQUAKE?
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), chairman of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee's Disaster Prevention and Prediction Subcommittee, called on federal, state and local officials to work closely with the private sector for greater earthquake preparation. Sen. DeMint was joined by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) during a field hearing on the current state of earthquake monitoring, research and preparation in the nation, and lessons learned since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. 
   "The 1906 earthquake simply devastated San Francisco, and, unfortunately, we know it was not the last catastrophic earthquake this region will see." Senator DeMint said. "Over the last hundred years, we've made amazing technological advances to prevent damage, yet the Bay area has also seen incredible growth and development. Despite our best efforts, a major shaking of this area would still cause significant destruction."
   The Association of Bay Governments estimates that the following would be impacted by a significant earthquake (http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/2005/15/):
   * 19,000 miles of roadways,
   * 95 miles of the BART System,
   * Over 2700 Bridges and Interchanges,
   * 76 Hospitals, and
   * Over 2700 Fire, Police or Local Government Facilities.
   Senator DeMint's panel heard testimony from The Red Cross and the local utility industry to determine how the community is going to protect life and public safety, how the utilities will weather the storm and how long it will take the business community to get the economy back up and running and people back to work.
   "If we learned anything from Hurricane Katrina, it's that we must be prepared for nature's worst. It's not 'if' but 'when' a future violent earthquake will occur in this region and it will have a national impact. Scientists tell us there is a 62% probability that at least one earthquake of 6.7 magnitude or greater will occur in the Bay area in the next 25 years. It's important that this subcommittee examine how state and local communities are preparing for this probable disaster," said Senator DeMint.
