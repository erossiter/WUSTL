SEN. DEMINT INTRODUCES COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNICATIONS REFORM BILL
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, introduced the Digital Age Communications Act (DACA). The bill creates a communications regulation system that is market-oriented, competition-based and grounded in sound economic principles.  
   "We can no longer force a modern, dynamic industry to operate on archaic rules that destroy job creation, limit consumer choice, and needlessly raise prices," said Senator DeMint. "Congress must wake up. These regulations originated when rotary telephones were our only way to communicate. Today, cable, phone, and wireless offer consumers similar services, but each one is bound by a different set of confusing and burdensome regulations. At a time when communication technologies are exploding, and mediums are merging, we must create a system that protects consumers while allowing businesses to thrive." 
   "Let's take the shackles off of America's most exciting industry. This bill will create an environment that encourages innovation and competition. Americans understand that when businesses are allowed to compete, they win. Competition lowers prices, expands choices, and gives us our most exciting new technology," said Senator DeMint. 
   Under DACA: 
   * The communications industry would be regulated like other businesses, by protecting consumers and ensuring businesses do not engage in unfair competition. 
   * Services that are alike from a consumer's perspective would be treated alike. For example, phone service, whether offered by a cable, land-line, or wireless company, would have to comply with the same regulations. 
   * The Universal Service Program would be reformed to make all service providers contribute equally and make the distribution of the funds more efficient, transparent, and technologically neutral. 
   * Cable television franchises would be phased out over 4 years. 
   * Each state would continue to play an important role in enforcing federal rules and would retain the authority to protect consumers and manage public rights-of-way.
