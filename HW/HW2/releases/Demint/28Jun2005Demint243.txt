SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO PASS BIPARTISAN ENERGY BILL
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) voted to pass The Energy Policy Act of 2005.  
 The bill passed with bipartisan support on an 85-12 vote. The bill expands America's energy choices, emphasizes conservation, and helps our nation meet the energy needs of the 21st Century. 
   "After years of debate, we finally have an energy bill that increases production, modernizes our energy systems, and conserves valuable resources," said Senator DeMint. "This bill addresses our short-term energy needs and advances solutions to our long term problems. If we're going to have the best jobs in the world, we must make America the best place in the world to do business. And that requires a national energy policy that provides for new resources and energy independence." 
   The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes several provisions that will benefit South Carolina: 
   * Authorizes funding of the President's Hydrogen Initiative 
   * Encourages increased investment in the nation's electricity infrastructure 
   * Protects transmission access for native load customers 
   * Reforms the hydropower licensing process 
   * Authorizes a Clean Coal Power Initiative, providing $200 million annually for clean coal research in coal-based gasification and combustion technologies 
   * Requires the Secretary of the Interior to support education in nuclear engineering through grants to university departments for research and facility support 
   * Promotes increased energy efficiency 
   "This bill is not perfect, but it is a step forward for America and for South Carolina," concluded Senator DeMint. "It will encourage innovation, promote technological advances, and make America more competitive."
