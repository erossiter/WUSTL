SEN. DEMINT VOTES AGAINST AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement Thursday after voting against the motion to limit debate, offered by Democrat Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), on the amnesty amendment to the immigration reform bill. The motion, which required 60 votes for passage, failed on a 39-60 vote. 
   "This proposal is amnesty, pure and simple, and it would weaken our border security," said Senator DeMint. "I support comprehensive reform that not only secures our borders but also includes a responsible temporary worker program for those people who play by the rules, return home, and then come back to our country the right way through the legal process. But I do not support amnesty for those who are in our country illegally. It's not fair to the millions of people who have waited their turn and followed the rules to allow 11 million illegal immigrants to gain permanent legal status and a clear path to citizenship. This would only invite more people to break the law and enter the country without documentation."
   "Rather than allow a vote on provisions to prevent felons and repeat offenders from receiving amnesty and green cards, the Democrats continue to push a bill that would weaken our border and homeland security. This is a serious national security issue and I hope Democrats will work with us to achieve bipartisan reform that can pass the House and the Senate and be signed by the President."
