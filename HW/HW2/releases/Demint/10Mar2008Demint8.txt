SEN. DEMINT WELCOMES GROWING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF EARMARK MORATORIUM
  Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement after Democrat Senators Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri), Barack Obama (D-Illinois) and Hillary Clinton (D-New York) joined as cosponsors of the DeMint-McCain earmark moratorium amendment.
