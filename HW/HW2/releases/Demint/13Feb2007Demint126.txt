SEN. DEMINT ANNOUNCES NEW PRESS SECRETARY
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) named Ryan Dawkins as his new Press Secretary.  
   Dawkins will handle media relations with South Carolina press outlets while working out of the Columbia office. She served the last two years as Senator DeMint's state scheduler in Greenville. 
   A native of Williamston, Dawkins worked on DeMint's successful Senate campaign as deputy press secretary and events coordinator. She is a graduate of Clemson University with a degree in political science and will soon complete her masters degree in mass communication from the University of South Carolina. 
   "Ryan is a talented staff member whose work will greatly benefit this office and the people of South Carolina," said Senator DeMint.
