SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S SPEECH ON IRAQ POLICY
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement:  
   "Americans are not against the war in Iraq, they are against losing. It's time for a winning strategy. 
   "Victory in Iraq is absolutely critical to winning the War on Terror and maintaining American credibility in the Middle East and the throughout the world. From Somalia to the Philippines, terrorists are betting that Americans do not have the will to finish the fight in Iraq. 
   "We must mount a coordinated effort that will destroy the terror networks, create security and allow Iraqi citizens the chance to prosper. I look forward to hearing more details and working with the administration to achieve success in Iraq."
