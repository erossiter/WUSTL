SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON MCCONNELL NOMINATION TO BE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) welcomed President George W. Bush's nomination of Mike McConnell to replace Ambassador John Negroponte as Director of National Intelligence. McConnell, a Greenville, S.C. native, will oversee all U.S. intelligence agencies upon confirmation by the Senate.  
   "Mike McConnell has a long and distinguished record of service to our country. As a Greenville native and Furman graduate he exemplifies what South Carolina has to offer," said Senator DeMint. "In today's world, intelligence functions are crucial to winning the War on Terror. Admiral McConnell's experience and expertise will help him win bipartisan support and succeed in this critical position. As a fellow South Carolinian, I especially look forward to helping him during the confirmation process." 
   McConnell is a retired Vice Admiral in the U.S. Navy, who served as an intelligence officer during tours of Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. He later served as Director of the National Security Agency under Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
