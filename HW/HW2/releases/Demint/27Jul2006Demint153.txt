PRESIDENT SIGNS ADAM WALSH CHILD PROTECTION AND SAFETY ACT
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following comments Thursday after the President signed into the law the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act: 
   "This is a real step to secure our shared values by giving American families additional protections against criminals and their heinous acts. Parents deserve to know when a sexual offender moves into their neighborhood so they can ensure their child's safety.
   "The National Sex Offender Registry and the public database created by this bill will help law enforcement and families track convicted sex offenders as they enter our communities and cross state lines. It has been said that this may be the toughest piece of child protection legislation in 25 years, and I'm proud to have supported it."
   * The measure creates a National Sex Offender Registry with uniform standards for the registration of sex offenders, including a lifetime registration requirement for the most serious offenders, and it establishes strong federal penalties for sex offenders who fail to register.
   * By creating a national sex offender registry, the bill enables child protective service officials in all 50 states to share information and more effectively investigate child abuse cases.
   * The bill also imposes enhanced penalties for the most serious crimes against children, as well as mandatory minimum penalties for recidivist offenders.
   * Senator DeMint was a cosponsor of S. 1086, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Grant Act, which contained similar provisions and was unanimously approved by the Senate on May 4, 2006.
   * The measure is named for Adam Walsh to honor the memory of the son of John and Revé Walsh, who was kidnapped and murdered 25 years ago, when he was only six years old.
