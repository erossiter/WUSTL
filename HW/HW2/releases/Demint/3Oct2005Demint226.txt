SEN. DEMINT COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF MIERS TO REPLACE RETIRING JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT O'CONNER
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today made the following statement after President Bush nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner on the Supreme Court.  
 If confirmed, Miers would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the nation's highest court. 
   "Ms. Miers has a long and distinguished career as one of the foremost lawyers in the country. I'm hopeful she will demonstrate that she is well qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and that she will strictly interpret the Constitution and laws of the United States, without legislating from the bench. 
   "Ms. Miers would bring a wealth of personal experience to the Supreme Court. I expect she will show that she has the intelligence, fairness, and open-mindedness needed to serve on the Court. 
   "The Senate has an important duty ahead. The Supreme Court of the United States is the custodian of our Constitution. Justices of the Supreme Court must not only be jurists of the highest competence, they must be attentive to the proper role of the courts in our democratic system. 
   "I was disappointed so many Democrats voted against Chief Justice Roberts. They proved that no matter how qualified the nominee, they will reject anyone put forward by this President. Democrats must remember that the American people elected President Bush because they agree with his view that judges should not legislate from the bench. 
   "I hope they will resist the temptation to attack Ms. Miers unfairly. Like all judicial nominees, she deserves a fair hearing, an honest debate, and a timely up-or-down vote."
