SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOTT'S RETIREMENT
  Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement:  
   "For more than 30 years, Trent Lott has dedicated his life to serving the Republican Party, Mississippi and our nation. As majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Trent was pivotal in passing the historic welfare reform that freed millions of Americans from government dependency. He fought to keep taxes and regulations low during the economic growth of the 1990s and pushed to strengthen our national defense. 
   "Senator Lott is a patriot whose leadership will long be remembered. I wish Trent and Tricia all the best."
