SEN. DEMINT OPPOSES 9/11 RECOMMENDATIONS BILL
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) voted against the 9/11 Recommendations bill that forces the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to negotiate with labor unions over its security decisions. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday on a 60-38 vote. President Bush has threatened to veto the overall bill over the collective bargaining provision, and letters have been signed by 36 senators and 146 members of the House of Representatives pledging to sustain the veto. 
   "This bill is payback to union bosses at the expense of homeland security and should be re-titled "The Big Labor Recommendations Bill'," said Senator DeMint. "This union earmark will tie TSA's hands with needless red-tape and make it harder to prevent another 9/11 attack."  
   "We can't be forced to negotiate with unions before take action to protect Americans from terrorist attacks. It's ridiculous to think we can run our security like the DMV and expect to keep our nation safe." 
   The collective bargaining provision would reverse the flexibility given to TSA to perform its critical aviation security mission. Collective bargaining was specifically rejected by Congress following the 9-11 attacks and was not recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The collective bargaining provision would have the following effects: 
   * Jeopardizes TSA ability to move people and equipment and change protocols on a daily bases to prevent future attacks, such as the UK liquids bomb plot. Security decisions that take minutes to implement today could now be held up in weeks and months of arbitration. 
   * Forces TSA to share sensitive intelligence information to explain changes in new work requirements. Disagreements on new protocols to be resolved under collective bargaining requires the involvement by the unions as a third party to negotiations. 
   * Stops TSA's ability to reward exceptional screeners and release underperforming workers. This performance standard is precisely what has enabled the agency to remain alert and in top shape to defend against possible attacks. 
   * Forces TSA to move 3,500 screeners off of security lines immediately to set up the new infrastructure required by collective bargaining. This will close 250 security screening lanes nationwide and likely double passenger wait time at airports. 
   The bill also fails to include several critical homeland security provisions. Senate Democrats blocked votes on the following amendments that would: 
   * Criminalize Terrorist Recruiting: Make it a crime - for the first time - to recruit people to commit terrorist acts. 
   * Criminalize Support and Rewarding of Terrorism: Make it a crime - for the first time - to encourage terrorism by rewarding the families of suicide bombers after the bombings take place. Also, increases the maximum penalties for existing offenses regarding the material support of terrorism, and for terrorist-motivated murders, kidnappings, and assaults. 
   * Revoke Visas of Suspected Terrorists: Authorize the immediate deportation of suspected terrorists whose visas are revoked on terrorism grounds. 
   * Detain Dangerous Aliens: Allow DHS to detain dangerous illegal immigrants to prevent their release inside the U.S. when home countries delay their return. 
   * Increase Penalties for Terrorist Hoax: Expand the terrorism hoax statute so that it punishes hoaxes about any terrorist offense listed in the official list of terrorist offenses. Also, increases penalties for those who call families of soldiers serving overseas and falsely claim that their family member has been killed. 
   "We had a chance to make this a serious effort to strengthen homeland security but the new majority was simply not interested," said Senator DeMint. "This bill will weaken our security and it should be vetoed."
