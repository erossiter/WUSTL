SEN. DEMINT CALLS MEGA SPENDING BILL 'UNACCEPTABLE'
  U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement today regarding the release of the proposed 3,565-page Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "Republicans were expecting something the President could sign with a straight face but this bill is completely unacceptable," said Senator DeMint. "We've only had it for a few hours and it's clear this is a bad deal. Instead of passing a clean bill, Democrats have packed it full of controversial policy riders, wasteful earmarks, and budget gimmicks that add billions in additional domestic spending over the President's level." 
   "I'm sure Democrats will try to ram this down our throats before anyone can read it, but we should do everything we can to stop them. I know many in Congress are anxious to get home for the holidays but we have a responsibility to stop wasteful Washington spending and protect American taxpayers," said Senator DeMint. 
   After an initial review of the legislation, several wasteful and unnecessary provisions have already been identified:
   * Earmarks: Instead of reducing the number of pork projects in the federal budget, the bill drives the number of earmarks up from last year. The bill contains over 8,000 earmarks, bringing the total for 2008 up to over 10,000 earmarks compared to just 2,658 in 2007. 
   * Spending Gimmicks: Instead of cutting wasteful spending out of the bill to bring its cost down to the President's level, the bill uses budget tricks and gimmicks to hide at least $14 billion in extra domestic spending. 
   * Policy Riders: Instead of limiting the package to spending needed to fund government operations, the bill includes unrelated policy items. Many of these riders are backed by special interests, such as organized labor, and could not win passage on their own.
