SEN. DEMINT VOTES FOR LOBBYING AND ETHICS REFORM BILL
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement Thursday after the Senate passed the lobbying and ethics reform bill on a 96-2 vote.  
   "I supported this bill because it takes steps toward earmark reform and is a big victory for taxpayers," said Senator DeMint. "This legislation requires the full disclosure of all congressional earmarks and it provides a powerful new tool to strike out wasteful earmarks that are secretly added to our spending bills." 
   "I was disappointed that we were not able to consider the legislative line item veto as part of this legislation. It would allow the President to challenge wasteful and corrupt earmarks by forcing Congress to reconsider them. However, I look forward to supporting that legislation when it is offered next week." 
   "I will be watching this lobbying and ethics reform bill closely as the House and Senate negotiators work toward a final agreement to ensure that there are no attempts to weaken our bipartisan earmark reforms." 
   Senator DeMint succeeded in adding two amendments to the bill. The first amendment requires full disclosure of all congressional earmarks, which must be posted on the Internet and made available to the public. The second amendment bans the practice of adding earmarks in secret where they cannot be voted on, and created a procedural tool to strike these provisions.
