SEN. DEMINT SPONSORS AMENDMENT TO REMOVE AMNESTY FROM IMMIGRATION BILL
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint joined Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana) in sponsoring an amendment to strike Title VI of the immigration bill, which awards illegal immigrants with legal status using new "Z" visas.  
   "The Z visa provision in this bill is what has Americans so upset, and rightfully so," said Senator DeMint. "It gives illegal immigrants the ability to permanently stay in the U.S. without having to return to their home counties. This is amnesty. It undermines the rule of law in our country and it is terribly unfair to those waiting to come to America legally." 
   * "Z" visas allow illegal immigrants to permanently stay in the United States without having to return to their home countries. 
   * "Z" visas allow illegal immigrants to cut in line for citizenship in front of approximately 800,000 legal applicants. 
   * "Z" visas allow illegal immigrants who are gang members, absconders or fugitives, sex offenders, and DUI felons to gain legal status. 
   * "Z" visas allow illegal immigrants to have access to administrative and judicial review of visa revocations, including those for terrorists. 
   * "Z" visas allow illegal immigrants access to public health benefits burdening American taxpayers. 
   * "Z" visas allow illegal immigrants to get Social Security benefits for illegal work performed in the United States. 
   * "Z" visas allow illegal immigrants to avoid any serious English requirement for at least 8 years. 
   "If the Z visa provision is removed from the bill, illegal immigrants will be able to go home, get right with the law, and apply to enter our country just like everyone else," said DeMint. "I believe in legal immigration and I want people to come here, respect our laws, embrace our values, and become American citizens. But we must reject amnesty if we ever expect that to happen. And that is why eliminating the amnesty provisions in this bill is the most compassionate, pro-immigrant thing we can do."
