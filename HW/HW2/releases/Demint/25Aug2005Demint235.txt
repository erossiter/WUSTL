SENS. GRAHAM, DEMINT ANNOUNCE AIR SERVICE IMPROVEMENT GRANT
  Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) announced a grant of $500,000 to the city of Florence for the purpose of air service improvement.  
   The grant has been awarded under the Small Community Air Service Development Program through the U.S. Department of Transportation. It will be used to institute a comprehensive marketing program to increase use of the airport. Local sources will contribute additional funds as well as provide in-kind contributions to this community effort. 
   The program helps communities address the challenges of local air service, such as high fares and insufficient levels of service. The grants will be used by communities around the country for programs such as financial incentives to air carriers, studies to determine air service needs, and marketing programs that encourage communities to use commercial carriers offering local air service.
