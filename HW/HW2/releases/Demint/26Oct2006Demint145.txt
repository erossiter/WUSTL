SEN. DEMINT APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF SECURE FENCE ACT
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement after President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act into law. The bill passed the Senate on an 80-19 vote in September.  
   "The American people have overwhelmingly rejected amnesty and asked us to secure the border first, which is exactly what this bill does. We must stem the flood of illegal immigration into our country and take control of our borders. The real fencing, border infrastructure, and state-of-the-art technology in this legislation is a huge step toward securing our homeland." 
   The Secure Fence Act will strengthen operational control of all borders and ports through additional physical barriers and fencing and greater use of state-of-the-art technology and surveillance along the southwest border. Specifically, the legislation: 
   * Authorizes more than 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing along the southwest border with prioritized placement at critical, highly populated areas and requires an evaluation of infrastructure needs along the northern border; 
   * Requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through a "virtual fence" that deploys cameras, ground sensors, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and integrated surveillance technology; 
   * Requires DHS to provide all necessary authority to border personnel to disable fleeing vehicles, similar to the authority held by the United States Coast Guard for maritime vessels; and 
   * Requires DHS to assess vulnerabilities on the northern border. 
   Senator DeMint supports legal immigration and the creation of a temporary guest worker program but he opposes amnesty, which would reward illegal immigrants with citizenship and voting rights.
