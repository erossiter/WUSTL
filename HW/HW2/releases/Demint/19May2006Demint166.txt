SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. REPORT ON GUANTANAMO BAY
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement in response to a United Nations panel report calling for the shutdown of the terrorist detainment center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
   "Instead of finding new ways to criticize the United States, the United Nations should focus their attention on real human rights abuses. Iran is reportedly trying to revive Nazi tactics of discrimination against Jews and Christians and hundreds of thousands are dying because of genocide in Darfur," said Senator DeMint. "In the meantime, America will not forget the lessons of September 11th, and will keep captured terrorists from killing more innocent Americans."
