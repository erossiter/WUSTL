SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT 0N LONDON BOMBINGS
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today made the following statement after terrorist bombings in London:  
   "Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of London. Today's cowardly attacks remind us that the global War on Terrorism continues. The enemies of freedom are trying to frighten the British people but they will fail. America will stand side by side with Great Britain to defend freedom and bring justice to the terrorists. 
   "There will be those in Great Britain, in America and throughout the world who will suggest that coalition action in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to these attacks. American and British support of freedom around the world did not cause these attacks. We must remind ourselves that America was attacked on September 11, 2001 before we took any action in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   "These savage murderers are not attacking Great Britain, America and countless other countries for any noble cause; they are killing because they are full of hate and evil. They can only be dealt with by force, and they will only stop killing when they are dead. We have but two choices: we can come home and wait for more attacks, or we can pursue terrorists and destroy them before they can kill again. America, Great Britain and our coalition partners have chosen the path of courage."
