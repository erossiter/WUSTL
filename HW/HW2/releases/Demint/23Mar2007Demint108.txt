SEN. DEMINT VOTES AGAINST LARGEST TAX HIKE IN HISTORY
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) voted against the Democrat budget resolution that requires a $736 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in American history. This will be three times larger than the previous record tax increase that was imposed by President Bill Clinton and the Democrat Congress of 1993. The budget resolution passed 52-47.  
   "It only took three months for Democrats to break their promise of fiscal responsibility and revert to their tax and spend ways," said Senator DeMint. "This tax hike is three times bigger than any previous tax increase. Democrats are trying to impose the biggest tax hike in history and Americans should be outraged. It will cripple our economy, destroy job growth, and make it harder for American families to make ends meet." 
   The Democrats' budget: 
   * Reverses the tax relief Republicans have passed since 2001, imposing a $736 billion tax increase over the next five years, the largest tax increase in U.S. history; 
   * Increases non-defense discretionary spending by approximately $150 billion over the next five years; 
   * Makes no attempt to reduce entitlement growth, leaving Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid on a path to bankruptcy. 
   Additionally, Senator DeMint and other Republicans offered a number of fiscally responsible amendments that were rejected by Democrats. These amendments included: 
   * Stop the Raid on Social Security Surplus (DeMint): The amendment would allow Congress to stop spending Social Security on other government programs and start saving the surplus for future generations. Rejected by Democrats, 45-52. 
   * Full Repeal of the Death Tax (DeMint): The amendment would repeal the Death Tax. Rejected by Democrats, 44-55 
   * Making Income Tax Relief Permanent (Lindsey Graham): The amendment would make permanent the individual income tax rate structure of 35, 33, 28, and 25 percent, established in 2001. Rejected by Democrats, 46-52. 
   * Deficit Reduction Account (DeMint): The amendment would require appropriations bills to have a Debt Reduction Account so reduced spending could be used to reduce the deficit instead of being spent on other programs. Rejected by Democrats, 38-61. 
   * Limiting War Supplemental to War Spending (Craig Thomas): The amendment would prevent extraneous earmarks from being added to the war supplemental. Rejected by Democrats, 39-59.
