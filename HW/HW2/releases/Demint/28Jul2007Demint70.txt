SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW LOBBYING AND ETHICS BILL
  U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement Saturday after learning about the new lobbying and ethics bill, which has now been rewritten by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada):  
   "Senator Reid tried to kill real ethics reform earlier this year when he sought to hide over ninety-five percent of the earmarks, but we managed to stop him. Now he's written a new bill in secret that could make the same mistake. But an ethics bill without serious earmark reform is another empty promise." 
   "Americans are fed up with special interest earmarks that have been at the center of recent scandals. The voters spoke loudly last November, but I think we need emergency funding to buy hearing aids for politicians who turn a deaf ear to earmark reform." 
   "We understand that Senator Reid's new bill contains loopholes that will allow Congress to continue to hide earmarks that direct American tax dollars to special interests. It may also allow senators to bypass the disclosure rules and add earmarks to our spending bills without ever having to debate or vote on them. This is business as usual and it shows how the culture of earmarks continues to drive the culture of corruption in Washington. 
   "It is ironic that Senator Reid has seen fit to rewrite a bill in secret that is supposed to provide transparency and sunlight. I'm especially disappointed in Speaker Pelosi who started this debate with strong rhetoric for earmark disclosure. She completed yielded to Reid and pressure from lobbyists." 
   "Once again, Senator Reid appears to want to ram a secret bill that is several hundred pages long through the Senate without a full debate and the chance to offer amendments. He tried to use these heavy-handed tactics on immigration, but Americans weren't fooled. Ethics reform is very important for America, and we need to make sure this bill includes true earmark reform and honestly addresses the culture of corruption that earmarks have created."
