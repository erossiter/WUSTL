SEN. DEMINT OPPOSES DEMOCRAT RETREAT AMENDMENTS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) voted against amendments to the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act by Senate Democrats that would establish a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops from the central front in the War on Terrorism in Iraq. 
   "Americans saw a clear difference today between Democrats who want to retreat and play defense with terrorists and Republicans who want to fight and defeat terrorists," said Senator Jim DeMint. "Terrorists know their only hope is to win the battle of wills. We cannot revert back to a pre-9/11 mentality. The terrorists must know that they cannot beat us, they cannot outlast us and they cannot discourage the American people. We must stand strong to secure a generation of peace and safety for our children and grandchildren."
