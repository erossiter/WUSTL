VETERANS DAY OBSERVANCE
 Last month Constituent Service Representative Seth Blanton and Regional Director Susan Aiken had the privilege of representing Sen. DeMint at the Veterans Day Observance held at Richard M. Campbell Veterans Nursing Home in Anderson. Guest speaker Lois Nash of Oconee County shared memories of her days as an Air Force service pilot. Nash and a few other select women were the first women trained to fly American military aircrafts. After a failed attempt to gain recognition as veterans of World War II, the group finally received full military status with the G.I. Bill Improvement Act of 1977.  
   Following Nash's remarks, nursing home patrons and their guests were served a full southern meal: fried chicken, green beans, potato salad, sweet tea and banana pudding. Blanton and Aiken were then given a tour of the facility - which included updates on assistance and care for our nation's veterans. 
   Of the event Aiken said: "It was such a blessing to me to be able to spend time with these wonderful men and women who honorably served our country."
