SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO CONFIRM JUDGE ALITO
 Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today voted in favor of the nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge Samuel A. Alito to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate voted to confirm Alito with a bipartisan vote of 58-42.  
   "Judge Alito has the most judicial experience of any nominee to come before the Senate in over 70 years, and I applaud his bipartisan confirmation to the Supreme Court" said Senator DeMint. "The consistent winner in his court has not been a person, business, branch of government or political ideology - it has been the rule of law. During 30 years of public service and 15 years on the bench, Judge Alito has proved to be a humble, thoughtful and fair judge all Americans can be proud of. 
   "If someone had told me last January that Sandra Day O'Connor and William Rehnquist would leave the court and a bipartisan majority would confirm John Roberts and Samuel Alito, two of America's most respected judges, I'm not sure I would have believed it. This is a major accomplishment for our nation and I'm honored to have been part of it." 
   Judge Alito began his public career serving for 15 years at the U.S. Department of Justice. As U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey he was best known for prosecuting white collar and environmental crimes, drug trafficking, organized crime, and violations of civil rights. Judge Alito has served on the Third Circuit since his unanimous Senate confirmation in 1990. 
   "Judge Alito is exactly the kind of Justice America needs, a man who does not prejudge any case and follows the law without injecting political opinions," said Senator DeMint. "In our meeting together and throughout his hearings, Judge Alito showed that he is a man of utmost intellect and integrity. I am confident that he will bring the wisdom and humility needed out our nation's highest court."
