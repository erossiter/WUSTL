SEN. DEMINT TO CHAIR HURRICANE PREDICTION HEARING
  On Wednesday at 2:00 p.m., Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), Chairman of Commerce Committee's Disaster Prediction and Prevention Subcommittee, will hold a hearing entitled "The Lifesaving Role of Accurate Hurricane Prediction."  
   The Disaster Prediction and Prevention Subcommittee has shared jurisdiction over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA). The National Weather Service operates under NOAA and is the primary source of weather data, forecasts, and warnings for the United States. 
   "Hurricane Katrina is a good example of how accurate predictions save lives. Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated because they got early and accurate information. This hearing will focus on what the National Weather Service did right in predicting the path and intensity of Hurricane Katrina, so we can duplicate and improve on that success in the future," said Chairman DeMint. 
   "Experts tell us we're entering a twenty-year period of increased severe storm intensity. Hurricane Katrina was likely the worst natural disaster to ever hit America, and it is likely just the beginning. The fact is that we're only in the first inning of a nine inning game, and we need to do every thing we can to maintain and improve accurate predictions of natural disasters."
