SEN. DEMINT CALLS FOR FULL DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION
  Sen. Jim DeMint, Chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, made the following statement Friday regarding the upcoming immigration reform debate. 
   "The Senate is scheduled to begin debate on the immigration plan this Monday, and yet we still haven't seen the bill. In fact, we're hearing the bill has not even been completed. This issue is far too important to jam into a couple days. It would be irresponsible for Congress to pass a long, complicated immigration bill that it knows very little about. Americans expect us to take our time and get this right."
   "As we understand it, this plan will grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants by allowing them to permanently stay here without ever having to return to their home countries. This can be fixed, but it will take time and there is no way the Senate can responsibly complete this debate in one week."
