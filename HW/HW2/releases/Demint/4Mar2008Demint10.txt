DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AWARDS $1 MILLION GRANT FOR UNION ROBOTICS TRAINING CENTER
  U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) today announced a $1 million competitive grant will be awarded for a Union robotics training center through the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
   This grant administered by the Catawba Council of Governments supports the construction of the workforce training center in the city of Union. In recent years, Union County has attracted several distribution centers to the area that require a highly-skilled and technically-trained workforce. Robotics manufacturing has been cited as a key to the growth of the automotive cluster in the Piedmont region.
   "I'm very pleased that the City of Union has been awarded this competitive grant," said Senator DeMint. "I know that the development of this training center has been a top priority for both the City of Union and Union County for quite some time, and I congratulate them for competing and winning this merit-based award. This kind of innovation and development will continue to help move South Carolina forward in the years ahead."
