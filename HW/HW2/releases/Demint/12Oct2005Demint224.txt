SEN. DEMINT COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S TAX ADVISORY PANEL
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) issued the following statement in response to the early recommendations from the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform:  
   "I hope the President's tax panel is not going to suggest putting a few Band-Aids on the current code. True tax reform requires the complete replacement of the IRS tax code with a new system that is simple, fair, and that promotes savings and investment. 
   "By just capping two deductions and reforming the AMT, the tax panel would make the IRS tax code more complicated, less fair, and more anti-growth than it is today. 
   "I have a lot of respect for the members of the commission, but these recommendations appear to be the brainchild of a group that is afraid to tackle the real problems in the tax code, and that prefers to continue to use our tax system to pick winners and losers. Instead of showing real insight and leadership, the panel wants to slap some lipstick on the pig and call it a day. 
   "If we want to make America the best place in the world do to business, we need to rip the IRS tax code out by its roots and replace it with a simple system that treats every American the same and that gives every American business a chance to compete in a global economy."
