DEMOCRATS HIJACK INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME CHILDREN TO EXPAND GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED HEALTH CARE
  Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement in response to the Democrat-controlled Senate using the States Children Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) reauthorization to pass a massive expansion of government-controlled healthcare. 
   "Congress should work to ensure every American has access to affordable private health insurance. Instead, the Democrats have hijacked a program for poor children to ram through a new entitlement to government-controlled health care for adults and upper-income families," said Senator DeMint. "Democrats are using this program intended for poor children to allow benefits for illegal immigrants, create new earmarks, gives handouts to labor unions, and force millions off of high quality private insurance. This large new entitlement will increase spending by billions of dollars and force higher taxes on working Americans."  
   The Democrat SCHIP bill also specifically ended an innovative program for health opportunity accounts (HOAs) that provide Medicaid beneficiaries with money to use for health care expenses. South Carolina began one of the nation's first HOA pilot programs earlier this year, but no other states will be permitted to participate. An amendment authored by Senator DeMint to restore the HOA pilot program was prevented from receiving a vote. 
   "This is a perfect example of how Democrats are wrestling control away from patients and forcing them onto government-run plans with fewer choices and lower quality. Health opportunity accounts are precisely the kind of creative, free-market solutions that lower prices and improve quality, patient-centered care. Governor Sanford deserves considerable credit for fighting so hard to give this opportunity for more health care choice to the people of South Carolina," said Senator DeMint. 
   "If states are ever going to be able to get a handle on escalating Medicaid costs, Congress needs to offer them more options rather than less options for doing so," South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford said. "We believe introducing market-based solutions to the Medicaid system will not only result in helping control the growth of the program, but that it will also ultimately result in better patient care. The bottom line is that we don't believe the answers to the healthcare challenges faced by states rest in Washington DC, and this bill represents a huge step in the wrong direction when it comes to letting states work toward innovative solutions to meet those challenges." 
   The Democrat bill to expand socialized medicine: 
   * Forbids states from following South Carolina's lead in utilizing innovative health opportunity accounts 
   * Removes 2 million Americans from private health insurance; 
   * Makes it easier for illegal immigrants to qualify for SCHIP and Medicaid benefits; 
   * Spends over $200 billion in federal and state taxpayer dollars over the next 10 years; 
   * Extends benefits to families at 400% of the federal poverty level ($82,600 for a family of four); 
   * Allows states to continue using money intended for children to enroll adults (some states currently enroll more adults than children); 
   * Increases taxes on cigarettes, a tax that disproportionately falls on Americans at or below the poverty level. 
   * Includes earmarks added secretly without debate or a vote that would funnel taxpayer money to a hospital in Tennessee and bolster pensions for labor unions in Michigan. 
   "The focus of this debate has shifted from providing low-income children with health care, to moving our country toward a system of European style socialized medicine no matter the cost," said Senator DeMint. "Republicans created this program in 1997 to help low-income children, but Democrats are trying to use it to sneak Hillarycare in the back-door. Many would be surprised that today nearly half of all American children have government sponsored health care. This bill could lead more than 70 percent of kids being forced onto government-controlled plans. Americans have already rejected socialized medicine that leads to waiting lines and government appointed doctors. I believe that we can help every American afford health insurance by reforming our tax code to treat all Americans equally and allow every individual and family to choose a portable, affordable private health insurance policy that is right for them."
