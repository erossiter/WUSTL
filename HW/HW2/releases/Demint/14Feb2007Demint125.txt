SEN. DEMINT OPPOSES BUDGET-BUSTING SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) today voted against the omnibus spending bill for Fiscal Year 2007, H.J. Res. 20. The omnibus passed by a vote of 81-15. 
   "The flaws in this bill far outweigh the minor improvements it makes in some areas," said Senator DeMint. "I applaud Democrats for not creating any new earmarks, yet they missed our best opportunity to completely end hidden earmarks."  
   "Democrats are failing to live up to their campaign pledges of open and honest government. They used a variety of budget gimmicks in this bill that break the budget. This is Enron-style accounting that attempts to pull the wool over the eyes of the public." 
   Flaws in H.J. Res. 20: 
   * Doesn't go far enough to stop hidden earmarks, 95% of earmarks could still be funded. 
   - The bill says earmarks written into reports shall have no "legal effect," but it does not clearly state that these hidden earmarks have no "guiding effect." Ninety-five percent of all earmarks are not even written in appropriations bills and already have no legal effect. If we don't fix the language in this omnibus spending bill, all of these earmarks could continue. In addition, the language does not turn off earmarks that may be requested through direct communications between lawmakers and the agencies, either by phone or in private emails. 
   * Uses accounting gimmicks to exceed budget and overspend on Democrat preferred projects. As reported by McClatchy News ("Analysts See Tricks in Democrats Budget Bill" by James Rosen, February 13, 2007): 
   - "The measure provides $2.49 billion for the ongoing realignment and closing of military bases, less than half the amount authorized by the last Congress. There is bipartisan agreement to make up the difference - $3.14 billion - in subsequent 'emergency' supplemental appropriations." 
   - "The measure eliminates $3.5 billion in 'contract authority' for federal highway projects, but it doesn't decrease 'obligation limitations' by an equivalent amount. Congress uses "contract authority" to set how much money states can seek in highway grants, but it doesn't determine how much money they actually get. Appropriators make those decisions each year by setting 'obligation limitations,' and those limitations must be lowered in order for the actual spending to be decreased. 
   - "The bill puts a $625 million cap on the amount of money to be distributed from the Crime Victims Fund, which Congress created in 1984 to help the victims of heinous crimes. The cap saves $1.25 billion on paper, but the government is required to pay the crime victims, so there will be no corresponding reduction in spending." 
   * Senators were denied the right to offer any amendments. As reported by Congressional Quarterly, the bill did not undergo the amendment process in either the House or Senate ("Senate Set to Limit Debate on Spending Bill" by Liriel Higa, February 12, 2007): 
   - "On Monday, several Republicans took to the floor, seeking to amend the measure. But they were thwarted when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., brought the resolution to the floor Feb. 8 and used a parliamentary maneuver known as 'filling the amendment tree' to prevent other lawmakers from offering amendments."
