SENATE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVES SEN. DEMINT, REP. PELOSI EARMARK TRANSPARENCY REFORM
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement after the Senate unanimously approved an amendment he sponsored that would require disclosure of all earmarks on the internet 48 hours before they are voted on. U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California) authored similar reforms that passed the House earlier this year.  
   "I'm pleased we were able to work in a bipartisan way to make sure the Senate is completely transparent when it comes to congressional earmarks," said Senator DeMint. "This is a very important first step in earmark reform, and it is a victory for American taxpayers. However, the Senate lobbying reform bill still does not do enough to prevent Congress from steering taxpayer dollars to special interest projects. 
   "The outcome we achieved on earmark disclosure demonstrates that we can work together to achieve meaningful results and I hope we can continue this progress by considering several important reform amendments that are currently pending." 
   "We need to stop earmarks from being airdropped into conference reports without being considered in either the House or the Senate. We also need to consider and vote on the Legislative Line Item Veto amendment that would allow the President to have Congress reconsider questionable earmarks that make it into the budget and annual spending bills." 
   The DeMint-Pelosi Amendment requires: 
   * Disclosure of earmarks for federal projects; 
   * Disclosure of all earmarks contained in report language, which is where approximately 95 percent of earmarks are prescribed; and 
   * Members seeking earmarks provide written information to committee of jurisdiction, which must be made available to the public on the Internet in a searchable format 48 hours prior to consideration. 
   Senator DeMint has sponsored an amendment that prohibits adding preventing out-of-scope earmarks that were not in either the House or Senate versions of the bill from being "airdropped" into a conference report. Senator DeMint has cosponsored the Legislative Line Item Veto amendment with Senator Judd Gregg (R-New Hampshire).
