SEN. DEMINT OPPOSES BILL TO RAISE ENERGY PRICES ON AMERICAN FAMILIES
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement Friday after he voted against the Democrat energy bill, H.R. 6, that passed the Senate late Thursday night on a 65-27 vote. 
   "This bill will raise energy prices for American families at the gas pump and on their utility bills," said Senator DeMint. "There are many things we could do to lower the costs of energy in America and lower our dependency on foreign oil, but Democrats have refused. This bill does nothing to increase our domestic energy supply. Instead it increases regulation and bureaucracy that will raise energy costs on American families and businesses."
   "Thankfully, we defeated Senate Democrats' attempt to raise taxes that would have made this bill far worse. However, they have promised to add this measure behind closed doors in a House-Senate conference. If Democrats have their way, experts predict it could double the cost of gas at the pump over the next decade. Higher energy prices would significantly impact our national economy and raise prices on thousands of products. I hope my colleagues realize that this bill is not a solution to America's energy challenge and work to stop it," said Senator DeMint.
   Senator DeMint offered an amendment that was rejected that would have created required 60 votes to pass any legislation that would increase the price of gasoline. According to a study completed this week by the Heritage Foundation, this energy bill itself could result in significantly higher prices for gasoline consumers. The review showed that the legislation, including the tax hikes threatened to be added in a House-Senate conference, could increase the price of regular unleaded gasoline from the current $3.14 per gallon average to $6.40 by 2016. That amounts to a 104 percent increase in the price of gas at the pump.
