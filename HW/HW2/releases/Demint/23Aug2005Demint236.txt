SEN. DEMINT ANNOUNCES SAFE SCHOOLS, HEALTHY STUDENTS GRANTS
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) announced two Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS) grants totaling more than $1.7 million.  
 The SS/HS Initiative is a unique Federal grant-making program designed to prevent violence and substance abuse among our nation's youth, schools and communities. 
   The following school districts received the grants: 
   * The Marion School District Two: $813,679 
   * Lancaster County School District: $894,523 
   The SS/HS Initiative is an unprecedented collaborative grant program supported by three Federal agencies-the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Justice. The SS/HS Initiative seeks to develop real-world knowledge about what works best to promote safe and healthy environments in which America's children can learn and develop. 
   Grantees are implementing comprehensive programs that address all of the following six elements: 
   * A safe school environment 
   * Violence, alcohol, and drug abuse prevention and early intervention programs 
   * School and community mental health preventive and treatment intervention services 
   * Early childhood psychosocial and emotional development services 
   * Supporting and connecting schools and communities; Education reform 
   * Safe school policies 
   "Regardless of the school, students deserve a learning environment that is free of violence and is a safe place to study. I'm hopeful that these grants are just the latest development that will make SC schools some of the best in the country," said Senator DeMint.
