SEN. DEMINT: PRESIDENT ALREADY HAS VIRTUAL LINE ITEM VETO
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) called on President George W. Bush to allow his administration to exercise their authority not to fund non-legislated earmarks. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), "Committee reports and managers' statements do not have statutory force, agencies are not legally bound by their declarations."  
   "I applaud the President for supporting line-item veto authority. Earmarks have gotten out of control and Congress should act quickly to give the President this important fiscal tool," said Senator DeMint. 
   "But the President also needs to step up to the plate with the authority he already has. A majority of the earmarks funded each year are only written in committee reports and do not carry the force of law. The President can already exercise a virtual line item veto. 
   "If the President wants to start vetoing line items in the budget, he can start today by instructing his cabinet to ignore wasteful earmarks and direct funding toward their core missions. This would prevent the wasting of billion of dollars this year on line items that are not national priorities," said Senator DeMint.
