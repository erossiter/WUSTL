SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF CONSERVATIVE ICON WILLIAM BURKLEY
  U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement:  
   "America has lost one of its sharpest intellects and truest patriots today. William F. Buckley has been a guiding light for the conservative movement for over half a century. He was an inspiration to millions and a personal hero of mine. Buckley's passing reminds us that a generation of great Americans who built the modern conservative movement are leaving us, but thankfully their philosophical underpinnings are not. Standing on the shoulders of giants is an enormous responsibility; it is left to new generations of conservatives to do just that by carrying the banner of freedom and liberty forward." 
   "Debbie and I offer our deepest condolences to the Buckley family, his friends and his colleagues, who are all in our thoughts and prayers."
