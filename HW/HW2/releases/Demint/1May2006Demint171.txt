SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON TRUSTEES REPORT ON SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement: 
   "This report is another wakeup call that Medicare and Social Security are in critical condition," said DeMint. "Democrats who stick their heads in the sand and applaud their own obstruction are putting the retirement security of millions of Americans in jeopardy. We cannot allow cynics with no solutions to deter us from real reform. We are driving Social Security and Medicare over the cliff of financial instability, and we are losing precious time to change course."
   "Sadly, in March, fifty-three senators turned their backs on America's seniors by voting to continue the raid on Social Security that has been taking place for decades. There is simply no way to save Social Security if we don't have the courage to stop using the surplus as a secret slush fund. Congress must stop the raid on Social Security and make sure this money is only used to pay Social Security benefits."
   Earlier this year, fifty-three U.S. Senators voted against an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution, introduced by U.S. Senators Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), which would have allowed the Senate to create a reserve fund in the budget resolution to protect the Social Security surplus. The current Social Security system allows Congress to spend the Social Security surplus on other government programs. Including interest, Congress has raided $1.7 trillion from Social Security since 1985.
