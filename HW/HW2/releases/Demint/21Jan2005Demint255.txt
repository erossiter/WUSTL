SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S INAUGURATION
  DeMint Statement on President Bush's Inauguration  
   "Today, South Carolinians joined fellow Americans to celebrate the inauguration of President George W. Bush.  
 I am heartened by the President's message, and inspired by his determination to lead America to a more peaceful and secure future. 
   "As we celebrate this powerful act of democracy, it is most important to remember our men and women serving overseas to give millions the same opportunities we celebrate today. We must continue to fight the War on Terror with courage and strength to keep this a war on foreign soil rather than our own. A vital part of this fight is support for our troops. 
   "President Bush has proven, time and again, that he has the fortitude and judgment to tackle the important challenges, both foreign and domestic. I look forward to working closely with him and my colleagues in the Senate to save Social Security for all Americans and to promote job creation and provide economic relief for families through tax reform. The opportunity is ours to make a constructive difference for generations to come, and we cannot let it slip away."
