SEN. DEMINT SUPPORTS BILL TO LOWER GAS PRICES
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) cosponsored a bill to encourage the construction of additional oil refineries in the United States.  
 The Gas PRICE Act, sponsored by Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Chairman of the Senate Environment & Public Works Committee, would provide incentives to build refineries on former military bases (BRAC sites) and streamline the permitting process for refinery construction and expansion. 
   "We will never have energy independence without a strong and diverse refinery system," said Senator DeMint, who sits on the Senate Environment & Public Works Committee. "We must have reliable refineries to convert oil to usable gasoline. As Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have painfully shown us, we cannot concentrate all of our refineries in one region. Now is the time to get serious about building new capacity in new areas of the country." 
   The Gas PRICE Act would: 
   * Provide, through the Economic Development Administration (EDA), incentives to building refineries at Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) sites. 
   * Provide certainty for industry and the public for the construction of new refineries, and the expansion and operation of existing facilities while preserving states' rights. 
   * Encourage the EPA to reduce methane emissions and natural gas leaks by establishing grant programs to identify methane emission reduction technologies and conducting workshops in oil and gas producing states. 
   * Require the EPA to establish a demonstration project to experiment with the use Fischer-Tropsche (diesel and jet) fuels as an emission control strategy. 
   "Military bases that are scheduled to close already have the infrastructure and workforce ready to move forward," DeMint concluded. "This is a commonsense solution to a serious problem."
