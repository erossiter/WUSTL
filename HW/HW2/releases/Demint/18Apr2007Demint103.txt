SEN. DEMINT APPLAUDS SUPREME COURT RULING ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) issued the following statement after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the nationwide ban on partial birth abortion. The 5-4 ruling upheld the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed into law in 2003.  
   "I applaud the Court for this important ruling on partial birth abortion. It upholds the will of the American people and confirms the ban on this horrible abortion procedure. We must continue to work as a nation to preserve and protect all life at every stage, not end it so young and so brutally." 
   Senator DeMint was an original cosponsor the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.
