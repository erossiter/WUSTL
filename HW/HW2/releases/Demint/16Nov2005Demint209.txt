SEN. DEMINT MEETS WITH JUDGE ALITO
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following remarks after meeting privately with Supreme Court nominee Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  
   "We had a great meeting. I asked him tough questions and he gave me frank and honest answers. Judge Alito showed me that he has all the qualities of an intelligent and thoughtful jurist. He has unquestionable constitutional credentials and a long judicial track record that proves he does not mix his personal beliefs with his legal interpretations. This is very important because we don't need a legislator on the bench. We need someone who will narrowly interpret our laws, not create them. 
   "I intend to vote for him. While he still has his hearings in January, at this point, I can't see any reason why I would not wholeheartedly support him. Judge Alito is a conservative and believes the Constitution is a textual document that has words that must be adhered to rather than a living, breathing document that changes over time. 
   "As I have said before, I believe what's really on trial in this debate is the United States Senate and whether it can demonstrate civility and character in the confirmation process. In 1990, Judge Alito was unanimously confirmed by a Democrat-controlled Senate. Now that he has been nominated to the Supreme Court, I hope Democrats will be consistent and resist the temptation to obstruct the process and deny him an up-or-down vote. 
   "As I have said before, if Democrats filibuster and obstruct this nominee, I will vote to restore Senate tradition and guarantee him an up-or-down vote. Judge Alito is a dignified man and he deserves a fair hearing and a fair vote. 
   "Judge Alito has impressed Americans with his qualifications, and I have all the confidence in the world that he will demonstrate his ability to serve on the Court in a way that is even-handed and open-minded, and that he will be our next Supreme Court justice."
