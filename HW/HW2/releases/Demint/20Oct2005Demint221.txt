DISASTER ALERT SYSTEM APPROVED BY COMMERCE COMMITTEE
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) applauded the Senate Commerce Committee's unanimous approval of S. 1753, The Warning Alert, and Response Network Act. In September, Sens. DeMint and Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Disaster Prevention and Prediction, introduced the bipartisan legislation. The bill seeks to utilize modern technology to ensure America's communities receive the alerts and warnings necessary to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, manmade accidents and terrorist attacks  
   "I'm pleased that my colleagues understand the urgency of developing a comprehensive and modern alert system," said Senator DeMint, Chairman of Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Disaster Prediction and Prevention. "Without a way to properly alert those in danger, even the most accurate disaster prediction is useless. Today, we can use modern technology to reach Americans with critical safety information. With this bill, a mother picking up her kids from school would be able to have the latest alert for her community sent straight to her cell phone." 
   "The WARN Act will provide an effective and consistent method to warn Americans when their life is at risk. While the warnings in advance of Katrina were very widely disseminated, we learned that the threat to life continues after the storm passes. This bill provides the tools to alert communities about the provision of ice, water and other life-sustaining resources. I'm very appreciative of Chairman Stevens' leadership to make this critical need a top priority," said Senator DeMint. 
   The International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), comprised of nearly 13,000 members, has endorsed the WARN Act, stating, "This legislation would create a nationwide communications system to make first responders and the public better informed and prepared for all hazards, including terrorist attacks." 
   Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Co-Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), and Senators David Vitter (R-La.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) are co-sponsors of the legislation. 
   The WARN Act would: 
   * Establishing a network for the transmission of alerts across a broad variety of media, including cell phones, blackberry, digital, analog, cable and satellite television and radio, as well as non-traditional media such as sirens and "radios-on-a-stick." 
   * Providing federal, state and local emergency managers with alert tools and the ability to send out geographically targeted alerts only to those communities at risk. 
   * Establishing a grant program to help remote communities install sirens and other devices because of the lack of quality telecommunications infrastructure, ensuring that individuals in communities in tornado alley, some of which may not have high cell phone penetration, still get warnings about threatening storms. 
   * Providing at least $200 million for the research, development and deployment of technologies and equipment to operate the alert systems.
