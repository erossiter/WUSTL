SEN. DEMINT APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY EXPLORATION BILL
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement Monday after Congress passed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act before it recessed for the year. The President is expected to sign the measure.  
   "After months of negotiation, I'm pleased we reached a bipartisan agreement to boost America's energy independence," said Senator DeMint. "This will help reduce the cost of living for American families that are still stinging from the summer energy crisis. I think this shows many in Congress heard voters frustration in November and we were able to come together to pass a responsible energy bill to help secure America's future." 
   Senator DeMint was part of a bipartisan group of House and Senate members that worked to reach agreement on energy exploration bills that passed both houses of Congress earlier this year. 
   "Expanding our energy exploration in the Gulf of Mexico is part of the solution to our energy crisis, but we must do more. We should continue to increase our domestic energy supply, eliminate regulatory roadblocks that needlessly raise costs, and diversify our sources to clean alternatives like hydrogen and nuclear power." 
   "High energy costs are making it hard for American families to make ends meet and they are costing American businesses thousands of jobs. If we fail to address rising energy costs, we will create yet another incentive for businesses to locate overseas and leave American workers behind." 
   * Over the last two years, the price of crude oil rose from $34 per barrel to high of around $77 per barrel, and over a six year period, America's annual natural gas bill rose from $50 billion to $200 billion. 
   * The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act provides for opening over 8.3 million acres on the outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing. 
   * Estimates show the bill will make available 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The natural gas supply made available by this bill is enough to heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years. 
   * According to the Energy Information Agency (EIA), in 2025, U.S. petroleum supply is projected to be 10.4 million barrels of oil per day, while our demand is expected to be 26.1 million barrels per day.
