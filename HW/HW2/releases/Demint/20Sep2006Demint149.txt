SEN. DEMINT: TERRORIST INTERROGATION PROGRAM MUST CONTINUE
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement Wednesday regarding the "Bringing Terrorists to Justice Act," which would preserve the ability of U.S. officials to perform aggressive interrogations of high-value terrorist suspects and authorize military tribunals to bring them to justice: 
   "The Supreme Court's recent decision temporarily stopped our detainee interrogation program, effectively calling a time-out on our ability to fight the War on Terrorism. The Senate must act soon to make this program lawful and make America safer."
   "Our detainee interrogation program has been a huge success, and I fully support the President on this issue. Information obtained from terrorists has been essential in preventing attacks and saving American lives. While some disagree with this program, we cannot weaken our ability to protect Americans because of fear of world opinion.
   "The specific details of the final bill are still being discussed but I'm hopeful we will be able to move this legislation through the Senate soon. American lives depend on it."
