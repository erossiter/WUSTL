SEN. DEMINT APPLAUDS HOUSE ACTION TO STOP RAID ON SOCIAL SECURITY
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) released the following statement in response to members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee offering companion legislation that stops the raid on Social Security. Sen.  
 DeMint will introduce the Senate bill Thursday. 
   "I'm very happy that Republicans in the House and Senate are uniting to stop the secret raid on Social Security," said Senator DeMint. "This advances the most important principle of long-term reform: Social Security money must be used for Social Security. Americans are outraged over the raid, and they want it to stop now." 
   "The President has shown great leadership and courage on this issue. Social Security reform gives us an opportunity of a generation. We have the opportunity to turn the largest tax program Americans pay into the largest savings plan most Americans will have. We can turn a retirement program that makes people dependent on politicians into one that gives Americans more ownership, freedom, and security. 
   "Now is the time to act. We can't swallow the whole apple in one bite, but we can take the first step and stop the raid. Before we can solve the long-term problems, we must first restore trust with the American people so they see Social Security as something more than a tax and spend program." 
   "Democrats claim they only want to spend Social Security funds on Social Security; we are about to find out if they are serious. Let's see if the Party of 'No' can say 'no' to stopping the raid on Social Security."
