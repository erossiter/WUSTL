SEN. DEMINT OPPOSES SURRENDER DATE, WASTEFUL SPENDING
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) voted against the conference report of H.R. 1591, the supplemental appropriations bill, which requires American troops to withdraw from Iraq beginning October 1st of this year, and contains more than $20 billion in unrelated spending. The measure passed the Senate 51-46 and President Bush has promised to veto it. 
   "Americans don't want to lose this war, they want to win and we can't do that by announcing a surrender date to Al Qaeda," said Senator DeMint. "Our brave troops are risking their lives because they know victory in Iraq is critical to the future safety of Americans. It is insulting to the sacrifices our troops have made for Democrats to declare the war is lost and vote to surrender to terrorists.
   "If Harry Reid believes the war is lost, then he should stop the war funding now and bring our troops home. Instead, he is playing a risky political game in an attempt to embarrass our Commander in Chief."
   "President Bush should and will veto this defeatist legislation that contains billions in unrelated spending. Since Democrats insisted on this pointless exercise, our troops will have to wait even longer to get the funding and equipment they need to defend themselves. I hope Congress can now work quickly to get a real war supplemental to the President that is free of politics and pork."
