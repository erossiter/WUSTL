SEN. DEMINT RECEIVES 'TAXPAYERS' FRIEND AWARD'
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) was presented with the "Taxpayers' Friend Award," this week, by the National Taxpayers Union (NTU). The NTU is a national taxpayers' advocacy group.  
   "If we're going to secure the future for the next generation, we must continue to fight for lower and fairer taxes for every American," said DeMint. "The federal tax code is the number one job killer in the United States, and it's time to replace it a new system that is simple, fair, and pro-growth." 
   The "Taxpayers' Friend Award" is awarded to Members of the House and Senate who receive a grade of "A" on the NTU's annual ratings. The Rating, based on hundreds of roll call votes, is considered the most comprehensive scorecard available on federal tax, spending, and regulatory issues. The Rating is based on every roll call vote affecting fiscal policy (182 House and 93 Senate votes for 2004), and assigns a "Taxpayer Score" to each Member of Congress that indicates his or her commitment to reducing or controlling federal spending, taxes, debt, and regulation. 
   "Congress has a reputation for overtaxing, overspending, and over regulating," said DeMint. "After paying the bills and paying Uncle Sam, many American families do not have enough to save for the future. Congress must reign in spending, reduce the tax burden, and focus on ways to give Americans more control over their lives." 
   The 350,000-member NTU is a non-partisan citizen organization working for lower taxes, less wasteful spending, and more accountable government at all levels. 
   DeMint concluded, "I'm honored to receive this award, and I appreciate the NTU for the hard work they are doing for American taxpayers."
