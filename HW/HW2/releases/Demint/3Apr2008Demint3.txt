SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE GOP EARMARK TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS
  Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement: 
   "Congress must kick the earmark addiction and these recommendations are a first step in the right direction. The task force has sent the message that Republicans are ready to move ahead with reforms, and we need to start by cleaning up our own house.
   "The President called on Congress to stop writing earmarks in secret reports and start writing them in our bills where they can be openly debated and voted on. I'm glad to see senior appropriators in my own party expressing support for additional transparency. I thank Leader Mitch McConnell for creating the task force and recognizing the need for real earmark reform.
   "We have heard a lot of talk about cleaning up wasteful Washington spending, but Americans want to see action. They want to see an end to pork projects that fund bridges to nowhere, fruit fly research in Paris, and hippie museums. They want the earmark waste and the corruption to stop.
   "Our party needs to lead by example and prove we are serious about fiscal responsibility. I hope more Republicans refuse to play in the earmark favor factory and that our leaders will insist on these basic reforms for our own conference."
   The GOP Task Force recommended that the Senate save funds from stricken wasteful earmarks to pay down the national deficit. Senator DeMint has authored legislation to create a deficit reduction account in every appropriations bill to allow for this.
