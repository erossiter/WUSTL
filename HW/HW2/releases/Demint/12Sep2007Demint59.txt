SEN. DEMINT: SENATE SHORTCHANGES INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WASTEFUL EARMARK SPENDING
  Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) voted against the Senate's $104.6 billion transportation and housing appropriations bill that spent $3.1 billion over the President's request and contained over 800 new earmarks that cost taxpayers over $2.5 billion. The Senate rejected attempts by Senator DeMint and others to reduce the cost of repairing the nation's infrastructure and put public safety ahead of pork projects. President Bush has promised to veto the bill due to excessive spending and misplaced priorities. 
   "It's disappointing that just weeks after the heartbreaking bridge collapse in Minnesota, the Senate refused to make public safety a priority over special interests and pork barrel projects," said Senator DeMint. "It's absurd and embarrassing that some continue to call for a gas tax increase while Congress wastes millions of dollars on bike paths, baseball parks, and gardens. In fact, the Senate refused to simply suspend a 76-year-old regulation that needlessly raises the cost of repairing roads and bridges by 35 percent."  
   The Senate rejected an amendment by Senator DeMint that would have waived Davis-Bacon regulations for bridges in need of urgent repair, providing regulatory relief and lowering costs to build and maintain more bridges with less money. The Federal Highway Administration has classified 153,990 bridges in the United States that are either "structurally deficient" or "functionally obsolete." These bridges represent 21 percent of all the bridges in the country and have either failed to meet bridge safety standards or cannot be used at all. According to the Associated Builders and Contractors, the "Davis Bacon Act wage rules increase the cost of public construction projects anywhere from 5 to 38 percent above what the project would have cost in the private sector." The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a full repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act would save Americans $1 billion annually. 
   According to the nonpartisan government watchdog group Taxpayers for Commonsense, the bill contains at least 839 earmarked projects, worth more than $2.5 billion. This total includes 12 secret earmarks worth approximately $83 million that were not attributed to any member. The Senate rejected attempts by Senators DeMint and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) to ensure public safety took priority over wasteful earmarks. These amendments would have:
   * Prohibited funds from being used for earmarks until all structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges have been repaired, with limited exceptions; 
   * Prohibited the use of funds for bicycle paths so that the funds can be used to improve bridge and road safety. 
   * Struck $450,000 in funding for the International Peace Garden in Dunseith, North Dakota; 
   * Required that the housing needs of all Louisiana residents displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are met before spending money to design or construct a Wetland Center in Lake Charles, Louisiana; 
   * Struck $500,000 in funding for construction of a new baseball stadium in Billings, Montana; 
   "There's been a lot of rhetoric this year about fiscal responsibility, but these votes prove it's been nothing but hot air. Too many senators are putting pork projects ahead of national priorities and they just proved why this Congress deserves the lowest approval ratings in history." 
   A new Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General report requested by Senator Coburn contains the following findings. (Click here to read the full report.)
   * Department of Transportation (DOT) earmarks have increased in number by 1,150 percent in 10 years (1996 - 2005), with the value of earmarks in the same timeframe jumping 314 percent. 
   * Ninety-nine percent of earmarks (7,724 out of 7,760) were not subject to the transportation agencies' review and selection processes or bypassed the states' normal planning and programming processes. 
   * Earmarks may not be the most effective or efficient use of funds. The IG report identifies five ways in which earmarks impact programs in the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration, as follows (see pages 11 - 14 of the full report): 
   1. Earmarks can reduce funding for the states' core transportation programs. 
   2. Earmarks do not always coincide with DOT strategic research goals. 
   3. Many low priority, earmarked projects are being funded over higher priority, non-earmarked projects. 
   4. Earmarks provide funds for projects that would otherwise be ineligible. 
   5. Earmarks can disrupt the agency's ability to fund programs as designated when authorized funding amounts are exceeded by "overearmarking."
