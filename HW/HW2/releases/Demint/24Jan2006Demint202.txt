SEN. DEMINT TO VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE ALITO TO SUPREME COURT
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint made the following statement after the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably recommended the nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States:  
   "I will wholeheartedly support Judge Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court, because he is exactly the kind of thoughtful jurist that America wants and deserves. After Judge Alito has endured eighteen hours of testimony and answered more than six hundred questions, one thing is clear: he will follow the law, not create it. 
   "Sadly, Democrats have decided to vote in lockstep against this distinguished public servant. During the hearings, Democrats were embarrassing as they attempted to smear Judge Alito's character, and the American people were rightfully appalled. 
   "The hearings did serve one useful purpose, they exposed two competing judicial philosophies. Democrats believe the judiciary should be used to advance liberal policies that Americans have rejected at the polls. This is the philosophy that has led to decisions to ban the Pledge of Allegiance and allow governments to take an American's home for better tax revenue. 
   "Republicans and most Americans have a different view, that judges should not prejudge cases to fit their personal political views. They should thoughtfully approach each case, and decide according to the Constitution and the law written by democratically elected representatives. 
   "The consistent winner in Judge Alito's court has not been a person, a business, a branch of government, or a political ideology - it has been the Constitution and the rule of law. That is what Democrats fear, and that is why Americans overwhelmingly support the nomination of Judge Alito.
