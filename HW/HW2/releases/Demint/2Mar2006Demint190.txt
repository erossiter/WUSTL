SEN. DEMINT: PATRIOT ACT IS VITAL TOOL IN WAR ON TERROR
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement after the Senate voted of 89 to 10 to approve the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act. 
   "The Patriot Act has been a vital weapon in our arsenal to win the War on Terror," said Senator DeMint. "South Carolinians understand that we must use every tool available to defend ourselves against the threat of terrorism. The Patriot Act has already led to the arrest and prosecution of terrorists within the United States, and has strengthened the ability to control our borders."
   Reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act restores the critical law enforcement tools that have prevented terrorist attacks, and have proved instrumental in dismantling several terrorist cells in the United States. Key provisions include critical terrorist surveillance authority, enhanced border and immigration security standards, authority to detect and prevent terrorist financing, and expanded information-sharing amongst law enforcement agencies. The law also provides enhanced protections for citizens' rights and increased judicial and congressional oversight.
   "As we continue to debate the security of our nation's seaports, it's important to note the Patriot Act contains several measures to strengthen port security," said Senator DeMint.
   An entire Title of the Patriot Act Conference Report is devoted to combating terrorism at America's ports. Known as the "Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2005," Title III of the Patriot Act strengthens current law and takes a number of steps to improve our nation's ability to secure our ports and thwart terrorists.
