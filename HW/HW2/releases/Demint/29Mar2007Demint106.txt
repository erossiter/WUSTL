SEN. DEMINT OPPOSES 'PORK AND RETREAT' WAR SUPPLEMENTAL
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) voted against H.R. 1591, the supplemental appropriations bill, which required a date-certain troop withdrawal from Iraq and included more than $20 billion in unrelated, wasteful spending.  
   "This wasn't a serious effort to fund our troops; it was a political statement full of pork-barrel spending," said Senator DeMint. "If Democrats are against the war in Iraq, they should have the courage to cut off funds and bring our troops home. Instead, they are playing political games while our troops will have to wait for the funds and equipment they need. I believe we must complete our mission in Iraq with victory and honor because it is vital to the safety of our nation." 
   Senator DeMint forced two votes on against funding for spinach and Christmas trees in the war supplemental. The Senate voted 96-1 against spending $25 million on spinach. Moments later, the Senate voted 57-41 in favor of spending $40 million on Christmas trees and ornamental shrubs. 
   "It's outrageous to spend millions for Christmas trees and ornamental shrubs on a war supplemental," said Senator DeMint. 
   Over 25% of the funding contained in this bill is unrelated to the war. Examples of wasteful spending in the war supplemental include: 
   * $24 million for funding for sugar beets. 
   * $3 million for funding for sugar cane. 
   * $20 million for insect infestation damage reimbursements. 
   * $13 million for Ewe Lamb Replacement and Retention Program. 
   * $3.5 million in funding for guided tours of the Capitol and a provision that allows transfer of funds from holiday ornament sales in the Senate gift shop. 
   * $165.9 million for fisheries 
   * $12 million for forest service 
   * $25 million for asbestos abatement at the Capitol Power Plant. 
   * $31 million for one month extension of Milk Income Loss Contract program.
