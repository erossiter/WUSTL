SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO CONFIRM JUSTICE JANICE BROWN
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today made the following statement following the Senate's 56-43 vote to confirm Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  
   "Now that Justice Brown has been allowed a vote, she has been confirmed with bipartisan majority support because she understands that her job is to interpret the law, not to invent the law." 
   "Janice Rogers Brown is a jurist of great intelligence and achievement. After a year and a half of obstruction, there is no evidence that she lacks the integrity, intellect, or experience necessary." 
   "Americans are tired and frustrated with those in Congress who want to waste time on partisan filibusters. While today's vote is a step forward, we must ensure all of the President's judicial nominees receive the timely up-or-down votes they deserve." 
   Justice Brown is the second judicial nominee to advance under a May 23 deal struck by seven Democrats and seven Republicans. The agreement allows for confirmation votes on only three of Bush's judicial nominees while preserving opponents' ability to filibuster under "extraordinary" circumstances.
