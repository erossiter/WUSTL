EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS EXPANDING IN GREENVILLE
  Options for education in Greenville County just keep getting better.  
   Clemson University, the Greenville County School District (GCSD) and the International Center for Automative Research (ICAR) have joined forces to create the Clemson University - International Center for Automotive Research charter school. Currently, through the J.L. Mann High School, students can take "in-depth courses of study" in mathematics, technology and science. The plan is to expand the program and house it in a location not yet announced. A strong proponent of creating more opportunities for those seeking education, Sen. DeMint has thrown his full support behind the program, assigning two of his staff members to the CU-ICAR Land Task Force: Regional Director Mark Cothran and Interim Grants Coordinator Jessi Knight. 
   Recently, Cothran and Knight met with representatives from Clemson University, GCSD, and ICAR to tour the proposed locations for the center and discuss its progress. Both were impressed by what they saw and heard, excited about what the program will bring to the state as a whole. 
   "By identifying the best and brightest students early on," Cothran said, "we can encourage them to remain involved in mathematics and technology throughout their academic careers and keep South Carolina at the forefront of economic competitiveness."
