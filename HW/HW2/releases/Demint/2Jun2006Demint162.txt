ASHLEY HOLBROOK NAMED REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR SEN. DEMINT
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) announced Ashley Holbrook as his new First District Regional Director. Holbrook replaces outgoing Regional Director Ellen Nobles who is getting married and relocating to Virginia. 
   "I'm happy for Ellen; she did a great job and represented me very well. I'm also pleased to announce Ashley's promotion. As a Lowcountry native and a veteran of my staff, Ashley will be able to hit the ground running," said Senator DeMint.
   Holbrook previously worked as a Legislative Assistant to Senator DeMint on a myriad of issues including judicial appointments, education and adoption in his Washington, D.C. Senate office. Prior to that, she worked with the Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush on judicial nominations. She is a graduate of the Porter-Gaud School and the University of Georgia. While a student at UGA, Holbrook studied in England at Oxford University.
   Luke Byars, State Director for Senator DeMint added, "Ashley will do an excellent job for us on the coast. She has already done a terrific job for the President in the White House and for Senator DeMint in our Washington Office."
   Holbrook will manage day-to-day affairs in the Charleston office and facilitate other U.S. Senate business throughout the First Congressional District. Senator DeMint presently has state offices in Charleston, Columbia and Greenville.
   Holbrook said, "I am excited to come back home to the Lowcountry and continue my service to Senator DeMint. He really does have the right ideas at the right time and is making a tremendous difference for the State of South Carolina in the United States Senate."
