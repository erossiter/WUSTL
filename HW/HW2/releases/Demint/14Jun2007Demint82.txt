SEN. DEMINT SEEKS TO PREVENT CONGRESS FROM INCREASING PRICE OF GAS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) announced that he plans to offer an amendment to the energy bill to create a 60 vote point of order against legislation or amendments that increase the cost of gasoline.  
   "Every day drivers head to the gas pump and find increasingly high fuel prices. There are many factors beyond our control that are responsible for the cost of gasoline, but the least we can do is prevent Congress from passing laws that make gas more expensive. When it comes to gas prices, Congress should adopt a first-do-no-harm policy." 
   The DeMint amendment would create a point of order in the Senate against any legislation that would increase the price of gasoline. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would evaluate the legislation to determine if it would have the effect of increasing the national average price of a gallon of gasoline. If that is the case, the DeMint amendment would allow any Senator to raise a point of order objection against the legislation. The point of order could only be waived with a 60 vote super-majority of the Senate. 
   "As families across the county pack up their mini-vans and hit the road for summer vacation, my amendment will ensure that they are protected from the high cost of federal legislation," said DeMint. "This common-sense proposal is a step in the right direction for a rational national energy policy. Once we ensure that Congress doesn't increase gas prices, we can begin to pursue initiatives that will actually reduce the price of gas such as increasing our domestic oil exploration, expanding refining capacity, and eliminating costly boutique fuel requirements."
