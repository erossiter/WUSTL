SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON START OF ALITO HEARINGS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement at the conclusion of the first day of hearings on the nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States:  
   "Judge Alito showed us today why he is the right man for the job. 
   "His opening statement was impressive. This is a guy who has more judicial experience than any other nominee in seventy years. He has extensive background with constitutional law and the perfect temperament for the Supreme Court. He's modest, humble, and believes the Court should interpret the law, not create it. 
   "Many Democrats wrongly urged Judge Alito to announce he would take one side or another of particular cases. However, I thought Senator Kyl summed it up well when he said, 'The only relevant side is that of the law and the Constitution.' 
   "We saw a lot of grandstanding from Democrats who wanted to score political points, but Judge Alito rose above them and demonstrated how qualified he is for the job. He deserves nothing less than a fair hearing and a fair up or down vote."
