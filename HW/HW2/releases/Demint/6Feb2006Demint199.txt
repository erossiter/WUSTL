SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON NSA TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today made the following statement:  
   "After September 11th, Americans expect President Bush and Congress to use every tool available to stop future terrorist attacks. The terrorist surveillance program is exactly the type of measure that helps us gather vital information before its too late. 
   "We must be clear: the program applies only to international calls with suspected terrorists. Previous administrations, Democrat and Republican, have taken similar actions and court rulings have upheld their actions. The President has briefed Congressional leaders of both parties many times on the program, and he is acting in the best interests of our security. 
   "Any member of Congress who does not want the President to intercept and respond to international calls from terrorists does not understand the true nature of our enemy or the imminent danger we face. 
   "Sadly, now that details of this program have been leaked to the press, Democrats have decided to grandstand on this sensitive national security issue. In the 1990's, Congressional Democrats joined President Clinton in pursuing short-sighted policies that decimated our intelligence capabilities and shortchanged our national defense. Now, Democrats allow partisan rhetoric to block essential tools that the President needs to protect America in the War on Terror and then try to blame Republicans for not doing enough."
