SEN. DEMINT COMMENTS ON WITHDRAWAL OF MIERS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) issued the following statement following the withdrawal of Harriet Miers:  
   "Harriet Miers has asked the President to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court, and I respect her decision. She has had an impressive legal career, and I trust she will continue to serve the President with distinction. 
   "We must now wait for the President to select another nominee. I trust that he will nominate a highly qualified individual who will strictly interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. 
   "It's important the President and Senate work quickly as the Court is already beginning its second month without a replacement for Justice O'Connor."
