SEN. DEMINT SAYS DEFICIT NUMBERS MISLEADING
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today applauded Americans for helping reduce the federal deficit, but called on Congress to begin using honest accounting and stop raiding funds from Social Security.  
   DeMint's remarks came after news that the deficit will be $333 billion for 2005, $94 billion less than the earlier estimate of $427 billion. If Congress did not use the Social Security cash surplus for other programs, however, the deficit would be approximately $70 billion higher. 
   "Today's announcement demonstrates that when you let Americans keep more of their money, the economy grows, and tax revenues exceed expectations. But before anyone breaks out the champagne, we need to recognize that these numbers don't tell the full story. Congress is raiding Social Security to mask the true size of the deficit." 
   "Each year Americans pay more Social Security taxes than are needed to pay benefits. Congress then uses these surpluses to pay for other programs, which hides the true size of the federal deficit. Americans would go to jail for this kind of behavior in the private sector, but somehow politicians get away with it. 
   "It's time for Congress to stop using Social Security as a secret slush fund. Let's stop the raid and be honest. We must begin saving this money in true Social Security accounts that Americans own, so it cannot be raided by politicians in Washington. We must take these funds off the table and force Congress to get serious about controlling wasteful spending. This will also begin strengthening Social Security by saving money today that will help pay benefits tomorrow."
