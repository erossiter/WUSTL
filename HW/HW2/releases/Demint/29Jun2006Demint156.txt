SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT'S HAMDAN RULING
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) issued the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the Hamdan case: 
   "This decision is very disappointing. We're in the middle of a war on terror and we must have the ability to try terrorists using military commissions. It would be completely inappropriate and extremely harmful to our national security if we had to try terrorists in civilian courts.
   "It's not exactly clear at this point what this decision will mean but it appears to lay out a path for Congress to enact legislation, authorizing military commissions to try terrorists in the future.
   "Folks need to understand that the Court, however misguided its decision may be, did not call into question the government's power to detain terrorists while hostilities continue. This is critically important because we can't allow terrorists to return home and resume their plan to kill Americans. Guantanamo must remain open so long as it is in the national security interests of the United States."
