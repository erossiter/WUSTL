SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEMOCRATS' RESOLUTION OF DEFEAT
  Sen. Jim DeMint today made the following statement after Senate Democrats failed in their attempt to end debate on Iraq by a vote of 56-34. In the Senate, 60 votes are needed to cut off debate.  
   "This is the third time Democrats have tried to pass a resolution of defeat and disgrace. I opposed the first and second, and I oppose this one too," said Senator DeMint. "Today's action by Senator Reid is a political stunt with no substance. The only vote that matters is whether Congress will continue to fund our troops at war." 
   "As I've said on the Senate floor over the past several weeks, we only have two choices in Iraq. We can either strengthen our resolve until victory is achieved, or we can cut off funds and bring our troops home now in defeat. But this resolution would do nothing to stop the war; it would only discourage our troops and send a message to our enemies that we have lost our resolve." 
   "Critics in the senate are putting on a spectacle for the media and it is shameful." 
   Senator DeMint is a cosponsor Senator Judd Gregg's (R-New Hampshire) resolution to guarantee that Congress will not withhold funding from our troops who are in harm's way.
