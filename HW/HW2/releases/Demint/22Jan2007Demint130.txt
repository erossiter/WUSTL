SEN. DEMINT: LINE ITEM RESCISSION VOTE WILL 'EARMARK' REAL REFORMERS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) urged his Senate colleagues to vote in favor of the Line Item Rescission amendment sponsored by Sen. Judd Gregg (R-New Hampshire). The legislation would create important new checks while maintaining necessary balances to help reduce wasteful spending and pork projects known as "earmarks."  
   "Tomorrow's vote on line item rescission authority will 'earmark' real reformers who are serious about cleaning up the corruption in Washington," said Senator DeMint. "Congress has proven it is unable to fully police itself and this authority will create important checks and balances to stop wasteful spending. Americans are angry about runaway earmarks that led to corruption in the past, and this is one of the strongest tools we can have to prevent future abuse." 
   "This amendment is virtually identical to legislation authored by former Senator Tom Daschle in 1995, which was supported by 20 current Democrat Senators including Senator Robert Byrd. Tomorrow we will find out which senators will keep their word to end the culture of corruption in Washington and which senators engaged in election year rhetoric." 
   Senator DeMint has cosponsored the Line Item Rescission amendment with Senator Judd Gregg. The amendment would give the President the opportunity to force Congress to take a second look at wasteful spending - including both discretionary spending and new mandatory spending - as well as targeted tax cuts. 
   * President can send up to 4 rescission packages a year. 
   * Congress would be required to fast track the President's recommendation within 8 days. 
   * Unlike the previous 1996 line-item veto proposal, it requires Congressional affirmation of the President's rescission package. 
   * Savings from rescissions passed by Congress must be used for deficit reduction. 
   * It sunsets after 4 years - giving Congress the ability to evaluate merits of rescission authority after President Bush and his successor have had an opportunity to use it.
