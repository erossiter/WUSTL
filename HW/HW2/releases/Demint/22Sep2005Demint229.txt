SENATORS INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE CRUCIAL DISASTER ALERTS
  Today, Sens. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Disaster Prevention and Prediction, announced the introduction of S. 1753, the Warning, Alerts, and Response Network (WARN) Act. Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Co-Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), and Sens. David Vitter (R-La.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), and Trent Lott (R-Miss.) joined as co-sponsors of the legislation.  
   "Without a way to properly alert those in danger, even the most accurate of disaster predictions is useless," said Senator DeMint. "We need an effective and consistent method to warn Americans when their life is at risk and this bill will allow us to establish the needed alerts. While the warnings in advance of Katrina were very widely disseminated, we learned that the threat to life continues after the storm passes. The WARN Act will provide tools to alert communities about the provision of ice, water and other life-sustaining resources. " 
   "With communications technology rapidly advancing, it only makes sense to explore ways to utilize that technology to communicate warnings and alert citizens to the dangers present during crisis situations," said Nebraska's Senator Ben Nelson. "Though natural disasters like hurricanes usually come with some warning, using a system like this would be helpful in responding to unexpected crises like terrorist attacks and man-made disasters." 
   The WARN Act ensures America's communities receive the alerts and warnings necessary to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, manmade accidents and terrorist attacks by: 
   * Establishing a network for the transmission of alerts across a broad variety of media, including cell phones, blackberry, digital, analog, cable and satellite television and radio, as well as non-traditional media such as sirens and "radios-on-a-stick." 
   * Providing federal, state and local emergency managers with alert tools and the ability to send out geographically targeted alerts only to those communities at risk. 
   * Establishing a grant program to help remote communities install sirens and other devices because of the lack of quality telecommunications infrastructure, ensuring that individuals in communities in tornado alley, some of which may not have high cell phone penetration, still get warnings about threatening storms. 
   * Providing at least $250 million for the research, development and deployment of technologies and equipment to operate the alert systems. 
   "Co-Chairman Inouye and I have worked closely with Senators DeMint and Nelson to develop a bipartisan all hazards alert bill that we believe will have a significant impact on all Americans. I come from a generation that had only a radio-based emergency notification system. But today with so much new technology we do not have a uniform mechanism to contact our people in a time of crisis. We believe this bill overcomes that obstacle, allowing public safety officials to communicate with people through all forms of communication devices during a terrorist attack or natural disaster," said Senator Stevens. 
   "A good alert system can help spread the word to residents whether they need to prepare for a storm, evacuate or get needed help afterward," said Senator Vitter. "Hurricane Katrina highlighted the importance of early warnings, and with a system like the WARN Act would create, we can help avoid the confusion and frustration that come with a large-scale disaster." 
   "It is imperative that we improve the federal response to tragedies like Hurricane Katrina," said Senator Landrieu. "The best way to protect Americans from natural disasters is to give them enough time to properly prepare. The WARN Act will help ensure our citizens have the warning they need to stay out of harm's way." 
   "In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi, we need to review our first alert warning system to ensure all residents of communities in harm's way get the word to take cover or evacuate. This bill is a good first step toward meeting that need," said Senator Lott.
