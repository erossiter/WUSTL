SEN. DEMINT HAILS BUSH'S CALL FOR BALANCED BUDGET, EARMARK REFORM
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) issued the following statement Wednesday backing President Bush's call for a balanced budget within five years and earmark spending reform.  
   "I applaud President Bush's goal of balancing the budget in five years without raising taxes on hardworking Americans. He understands that balancing the budget requires low taxes and spending restraint. This means some tough decisions and the willingness of people in both parties to focus on true national priorities. 
   "I am pleased the President wants to reform the spending process in Washington that has led to wasteful pork-barrel spending. Earmarks have tripled in number over the last decade and increased spending by billions of dollars. The President wants to stop the practice of concealing earmarks in hidden reports, and I hope he will instruct his Cabinet to ignore these earmarks that do not have the force of law. With the President's leadership we now have new momentum to bring some needed sanity to the federal spending process."
