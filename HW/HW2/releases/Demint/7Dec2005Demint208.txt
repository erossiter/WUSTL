SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF GOV. CAMPBELL
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement:  
   "Today, South Carolina has lost one of its most admired public servants, and I've lost a good friend. Governor Campbell has always been a hero to me, a man of courage and conviction that brought pride to our state. 
   "Throughout his life, Governor Campbell worked to improve the lives of all South Carolinians. He was a visionary that understood South Carolina must compete in a global economy, and was instrumental in attracting businesses like BMW to our state. His tireless efforts helped bring our state's economy into the 21st Century. 
   "Personally, Governor Campbell helped me in my first campaign to fill a seat he once held in the U.S. House of Representatives. His friendship over the years, and that of his wife Iris, has meant the world to Debbie and me. We send our deepest sympathies to the entire Campbell family. Their love and devotion to one another as Governor Campbell battled Alzheimer's has been an inspiration to families across our state."
