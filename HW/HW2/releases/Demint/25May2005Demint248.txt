SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO CONFIRM JUSTICE OWEN
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) voted to confirm Priscilla Owen to U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.  
 Justice Owen was confirmed by the full Senate by a 56-43 vote. 
   "Justice Owen is a careful and thoughtful jurist," said Senator DeMint. "She is a model of a judge who interprets the law and does not legislate from the bench." 
   Justice Priscilla Owen has served on the Supreme Court of Texas since 1995. In 2000, Justice Owen was overwhelmingly reelected to a second term on the Supreme Court, receiving 84 percent of the vote. During Justice Owen's 2000 re-election bid, every major newspaper in Texas endorsed her. 
   "I'm pleased that Justice Owen finally got her vote in the United States Senate," said Senator DeMint. "This talented woman has been unfairly demonized for four years and yet she has shown judicial temperament in every way by never responding with bitterness or anger. Justice Owen deserved an up-or-down vote, she got one, and now she will be a member of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals." 
   On Monday, seven Republicans and seven Democrats signed a compromise agreement in which the Republicans pledged to oppose the constitutional option during the 109th Congress. In return, the Democrats pledged to stop blocking three nominees and to only block future nominees under "extraordinary circumstances." The deal leaves the definition of extraordinary circumstances up to each senator. 
   "I'm glad that some judges will finally get a fair up-or-down vote, but I'm concerned that the agreement does not settle the matter once and for all," said Senator DeMint. "Now its time for my Democrat colleagues to start using the restraint they promised in the agreement."
