SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO CONFIRM JUDGE ROBERTS AS CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today voted in favor of the nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge John G. Roberts Jr. to succeed the late William Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 The Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Roberts on a 78-22 vote. 
   "Judge Roberts is the kind of Justice America needs, and I was proud to cast my vote in favor of his nomination," said Senator DeMint. "He is brilliant, fair, and independent. Judge Roberts has the right judicial philosophy, and I'm confident he will strictly interpret the law, and not legislate from the bench. Judge Roberts is a man of integrity and has a humble approach to his role as chief justice." 
   Earlier this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 endorsing Judge Roberts to become Chief Justice, clearing the way for confirmation by the full Senate. It also set the stage for the debate over President Bush\'s choice to succeed retiring Justice Sandra Day O\'Connor. President Bush could announce his pick as early as this week. 
   "Now it's time for the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm an Associate Justice to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Conner," said Senator DeMint. "I'm confident this President will appoint another highly qualified individual who we can all support. While some Democrats will attack anyone the President nominates, I hope most will give the next nominee serious and fair consideration. Many Democrats just proved it is possible to set partisan politics aside, treat a nominee with dignity, and allow a fair up-or-down vote. We can only hope other Democrats learn from their positive example."
