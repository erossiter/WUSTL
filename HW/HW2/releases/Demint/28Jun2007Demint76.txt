SEN. DEMINT ON DEFEAT OF IMMIGRATION BILL: 'THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WON TODAY'
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement after the Senate immigration bill was defeated on a cloture vote of 46-53. This motion to end debate required 60 votes for adoption.  
   "When the U.S. Senate brought the Amnesty bill back up this week, they declared war on the American people. This act created a crisis of confidence in their government. Thankfully, the American people won today," said Senator DeMint. "This is remarkable because it shows that Americans are engaged and they care deeply about their country. They care enough for their country to get mad and to fight for it, and that's the most important thing of all. Americans made phone calls and sent letters, and convinced the Senate to stop this bill." 
   "The Senate rejected this bill and the heavy-handed tactics used to ram it through. Americans do not want more of the same - amnesty and broken promises on the border. Americans want legislation to be written in public - not in secret - and they want Congress to engage in an open and fair debate." 
   "There is a better way forward without this bill. The President has said that the border security measures can be implemented over the next 18 months, and they can be done under current law. Now the Administration needs to prove it and stop holding border security hostage for amnesty." 
   "Once we have secured the border and restored trust with the American people, we can begin to take additional steps."
