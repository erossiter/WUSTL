SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPORT BY ADVISORY PANEL ON FEDERAL TAX REFORM
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) issued the following statement in response to the final report presented to Treasury Secretary John Snow by the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform: 
   "This report includes some good ideas, but it leaves many out. These recommendations are small and quite complicated, and that's exactly what we're trying to get away from. I hope the President will consider these ideas along with some that go further. We need comprehensive reform that will make America the best place in the world to invest and do business."
