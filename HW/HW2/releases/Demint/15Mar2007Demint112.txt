SENATE REJECTS DATE CERTAIN WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ, SUPPORTS FUNDING FOR TROOPS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement after he voted against S. J. Res. 9 that called for a specific timeline for withdrawal from Iraq. The resolution failed on a vote of 48-50.  
   "The Senate clearly rejected this resolution of defeat and disgrace," said Senator Jim DeMint. "I'm proud of our brave troops in Iraq and I believe they need to know they have the full support of Congress and our nation." 
   Senator DeMint voted in favor of two resolutions that confirmed funding and Congressional support for the U.S. Armed Forces. S. Res. 107, which pledged to continue funding for our military, passed by a vote of 96-2. S. Con. Res. 20, which pledged not to cut funding for our troops in the field, passed by a vote of 82-16. Only 16 Democrats wanted to hold open the option of cutting off funding for troops in the future.
