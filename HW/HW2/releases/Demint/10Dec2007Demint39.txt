SALUDA TRAIL SENATE
 Kelly Long, regional director for Sen. DeMint, had the opportunity to speak with over 100 students and teachers of the seventh grade at Saluda Trail Middle School in Rock Hill back in early October.  
   Following up on a celebration in social studies classes for Constitution Day the month before, Long's visit provided a first-hand opportunity for the students to learn about the role of Sen. DeMint. In his presentation, Long explained our constitutional form of government, Senate processes and the responsibilities of its members, as well as the importance of citizen involvement in democratic government. 
   The discussion concluded with a mock debate. Students volunteered a list of important issues confronting them and Long selected one for debate. He then asked the group to argue for or against the proposal. Those favoring the idea greatly outnumbered those who were opposed to it, which gave Long the chance to encourage the minority to hold strong to their convictions. After the vote, Long explained that that is how the Senate operates. With approximately one hundred students in the room, the class was indeed the perfect size for a Saluda Trail Senate. 
   Of his visit, Long said: "I enjoyed spending time with some of Senator DeMint's younger and brighter constituents. They had intriguing questions and I walked away with the impression that although young, these students have genuine concerns about the future of our country." 
   Students seemed to enjoy the experience as well - especially since Long's visit interrupted their math class. 
   "Well, I can't blame them for that," said Long. "I enjoyed getting out of the office myself."
