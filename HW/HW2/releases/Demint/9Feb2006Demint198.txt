SEN. DEMINT COSPONSORS BIPARTISAN PORK-BARREL REDUCTION ACT
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) joined Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) in offering a substantive proposal to shine light on the appropriations process. The Pork-Barrel Reduction Act (PBRA) is a necessary first step in reducing and eliminating pork-barrel politics. 
   "The appropriations process in Washington keeps Congress from making good decisions about the future of our nation," said Senator DeMint. "Today's system encourages huge spending bills filled with local projects that end up forcing lawmakers to either support bad policy or risk harming their states. The system also short-changes our states by allowing a few chairmen to feast at the head of the table while everyone else fights for the crumbs. These decisions should be made at the local level, not here in Washington."  
   According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress passed 3,023 earmarks in 1996, costing taxpayers $19.5 billion. However, last year that number grew to 15,877 projects, costing taxpayers $47.4 billion. 
   "Sunshine is the best disinfectant," said Senator DeMint. "If we want to stop Congress from slipping hundreds of wasteful pork projects into spending bills, we have to shine a big spotlight on this process. This bipartisan legislation requires all earmarks to be written in the text of a bill, it requires the disclosure of the members requesting earmarks, and it requires the recipients of federal funds to disclose the amount of money they spend on lobbyists." 
   The Pork-Barrel Reduction Act was also cosponsored by Senators Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), John Ensign (R-Nev.), John Sununu (R-N.H.), and John Cornyn (R-Tex.). 
   "Americans are tired of reading about their taxes going to frivolous projects," said Senator DeMint. "It's time to shine light on the appropriations process and add more scrutiny to this spending. Obviously, there are legitimate needs in our country that must be met, but the process should be open, competitive, and accountable." 
   Major provisions of PBRA: 
   * Creates a new point of order against unauthorized earmarks and policy riders. This point of order allows for the elimination of extraneous individual earmarks and policy riders. Under this provision, only the offending provision would be removed from the appropriations bill or conference report if a point of order was sustained, thus maintaining the integrity of the underlying bill. 
   * Prohibits federal agencies from spending money on items and earmarks that were only included in unamendable committee or conference reports. This provision requires that all earmarks and spending items be in bill text, allowing for amendment and debate. 
   * Requires conference reports to be filed and publicly available for at least 48 hours prior to floor consideration. This requirement increases transparency and debate and gives lawmakers and the American public time to review legislation before it receives a vote. 
   * Strengthens current Senate rules against the conference report inclusion of matter not considered by the House or Senate. This provision prohibits consideration of conference reports containing matter not committed by either the House or Senate. Current rules allow for a point of order against reports with new matter, but many new provisions sneak by when they are attached to must-pass bills that can overcome the point of order. 
   * Requires full disclosure of any and all earmarks included in bills or conference reports. This provision shines some much needed light on the process by requiring a detailed description of all earmarks, including the identity of the lawmaker seeking the earmark and the earmark's essential governmental purpose. 
   * Requires recipients of federal dollars to disclose the amount of money that they spend on registered lobbyists. By increasing transparency and disclosure, this provision reduces the likelihood that taxpayers will unknowingly fund lobbyists who are promoting wasteful earmarks and working against the interests of hard-working taxpayers.
