SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEMOCRAT SHUTDOWN
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint issued the following statement: 
   "I came to the Senate to make a difference for all Americans, and the actions taken today by the Democrats is a disgrace. It shut the American people out and shut the Senate down. This was nothing more than a political stunt to divert attention away from the important measure we were debating to cut federal spending. Democrats have shown the American people, once again, that they have no ideas, no solutions, and no agenda."
