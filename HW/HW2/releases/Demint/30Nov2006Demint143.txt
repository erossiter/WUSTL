SEN. DEMINT APPLAUDS REPORT CALLING FOR SARBANES-OXLEY REFORM
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement in reaction to the report released by the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation:  
   "I'm very pleased the Committee recognized that our own laws are quickly chasing investment away from our country. As its report noted, America has gone from attracting fifty percent of the value of new stock offerings to only 5 percent in just five years. There is no question that the well-intentioned Sarbanes-Oxley Act has become bad for American investors and harmful to American jobs." 
   "I'm also pleased the Committee agreed with the ideas in the COMPETE Act and recognized the urgent need for reform. I hope the SEC will act responsibly on these reforms and act soon. In the meantime, I will continue to work in Congress to reform Sarbanes-Oxley. Regulatory changes are subject to lawsuits, judicial review, and delay. Congress created these problems and we need to fix them." 
   Senator DeMint is the lead sponsor of the COMPETE Act in the U.S. Senate, legislation that would require the SEC and PCAOB to clarify confusing terms and allow smaller companies to comply with more appropriate regulatory requirements, two of the goals recommended by the Committee. The COMPETE Act is sponsored in the U.S. House by Congressman Tom Feeney (R-Fla.) and is cosponsored by Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.).
