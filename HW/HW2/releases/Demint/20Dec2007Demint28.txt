EXPLORING F-35 LIGHTNING AT SHAW AIR FORCE BASE
  Kelly Long, regional director for Sen. DeMint, recently visited Shaw Air Force Base for a tour of the facilities and a test flight in the F-35 Lightning simulator. The F-35 is the U.S. military's newest strike fighter and Shaw AFB is scheduled to be one of the first bases that will receive the aircraft.  
   Describing his experience, Long said: "Flying in a computer-controlled simulator on the ground is one thing, but it will be something altogether different for young officers in a combat zone. This experience has left me with a great deal of respect and gratitude for the officers who will be flying these planes in harm's way and for the men and women on the ground who will make each and every mission a success." 
   The last time Sen. DeMint was at the base, he noted that when he gets discouraged by the political partisanship in Washington, he thinks about the quality and courage of the airmen he has met at Shaw and the other Air Force bases in South Carolina. Their integrity, service, and excellence demonstrate that the country is in good hands.
