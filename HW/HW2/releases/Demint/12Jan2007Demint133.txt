SEN. DEMINT THANKS DEMOCRATS FOR AGREEING TO ACCEPT PELOSI EARMARK DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement today after reaching an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) on new earmark disclosure requirements.  
   "Senator Reid and I have reached a bipartisan agreement on earmark disclosure that is even stronger than what I had originally proposed. I'm very pleased Senate Democrats were willing to work with us on this important issue. This is a big step forward in achieving honest and open government, and it's a major victory for American taxpayers." 
   "The bipartisan agreement accepts all of the key provisions in my original amendment so that every earmark is disclosed. Specifically, federal earmarks will be disclosed as well as those earmarks contained in committee reports that are not written in the text of a bill. These important changes will expand the disclosure requirements in the underlying bill so that 100 percent of the earmarks will be disclosed rather than only 5 percent. 
   "Democrats have also agreed to make these reports available in a searchable format at my request. It is vitally important that Congress as well as the public can easily research earmarks electronically. 
   "I want to thank Senator Reid for agreeing to do the right thing and be completely transparent with Americans on how Congress spends their money."
