SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO CONFIRM JUDGE WILLIAM PRYOR
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) today made the following statement following the Senate's 53-45 vote to confirm Judge William H. Pryor, Jr. to the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  
   "Today's bipartisan confirmation of Judge Pryor proves that years of partisan obstruction were completely misguided," said Senator DeMint. "Judge Pryor is one of America's most experienced public servants. He has a keen understanding that courts should interpret the law, not invent it." 
   President George W. Bush nominated Judge Pryor for the 11th Circuit in 2003. After Democrats used filibusters to block his nomination, the President gave him a recess appointment to the same court. Judge Pryor previously served the state of Alabama as Attorney General. 
   "I'm glad we have now confirmed three highly-qualified jurists that were unfairly blocked for years, but this is not enough. I believe that all of President Bush's judicial nominees deserve timely up-or-down votes." 
   Justice Pryor is third and final judicial nominee to advance under a May 23 deal struck by seven Democrats and seven Republicans. The agreement allows for confirmation votes on three of Bush's judicial nominees while preserving opponents' ability to filibuster under "extraordinary" circumstances.
