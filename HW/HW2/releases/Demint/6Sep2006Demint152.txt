SEN. DEMINT: DEMOCRATS SHOULD 'STOP PERFORMING FOR AN AUDIENCE AND HELP US FIGHT THIS WAR ON TERROR.'
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement on the floor of the U.S. Senate in response to a Democrat amendment calling for the resignation of U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. 
   "I'm afraid if my Democrat colleagues spent half the time helping us fight this War on Terror as they do attacking the administration, we'd be a lot closer to winning this war.
   "They are united in the idea of retreat and defeatism. They attack this president with no ideas of their own. They are trying to take the tools to fight terrorism away from this president: the Patriot Act, the interception of communications, tracing finances.
   "On every turn, the Democrats are obstructing the things that have changed with this president that allowed terrorism to grow unchallenged for the eight years under the Clinton administration. Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have stooped to attacking members of the President's cabinet.
   "We need to get back to the business of approving the resources that our soldiers need. And I would appeal to my Democrat colleagues to stop performing for an audience and help us fight this War on Terror."
