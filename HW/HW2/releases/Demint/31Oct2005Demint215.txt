SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE ALITO NOMINATION
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following remarks after President Bush announced his intention to nominate Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to be Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court:  
   "Judge Alito is one of the most respected judges in America. His constitutional credentials are unquestionable and his judicial philosophy is verifiable. 
   "Judge Alito is highly qualified. After completing his studies at Princeton University and Yale Law School, he served as Assistant to the Solicitor General, arguing 12 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. He later served as U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey before he began his tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he has been a judge for the past 15 years. 
   "In 1990, Judge Alito was unanimously confirmed by a Democrat-controlled Senate because he commanded respect across party lines. Now that he has been nominated to the Supreme Court, I hope Democrats will resist the temptation to obstruct the process and deny him an up-or-down vote. Judge Alito is a dignified man and he deserves a dignified process. He deserves a fair hearing and a fair vote. 
   "People in South Carolina and across the nation want a judge who will carefully listen to the arguments in each case and make thoughtful decisions. Americans want a judge who will strictly interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. We have a critical confirmation process ahead of us and I am confident Judge Alito will clearly demonstrate his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court."
