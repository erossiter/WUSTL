SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO FREEZE SENATE PAY
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) voted for S. Amdt. 2062, a measure to freeze the Senate's scheduled cost-of-living pay increase of 1.9 percent for Fiscal Year 2006.  
 It is projected to save the federal treasury approximately $2 million. 
   "It is painfully obvious to every American that federal spending is out of control," said Senator DeMint. "This vote is the least we can do to begin the process of serious fiscal restraint. I hope my colleagues will continue to demonstrate courage as Congress attempts to tighten its fiscal belt." 
   In the coming weeks Congress will work to pass a budget reconciliation package to save $50 billion from the Federal budget. In 1997, a larger savings package was passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. 
   The amendment passed 92-6. It was offered to the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, Judiciary and District of Columbia Appropriations Act, H.R. 3058.
