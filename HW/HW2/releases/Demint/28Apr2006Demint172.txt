SEN. DEMINT: SOARING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT EVIDENCE OF BUSH BOOM
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), made the following statement: 
   "There can be no denying that the Bush economic boom is in full swing," Senator Jim DeMint. "Thanks to Republican tax relief, American businesses are expanding and hiring millions of new workers instead of sending money to an already bloated federal budget. Today's news highlights the importance of making the tax relief permanent to keep this economy moving."
   "To succeed in today's global economy, we must make America the best place in the world to do business. It's time to overcome Democrat obstruction on energy independence and fundamental tax reform and to allow every American to own their own health insurance policy so we can continue our economic expansion and secure America's future."
