SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON TREATMENT OF TROOPS AT WALTER REED
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following statement Wednesday after having breakfast with the American Legion Department of South Carolina.  
   "Some of our troops at Walter Reed have experienced bureaucratic delays and substandard living conditions. This is completely unacceptable and it cannot continue. We have a moral obligation to provide best care in the world to the men and women who serve our country." 
   "The head of Walter Reed has been dismissed and the President has called on former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary Donna Shalala to conduct a full review of the care our country is providing to our wounded soldiers. 
   "I look forward to hearing their recommendations and I hope we can continue to work in a bipartisan way to ensure our servicemen and women get the quality of care they deserve."
