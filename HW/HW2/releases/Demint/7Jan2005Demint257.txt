SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM COMMISSION
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement applauding President George W. Bush for appointing a commission on federal tax reform and simplification:  
   "This is a bold move by the President. It shows he's serious about tackling one the biggest problems facing our country today. 
   "The tax code is the number one job killer in America. High rates and tax complexity are robbing Americans of their time and money, and driving jobs overseas. We're not going to be able to compete with our trading partners if we ignore this problem. 
   "If America is going to be the best place in the world to do business, we need the most pro-growth tax code in the world. What we do with our tax system today will determine the kind of jobs our children have tomorrow. 
   "The President is doing the right thing. Tax reform won't be easy, but it must be done. This commission will give Congress the guidance and focus it needs." 
   In 2003, DeMint sponsored H.R. 3215, the Tax Reform Action Commission Act, to establish a bipartisan tax reform commission and require Congress to consider its recommendations. H.R. 3215 had the support of 118 cosponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives.
