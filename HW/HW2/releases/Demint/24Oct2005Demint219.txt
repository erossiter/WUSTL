SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON BEN BERNANKE NOMINATION
 Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following remarks after President Bush nominated Dr. Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve: 
   "Dr. Ben Bernanke grew up in Dillon, South Carolina as the son of the town pharmacist. He went on to graduate with honors from Harvard and chair the economics department at Princeton University. Most recently, Dr. Bernanke has led the President's Council of Economic Advisor's during a time of important economic recovery. I believe Dr. Bernanke has the wisdom and experience needed to lead the Federal Reserve." said U.S. Senator Jim DeMint.
