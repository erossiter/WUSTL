SENATE RECOGNIZES NOVEMBER AS NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH
 Yesterday, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved S.Res.299, a resolution recognizing November 2005 as National Adoption Month. Sen.  
 Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), an original co-sponsor of the resolution and a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, made the following comments: 
   "With this resolution, the Senate voiced its support for adoption, and recognized November as National Adoption Awareness Month. This is a great time to celebrate those families who have been touched by adoption, and to encourage more Americans to open their hearts to children in need. 
   "Those parents who open their homes to these kids represent the very best of the American spirit, and those mothers who make the live-saving choice of adoption are true American heroes. There may be unwanted pregnancies but there are no unwanted children."
