SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMPROVED DEFICIT FIGURES
  Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement today in response to news that the federal budget deficit will be $127 billion less than projected due to rising revenues created by a strong economy. This year's budget deficit is now forecast to be $296 billion, or 2.3 percent of our economy (GDP), equal to the historical average. This deficit is 30 percent below the Administration's February forecast. 
   "This news is further evidence that Republican tax relief is helping the economy, creating jobs, and lowering the deficit. For the second year in row, the economy has exceeded expectations by creating millions of new jobs, increasing business profits, and generating even greater tax revenues.
   "We hear a lot from Democrats these days about 'tax cuts for the rich' and 'deficits as far as the eye can see' but the facts show that tax relief is benefiting all Americans and helping us balance the budget. Democrats can continue to play class warfare games and push a socialist agenda if they want, but Republicans will keep fighting to stop tax increases and to lower the cost of living for hardworking Americans."
