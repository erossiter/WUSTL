SEN. DEMINT: 'LET'S SET POLITICS ASIDE AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN'
  Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) called on senators to pass the bipartisan Dingell-Pelosi child product safety bill, H.R. 4040, that already passed the House 407-0. 
   "It's time to act quickly and set politics aside because Americans deserve to know the toys their children play with are safe," said Senator DeMint. "Giving the Consumer Product Safety Commission the tools it needs to ensure that products are safe for our children should be a top priority. The House passed a truly bipartisan bill last year and the Senate should have taken it up long ago. But some of my colleagues want to use this emotional issue to add a number of politically motivated giveaways for trial lawyers, organized labor and other special interest groups. Unfortunately, these provisions will harm American workers and consumers."
   "I hope the Senate will recognize that passing Speaker Pelosi's bill is the most responsible thing to do. The President could sign it tomorrow, instead of waiting months to work out differences in the House and Senate bills and without adding harmful political giveaways. Let's set politics aside and protect our children," said Senator DeMint.
   U.S. Representative John Dingell (D-Michigan) wrote in the New York Times: "This bill would enact the toughest standard in the world for lead in children's products, increase penalties and provide the commission with additional resources and authority... Let's hope that the Senate acts expeditiously and with the same bipartisan commitment as the House."
   Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California) stated: "This bill, which is supported by consumer advocates and scientists alike, would require third-party testing and certification of children's products, ban lead in children's products and toys, and provide recall authority for hazardous products and ensure the public is notified of recalls."
   H.R. 4040, The Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act, would:
   * Mandate tough pre-market testing for children's products: testing for lead, for choking hazards and for other potential hazards.
   * Replace the Consumer Product Safety Commission's aging testing lab with a modern state-of-the-art lab that will allow the commission to find unsafe toys and keep them off the shelves.
   * Require that products are tested by an independent third party to ensure product safety.
   * Improve notice about recalls by publicly disseminating recall information through the Internet, radio and television.
