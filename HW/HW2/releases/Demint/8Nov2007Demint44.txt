SEN. DEMINT: WRDA VOTE SHOWS CONGRESS STILL FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE
  Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) made the following remarks after he voted to uphold the President's veto of the Water Resources and Development Act (WRDA) that contains billions in pork barrel spending. The bill, which began as a $4.9 billion authorization, grew to $14 billion when first passed by the Senate in May and then ballooned to over $23 billion in the House-Senate conference. The White House anticipates the final cost of the bill could be up to $38 billion. The Senate voted 79-14 to override the veto.  
   "Congress still hasn't learned its lesson - Americans want us to stop the flood of runaway spending and stop wasteful earmarks for pet projects," said Senator DeMint. "There are some critical needs in our country, but this bill earmarks billions in tax-dollars based on political power instead of setting real priorities. Sadly, because the authors of this bill have rained a few earmarks to every member's district, Congress didn't have the courage to stop this reckless overspending. We need to enact real reform and allow the Army Corps of Engineers to focus on the true needs of our nation, instead of wasting time and resources on hundreds of politically motivated pork projects." 
   In announcing his opposition to the wasteful spending bill, President Bush said, "The bill's excessive authorization for over 900 projects and programs exacerbates the massive backlog of ongoing Corps construction projects, which will require an additional $38 billion in future appropriations to complete. This bill does not set priorities."
