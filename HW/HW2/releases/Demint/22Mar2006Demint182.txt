SEN. DEMINT PROMOTES FINANCIAL LITERACY IN SCHOOLS
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) addressed the need to expand financial literacy in high school curriculums nationwide as he continued his "Success in School, Success in Life" tour. Sen. DeMint urged schools to invite community leaders to share their financial success stories with students. 
   "We need to make sure our students are being prepared for the real world," said Senator DeMint. "High school students need to know how to read a credit report, the real impact of credit card debt and how to balance their checkbooks. If they don't understand the problems associated with high interest rates and debt, they are more likely to make poor financial decisions. Community business leaders provide an excellent resource of hard-earned financial wisdom, and schools should allow students to benefit from their knowledge."  
   As our financial system becomes more complex, there is more responsibility placed on young adults to manage the details of their own finances. Unfortunately, mounting evidence suggests a large percentage of young adults lack the basic financial knowledge and skills to ensure long-term stability for both themselves and their families. The statistics are alarming: 
    * 74% of parents feel unprepared to teach their children about personal finance (Fleet Boston Survey, 2003), 
   * The personal saving rate in 2004 was 1% compared to a 7% average over the past 3 decades (Alan Greenspan, February, 2005), 
   * Between 1983 and 2001, the average credit card debt for 25 to 34 year olds nearly tripled, from $3,989 to $12,000 (The United States Federal Reserve), and 
   * In 2003, 1.6 million consumers filed for bankruptcy, the highest rate in history (The Fragile Middle-Class: Americans in Debt by Teresa A. Sullivan, Elizabeth Warren and Jay Lawrence). 
   Financial Literacy is not only important for the financial success of individuals, but also for our success as a nation. Senator DeMint believes this message can be most effectively conveyed to high school students by successful local entrepreneurs. At Mid Carolina High School in Newberry County today, Senator DeMint joined Alan Gardner, a local Insurance Company executive, to speak with students and faculty about the importance of Financial Literacy. 
   Mr. Gardner said, "Consumers often make poor financial decisions simply because they have never been taught otherwise. Like most everyone else, I have had to learn financial lessons the hard way and that's why I'm excited to share some of my personal experiences with these students today." 
   On Tuesday, the State Superintendent of Education, Inez Tenenbaum held a press conference to announce private funding for a new financial literacy program in South Carolina schools. South Carolina is one of the first states in the nation to require students to learn basic skills for managing money. 
   Senator DeMint added, "I applaud the State Department of Education for implementing these types of public-private partnerships that will produce real results in the classroom. This is a good start, but we need to do more. In many cases the best messengers for this life lesson are the local business and community leaders who have personal experiences illustrating the problem. Unfortunately, some teachers' unions set up road blocks for these community leaders to teach in classrooms without a certificate. We must break down these types of barriers that keep professionals from sharing their insights with students." 
   Senator DeMint will start the day in Greenwood with business leaders then meet with students, faculty and staff at Mid Carolina High School in Newberry County.
