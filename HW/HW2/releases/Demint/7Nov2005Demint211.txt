SEN. DEMINT VOTES TO CUT SPENDING BY $35 BILLION
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) voted in favor of the Deficit Reduction Act (S. 1932), which will reduce mandatory spending by $35 billion over the next five years. The bill was approved by a vote of 52-47.  
   "This was a victory for fiscal responsibility and for American taxpayers," said Senator DeMint. "This package will result in savings of $35 billion over five years and as much as $100 billion over ten years. These are challenging times and we must address difficult issues in a sound, fiscally responsible way." 
   Automatic spending, excluding interest on the debt, now represents 56 percent of all federal spending. Left unchecked, that will grow to more than 62 percent in 10 years. Accelerated spending in several of the largest entitlement programs is on the verge of overwhelming our economy's ability to pay for those benefits as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire in 2008. 
   "For all of the complaining we hear from Democrats about deficits, it was revealing to see them vote in block against this modest measure to reduce spending. While we have been working to bring some fiscal sanity to Washington this year, Democrats have tried to increase spending by over a half trillion dollars." 
   The Senate also overcame years of resistance from Democrats to affirm its support for oil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   "It's finally time we did something about our dependency on foreign oil," said Senator DeMint. "This is needed relief as we transition to a new energy economy. It's sad Democrats held this up for over a decade while gas prices more than doubled." 
   Once developed, ANWR will provide the United States with at least 900,000 barrels of oil a day, or about 4.5 percent of today's U.S. consumption, for the next 30 years. In terms of production, such a yield could amount to nearly 16 percent of today's total U.S. production.
