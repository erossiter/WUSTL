SEN. DEMINT ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) made the following statement: 
   "The men and women of the U.S. military, our Coalition forces, the President of the United States and the Iraqi people need to be congratulated this morning. The death of Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq is a major defeat for the terrorists and a significant step along the road to victory in the War on Terror. Zarqawi was a savage murderer who brutally killed innocent Iraqis and Americans. His execution sends a strong signal to all terrorists: the United States and our allies will not rest until we achieve ultimate victory against our enemies in the War on Terror - if you continue to fight us, you will die."
   "Today the world breathes a sigh of relief that Zarqawi's days have ended, yet we know the fight is far from over. While violence and terror is likely to continue, it is important that we continue to support our brave troops in their mission to defend freedom abroad."
