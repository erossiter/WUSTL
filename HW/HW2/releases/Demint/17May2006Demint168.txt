SEN. DEMINT VOTES FOR REAL BORDER FENCE
  Today, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) voted for an amendment by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) that will increase the amount of fencing and add vehicle barriers along the southwest border of the nation. The amendment directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to construct at least 370 miles of triple-layered fence and 500 miles of vehicle barriers at strategic locations along the southwest border. The amendment passed 83-16. 
   "Every sovereign nation has a fundamental obligation to secure its own border. A real fence is one of the most effective ways to stop illegal immigration," said Senator DeMint. "I'm deeply troubled by many provisions in the Senate immigration compromise, but I am pleased we made some progress today to improve it."
