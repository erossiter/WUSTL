  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded final passage of H.R. 6111, which includes a provision to raise the income earn-out cap for current participants in the District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program.       
"The passage of this important provision comes as a great relief to the families currently participating in the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program," said Brownback.  "This provision assures parents that an improved financial situation will not negatively affect their children's education.  Students participating in the voucher program can now enjoy the holiday season knowing that they will be able to return to their schools next semester."     
The provision raises the earn-out cap from 200% to 300% of poverty level.  Prior to the passage of this provision, approximately 70 low-income children in the District were ineligible to continue participating in the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program and faced removal from their current schools at the end of this month.  The provision does not change the initial eligibility income requirements for the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, which mandates that children may apply for the program only if their household income is 185% of poverty level or below.       
H.R. 6111, which passed the Senate Saturday morning, authorized the extension of certain programs, tax credits, and trade provisions.       Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
