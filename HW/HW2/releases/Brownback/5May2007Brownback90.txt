  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today joined Senator Pat Roberts, Congressman Todd Tiahrt, and Congressman Jerry Moran calling on President Bush to declare Greensburg and the surrounding area a federal disaster area.  An excerpt from the letter reads:     
"Mr. President, one of our Kansas communities was literally erased from the map last night.  The residents of Greensburg and the surrounding area are in desperate need of assistance from local, state, and federal authorities.  We urge you to take immediate action to request that all federal agencies provide any available assistance."     
Southwest Kansas, and primarily the City of Greensburg, was devastated by a tornado last night which reportedly destroyed over 60 percent of the city with over 50 people injured and seven deceased.  Brownback reiterated his support for the people of Greensburg, Kiowa County, Stafford County, and Barton County affected by the storm.  Brownback said, "Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this terrible storm, and in particular with those who have lost loved ones.  I will do whatever is necessary to ensure that the residents of this great community have the resources they need in order to rebuild."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, which oversees federal assistance for emergencies.  Brownback will visit the affected area tomorrow and will join a student prayer vigil at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas today at 4:00 p.m. Central.
