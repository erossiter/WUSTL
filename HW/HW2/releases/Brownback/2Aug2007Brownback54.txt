  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the Senate Judiciary Committee vote for Judge Leslie Southwick's nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Southwick's nomination will now be considered by the full Senate.       
"Judge Southwick's outstanding record speaks to what a great jurist he will be on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I was proud to vote to move his nomination forward," said Brownback.  "I applaud my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for recognizing Judge Southwick's many qualifications."       
By a vote of 10-9, Southwick, an Iraq War veteran, was favorably reported out the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Southwick has been nominated to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, a vacancy that has been deemed a judicial emergency.  Southwick has been rated by the American Bar Association as "Well-Qualified," which is the ABA's highest rating.       
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
