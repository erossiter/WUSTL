  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the decision by the United States Supreme Court to uphold the federal ban on partial-birth abortions.       
"I am very pleased that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled to uphold the ban on partial birth abortions," said Brownback.  "This ban was enacted to put an end to one of the most grotesque forms of abortion, and it is completely in line with the respect for life that is at the very heart of our Constitution.  This is a great step forward for our nation's citizens, born and unborn."      
The U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-4 decision today ruled that the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act is constitutional.  The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act was passed by Congress and signed by President Bush in 2003.      
Brownback continued, "I applaud the Court for finding that the constitution 'expresses respect for the dignity of human life,' and hope that this decision signals the Court's willingness to revisit and reverse Roe v. Wade."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
