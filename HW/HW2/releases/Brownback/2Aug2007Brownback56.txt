  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted in favor of S. 1, the Ethics Bill, which passed the Senate by an 83-14 vote.        
"While I am disappointed in the lack of significant earmark reforms contained in S. 1, I think a comprehensive ethics reforms bill was long overdue," said Brownback.  "I supported S. 1 when it originally came up for a Senate vote, but I believe the current version unfortunately watered down key provisions of the original bill."       
Brownback voted in favor of S. 1 in January of 2007, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96-2.  After being voted upon in the Senate, the bill moved to consideration of the House.  The House amended the bill, and returned it to the Senate for final consideration.  The current version of S. 1 was brought to the Senate floor by Democrat leadership under a parliamentary procedure which did not allow for any amendments.       
Brownback continued, "Congress must continue to take steps to restore the American people's faith in the legislative process.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to strengthen ethics reforms."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
