  ERBIL, Iraq - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback yesterday encouraged Iraq to move toward federalism during a meeting with the president of the Kurdish Regional Government, Massoud Barzani.     
"The Kurdish region of Iraq is secure and thriving," Brownback said.  "The Kurdish region serves as a model for what Iraq's Shi'a and Sunni communities could achieve under a federal system.  Iraq's leaders should look more to the Kurdish-model for a political solution.  Iraq has three primary groups and each should have a region they govern within a federated country; One country with three states and Baghdad as the federal city."     
Iraq's constitution provides for an autonomous Kurdish region in the northern part of Iraq, and leaves open the possibility of the formation of other regions inside the country.     
Brownback continued, "The Kurds experienced a great deal of repression during Saddam's rule, but they used the protection of a no-fly zone to develop one of the most open societies in the region.  I congratulate them for their efforts, and I look forward to the continued success of the Kurdish region and the Kurdish people."     
Yesterday, Brownback met with members of Iraq's national government, including Prime Minister Maliki, in Baghdad.  His travels in Iraq follow a visit to Afghanistan earlier this week.  Brownback is currently in Ethiopia on a trip to review the key fronts in the war on terror.     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
