  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement in response to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist’s comments regarding expanded federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.   
 
“I am disappointed that Senator Frist has endorsed taxpayer-subsidized destruction of human embryos.  While Senator Frist acknowledged that human embryos are nascent human life, he never addressed the most important question: how does one treat human life?   
 
“Is the young human embryo a person or a piece of property?  It is one or the other.  The American public deserves to have a thorough debate on this subject in the Senate.  We must address the legal status of the young human embryo.”
