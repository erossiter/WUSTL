  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.   
 
“I wish to commend Justice O’Connor on her 24 years of service on the United States Supreme Court.  Appointed by President Reagan in 1981, Justice O’Connor was the first woman to serve on the Court, and has been a role model to a generation of women in the legal profession.   
 
“As he deliberates on a nomination to fill this vacancy, I hope and am confident that President Bush will select an individual who is faithful to the text of the Constitution.”
