  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Senate Appropriations Committee passage of three funding bills, the State and Foreign Operations bill, the Energy and Water Development bill, and the Commerce, Justice, and Science bill.       "I am pleased my funding requests for Kansas were included in the Energy and Water Development and the Commerce, Justice, and Science bills," said Brownback.  "Many of these projects provide critical services for the residents of Kansas.  Others will help decrease our dependence on foreign oil and contribute to the advancement of our nation's space program."         
The bills include the following Kansas projects:     
•	National Center for Advanced Materials Performance, National Institute for Aviation Research, Wichita State University: $350,000      
•	Victims of Crime Services, Kansas City: $400,000      
•	College for Prisoners Program, Donnelly College, Kansas City: $300,000      
•	Mentoring Children of Prisoners, Camp Fire USA, Kansas City: $200,000      
•	Kansas Methamphetamine Prevention Project: $90,000      
•	Manhattan Flood Control, Manhattan: $300,000      
•	Upper Turkey Creek Study: $231,000      
•	Brush Creek Basin Study: $200,000      
•	Tuttle Creek Lake Dam Safety: $28,500,000     •	Turkey Creek Flood Control: $9,000,000      
•	Eureka Creek Flood Control, Manhattan: Contract Authorization Language      
•	Cloud County Community College Wind Turbine, Concordia: $1,000,000      
•	Demonstration of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles, KCATA: $1,000,000      
Brownback continued, "However, I voted against passage of the State and Foreign Operations bill due to its funding of programs which weaken pro-life policy."       
The State and Foreign Operations bill would provide contraceptive funding to abortion-providing groups previously banned from receiving funds, thus undermining longstanding U.S. policy which bans funding of overseas abortion providers.       
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
