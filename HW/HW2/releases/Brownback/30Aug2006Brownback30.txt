  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the U.S. ethanol production record set in June of 318,000 barrels per day.       
"The remarkable increase in ethanol production is good for our economy and our national security," said Brownback.  "The more ethanol that is domestically produced and brought to the market the less foreign oil America imports.  This not only keeps American dollars in the American economy, but also helps combat our addiction to foreign oil."     
The daily production of 318,000 barrels of ethanol in June is an increase of 25,000 barrels per day in May.  This is nearly a 28% increase from June 2005.       
Brownback continued, "This is especially good news for strong agricultural states like Kansas.  Ethanol is produced in rural America with grain from American farmers which boosts local economies and creates jobs."     
Last fall Brownback joined several Republican and Democratic senators to introduce the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act, which would reduce American dependence on foreign oil by setting goals for reducing national oil consumption, enacting market-based tax credits and R funding to encourage producers and consumers of fuel-efficient vehicles, and expanding the renewable fuels infrastructure.  The bill was authored by Brownback and Senators Joe Lieberman (D-CT), Evan Bayh (D-IN), and Norm Coleman (R-MN), and is co-sponsored by 24 other Republican and Democratic senators.     
Senator Brownback sits on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
