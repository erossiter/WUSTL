  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today joined several senators to cosponsor the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of 2007, which would strengthen existing sanctions on the Iranian regime and levy new sanctions on nations which assist Iranian nuclear enrichment.       
"Congress must take aggressive action against the dangerous regime in Tehran," said Brownback.  "The mullahs in Iran pose a serious threat to global security: they seek nuclear weapons, threaten genocide against Israel, and have called for the destruction of the United States."       
The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act would freeze assets of Iranian officials, forbid government contracts from being awarded to entities eligible for sanctions under the Iran Sanctions Act, and support the designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards as a foreign terrorist organization.  The bill also places limited sanctions on countries, such as Russia, that are assisting in Iranian nuclear enrichment.     
Brownback continued, "I am hopeful that the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act will help confront and eliminate the threats faced by the Iranian regime.  America must be vigilant when dealing with a regime that tortures and kills its own citizens."     
Brownback also plans to introduce legislation that would reform broadcasting into Iran and improve human rights for the Iranian people.  Earlier today, Brownback condemned Iran for taking 15 British servicemen hostage, and said they must be returned safely, unconditionally and without delay.     
Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
