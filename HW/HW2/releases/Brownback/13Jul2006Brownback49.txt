  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill.       
"The Homeland Security Appropriations bill provides vital funding for programs that protect American citizens," said Senator Brownback.  "During Senate consideration of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, I voted for provisions that would have allocated $1.829 billion to build 370 miles of double layer fencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as $85.67 million for 659 additional worksite enforcement agents.  Unfortunately these provisions were not included in the final bill, but we must continue to work toward securing our border and cracking down on employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens."     
Selected items in the Homeland Security bill for Department of Homeland Security operations:   $23.935 billion for Security, Enforcement, and Investigations   $6.385 billion for Preparedness and Recovery   $1.667 billion for Research and Development, Training and Services     Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
