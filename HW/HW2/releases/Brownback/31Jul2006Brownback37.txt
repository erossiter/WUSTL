  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Japan for following through on its promise to re-open its market to American beef imports after a final round of inspections.  The final round of inspections were completed last week.     
"American beef producers now have access to the Japanese market after nearly two years of blocking and delays," said Brownback.  "I applaud the Japanese government for this welcome change and I hope their market remains open to American beef for years to come.  We should keep up the pressure, however, as this is just the first step toward a full resumption of beef trade with Japan.  Only boneless beef from animals 20 months of age and younger will be accepted, as opposed to the internationally accepted age of 30 months."     
Japan announced in June that it would re-open its market following audits of the individual plants that will be allowed to export beef to Japan.  Since Japan first closed its market to U.S. beef imports over two years ago, the USDA has tested over 500,000 cattle for BSE.  The USDA has found and confirmed only one case.  Japan initially announced it would re-open its market to American beef in December 2005, but after an isolated incident in January, Japan closed its markets again.     
Brownback's efforts to re-open the market include a meeting last March with Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato and a visit to Japan in January 2004 to discuss the safety of U.S. beef with government officials.  In 2004 Brownback hosted a Japanese technical team at a Kansas beef ranch and processing plant to highlight the quality and safety of U.S. beef.     
Senator Brownback sits on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
