  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court:     
“Today, President Bush nominated Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  In addition to his impressive academic credentials, Judge Alito has broad legal experience: he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court while serving in the Solicitor General's Office at the Justice Department; provided extensive advice on constitutional matters while serving in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel; worked for half a decade as a federal prosecutor; and has served with distinction on the Third Circuit for the past 15 years.     
“I commend the president and congratulate Judge Alito on this nomination, and I look forward to the upcoming confirmation hearing, during which members of the Judiciary Committee will have a robust and, I hope, civil dialogue with the nominee about the meaning of the Constitution and the role of the courts in American life.”     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee and chairs the Constitution Subcommittee.
