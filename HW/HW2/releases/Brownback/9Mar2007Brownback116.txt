  BROWNBACK INTRODUCES PARENTS' TAX RELIEF ACT  Bill will expand options for working parents     
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback yesterday introduced the Parents' Tax Relief Act, which would offset current penalties in the tax code for married couples and stay-at-home parents.       
"Our tax code punishes all married couples and parents who wish to leave the workforce and take a more active role in raising their children," said Brownback.  "The Parents' Tax Relief Act makes it easier for parents to work from home or leave the workforce during their children's preschool years and offers incentives to workplaces so that more employees can telecommute."      
The Parents' Tax Relief Act extends the Dependent Care Tax Credit to stay-at-home parents; makes permanent the $1,000 Child Tax Credit and fixes it to inflation; permanently eliminates the marriage tax penalty.  The bill also encourages telecommuting, adjusts Social Security credits for stay-at-home parents, and streamlines the home office deduction.        
Similar legislation yesterday was introduced in the House by Congressman Lee Terry (R-NE).     
Brownback continued, "In order to keep America's economy strong we must ensure our families are healthy.  No parent should be punished for choosing to stay home with their children."       
Brownback is member of the Joint Economic Committee.
