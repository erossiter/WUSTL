  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback yesterday joined a bipartisan group of 27 members of Congress in sending a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao calling for the Chinese government to immediately stop its practice of harvesting organs from condemned Chinese prisoners.       
"I urge the Chinese to abide by international medical and ethical norms and immediately stop harvesting organs from executed prisoners," said Brownback.       
According to China's Ministry of Health, since 1993 there have been over 65,000 transplant procedures performed in China.  According to China's Deputy Health Minister, 95 percent of the organs for organ transplants performed in China are from Chinese prisoners.        
"I know of no other country in the world that has such a policy," Brownback continued.  "I have heard reports that executions are being scheduled based on the demand for organs, rather than based on the status of the prisoner's case.  This practice challenges many international human rights norms."     
The letter was sent in advance of President Hu's April 20th meeting with President Bush at the White House.  Brownback also hopes that President Bush will use the opportunity to raise other key human rights issues like the treatment of North Korean refugees, ongoing religious persecution of Chinese citizens, and the legal protection and rights of prisoners of conscience such as Hao Wu and Dr. Yang Jianli and many others.     
Senator Brownback sits on the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee.
