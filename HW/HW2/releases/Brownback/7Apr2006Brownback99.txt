  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today introduced the Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act, which would establish a central internet location listing common medical costs, allowing the consumer to be better informed.     
"The Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act would create price transparency at a consumer level, allowing Americans to choose for themselves health care services that are affordable and within their region," said Brownback.  "This price information will provide a critical baseline for individuals to assess health care costs.  As a consumer, each person should be able to easily shop for medical services and find the best price."        
Although Medicare reimbursement rates are publicly available, the Disclosure Act establishes one location on the internet where consumers without insurance or with Health Savings Accounts can view the Medicare reimbursement rates for common medical procedures and physician visits, region by region. The website would contain a comprehensive list of common medical procedures and physician services, searchable by zip code.       
Brownback continued, "This plan to increase price transparency would remove major barriers for consumers by empowering them with the crucial information.  Individuals could take charge of their health care spending and negotiate health care prices."       
The price disclosures would be made available by the Department of Health and Human Services on the Medicare website.  Broken down by region, the website would list payment rates for the 30 most common inpatient and outpatient hospital procedures and payment rates for the 30 most common physician services.  The website would also describe items and services included in each of these procedures.
