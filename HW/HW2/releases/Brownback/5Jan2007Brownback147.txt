  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback will travel over the next couple of weeks to the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia to ascertain firsthand U.S. efforts in the war on terror.     
Brownback will visit American troops, high-level leaders and American representatives in Ethiopia, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.     
"We must continue to pursue a global strategy to thwart terrorism and I look forward to meeting with leaders from several nations that have been very helpful in and on the front lines of the global war on terror," Brownback stated.  "I am especially glad to be meeting with American troops actively serving in several locations, including Kansas men and women who are serving our nation with honor and patriotism."     
Brownback has called for increased efforts to encourage a political solution in Iraq and has said he does not believe a military solution alone will bring long-term security and stability to Iraq.     
Brownback will also meet with local and American leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan to discuss ongoing allied efforts to combat terrorism.  He will also visit troops in Kuwait, and will get a first-hand look at the war on terror from Ethiopia, where he will meet with officials leading the fight against militant Islamic forces from Somalia.
