  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the Federal Communications Commission's vote to approve a digital television frequency fix for KFJX-TV Fox 14 in the Pittsburg, Kansas, market.     
"As the Ranking Member on the appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the FCC, I have worked hard to ensure that residents of Southeast Kansas have access to broadcast television without interfering with first responders or other emergency communications," said Brownback.  "Today's decision by the FCC will help smooth the transition from analog to digital television frequencies in Kansas."     
By voting to approve KFJX's reallocation, the FCC will help ensure a smooth and successful digital transition for television viewers in the Pittsburg, Kansas, and Joplin, Missouri, viewing area.  Today's decision guarantees that police, fire and first responders will not be subjected to random broadcast interference to their emergency radio communications and that local citizens will continue to receive broadcast programming, including emergency alerts, on KFJX-TV after the digital television transition in February, 2009.       
Senator Brownback is the Ranking Member on the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee.
