  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement after the Senate confirmed Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court:   
“The confirmation of Samuel Alito to be our 110th Justice of the Supreme Court is a victory for the Constitution and the country.   
“During his Judiciary Committee hearing, Samuel Alito showed America that he met the criteria President Bush outlined and the American people endorsed in the last election: he will remain faithful to the text of the Constitution and will not legislate from the bench.  Even more, he withstood baseless attacks on his character and judicial record with a grace and dignity appropriate for one who wears the robe.   
“I congratulate Justice Alito and President Bush on a successful nomination, and look forward to Justice Alito continuing his long devotion to law and public service on the Supreme Court.”   
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights.
