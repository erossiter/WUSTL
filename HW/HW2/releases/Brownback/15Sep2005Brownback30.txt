  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced Senate passage of the $48.9 Commerce/Justice/Science Appropriations bill.  This bill funds the operations of the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Weather Service.  The CJS Appropriations bill now goes to Conference with the House-passed version.     
"As a member of the Appropriations Committee and the CJS Subcommittee, I am pleased that the Senate rejected numerous fiscally irresponsible amendments and passed a bill that is within the budgeted amount," Brownback said.  "The funding allocated in this bill for the National Weather Service and NOAA is of vital importance considering the recent events with Hurricane Katrina.  Also, I am pleased with the $512.3 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which provides needed grants to Kansas law enforcement agencies."     
The bill also provides numerous provisions designed to help restore the lives of those affected by Hurricane Katrina, including an amendment sponsored by Senators Vitter and Snowe to expand the loan authority of the Small Business Administration.  Additionally, $284 million is made available for the Economic Development Assistance program.     
"Congress continues to step up to the plate and show its commitment to helping victims of Hurricane Katrina.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to craft a comprehensive emergency appropriations bill for Gulf Coast reconstruction," Brownback said.     
Senator Sam Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee, which oversees the drafting of the 12 annual bills that fund the operations of the Federal Government and numerous grants for projects in the State of Kansas.
