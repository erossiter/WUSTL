  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded passage of the Marriage Protection Amendment by a 10-8 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee.   
“I’m glad the Marriage Protection Amendment is on its way to the Senate floor for a vote,” said Brownback.  “The American people support protecting traditional marriage, and we should give this amendment due consideration through the full legislative process.  We must continue to fight for the protection of traditional marriage.”      
The amendment now heads to the Senate floor for debate and a vote by all 100 senators.  A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote from both the House and Senate and approval by the states.   
Senator Brownback chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights.
