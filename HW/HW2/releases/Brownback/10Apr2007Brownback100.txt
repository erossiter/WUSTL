  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today stood against S.5, the Reid-Harkin Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, arguing that it uses federal taxpayer dollars to sanction the destruction of nascent human life.  He made the following remarks today on the Senate floor:     
"Central to this debate is the issue of how we treat our fellow man. A basic premise of our nation and culture is that each individual has an inalienable right to life, and we hold this for all members of our society, from newborns to senior citizens.     
"Science tells us that life begins much earlier than birth. We know that the human embryo is a human life, so how should we treat it? As Ronald Reagan noted in his 1983 essay 'Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation,' we should give life the benefit of the doubt:     
'Anyone who doesn't feel sure whether we are talking about a second human life should clearly give life the benefit of the doubt. If you don't know whether a body is alive or dead, you would never bury it. I think this consideration itself should be enough for all of us to insist on protecting the unborn.'     
"Human life has immeasurable value and it is wrong to use any human being as a means to an end. We want to help and treat people who have medical conditions, but we must not trample another human to achieve that end."     
Brownback is opposed to S.5, the Reid-Harkin Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, and supports S.30, the Coleman-Isakson HOPE Act.     
Brownback authored on op-ed on stem cell research which was published today in USA Today.
