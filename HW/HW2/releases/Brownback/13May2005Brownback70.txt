  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement on the recommendations of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission.   
“I am very pleased that the Department of Defense recognizes and values the important role that Kansas military bases play in defending our nation,” Brownback said.  “I look forward to working with the BRAC Commission as the process moves forward and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that all of our Kansas bases are at the forefront of homeland security and national defense.”   
Today Secretary Rumsfeld initiated the Base Realignment and Closure process by submitting his recommendations to Congress.  The recommendations included a list of military installations that should be considered for closure in addition to opportunities to relocate various missions and military activities.  The four major installations in Kansas are not included in the closure list.  The recommendations do include opportunities to realign missions and troops from other bases around the world and bring them to Kansas.   
Secretary Rumsfeld’s recommendations will be considered by a panel of nine appointed commissioners which will review the recommendations and conduct hearings in areas seriously affected by them.  After the commission completes their review and analysis, they will transmit the official BRAC report to the President for approval.     
Brownback is a member of the Military Construction Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
