  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on yesterday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testified.     
"At yesterday's hearing, I posed several questions to the Attorney General about the grounds for the dismissal of eight United States attorneys in December 2006," said Brownback.  "Although his answers suggested that there were serious managerial issues at the Department of Justice, I did not see a factual basis to call for his resignation.  As for whether the Attorney General should resign, that is a question I leave to him and to the President."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
