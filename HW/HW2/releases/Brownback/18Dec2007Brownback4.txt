   WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback tonight commented on Senate Passage of the FY08 Omnibus spending bill. I am pleased to announce the following important projects for Kansas in the omnibus funding bill including flood control, aerospace research, food safety, transportation improvements and Fort Riley upgrades, said Brownback. While there were many things I didnt like about the omnibus bill, especially the removal of abstinence education funding and the way the bill was forced through without proper debate, I am glad we could continue to fund critical needs throughout the state of Kansas. The following projects are of interest to Kansas:  Agriculture/Rural Development (all grants subject to maximum 0.7% rescission) Kansas Polymer Research Center, Pittsburg State University: $1,125,000 National Veterinary Medical Services Act: $875,000 Wheat Genetics, Kansas State University: $258,000 Great Plains Sorghum, Kansas State University: $552,000 Water Conservation, Kansas State University: $75,000 Pre-harvest Food Safety, Kansas State University: $152,000 Language making Lansing,  KS, eligible for Rural Development grants and loans.  Language making Parsons, KS, eligible for RUS wastewater treatment grants and loans. Language making Mid-Kansas Electric Cooperatives eligible for financing from the Rural Utilities Service.  Report language is included that encourages the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to provide regional field crop designations for Sericea Lespedeza.

A regional field crop designation would allow APHIS to work with conservation groups in KS to develop strategies to exterminate Sericea in the Flint Hills.
