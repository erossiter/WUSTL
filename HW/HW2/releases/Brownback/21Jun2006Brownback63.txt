  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the death in Iraq of American soldiers Kristian Menchaca and Thomas Tucker:     
"Every life is precious and holds infinite worth, and we are reminded of this by the sacrifice of these two soldiers and the others who have died in the service of their country in Iraq.  It appears they were brutally tortured, which makes their death especially heartbreaking.     
"We will not stop until we are successful in this war on terrorism.  Their lives will not be forgotten, and we will not pull back in defeat.  We will win this war, and we pledge this to the families who have committed their children's lives so we can expand opportunity and freedom around the world."     
Sen. Brownback sits on the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
