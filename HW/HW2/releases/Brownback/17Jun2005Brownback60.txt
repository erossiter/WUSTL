  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today condemned the presidential elections in Iran, noting that they offer voters no real choice.   
 
“These are bogus elections, leaving Iranians with no real choice to bring the voice of the people to the forefront,” Brownback said.  “Only the candidates approved by the unelected Guardian Council could even get on the ballot.  That’s a far cry from any similarity to democracy, and for the ruling mullahs to claim this offers the people of Iran a chance to make their opinions heard is ridiculous.”   
 
Iranians voted today in a presidential election that is being boycotted by thousands of people who have no faith in the non-elected theocracy, directed by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Khamenei’s power dwarfs both the presidency and parliament.  He and the unelected clerics barred all but a handful of more than 1,000 presidential hopefuls.     
 
President Bush has also called the elections undemocratic and designed to keep clerics in power.  None of the seven candidates is expected to get the 50 percent support needed to win outright, so the two top vote-getters will meet in a runoff election.   
 
Brownback continued, “The regime in Iran is moving farther away from free and fair elections and a democratic transformation, not towards them.  The U.S. and the rest of the free world should strongly condemn these staged elections and work for real elections and the development of civil society in Iran.”   
 
Brownback previously introduced a bill passed by the Senate condemning the unelected Council of Guardians for disqualifying thousands of legitimate candidates solely on religious grounds.  He is also the author of the Iran Democracy Act, which was designed to help create a democratic, secular government in Iran which doesn’t support terrorism and recognizes basic human rights.
