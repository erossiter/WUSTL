  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on Judge Michael Mukasey's pending confirmation to be United States Attorney General.       
"In seeking a nominee who can tackle the central issue of our day, the war against terrorism, you couldn't ask for a more qualified nominee than Judge Mukasey," said Brownback.  "This country needs an attorney general, and Mukasey's nomination has been pending far too long.  I urge my colleagues to quickly pass Judge Mukasey's nomination out of the Judiciary Committee."     
Mukasey's nomination is scheduled for a vote next Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Several Democrats have said they would not vote to pass Mukasey's nomination out of committee.       
Brownback continued, "Judge Mukasey is an outstanding nominee.  Unfortunately, some of my Democrat colleagues have expressed concern over Judge Mukasey's answers to questions about interrogation techniques.  However, the assault on Mukasey's nomination is unfounded.  Mukasey has called waterboarding 'repugnant' and has said that the United States must stand for 'what is right.'  He is committed to upholding the law of the land."       
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
