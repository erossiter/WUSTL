  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the selection of Manhattan, Kansas, as one of the top five possible locations for the construction of the new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility.       
"I am pleased Manhattan, Kansas, was selected as a finalist for NBAF," said Brownback.  "I look forward to working with the Department of Homeland Security to help Manhattan prevail in the final round of selections."     
Manhattan is one five sites, down from an original nationwide selection pool of eighteen, currently being considered by the DHS to house the new facility.  NBAF will be dedicated to researching the biological threats of foreign animal diseases and diseases transferred from animals to humans.     
Brownback continued, "I congratulate the Kansas Bioscience Authority, Kansas State University, the City of Manhattan and the state of Kansas on this honor.  This facility will be a great addition to the Manhattan community and economy."     
It is estimated that over a twenty year period, NBAF would have a $3.5 billion impact on the Kansas economy.  The proposed site would be a $451 million, 500,000 square foot building and will create as many as 500 high-paying, scientific federal jobs in the state of Kansas and will bring additional jobs in research partnerships to the state.
