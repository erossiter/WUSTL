  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement about the expected House vote on the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, H.R.6099.     
"I encourage my colleagues in the House of Representatives pass the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act next week and if they do, I intend to seek unanimous consent that the Senate take up and pass this critical piece of legislation," Brownback said.     
The House is expected next week to vote on H.R. 6099.  The legislation would require those who perform abortions on unborn children 20 weeks after fertilization to inform the woman seeking an abortion of the medical evidence that the unborn child feels pain.  Brownback is the sponsor of the Senate companion bill.         
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights.
