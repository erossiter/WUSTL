  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced Senate passage of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill.  H.R. 2361 provides $27.7 billion for important conservation, forestry, and land management programs, as well as the operations of the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Smithsonian Institution.  Also included is $1.5 billion in emergency funding for the Veterans Administration to cover the VA’s projected shortfalls for Fiscal Year 2005.     
 
“I am pleased with the important funding measures included in this legislation,” Brownback said.  “Some of this funding will enable Americans to continue to enjoy our nation’s natural resources and environment.  Dramatic increases in funding for our nation’s veterans as well as for the Indian Health Service’s mental health programs are particularly important as well.  I am pleased that this important bill has moved one step closer to final passage.”      
 
Also included in H.R. 2361 is funding for projects in the state of Kansas:     
 
$1,159,000 for construction of the North Officers’ Quarters at the Fort Larned National Historic Site, Pawnee County, KS   $500,000 for a raw water transmission line, Medicine Lodge, KS    $250,000 for the Brown Foundation, Topeka, KS   $230,000 for a study of the Ozark Aquifer in Southeast Kansas        
Brownback continued, “As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will work to protect these important projects as the bill goes to Conference.  They are all beneficial to their local communities.”    

Brownback again expressed his disappointment that the President’s request of $5,000,000 for the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture was only partially funded.  “Although the Museum was funded in this bill at last year’s level of $3,944,000, they will need an increase in future fiscal years.  As the Smithsonian looks to move this project forward at an accelerated pace, I will continue fighting for increased funding levels.  This museum will be an important catalyst for racial reconciliation in the country, and I look forward to continue working with the Smithsonian on the construction of this much needed and long-overdue project.”    

Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees the drafting of the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund the operations of the Federal Government and numerous projects in Kansas.
