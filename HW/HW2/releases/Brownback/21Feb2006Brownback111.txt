  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded President Bush’s push for new energy sources:   
“I commend President Bush for his efforts pursuing new energy initiatives.  As he described in his State of the Union address, America has become too dependent on foreign sources of oil.  This is dangerous for both our economic and national security.  As shown by the recent attacks in Nigeria, the worldwide oil infrastructure is fragile and susceptible to unstable global conditions.”   
Last November Brownback co-authored the bipartisan Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act, which aims to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by creating market incentives to encourage the use of renewable and alternative fuel technologies.   
Brownback continued, “I co-authored a plan in the Senate called the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act, which enjoys support from members of both parties in the Senate and House.  If enacted, this bill would introduce more choices in how people power their cars, which could have a big impact on how much foreign oil America needs.  Whether it’s electricity in the form of plug-in hybrid technology or increased use of ethanol and biodiesel, Americans should be more dependent on the Midwest for their fuels and not the Middle East.”   
The bill has 12 co-sponsors, and a companion bill introduced in the House has 42 co-sponsors.
