  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the death of Harold Robinson, the first African American football player at Kansas State and in the Big 7 Conference.       
"I was saddened to hear about the death of Harold Robinson," said Brownback.  "Harold was a courageous man who would not let prejudice deter him from his goal of playing football. As an African American in 1949, Harold faced many obstacles on and off the athletic field, yet he acted with dignity and made our society better by fighting against discrimination."     
In 1949, Robinson, a native of Manhattan, Kansas, joined the football team at Kansas State.  Robinson played in the Big 7 Conference, which is now the Big 12 Conference.  He died May 9, at the age of 76.
