   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback called for the release of Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who was arrested by the Iranian government earlier this month. In the strongest possible terms, I call on the Iranian government to release Dr. Esfandiari immediately and unconditionally, said Brownback. Since traveling to Iran in December to visit her 93-year old mother, Dr. Esfandiari has faced intimidation and harassment, and was sent to the notorious Evin prison, where numerous human rights abuses have been documented. Such gross mistreatment of Dr. Esfandiari is yet another example of how the Iranian regime violates the basic rights and freedoms of the Iranian people. According to Human Rights Watch, Esfandiari was sent to Evin prison without warrant on May 8, after she was summoned by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence for questioning. Brownback sponsored the Iran Human Rights Act in the 109th Congress is a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
