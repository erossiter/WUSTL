  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback tonight made the following statement on the State of the Union address by President Bush:     
“President Bush showed bold leadership and a vision for our country and the world.  I thought he did a wonderful job highlighting issues most important to the American people.     
“I was especially encouraged by President Bush’s efforts to wean America of its dependency on foreign oil by encouraging flex-fuel ethanol vehicles.  We must be more energy independent and I support the President in efforts to make current tax cuts permanent and to improve primary math and science education, all of which will help us continue to grow our economy.  In addition, health care and immigration are critical issues that we must address.     
“I appreciate his strong response to the dictatorial regime in Iran, which must stop its dangerous moves toward nuclear weapons.  I fully agree with our need to continue to take the fight to the terrorists.  We must win this fight.  The President has shown the resolve to do just that."
