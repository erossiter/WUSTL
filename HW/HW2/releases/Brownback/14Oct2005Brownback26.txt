  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the death of C. DeLores Tucker, a leading civil rights activist and crusader against misogynist and violent music lyrics:     
"Our country has lost one of our greatest and most effective advocates for civil rights," said Senator Brownback.  "C. DeLores Tucker fought for equal rights for women, for the well-being of our children, and for values that respect the decency of all members of our society.  She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from Selma to Montgomery, and I'm honored to have known and worked with DeLores.  She leaves a legacy of hope and inspiration."     
Tucker, 78, was both an advocate for women's rights and a pioneer herself.  She was the first African American woman to serve as Secretary of State in Pennsylvania, where she formed the Commission on the Status of Women in Pennsylvania.  Tucker was the first black president of the National Federation of Democratic Women.  In 1991 she established the Bethune-DuBois Institute, which offers scholarships and educational programs  to promote the cultural development of African American youth.  In 1965 she marched from Selma to Montgomery, AL, with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.     
"In the late 90s I worked with DeLores to fight the marketing of media violence to American youth.  I was impressed by her dedication and commitment to improving the cultural values and civic conditions that affect the ability of young people, women, and minorities to succeed.  She set an inspiring example with both her personal achievement in adverse conditions and her effectiveness at advancing her cause," added Sen. Brownback.     
Tucker passed away at the Suburban Woods Health and Rehabilitation Center in Norristown, PA.
