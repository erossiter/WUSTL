  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced his willingness to lift the hold on Judge Janet Neff of Michigan if she agrees to recuse herself from certain cases.     
"I will lift the hold on Judge Neff if I have her assurances that she will recuse herself from cases dealing with same sex unions.  I make this request based on my longstanding belief that this issue should be dealt with by the people and their legislative representatives, not the courts."
