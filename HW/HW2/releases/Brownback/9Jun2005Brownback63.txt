  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced Appropriations Committee approval of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill.  H.R. 2361 provides $26.2 billion for important conservation, forestry, and land management programs, as well as the operations of the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Smithsonian Institution.  The legislation now goes to the full Senate for consideration.     
 
“This legislation contains provisions that are vital to protecting the environmental health of the United States as well as programs designed to involve Americans in our country’s collective history and natural beauty,” Brownback said.  “In particular, I am pleased by the $4.3 million increase in funding for mental health programs through the Indian Health Service.  I commend the Committee’s work on this important bill and my colleague Senator Burns for his leadership as the bill’s manager.”      
 
Brownback also announced funding for projects in the state of Kansas contained in the bill:     
 
$1,159,000 for construction of the North Officers’ Quarters at the Fort Larned National Historic Site, Pawnee County, KS   $500,000 for a raw water transmission line, Medicine Lodge, KS   $500,000 for water infrastructure improvements in Johnson County, KS   $250,000 for the Brown Foundation, Topeka, KS   $230,000 for a study of the Ozark Aquifer in Southeast Kansas        
“These projects will be of great benefit to the communities that they affect.  As the appropriations process moves forward, I will use my position on the Committee to protect this important funding,” Brownback said.    

Brownback expressed his disappointment that the President’s request of $5,000,000 for the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture was only partially funded.  “Although the Museum was funded in this bill at last year’s level [$3,944,000], they will need an increase in the very near future.  As the Smithsonian looks to move this project forward at an accelerated pace, I will continue fighting for increased funding levels.  This museum will be an important catalyst for racial reconciliation in the country, and I look forward to continue working with the Smithsonian on the construction of this much needed and long-overdue project.”
