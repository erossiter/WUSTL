   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the situation in Burma, where peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations against the military junta have turned deadly. I applaud President Bush for calling on the international community to bring an end to the Burmese junta military rule, said Brownback.  The world this week has watched the oppressive military junta in Burma violently turn against peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators.  International leaders at the United Nations condemned the junta's actions, and now is the time for those leaders to act to end the junta's illegitimate brutal reign. It is estimated that more than 100,000 Burmese civilians, including Buddhist monks, this week have peacefully demonstrated against the military junta.  The junta has responded to the demonstrations with warning shots, tear gas and baton charges.  Two monks and two civilians were killed in Wednesday's demonstration.  In response to the junta's actions, President Bush publicly called for stricter sanctions on Burma. Brownback continued, The international community must not stand by idly as the repressive Burmese junta uses deadly force against people who are peacefully expressing opposition to a regime that has destroyed their livelihoods, ravaged their lands and committed innumerable atrocities.  Nineteen years ago, the Burmese people tried to rise up against the junta and they were brutally struck down.  We must not allow such violent oppression to occur again. The Burmese regime has held an uncontested military rule for 45 years.  This week's demonstrations followed the regime's decision last month to double the price of fuel.  The last major citizen uprising in Burma, in 1988, resulted in the death of an estimated 3,000 people. enator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Senator Roberts is a member of the Senate Finance Committee. -30-
