  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded a $10,000,000 Department of Labor grant awarded to the Kansas Department of Commerce that will offset the affects of unemployment caused by recent flooding in Eastern Kansas.       
"I am pleased that the Department of Labor has awarded funding to Kansas communities to help rebuild after being devastated by flooding," said Brownback.  "I spoke to Labor Secretary Chao today and was impressed by her commitment to help Kansas rebuild.  I know that my fellow Kansans will use the funding wisely to quickly and efficiently rebuild their communities."     
According to the Labor Department, the grant will in part aid workers displaced as a result of the recent Kansas flooding.  It will provide temporary jobs to assist in the flood clean-up and recovery efforts.  The award, granted by the Labor Department to the Kansas Department of Commerce, will fund programs in the following counties:  Allen, Anderson, Bourbon, Butler, Chautauqua, Cherokee, Coffey, Cowley, Elk, Franklin, Miami, Montgomery, Neosho, Osage, Wilson, and Woodson.       
Brownback is a member of the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
