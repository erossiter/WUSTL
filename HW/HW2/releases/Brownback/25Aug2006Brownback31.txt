  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today condemned the Chinese government for jailing Chen Guangcheng, a blind activist who had published information about forced abortions and sterilizations.     
"The politically motivated trial of Chen Guangcheng was a mockery of justice," said Brownback.  "Chen has been under house arrest or in jail for the past year and had no access to his lawyers, who were themselves detained on trumped-up charges during the closed-door trial."     
A court in the Shandong Province sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison for "damaging public property and gathering people to block traffic."  Chen has prominently advocated for women and families by bringing to light and criticizing the Chinese government's restrictive family planning practices.  Chen was primarily based in Linyi City in the Shandong Province.     
Brownback continued, "I call on the Chinese government to immediately release Chen Guangcheng and to stop its harassment of other human rights defenders.  The Chinese government should also end its campaign against defense lawyers and activists who attempt to use the legal system to fight for their rights.  Participants in these grassroots movements should not endure harassment and even beatings and detention because of their vigorous efforts to defend the basic rights of Chinese citizens."     
Senator Brownback chairs the Helsinki Commission and is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
