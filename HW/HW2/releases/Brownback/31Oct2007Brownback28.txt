  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today addressed the Advanced Tanker Suppliers Conference and praised the KC-767 as the best choice to replace the Air Force's aging tanker fleet.     
"To properly support the American Warfighter, we must build and deliver world-class tankers," said Brownback.       
The United States Air Force is seeking to replace more than 500 Eisenhower-era KC-135s.  The service is reviewing replacement options and is expected to award a contract for 179 new tankers early next year.     
Brownback continued, "I especially want to congratulate the Kansas companies that continue to play a vital role for the next generation tanker.  Boeing has been in the tanker business from the beginning, and they have put a terrific proposal together.  Spirit Aerosystems will build the forward fuselage, as well as nacelles and struts.  They have been involved with the 767 program from the start."     
The suppliers' conference brought together dozens of representatives of the aerospace industry that contribute to Boeing's 767 tanker program.     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
