  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today condemned North Korea for announcing its intention to conduct a nuclear weapons test.   
“The North Korean regime’s brazen announcement that it will test a nuclear weapon is designed to force the U.S. and international community to continue appeasing and subsidizing North Korea when they should be focusing on supporting its suffering people,” said Brownback.   
Brownback called for discussion beyond the security and military implications of a nuclear test on the Korean Peninsula—where approximately 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed—and suggested an increased focus on the North Korean regime’s squandering of its limited resources on building up a nuclear arsenal while millions of its citizens starve to death.   
“Focusing on military threats alone will not lead to positive changes for North Koreans,” continued Brownback.  “Just as the threat of nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union did not disappear until people behind the Iron Curtain won their freedom, security on the Korean peninsula will depend on the development of democracy and respect for human rights in North Korea.”   
Brownback called on the international community to open up North Korea without propping up the regime.   
“China can play a critical role in opening North Korea or it can continue keeping the regime on life support at the expense of the North Korean people.  A nuclear test should be the ultimate red line, and if North Korea goes ahead with a nuclear weapons test I call on China to suspend its support for Kim Jong Il and his government in Pyongyang.”   
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
