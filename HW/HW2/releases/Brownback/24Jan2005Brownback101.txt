  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated the commander and soldiers of the Army’s 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, for their receipt of the Valorous Unit Award for their service in Iraq.  To earn the award, a unit must have performed with distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission to set it apart from the other units participating in the same conflict.   “I congratulate the 3rd Brigade on their receipt of this distinguished award and everyone who helped support this unit during their training and deployment cycles,” Brownback said.  “I had the opportunity to personally meet several soldiers from this brigade and I was greatly impressed by their dedication and patriotism.  I also believe that this recognition clearly demonstrates Fort Riley’s place as one of the finest Warfighting Centers in the U.S. Army.”   
The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division of the U.S. Army served in Operation Iraqi Freedom from March 2003 to March 2004 and was presented the award at Fort Riley on Friday.   
Brownback was first elected to the Senate to fill the unexpired term of Bob Dole in 1996.  He was returned by the voters of Kansas for a full term in 1998, and reelected this past November.  He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1994-1996.  Brownback serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Joint Economic Committees.  He also serves on the Helsinki Commission.
