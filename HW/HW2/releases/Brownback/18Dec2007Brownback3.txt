   WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated Col. Randy Roebuck, who has been chosen to command the Great Plains Joint Regional Training Center in Salina, Kansas.  I congratulate Col. Roebuck and know that he will offer outstanding leadership at the Great   Plains Training Center, said Brownback. Col. Roebucks leadership will be crucial to realize the Kansas National Guards vision of a unique national training area in the heart of the state. The GPJRTC provides several training opportunities. Army and Air Force units can train for joint operations, while state and local officials can train for first response missions with the National Guard. In addition, the GPJRTC provides in-state pre-mobilization military training. Training areas like the one at Great Plains will be increasingly important with the planned expansion of the Army. Brownback has worked to provide funding for the GPJRTC in the omnibus spending bill currently being debated on the Senate floor.  Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
