  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today met with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to discuss the subject of federalism in Iraq.      
"I am pleased that President Talabani strongly supports the idea of a federal Iraq," said Brownback.  "I agree with President Talabani that federal models, like the United States, provide examples that Iraq can follow to unify its people and keep the country intact."     
Brownback last week joined Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) to introduce an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that called for Iraqis to reach a comprehensive political settlement based on the federal principles in the Iraqi constitution.  The amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 75-23.     
Brownback continued, "The Kurdish region of Iraq is largely stable.  We have seen progress in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province.  The time is right for Iraqis to decentralize power so that Iraqis can live together peacefully within a unified Iraq.  The United States Senate reached a broad, bipartisan agreement endorsing federalism because employing a federal model is the best chance for Iraqis to resolve their differences while living in a united country."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Operations.
