   WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage by unanimous consent of S.193, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which increases by a factor of ten fines for broadcasting indecent material. Brownback authored and introduced the bill last January. I am glad the Senate took action and increased fines for broadcasters who show indecent material, said Brownback. Radio and television waves are public property, and the companies who profit from using the public airwaves should face meaningful fines for broadcasting indecent material. Current fines levied against broadcasters by the Federal Communications Commission are limited to $32,500 per violation, and the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act increases those fines to $325,000 per violation. The bill only raises FCC fines, and does not address other issues such as the definition of indecent material or how the fines are assessed. The bill does not grant the FCC new powers to revoke licenses from broadcasters who play offensive content. Brownback continued, I urge the House to take action on increasing indecency fines so we can send a bill to the White House. Its time that broadcast indecency fines represent a real economic penalty and not just a slap on the wrist. Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Appropriations Committee.
