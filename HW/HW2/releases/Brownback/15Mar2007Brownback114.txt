  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today co-sponsored the A PLUS Act, legislation which would empower states to have more control over education programs.       
"Education must be a top priority for everyone and the A PLUS Act will help ensure that every child receives the education he or she deserves," said Brownback.  "Our current education system has made great strides under the No Child Left Behind Act, but states should be able to exercise more control over the education objectives of their schools."       
The A PLUS Act would allow states to opt-out of federal regulatory constraints and replace them with state regulations to meet the goals and objectives of the No Child Left Behind Program while still receiving federal education dollars.       
Brownback continued, "Allowing states the freedom and flexibility to establish their own educational guidelines will encourage more creativity and innovation in the classroom, which will lead to greater academic achievement."     
The A PLUS Act, introduced today, was also co-sponsored by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Jim DeMint (R-SC), and Mel Martinez (R-FL).      
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
