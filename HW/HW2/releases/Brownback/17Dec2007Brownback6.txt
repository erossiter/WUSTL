  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today was in Kansas to survey damage caused by last week's winter storms.       
"I am impressed by the efficient work of the local municipalities and utilities for their ability to so quickly begin recovery efforts," said Brownback.  "However, many Kansas communities need much more help to rebuild the infrastructure that was devastated during the ice storm.  I will continue to work with my Kansas colleagues in Washington to bring valuable resources to Kansas."          
Brownback visited the Westar Storm Center in Topeka and was updated on outages and recovery efforts.  Brownback traveled also to Horton, Kansas, where he was briefed by local officials on efforts to restore electricity to residents.  Horton Mayor Tim Lentz and Dick Hainje, FEMA Regional Administrator, also took part in the briefings.
