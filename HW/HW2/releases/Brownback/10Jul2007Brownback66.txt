  Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback on Friday sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon urging intervention in the scheduled execution of a North Korean prisoner.  In addition to Brownback, Senators Max Baucus (D-MT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), James Inhoufe, (R-OK), and David Vitter (R-LA) signed the letter.     
Following is full text of the letter:     
We would like to bring to your attention the case of Jong Nam Son, a North Korean refugee, who was recently deported back to North Korea.     
Mr. Son fled to China in 1998 with his wife, son, and brother in an attempt to seek refuge in China.  Subsequently, in 2001, Mr. Son was arrested by Chinese authorities and sent back to North Korea, where he faced imprisonment for three years for working to send missionaries into North Korea.  Upon his release from prison, Mr. Son fled to China once again hoping to find his brother.  In January, 2006, he was again deported back to North Korea and has remained in prison ever since, where he awaits public execution for being a Christian.     
Future cooperation and engagement with North Korea will be far more challenging if its leaders continue to persecute their own people for religious views.  The United States has made political and religious freedoms important elements in its diplomatic relations and we are gravely concerned about abuses of such basic rights in North Korea.   
In light of these concerns, we respectfully ask that you seek the immediate release of Mr. Son.
