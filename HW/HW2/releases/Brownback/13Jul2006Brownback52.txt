  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated the Iraqi Security Forces for taking full control of the Muthanna province.     
"This brings Iraqis one step closer to a stable government and full control of the security of their country," said Brownback.  "While tough challenges remain in Iraq, I think momentum is on our side and Iraqis are eager to stand up and take charge of their security.  In the last few months coalition forces killed the terrorist al-Zarqawi, Iraqis formed a national unity government, and now the Iraqis have taken a crucial first step on the path toward full responsibility for the stability and security of their country."     
The Muthanna province is roughly the size of West Virginia, with a population of over 500,000 people.  The Iraqi Security Forces already lead operations in more than 30,000 square miles of Iraq, but in Muthanna they will have full responsibility for security throughout the province.     
Brownback continued, "This transfer is consistent with our strategy of allowing commanders to assess the conditions on the ground and turn over responsibility to the Iraqis as they become ready to assume control.  I applaud the hard work and tremendous dedication of our men and women in uniform."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
