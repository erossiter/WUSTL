  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced final passage of H.R. 2419, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill.  This important measure provides $31.01 billion for the Department of Energy operations and the flood protection work of the Army Corps of Engineers and more than $60 million for the state of Kansas.  This bill, which is within budget, is now awaiting President Bush’s approval.   
“I am pleased that the Conferees have submitted to the Senate a balanced, fiscally responsible bill that funds the necessary flood prevention work of the Army Corps of Engineers,” Brownback said.  “Having watched the city of New Orleans flood earlier this year, we were reminded of the devastation and destruction that nature can bring.  My colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and I worked to ensure that enough funding is available for flood prevention efforts in Kansas’ most vulnerable areas.”   
Selected projects include:   
Grand (Neosho) River Basin Watershed, KS: $150,000 Rock Creek Basin Stormwater Project, Johnson County, KS: $200,000 Levee Enhancement Project, Augusta, KS: $2,500,000 Sand Creek Ecosystem Restoration Project, Newton, KS: $3,000,000 Turkey Creek Flood Prevention Project, Turkey Creek, KS: $3,000,000 Tuttle Creek Lake Dam Safety Program, Riley County, KS: $27,000,000 Telecommunications Energy Storage Development, Overland Park, KS: $2,500,000
