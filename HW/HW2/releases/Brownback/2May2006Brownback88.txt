  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today condemned Iran for its statement that it would attack Israel if the United States engages in measures to halt Iran's weapons-grade uranium enrichment:     
"Today the world bore witness to another escalation of reprehensible Iranian rhetoric directed against the United States and Israel.  This time, however, Iran explicitly threatened the destruction of Israel were the U.S. to engage in measures to stop its weapons-grade uranium enrichment.     
"We must make it clear to the Iranian regime that we will not submit to this form of blackmail.  The international community has repeatedly called for an end to Iran's nuclear program, citing abundant evidence of the regime's determination to obtain nuclear weapons.  Given Iranian President Ahmadinejad's previous threats against Israel and his rampant Holocaust denial, we must take such words at face value.     
"I am shocked and deeply concerned about the latest threats from Iran.  The U.S. should not take any option off the table when dealing with Iran and I will personally continue to work to implement policies that support the Iranian people's access to basic human rights and freedoms."
