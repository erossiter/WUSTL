  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the death of Coretta Scott King, the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a strong advocate for civil rights and peaceful change:     
“I was greatly saddened to hear of Mrs. King’s passing,” said Brownback.  “Mrs. King was a courageous and valiant woman who held our nation accountable to the principles of peace, equality and equal rights for all Americans.  Her strength and fortitude helped America rise to the challenge of non-violent social change.     
“I had the pleasure of meeting with Mrs. King several years ago.  She was a role model for those of us working toward racial reconciliation in this country.  Mrs. King and her husband saw the possibilities of a nation united, not divided by race or other divisions, and we owe it to them to continue this legacy of compassion and change."     
King, 78, died in her home in Atlanta.
