  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage by 70-28 of the Coleman-Isakson HOPE Act.     
"I am glad the Senate voted overwhelmingly to support adult stem cell research as an ethical and clinically superior alternative to using taxpayer dollars for destructive human embryonic stem cell research," said Brownback. "While I am disappointed that the Senate also passed a bill that provides federal funds for unethical human embryonic stem cell research, I will continue fighting for life and highlighting the success and promise of ethical adult stem cell research."     
In his remarks on the Senate floor during the stem cell debate, Brownback mentioned several personal stories of patients treated with adult stem cells, often at great personal expense.     
 "After a car accident left young Jackie Rabon as a paraplegic, she had to travel to Portugal for treatments based on her own stem cells. Jackie has a long way to go, but she has progressed from feeling nothing below the waist to walking with the aid of braces and a walker.     
"David Fagey was diagnosed with heart disease and told he should move into hospice and prepare for the end, but instead he received adult stem cell treatments in Bangkok, Thailand, and recently wrote me celebrating his improved condition and new hope for life.     
"Dr. Dennis Turner suffered from extreme shaking caused by Parkinson's disease, but his symptoms have subsided significantly since he received an experimental adult stem cell treatment in 1999. Dr. Turner even testified before Congress about his pursuit of a life that would not have been possible without his adult stem cell treatments.     
"It is distressing that we have fallen behind in putting resources behind successful and ethical adult stem cell research. Patients should not have to travel abroad at personal expense for treatments that America cannot provide.
