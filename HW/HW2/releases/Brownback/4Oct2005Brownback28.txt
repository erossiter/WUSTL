  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Harriet Miers, President Bush’s nominee to succeed Sandra Day O’Connor on the Supreme Court.     
“I congratulate Harriet Miers on her nomination to be Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court and I look forward to learning at her confirmation hearing whether she possesses a firm commitment to the Framers' Constitution and to the rule of law,” Brownback stated.  “I am hopeful that Ms. Miers will be, as President Bush promised, a qualified nominee in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas who will strictly interpret the law and will not create law.”     
Brownback, a member of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, previously commented that he hoped the President would nominate a jurist who would strictly interpret the Constitution and who has a well-formed judicial philosophy and stated positions on important issues.     
Brownback continued, “I have said in the past that I would like a nominee with a proven track record on important issues to all Americans and whose judicial philosophy is well-formed.  I am not yet confident that Ms. Miers has a proven track record and I look forward to having these questions answered.  President Bush has a long-standing working relationship with Ms. Miers and I trust the President knows her heart and her mind.  Even so, the confirmation process has just begun and questions about her views on the Constitution need to be answered.  As President Bush and President Reagan have commented in the past, in this regard I feel we must trust but verify.”     
Miers currently serves as Counsel to the President and previously served as President of the State Bar of Texas and as Co-Managing Partner of Locke, Liddell & Sapp in Dallas, Texas.
