  BROWNBACK CONDEMNS BOMBINGS IN PAKISTAN      
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today condemned the bombing in Pakistan that killed dozens of people awaiting the passage of the motorcade of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.     
"I was deeply saddened to learn of the bombings that targeted Prime Minister Bhutto's convoy," said Brownback.  "Americans stand united with the Pakistanis who are horrified by this attack and condemn terrorism.  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families."      
Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's convoy was traveling through Karachi at the time of the explosions.  Bhutto was not harmed, but dozens of other people were injured.  An unconfirmed number of people were killed.      
Brownback continued, "At a time when the government of Pakistan is taking steps towards reconciliation between the major parties, I am encouraged to know that former Prime Minister Bhutto was unharmed.  This vicious and barbaric attack underscores the importance of fighting against militant Islamic extremism."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary Committees.
