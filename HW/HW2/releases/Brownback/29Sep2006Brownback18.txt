  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today criticized a ruling from the Massachusetts Superior Court that same-sex couples residing in Rhode Island can legally marry in Massachusetts.     
"I urge Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly to appeal this ruling," said Brownback.  "Massachusetts courts are not only deciding whether same-sex residents of their own state can marry, but they are also deciding the issue for residents of other states.  This ruling could mean that if a state does not have a constitutional amendment or statute defining traditional marriage, then Massachusetts can issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples from that state. "     
The ruling stems from a challenge brought by several same-sex couples residing outside of the state.  They challenged a 1913 law forbidding Massachusetts from extending marriage licenses to out of state residents if their home state would not permit the marriage.     
Because Rhode Island law does not specifically prohibit same-sex marriage, Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly ruled that it would be in accordance with Massachusetts law for Rhode Island same-sex couples to legally marry in Massachusetts.     
Brownback continued, "This ruling turns the law and common sense upside down.  The court should not assume that a state accepts same-sex marriage just because it has yet to take specific action against it.  Massachusetts should not assume that any other state accepts its novel redefinition of marriage just by remaining silent on the topic thus far."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee.
