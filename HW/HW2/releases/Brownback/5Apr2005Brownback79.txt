  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement in response to recent reports that the leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives will allow a vote for federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research.   
 
“If legislation to expand taxpayer funding of destructive human embryonic stem cell research comes before the Senate in the coming weeks or months, I will use all legislative options available to defeat it.   
 
“I oppose destructive embryonic stem cell research because it results in the untimely termination of a young human life.  To expand taxpayer funding of human embryo-destructive research is wrong, and it cruelly plays on the hopes and fears of those suffering from illness and disease.  We should shift taxpayer funds to non-destructive, ethically-sound research that is resulting in real treatments and real cures for real people.”
