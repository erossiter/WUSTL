  BROWNBACK APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE  OF SUDAN DIVESTMENT LEGISLATION     
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of S. 2271, legislation which allows state governments, asset and pension fund managers to divest from companies that do business with Sudan.  The legislation last night passed the Senate by unanimous consent.      
"This divestment legislation allows the United States to work more effectively to change the economic calculations of the Sudanese regime," said Brownback.  "Since 2003, more than 400,000 people have died in Darfur and more than 2.5 million have been displaced.  We must not stand idly by as more people are displaced from their homes or are killed.  We have said not on our watch, and now we have said not on our dime."      
Brownback earlier this year testified before both a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing and a Senate Banking Committee hearing, urging greater U.S. action to end the genocide in Darfur.  Brownback cosponsored S. 831, the Sudan Divestment Authorization Act of 2007, which authorizes state and local governments to prohibit investment of state assets in any company that has a qualifying business relationship with Sudan.      
Brownback continued, "States across America have already acted to ensure that their pension fund dollars are not invested in foreign companies that help fuel the genocide.  I am proud that Kansas is among the 20 states that have already passed legislation to restrict their Sudan investments."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committee.
