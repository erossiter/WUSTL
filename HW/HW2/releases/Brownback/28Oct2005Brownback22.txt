  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Brownback today made the following statement on recent remarks from the President of Iran:      
"On October 26, 2005, the aggressive intentions of the ruling Iranian regime were made explicit when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad openly and forcefully called for wiping the State of Israel off the face of the earth.     
"This hateful and destructive declaration by President Ahmadinejad not only threatens our closest ally in the region, but it also exposes the Iranian President's callous disregard for human life, human dignity and fundamental religious freedom.  This rhetoric should be condemned by the international community.     
"We must not let this deplorable behavior go unchallenged.  In the context of the Iranian regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons, the international community should heed the warning as a threat to Israel, the region and our own national security.  I am confident that the United States and our allies around the world will successfully confront this danger and move forward with ensuring peace, security, and human rights in the region."
