  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the death of Dr. John Garang, the first vice president of Sudan, who was killed Saturday in a helicopter crash.     
 
"I extend my condolences to the family of Dr. Garang and the people of Sudan," Brownback said.  "He was a man who envisioned a peaceful and prosperous Sudan, and he worked tirelessly toward that goal during his lifetime.  I had the pleasure of meeting with John Garang on several occasions.  My prayers are with his family, the people of southern Sudan, and the government of Sudan during this time of loss."     
 
Dr. Garang was sworn in as the first vice president of Sudan on July 9, 2005 and was instrumental in securing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, ending Africa's longest-running civil war.  Brownback had met with Dr. Garang both in Sudan and in the United States and praised Garang and his leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement to secure peace in recent years.     
 
Brownback remains deeply concerned over the situation in Darfur and the continuing humanitarian catastrophe that has left 2 million displaced from their homes in what the U.S. has deemed a genocide. In addition, the reports of rioting and violence following Dr. Garang's death are of great concern and Brownback urged all parties to abide by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.      
 
Brownback continued, "I urge the government of Sudan to continue to work towards the peaceful settlement of these conflicts and to protect the people of southern Sudan, Darfur and other marginalized regions during this difficult time.  Furthermore, the instability created by support for the Lord's Resistance Army in Northern Uganda should cease immediately, and all parties should work together to turn over the leaders of the Army who continue to abduct children into forced labor as soldiers."
