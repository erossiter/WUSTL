  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on reports that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may visit Ground Zero this weekend during his trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly meeting.     
"The mere prospect of Ahmadinejad standing next to the hallowed site where so many Americans died in the September 11 attacks is outrageous and unacceptable," Brownback said.  "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad represents a regime that is the biggest state sponsor of terror in the world, has threatened genocide, and authorizes deadly force against our troops in Iraq.     
"The fact that he has received a visa to travel to New York City for the General Assembly is disappointing enough.  Ahmadinejad's presence at Ground Zero, under government protection, would be an insult to the victims' families and to all American people.      
"Instead of going to Ground Zero, I call on President Ahmadinejad to renounce terrorism and apologize to all its victims."
