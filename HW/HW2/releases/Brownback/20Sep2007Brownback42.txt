  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today introduced the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act, legislation which would require that a doctor perform an ultrasound and then share the results with the woman and allow her to view the images before performing an abortion.       
 "It is necessary and right to provide a woman seeking an abortion with all the available information so that she may make the most informed decision possible," said Brownback.  "The Ultrasound Informed Consent Act would ensure that women have access to important information."      
The requirements of the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act are placed solely on the doctor, not the patient.  A woman seeking an abortion may refuse to view the images of the ultrasound after the results are made available to her.  Several states including South Carolina and Texas have recently pursued similar legislation.       
Brownback continued, "I am hopeful that this bill will inform women and will cause a deeper reflection on the humanity of unborn children.  It is important to promote a culture that values life in all stages."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
