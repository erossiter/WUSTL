  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback along with Bureau of Prison Director Harley Lappin today toured Leavenworth United States Prison campus, which includes a proposed site for a new U.S. prison facility.  Brownback encouraged Director Lappin to consider Leavenworth as a site for a new prison facility.        
"The Leavenworth community is ready and eager to assist in building a new prison facility," said Brownback.  "Four major prison facilities are currently located within the Leavenworth-Lansing area.  Leavenworth businesses, law-enforcement and city management are ready to work with the Bureau of Prison to build and operate a new prison."      
Currently, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice own acreage that is contiguous to Fort Leavenworth which would be able to accommodate a new prison.  This property currently houses two Bureau of Prison facilities, USP Leavenworth and the minimum security Honor Farm, and would also be able to accommodate a new facility.  The existing infrastructure fits within the Bureau of Prison's current aim to build several facilities in one location, thereby saving tax-payer dollars.       
In July Brownback sent a letter to Director Harley Lappin asking that the BOP consider building its new facility in Leavenworth, Kansas.  Currently, BOP has not made specific plans regarding a new Midwestern facility and is still assessing the need and location for such a facility.       
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
