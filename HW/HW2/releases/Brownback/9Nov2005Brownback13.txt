  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded subcommittee passage of the Marriage Protection Amendment by a 5-4 vote.   
“I’m glad the Marriage Protection Amendment passed the subcommittee and is headed to the full Judiciary Committee for debate and a vote,” said Senator Brownback.  “This is an important step in the fight to protect traditional marriage.”   
The Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, which Brownback chairs, met this afternoon to debate and vote on placing the marriage amendment on the agenda for action at next week’s full Judiciary Committee meeting.  Now that is has cleared the Subcommittee, the amendment must pass through the full Judiciary Committee before it can head to the Senate floor for debate and a vote by all 100 senators.   
Brownback continued, “Every state that has taken up the issue has voted to protect marriage, and another state was added to the growing list yesterday.  The American people support protecting marriage, and it’s important that we debate this amendment in the Senate and give it due consideration through the full legislative process.  This is an issue that none of us felt needed discussion a few years ago, but judicial activism that contradicts the will of the people makes this a pressing issue.  We should act as soon as possible to protect traditional marriage.”
