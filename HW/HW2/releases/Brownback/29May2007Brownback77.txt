   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded President George W. Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Jr., for blocking the assets of two Sudanese officials, a rebel leader and 30 Sudanese companies responsible for directing or supporting the genocide in Darfur. I applaud President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson for taking strong action against the genocide in Darfur, said Brownback. I share the president's impatience with the diplomatic process and frustration over Khartoum's continued thwarting of the diplomatic efforts of the international community. By blocking assets, the Department of Treasury prevents the individuals and companies from accessing the U.S. financial system or doing business with U.S. persons. Any assets already within U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. Brownback continued, It is important to punish the individuals who are directly responsible and also those who are complicit in this tragedy. I hope that tougher sanctions will provide the incentive that the Khartoum government needs to start disarming the government-sponsored Janjaweed militia, allowing a robust U.N. peacekeeping force to protect innocent civilians in Darfur and supporting a viable peace process. These sanctions are important, but we still face a long road ahead to achieve peace and stability in Sudan. The individuals include Ahmad Muhammed Harun, Sudan's State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs; Awad Ibn Auf, Sudan's head of the Military Intelligence and Security; and Khalil Ibrahim, the leader of the Justice and Equality Movement, a rebel group that refused to sign the May 2006 peace agreement. A complete list of the companies is available at: http://www.treasury.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/actions/20070529.shtml Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
