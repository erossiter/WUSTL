  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded Senate passage of S.Res.175, a resolution recognizing the 59th anniversary of the independence of the State of Israel.  Brownback introduced the legislation on Friday with 27 co-sponsors.         
"In passing this resolution, my colleagues and I congratulate the people of Israel for building a vibrant, pluralistic democracy," said Brownback. "Israel serves as an oasis of hope and democracy in an otherwise troubled region.  I am proud to sponsor a resolution that not only recognizes this important fact, but also builds upon the special bond Americans share with the people of Israel.  We must continue to stand strong alongside Israel."     
On Friday, Brownback introduced, and the Senate passed by unanimous consent, the resolution.  The resolution congratulates Israel for its democratic government, and commends the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel.      
Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
