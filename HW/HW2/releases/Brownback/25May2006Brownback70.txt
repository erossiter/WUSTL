  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage by a 62-36 vote of S. 2611, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act.  The bill now heads to a House-Senate conference committee so both sides of Congress can resolve their differences.    
“I am pleased that the Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, which strengthens our border significantly and makes practical provisions for our massive immigration problems,” said Brownback.  “In order to have a workable immigration system we must fix the existing problems.  We learned from the mistakes of the 1986 amnesty bill and the 1996 enforcement-only bill that immigration reform must be comprehensive.”   
The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act combines border and employer enforcement provisions with a guest-worker program for future immigrants and provides current undocumented immigrants the ability to earn legalized status if they pay a fine, pay back taxes, and learn English, along with other steps, in order to legally work in the United States.   
Brownback continued, “We must be a nation of laws, but we must also be compassionate.  Right now, there are more than 12 million immigrants in the country illegally, and we must bring these people out of the shadows without rewarding them for past transgressions.”   
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights.
