  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement on the fire that burned much of historic downtown Fort Scott, Kansas Friday night.   
 
“The fire in Fort Scott is a terrible disaster upon the community.  My heart goes out to everyone, and knowing the people of Fort Scott, they will rebound and be stronger and better than ever.  Our office will try to do everything we can to help.”   
 
Brownback was first elected to the Senate to fill the unexpired term of Bob Dole in 1996.  He was returned by the voters of Kansas for a full term in 1998, and reelected this past November.  He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1994-1996.  Brownback serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Joint Economic Committees.  He also is chairman of the Helsinki Commission.
