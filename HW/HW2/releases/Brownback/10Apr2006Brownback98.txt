  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following statement on the immigration reform bill that stalled in the Senate last week:     
"The hallmark of the Senate is deliberation before decision," said Senator Brownback.  "Yet last week, the Democrat leadership frustrated this purpose during the Senate's consideration of the comprehensive immigration reform bill.  Although we had forged a bipartisan consensus supported by a strong majority of Senators, the Democrat leadership refused to allow several of my colleagues to get votes on their amendments to the bill, ultimately undermining the entire bill.  However, the millions of protesters we see in the streets, and the millions more constituents who are writing to us, want results on this critical issue.  I therefore call upon the Democrat leadership to allow for debate and a series of votes on a reasonable number of amendments, in order for the bipartisan consensus we have achieved on immigration reform to go forward."     
Last Thursday a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform stalled in the Senate over disagreements about whether to allow amendments to be attached to the Securing America's Borders Act.     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on the Constitution.
