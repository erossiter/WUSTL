  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback made the following statement after a San Francisco Superior Court judge struck down two California laws that limit marriage to a man and a woman.   
 
“This is another instance of judicial tyranny where one judge has thrown out the will of the people over an issue of deep concern to society in general.  We’ll have several hearings on this issue in the Senate Constitution Subcommittee in the upcoming legislative session.”   
 
Brownback is chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  He was first elected to the Senate to fill the unexpired term of Bob Dole in 1996.  He was returned by the voters of Kansas for a full term in 1998, and reelected this past November.  He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1994-1996.  Brownback serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Joint Economic Committees.  He also is chairman of the Helsinki Commission.
