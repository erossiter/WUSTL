  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today sponsored a Senate resolution asking President Bush to posthumously award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Harry Colmery, a Kansas veteran who was instrumental in drafting the GI Bill of Rights.  Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas co-sponsored this resolution.         
"Mr. Colmery lived a life of service to his country, and America should recognize and honor him," said Brownback.  "Bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom upon Mr. Colmery is a testament to his family that America truly appreciates the work and deeds of this great man."      
After serving in the Army Air Service during World War I, Colmery settled in Topeka, Kansas.  In 1943 Colmery with the American Legion drafted the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, which later became known as the GI Bill of Rights.       
Brownback continued, "The GI Bill of Rights has provided innumerable services to the men and women who have fought for our nation's ideals of freedom and democracy.  The GI Bill of Rights has helped many veterans adjust to civilian life after serving in the armed services."     
Since its enactment in 1944, the GI Bill of Rights has provided education or training for 21 million veterans.  More than 2 million World War II veterans purchased homes through the GI Bill of Rights.       
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
