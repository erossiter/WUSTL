  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced final passage of H.R. 2862, the FY2006 Science, State, Justice, and Commerce Appropriations bill.  As passed, the measure provides $68.01 billion for the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce as well as NASA, NOAA, and the National Science Foundation.  This bill, which is within budget, now goes to the President’s desk for his signature.    
“I am pleased that Congress has finished work on this vitally important bill,” Brownback said.  “One of the government’s most important jobs is to provide protection for its citizens from criminal elements in society, and this bill does just that by providing necessary funding to our nation’s police departments.  Programs ranging from those that keep juveniles from a life of crime to those that promote space exploration have received balanced and proper funding, and I am pleased to have worked on drafting it with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee.”    
Numerous projects in the State of Kansas were also funded in this bill.  Selected projects include:    
Big Brothers Big Sisters Mentoring Program for At-Risk Rural Youth: $200,000 800 MHz Emergency Services Radio Interoperability Upgrade, Kansas DOT: $200,000 Kansas Methamphetamine Prevention Project: $100,000 GoGirlGo Initiative for Johnson and Wyandotte Counties: $300,000 Public Safety Equipment, Sedgwick County Sheriff’s office: $50,000   
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee, which drafts the twelve annual appropriations bills that fund the operations of the Federal Government and numerous projects in the State of Kansas.
