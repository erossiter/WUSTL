   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the decision by Dillons Grocery Stores to rebuild a full service supermarket which will serve the Greensburg, Kansas, community. I applaud Dillons for its leadership in helping the Greensburg community to continue to recover and prosper, said Brownback.  Dillons commitment to Greensburg will be of great assistance to the overall community redevelopment efforts and will help facilitate the return of additional residents and businesses.  I am proud of the resiliency of the people of Greensburg and will continue to work with them in rebuilding an outstanding Kansas community. Dillons Grocery Stores this afternoon announced that their Greensburg Kwik Shop convenience store will be converted into a Dillons Grocery Store and Kwik Shop. Brownback last May spoke with David Dillon, the CEO of Kroger, which is the parent company of Dillons Grocery Stores, and asked Dillons to consider rebuilding their Greensburg store which was severely damaged by the May 4th tornado.  Brownback today again spoke with David Dillon expressing his gratitude on behalf of the Greensburg community. Brownback is a member of the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees. -30-
