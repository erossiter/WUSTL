   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Pat Roberts (R-KS) today introduced a Senate Resolution condemning the attachment of politically confrontational provisions to any bill which funds the implementation of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's recommendations. I encourage my Senate colleagues to support this resolution and to pass a clean Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill with full BRAC funding which fully funds Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth, said Brownback. Funding for the BRAC Commission's recommendations is urgent and should not be held hostage by partisan politics.  Voting in favor of a funding bill that President Bush will veto because of extraneous controversial provisions undermines Kansas military installations and the many communities that support them. The U.S. House of Representatives is soon expected to vote on H.R. 1591, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, which provides over $100 billion to fund ongoing military operations in the Global War on Terror.  H.R. 1591 also will address BRAC projects which are not funded by the FY2007 Continuing Resolution.  President Bush has vowed to veto H.R. 1591 in its current form because of provisions which would require him to begin redeployment of troops from Iraq. Brownback continued, It is wrong to attach a time-line to this funding bill, and this proves that the Democrats have no plan for winning the War on Terror.  It is a political stunt for Congress to send a bill to the President knowing it will be vetoed.  Regrettably, this stunt is one which will cost lives. Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees. -30-
