  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today released a statement condemning Iran’s resumption of its nuclear program and inflammatory statements from its president.     
 “Today’s nuclear developments in Iran are simply the latest move in a pattern of threatening and destructive behavior, clearly articulating the regime’s unceasing drive to acquire weapons of mass destruction.  I am deeply concerned about Iran’s decision to renew their pursuit of nuclear technology by removing the United Nations seals on the nuclear enrichment facilities.  It is time for decisive and immediate action by all members of the United Nations Security Council.   
   “I recently sent a letter to Secretary General Kofi Annan in which I expressed my concern over President Ahmadinejand’s reprehensible statements about wiping Israel off the map.  More recently, President Ahmadeinejad denied the Holocaust and wished death upon Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  These statements reveal the racist and destructive intentions of the regime. The international community should take very seriously both the words and actions of a government that has openly called for the annihilation of another United Nations member state.   
   “Today’s developments are compounded by the destructive results of terrorist acts around the world committed by groups bolstered by Iranian support and the grave human rights abuses committed by the Iranian regime against its own people.   
  “As we have learned time and again, words without action fall upon the deaf ears of tyrants and oppressors.  The international community and the United Nations must confront this growing crisis immediately.”   
 Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
