  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the Senate Appropriations Committee passage of the Emergency Agricultural Disaster Assistance Amendment to the Iraq War Supplemental Appropriations Act.       
“Kansas farmers and ranchers work hard to produce the best agricultural products in the world, and they need relief from recent unpredictable weather-related disasters,” said Brownback.  “I will continue to fight for Kansas agriculture and I applaud the Senate for passing this relief amendment.”    
In many areas of Kansas, several years of drought have decimated row crops and reduced water supplies for livestock.  In other regions of the country, farmers are experiencing crop destruction and reduced yields because of flooding and an increased incidence of crop pests and diseases due to an unusually strong hurricane season.   
Brownback continued, “Significantly increased costs of fuel and fertilizer over this past year severely harms agriculture and our rural communities.  Some farmers have seen their energy bills double in recent years, which is especially debilitating because they are already operating on tight profit margins.  These increases in overhead costs can have a devastating effect on our farmers and food supply.”    
In the United States, farm income is predicted to drop 21 percent this year, from $83 billion in 2005 to $65 billion in 2006.      
Brownback is a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations.
