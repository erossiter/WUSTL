  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the re-introduction of the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, which would federally regulate broadband companies' business relationships with their content providers.       
"The Internet Freedom Preservation Act would unfairly punish broadband access providers for innovation and competition," said Brownback.  "Over the years, we have seen impressive Internet growth, due in large part to the absence of unnecessary government regulation.  Given the billions of dollars broadband access providers have invested in creating and maintaining Internet infrastructure, it is reasonable for them to request that content providers pay their fair share for the services they use."     
The Internet Freedom Preservation Act today was re-introduced by Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Bryon Dorgan (D-ND).       
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
