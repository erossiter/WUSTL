  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced final passage of a $51.8 billion emergency supplemental appropriations bill that will continue to aid in the relief and recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.  This comes on the heels of a $10 billion emergency relief bill that passed the Senate last Thursday.     
"The relief and reconstruction effort must be properly funded and effective," said Brownback.  "We owe this to the people who are suffering and have been displaced from all over the Gulf Coast.  The Senate has shown its commitment to provide relief to those affected by passing two emergency funding bills, and we will continue to stand beside them as long as it takes."     
Of the $51.8 billion made available in this bill, $50 billion is available for disaster relief, $1.4 billion is for the armed forces responding to the crisis, and $400 million is for the Army Corps of Engineers as they continue to work on the levees and flood walls surrounding New Orleans.     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee which oversees the drafting of emergency supplemental appropriations bills as well as 12 annual bills that fund the federal government.
