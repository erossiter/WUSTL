  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded President Bush for encouraging increased transparency in health care prices, which could help lower health care costs by providing consumers with better information about health care prices.  Last month, Brownback advocated a similar approach and sponsored the Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act, which would make Medicare price information available online.     
"I agree with President Bush that improved health care price transparency will help lower medical costs," said Brownback.  "This is why I introduced the Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act, which would create price transparency at a consumer level, allowing Americans to make their own choices for health care services in their region.  Public price information will provide a critical baseline for individuals to assess health care costs so they can easily compare medical services and find the best price."     
Under the president's plan, announced Monday in a speech before the American Hospital Association, the Department of Health and Human Services will soon publish Medicare price information on the Internet.  Medicare prices often influence what major insurers are willing to pay for health care services, which can be helpful information for individuals shopping for health care services.     
Brownback continued, "The Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act would remove major barriers for consumers by empowering them with crucial information so they can take charge of their health care spending."     
Brownback's bill establishes a single internet location with regional Medicare reimbursement rates for common medical procedures and physician visits, searchable by zip code.
