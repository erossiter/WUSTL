  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the Senate vote for Judge Leslie Southwick's nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  The Senate voted, 59-38, to confirm Southwick.       
"Judge Southwick has an outstanding judicial record, a proven commitment to public service, and a remarkable dedication to his country," said Brownback.  "I know that Judge Southwick will be a great addition to the federal appellate bench."     
Southwick, an Iraq war veteran, was nominated to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, a vacancy that had been deemed a judicial emergency.  In 2004, the Mississippi State Bar honored Judge Southwick with its Judicial Excellence Award.  Southwick also has been rated by the American Bar Association as "Well-Qualified," which is the ABA's highest rating.       
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
