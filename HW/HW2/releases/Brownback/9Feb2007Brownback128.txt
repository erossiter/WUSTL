  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the decision of the Department of Veteran's Affairs to open a vet center in Manhattan, Kansas, which would provide readjustment counseling and outreach services to combat veterans.  The center is scheduled to open in 2008.       
"Our combat veterans have sacrificed greatly for our country and deserve the best treatment we can provide, and I know Manhattan will serve them well," said Brownback.  "With the return of the Big Red One to Fort Riley, there will be more combat veterans in central Kansas than there has been in decades.  We are hopeful that many Fort Riley soldiers will make Kansas their permanent home upon discharge from duty.  We must do everything we can to support these veterans and their families."     
According to the Department of Veteran's Affairs, all vet centers are community based.  The centers provide mental health and employment counseling to veterans, as well as outreach and bereavement programs for veterans' families.       
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Appropriations Committee.
