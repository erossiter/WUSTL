  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted against S.J. Res. 9, legislation which proposes a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.     
"I believe that announcing a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq threatens to give a victory to the terrorists," said Brownback.  "Congress should not use a binding resolution to mandate the length of our presence in Iraq.  Our commitment should be driven by the mission we must complete."       
The Senate today voted on S.J. Res. 9 along with several other pieces of legislation to decide if Congress should continue to fund U.S. troops in Iraq or if a timetable for troop withdrawal should be established.  S.J. Res. 9 failed by a 48-50 vote to pass the Senate.         
Brownback continued, "The withdrawal resolution presents a choice between pursuing victory and calling for retreat.  I believe victory is still possible and that failure is unacceptable.  We must win the fight against terrorism, and I look forward to further Senate debates that will move us toward policies that make victory in Iraq a priority."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary Committees.
