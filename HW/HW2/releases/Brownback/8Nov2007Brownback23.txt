   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today called for repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax at a JEC hearing with Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke.   In the face of mounting pressure on the economy, the idea of raising taxes seems exactly the wrong prescription, Brownback said. Failing to fix or, better yet, repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax will hurt families and hurt economic growth.    Congress has only seven weeks to extend the AMT before many middle-income taxpayers will have to pay significantly higher taxes.  Brownback also warned Democrats about the consequences of killing many of the Republican tax cuts: Allowing capital gains and dividend tax relief to expire without even a vote or imposing higher rates of taxation on carried interest will only hamper the efficient movement of capital within the economy.  In my view, the efficient movement of capital is a critical issue at any time, but especially now.  Senator Sam Brownback is Senior Republican Senator on the Joint Economic Committee
