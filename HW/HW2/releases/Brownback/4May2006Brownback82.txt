   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today urged passage of S.193, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which would increase fines for broadcasting obscene, indecent, or profane material by a factor of ten. There is overwhelming bipartisan support for the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act in both chambers of Congress, said Brownback. In 2004 ninety of my current Senate colleagues voted in support of an amendment containing the exact same language contained in the Decency Act. In fact, the only 'no' vote was cast by a Senator who is no longer serving. Last year, the House passed a similar bill by a vote of 389-38. Current fines levied against broadcasters by the Federal Communication Commission are limited to $32,500 per violation. The Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act would increase those fines to $325,000 per violation. Brownback continued, I hope my colleagues will join me in making decency fines meaningful. Broadcasters have the privilege of using the public airwaves. In return, we ask that they keep their content free from indecent, obscene and profane speech between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., when children are likely to be watching. Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee.
