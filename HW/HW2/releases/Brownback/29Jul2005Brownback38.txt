  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced final Senate passage of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill.  H.R. 2361 provides $26.2 billion for important conservation, forestry, and land management programs, as well as the operations of the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Smithsonian Institution.  Also included is $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for the Veterans Administration to cover the VA's projected shortfalls for Fiscal Year 2005.  The bill now goes to the President's desk for his signature.     
 
"Americans value the natural resources and environment of this great land, and this legislation will help them continue to enjoy these resources," Brownback said.  "Additionally, our military veterans will benefit from the supplemental funding included in this bill for the VA.  For their sacrifice, we owe our veterans the best services we can provide."     
 
Also included in H.R. 2361 is funding for projects in the state of Kansas:     
 
$1,159,000 for construction of the North Officers' Quarters at the Fort Larned National Historic Site, Pawnee County, KS   $500,000 for a raw water transmission line, Medicine Lodge, KS    $250,000 for the Brown Foundation, Topeka, KS   $230,000 for a study of the Ozark Aquifer in Southeast Kansas        
Brownback again expressed his disappointment that the President's request of $5,000,000 for the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture was only partially funded.  "This Museum is an important project for our country's racial reconciliation, and it is long overdue.  We will need to increase funding for the Museum in future years, since this year's funding fell about $1 million short of the President's request.  I'll continue to work with the Smithsonian on the construction of this  project and to press for increased funding levels for the Museum."     

Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees the drafting of the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund the operations of the federal government and numerous projects in Kansas.
