  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today thanked Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns for scheduling a Farm Bill Listening Tour in Kansas at the State Fair.     
"I'm very pleased and thankful that Secretary Johanns has announced that he will hold a Farm Bill Listening Session at the State Fair this September," stated Brownback.  "I invited with him earlier this year and asked him to visit Kansas during the State Fair to hold a listening session, and I'm so pleased he has accepted."     
On Monday, Sept. 12, Secretary Johanns will be in Kansas to host a USDA Farm Bill Listening Session tentatively from 9:00 a.m. to noon at the Kansas State Fairgrounds in Hutchinson, Kansas.     Brownback continued, "I look forward to hearing what Secretary Johanns has to say about the upcoming farm bill debate, but more importantly, I want to hear what farmers in Kansas have to say about the 2007 Farm Bill.  This is a great event for Kansas farmers to voice their concerns and I look forward to hearing them."
