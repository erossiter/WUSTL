  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the passing of Representative Henry Hyde.     
"Henry was an early leader in the pro-life movement known for his conviction, wisdom and decency," said Brownback. "He forged a path many years ago for a culture that respects life and human dignity. I had the pleasure of working with Henry in the House, where he served as a guiding light to focus on what matters the most at the end of the day. My thoughts and prayers are with his family as they mourn his passing and celebrate his life and remarkable achievements."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committee.
