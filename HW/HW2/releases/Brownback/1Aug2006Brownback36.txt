  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today welcomed the return of the headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division, also known as the Big Red One, to Ft. Riley, KS after ten years in Germany.     
"This is a great homecoming for the Big Red One and for Kansas," said Brownback at a welcoming ceremony at Ft. Riley.  "The Big Red One enjoys a long and proud history of defending America and bringing the fight to the enemy, and I am proud it's coming back to Kansas where it belongs."     
The Big Red One has fought in major engagements ranging from D-Day on Omaha Beach in World War II to responding to the Tet Offensive in Vietnam.  The Big Red One played integral roles in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to the present.  The 1st Infantry Division moved its headquarters from Germany to Ft. Riley in 1955, was briefly based in Vietnam, and then moved its headquarters to Wurzburg, Germany in 1996.     
Brownback continued, "The Big Red One's move back to Ft. Riley means new economic opportunities for Kansas.  A new division headquarters is under construction, thousands of soldiers are moving to the area, and I will work closely with nearby communities to make sure they can take advantage of this opportunity for growth."     
Ft. Riley is named after Maj. Gen. Bennett C. Riley, who led the first military escort along the Santa Fe Trail.  Ft. Riley trained tens of thousands of troops during World Wars I and II and also during the Korean War.  Following the transfer of the headquarters of the Big Red One to Germany in 1996, Ft. Riley was home to the headquarters of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division.     
Brownback is a member of the Military Construction Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
