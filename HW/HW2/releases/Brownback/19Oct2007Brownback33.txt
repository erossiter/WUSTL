  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Rod Bremby's decision to deny Sunflower Electric air quality permits necessary for Sunflower Electric's proposed plant expansion.        
"I am disappointed by Secretary Bremby's announcement," said Brownback.   "The expansion of Sunflower Electric would have brought to Kansas billions of dollars in investment and created new jobs.  Secretary Bremby's decision is not in the best interest of Kansas and does not have statutory authority."     
Sunflower Electric had sought to expand its existing coal-fired power plant in Holcomb, Kansas, but was denied the necessary air quality permits due to concerns over carbon dioxide emissions.  According to a Fort Hays State University study, the expansion would have created 2,000 jobs during construction and 400 permanent jobs.        
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary Committees.
