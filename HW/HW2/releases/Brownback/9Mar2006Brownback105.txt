  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced the passage of his amendment permanently authorizing the J-1 visa waiver program which enhances medical care in rural and other underserved areas.     
“The passage of this amendment is crucial for Kansas, where citizens living in rural areas often have limited access to health care due to a shortage of medical services and professionals,” said Brownback.  “The Health Policy Institute projects a shortfall of 200,000 physicians by 2020.  Though the J-1 visa waiver program would account for a small percentage of this shortage, its impact would still be significant in rural areas.”   
This program, an amendment to Senator Arlen Specter’s pending comprehensive immigration reform bill, enables states to waive the two-year home residency requirement for foreign medical students and physicians who serve in “medically underserved areas” upon completion of their J-1 program.    
In 1994, Congress established the J-1 visa waiver program.  Under this program, participating states were allocated 20 J-1 visa waivers.  The program was reauthorized in the 107th as well as the108th Congress, at which point the annual number of waivers was increased to 30.  The program is now set to expire on June 1, 2006.  The passage of Senator Brownback’s amendment, however, will permanently authorize the program.     
“This program has a positive impact on participating states, especially those with great numbers of citizens living in rural areas,” continued Brownback.  “Since its inception in 1994, not a single state has terminated its participation in the program; currently, all 50 states participate, which speaks to the program’s ability to assist state health departments in meeting the need of their most underserved patients.”   
Senator Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee.
