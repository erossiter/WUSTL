  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the vote by the Smithsonian Board of Regents to locate the future National Museum of African-American History and Culture on Madison Drive between 14th and 15th Streets, near the Washington Monument.   
“Today I applaud the decision by the Smithsonian Board of Regents to locate the National Museum of African-American History and Culture on the National Mall,” said Sen. Brownback.  “Of the many sites the Smithsonian considered, I believe they chose the best one.  Giving this museum a central location on the Mall stresses the importance of African-American history and shows how it is inseparable from American history.”   
For the past five-and-a-half years Sen. Brownback and Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) have worked together to make the museum a reality.  Brownback introduced the Senate bill that was signed into law on December 16, 2003, with the cooperation of the Smithsonian Institution and the NMAAHC Plan for Action presidential commission.  Since then, the Smithsonian Board of Regents and the NMAAHC advisory council have reviewed potential sites and started hiring senior staff for the museum.   
Brownback continued, “It has always been my hope that this museum will not only nationally showcase the great accomplishments of African-Americans, but will also serve as a catalyst for racial reconciliation in our nation.  I do not pretend that this museum is a panacea for racial reconciliation, but it is a productive step that recognizes the important contributions of African-Americans and the debt owed to them by all Americans.”   
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee and chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution.
