  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the 7th annual World Refugee Day, which was established by the United Nations General Assembly.     
"Americans enjoy the benefits of living in a free and open society, but we must remember that many people around the world unfortunately do not," said Brownback.  "A nation's goodness depends on the goodwill it bestows on those most in need of help.  Developed nations around the world should extend a helping hand to those seeking refuge from dictatorial or totalitarian regimes."     
According to U.S. law, a refugee is a person outside the U.S. who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of origin because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.  At the beginning of each fiscal year, the President consults with Congress to establish a worldwide refugee admissions ceiling for that year and to set allocations for each of the six geographic regions. In the case of an unforeseen emergency, the total ceiling and regional sub-ceilings may be adjusted. For Fiscal Year 2007, the Administration proposes to admit 70,000 refugees to the United States, which is the same level as for Fiscal Years 2002 - 2006.       
The United States is the single largest donor to refugee assistance and resettlement programs around the world.  Brownback in 2004 authored the North Korean Human Rights Act, under which North Koreans have been admitted into the U.S. as refugees for the first time since the Korean War.     
Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
