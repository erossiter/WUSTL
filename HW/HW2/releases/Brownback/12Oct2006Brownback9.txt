  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated Shilpi Ganguly, a sixth grade student at Trailwood Elementary in Overland Park, for advancing to the finalist stage in the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge.     
"Shilpi sets a great example for students and aspiring scientists in Kansas," said Brownback.  "I'm proud that a young Kansan made the cut from the tens of thousands of students nationwide who entered this contest.  I wish Shilpi the best as she travels to Washington and competes for the title of America's Top Young Scientist of the Year."     
Of the 70,000 students nationwide who participated in science fairs affiliated with the Science Service, 1,900 submitted formal entries, 400 were selected as semifinalists, and 40 made the cut as finalists.  During October 21 to 25 all 40 finalists, including Ganguly, will compete at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland, for $100,000 in prizes and scholarships.     
This year's theme focuses on the impact and causes of global health issues such as Avian Flu and obesity.  The students will prepare team presentations and conduct experiments designed by the Discovery Channel and the NIH.  The Discovery Channel will broadcast highlights of the competition.     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science.
