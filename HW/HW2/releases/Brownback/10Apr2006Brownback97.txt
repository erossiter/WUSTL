  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated Kristina Hilboldt, currently interning in his Washington office, who was selected on Friday to serve as the 2006 Cherry Blossom Queen.       
"Congratulations to Kristina; she will represent Kansas and the United States well as Cherry Blossom Queen," said Brownback.  "This is an example of the excellent opportunities for young Kansans who spend a semester interning for their elected officials.  I encourage students to apply for internships in Kansas and in Washington."     
This year's Cherry Blossom Festival marks the 94th celebration of the original gift of the 3,000 cherry trees from the city of Tokyo to the people of Washington, D.C., in 1912.  As a part of the official duties of Cherry Blossom Queen, Hilboldt will travel to Japan this May to represent the United States and promote goodwill between the two nations.       
Brownback continued, "Kristina should serve as an example to other college students.  As an intern in my office she has taken full advantage of her time in Washington, D.C."     
Hilboldt, a senior at the University of Kansas and one of 51 Cherry Blossom Princesses, had been chosen to represent Kansas.  The other princesses came from around the United States as well as several other countries.  At the Cherry Blossom Pageant, held on Friday night, Hilboldt was selected to serve as Cherry Blossom Queen for 2006.
