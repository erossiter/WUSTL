  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded inclusion in the Senate Farm Bill of a provision that would require the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to hold an annual exposition of products made from bio-based materials.       
"I am pleased the Senate Agriculture Committee included in the Farm Bill my new uses expo amendment," said Brownback.  "Increased use of bio-based products creates jobs in rural areas, puts more money in farmers' pockets, is good for the environment, and good for Kansas."       
Brownback spoke several times with former Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns about the new uses expo.  Brownback recently spoke with the nominee to be Ag Secretary, Ed Schafer, about the need for this expo.    The Farm Bill is currently being debated on the Senate floor.  A vote on the bill is expected next week.       
Brownback continued, "The time is right for the increased use of bio-based products.  We have a chance to create new markets for traditional agricultural products.  An annual new uses expo will help make that a reality."      
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary Committees.
