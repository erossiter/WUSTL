  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the 4.8 percent growth in Gross Domestic Product shown in new data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.     
"This morning's strong first quarter GDP growth figure confirms that the American economy continues charging ahead, creating prosperity and opportunity for Americans," said Brownback.  "America's economy is growing at its fastest rate since 2003, and we have seen positive growth for eighteen quarters in a row."     
Brownback credited President Bush and the Republican majorities in Congress for pursing policies that have contributed to American economic growth.     
"Although rising gas and energy prices and one of the worst natural disasters in American history have tested the resilience of our economy, America's economy continues to expand," stated Brownback.  "The tax cuts and reduced federal regulations pursued by President Bush and the Republican majorities in Congress have helped support this amazing growth."     
Senator Brownback serves on the Joint Economic Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Committee.
