   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today paid his respects to the family, friends and loved ones of Reverend Jerry Falwell. Today, America lost a true spiritual leader and a man of great faith in Jerry Falwell. His great words and actions will never be forgotten by the hundreds of thousands of people around the world that his life has touched. Jerry's moral character and principle will forever be remembered deep within my heart and those whose lives were so blessed to be touched by him. Reverend Falwell, who passed away earlier today, was 73 years old.
