  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on today's Senate vote to invoke cloture on S. 1348, the Immigration Reform Bill.       
"Fixing our broken immigration system must be a priority for the sake of our national security and our nation's future," said Brownback.  "It is important that we have this debate over how to fix our immigration system and that is why I voted to proceed to debate the bill."     
Today's procedural vote passed the Senate by 69-23.  The Senate tomorrow will begin debate on the Immigration Reform Bill.          
Brownback continued, "There are good aspects of the bill such as enhancing border security and establishing a robust worksite enforcement system.  But there are also some provisions of the bill that can be greatly improved.  I am particularly concerned by provisions of the bill that could grant legal status and work authorization to undocumented immigrants before the government could complete a background check."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
