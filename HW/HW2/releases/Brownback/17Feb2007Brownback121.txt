  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on today's procedural Senate vote on S. 574, which expresses disagreement with President Bush's plan to increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq.     
"I am disappointed that Democratic leadership continues to deny the Senate the opportunity to have a full discussion of ideas on the very critical issue of the war in Iraq," said Brownback.  "It is important that the Senate has a full debate in which senators can offer amendments and vote on several different proposals."     
Fifty-six senators voted in favor of closing off debate, while 34, including Brownback, voted against the cloture motion.  Cloture failed because the motion requires 60 votes to pass.  The House yesterday passed the same measure under consideration in the Senate by a 246-182 vote.       
Brownback continued, "While I do not think a troop surge is the best course of action, I believe that the Senate should be allowed to vote on resolutions that would demonstrate support for the men and women serving in our military and guarantee they have the funds necessary to complete their mission."      
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Judiciary Committee.
