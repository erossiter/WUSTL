  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) today introduced the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005, which enables the Federal Communications Commission to increase tenfold the current fines on television and radio broadcasters who violate the FCC decency rules regarding over-the-air public broadcasts.   
The legislation increases the maximum fine for each violation to $325,000 with a penalty cap of $3 million for any single act.   
“The Senate overwhelmingly agrees that the FCC needs better tools to enforce broadcast decency laws—the original Decency bill passed 99 to 1 last year,” Brownback said.  “We must have punitive damages to give some teeth to the current fine structure so there will be meaningful deterrents to broadcasters who may air indecent or obscene broadcasts.”   
“In a media culture that increasingly pushes the envelope on sex and violence, the role of the FCC is to ensure that broadcasters do not cross that line of decency,” Lieberman said.  “This legislation gives the FCC more leverage to do its job by increasing the consequences of violating our broadcasting standards.”   
Current law caps penalties at $32,500 per offense.     
Additional Senate sponsors of the bill include Senators George Allen (R-VA), Jim DeMint (R-NC), Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), John Ensign (R-NV), Michael Enzi (R-WY), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Charles Grassley (R-IA), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), James Inhofe (R-OK), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Trent Lott (R-MS), Mel Martinez (R-FL), John McCain (R-AZ), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Rick Santorum (R-PA), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Craig Thomas (R-WY), and John Thune (R-SD).   
A similar bill has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI).
