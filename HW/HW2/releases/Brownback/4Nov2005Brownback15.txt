  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded passage of legislation expanding a successful home health care program for urban seniors to also provide coverage for rural seniors.  The bill, called the Community Options for Rural Elders Act, expands the coverage areas of a current program that provides urban seniors in-home alternatives to permanently moving into full-time assisted living facilities.   
“This bill gives rural seniors the option of continuing to live at home while making occasional visits to healthcare sites for treatments,” said Senator Brownback.  “Not only are seniors living at home more likely stay healthy, but home health care is more cost-effective than institutionalized care.  Seniors are happier and live longer, and taxpayer money is better spent.”   
The CORE Act builds on the Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly, a Medicare program started in 1997.  The PACE program allows seniors to continue living at home while receiving treatments, instead of being institutionalized.   
However, for seniors to take advantage of the PACE program, they must live in certain designated service areas.  These service areas tend to be in or immediately near urban centers, which precludes seniors living in more rural regions from participating.  The CORE Act offers guidelines for adapting the PACE model for rural areas, with the goal of developing a foundation of experience for broader implementation of the PACE home health care program.  The bill provides development grants and technical assistance for fifteen rural sites.   
Senator Brownback is the original co-sponsor of the CORE Act, which was introduced by Senator Blanche Lincoln. The CORE Act passed as part of the Budget Resolution, which cleared the Senate on a 52-47 vote.
