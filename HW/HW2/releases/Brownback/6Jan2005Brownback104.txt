  WASHINGTON â€“ U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) will join Heart to Heart International, along with representatives from donating organizations and companies, at the FedEx Express facility at JFK International Airport in New York. The MD-11 aircraft will be loaded with approximately 84,000 pounds of aid headed for countries recently devastated by a tsunami.  FedEx has donated facilities, manpower and the aircraft to transport the aid to Asia.   
The Friday morning shipment, spearheaded by Heart to Heart International in cooperation with a number of aid organizations, will include water purification systems, first aid supplies, antibiotics and other critically needed medicines, food, exam gloves, and other relief products.   
Brownback, along with Corzine, will be traveling to Asia this week to visit Sri Lanka, India and possibly Indonesia to assess the damage caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami and offer further assistance.
