  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today expressed concern regarding the upcoming passage of an omnibus appropriations bill in the House of Representatives.     
"I would be very disappointed if members in the House attempt to pass funding bills which threaten long-standing pro-life policy," said Brownback.  "If they do include abortion funding in the omnibus bill, it will face significant hurdles in the Senate and likely face a presidential veto.  I encourage my colleagues in the House to focus on finishing pending appropriations bills instead of trying to export pro-abortion policies to other countries."     
The House next week is expected to consider passage of an omnibus appropriations bill.       
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
