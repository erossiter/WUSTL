  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the Senate's failure to pass an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to fund the Department of Defense.       
"Kansas could experience a significant number of layoffs if Congress does not approve additional funds for the Department of Defense by the middle of December," said Brownback.  "I am disappointed that these funds were not approved today, and I hope Congressional leaders will reconsider their decision to delay further consideration until 2008."     
The Senate today rejected an attempt to provide unrestricted supplemental funding to the Department of Defense.  Brownback voted in favor of the measure.  Brownback opposed another spending bill which would have provided funding on the condition that the United States adopt a timetable for withdrawing from Iraq.  That measure also failed.     
Brownback continued, "Our support for those who serve overseas and those who support them at home should not be subject to political games in Washington.  Our debate over the war should not proceed at the expense of civilian and contract employees at Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth."     
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates yesterday said that without supplemental funding, operations at all Army bases would cease by mid-February.  Gates also said 100,000 government employees and a similar number of contractors would be furloughed.  Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have said they will not consider supplemental funding bills until January or February of next year.      
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
