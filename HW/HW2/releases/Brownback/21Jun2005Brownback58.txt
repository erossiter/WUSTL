  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback and 44 Members of Congress sent a letter to President Bush urging him to press the Vietnamese Prime Minister on the country’s questionable human rights record during his visit to Washington today.     
 
“I hope the President’s meeting with Prime Minister Khai will improve relations between the U.S. and Vietnam on many fronts, but I am deeply disappointed in Vietnam’s troubling human rights record,” Brownback said.  “Last year, for the first time, the Department of State designated Vietnam a country of particular concern for its gross violations of religious freedom.  While Vietnam has made a number of public statements and gestures that give us hope, I remain concerned that concrete results are lacking.”     
 
The visit of Prime Minister Phan Van Khai to the White House today marks the highest level visit since the end of the Vietnam War.     
 
In the letter, Brownback and the other Members of Congress specifically requested that the President  ask the Prime Minister to:     
 
Release all political and religious prisoners;    
Discontinue the practice of administrative detention without trial;    
Formally announce the prosecution of all officials who violate human rights and religious freedoms, especially those forcing Christians to recant their faith;    
Formally recognize the legal status of religions like the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the Hoa Hao Buddhists, and the Mennonites and their right to function as religious institutions without hindrance and with the full freedoms to practice and conduct religious activities at home;    
Formally announce the re-opening of all churches, meeting points, and home worship centers that were closed in the 2001 crackdown against Christians and its aftermath;    
Return all confiscated Catholic Church properties;    
Issue passports and proper documentation to Vietnamese citizens and respect free and open emigration; and    
Lift the ban on imports of intellectual products, including bibles, all forms of publications, videos, DVDs, and broadcast programs to Vietnam from the United States.    

Brownback continued, “Economic freedom and political freedom cannot be separated.  Citizens want to experience the benefits of undiluted liberty, and governments who try to check this desire will find they are swimming against the current of the human spirit.”      

Brownback is author of the Vietnam Human Rights Act.
