   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today stated his support for Entertainment Ratings and Labeling Awareness Month, sponsored each June by the Coalition of Entertainment Retail Trade Associations. As a parent, I know it is difficult to make informed decisions about the media our children are exposed to, said Brownback. Parents need to pay close attention to the rating guidelines offered by the entertainment industry and should also be aware of organizations like Coalition of Independent Ratings Services which rates media based on content, rather than traditional age-based ratings. This is the third year that CERTA will observe and promote Entertainment Ratings and Labeling Awareness Month. Yesterday Congress sent a bill to President Bush that increases FCC broadcast indecency fines by a factor of ten. The Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, sponsored and authored by Brownback, is designed to make indecency fines more meaningful.
