  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today questioned another controversial ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The court decided yesterday that parents have no say in the determination of what their students are exposed to at public schools regarding sex education.  The court, based in San Francisco, California, is the same one which recently found the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional.   
“This is another example of common sense norms being overturned by activist judges,” Brownback stated.  “Parents have a right to know and to decide what their young children are being exposed to by the schools regarding sex education.”   
Brownback continued, “It is not appropriate for a first grader to be asked about sex without consent from, or even notification of, the child’s parents.  And parents should have every right to decide that their 6-year-old should not be exposed to sexual materials in any way.  This is common sense to everyone, except certain courts.”   
The Ninth Circuit opinion rejecting parents’ rights to oversee their children’s education stated in part that “parents have no due process or privacy right to override the determinations of public schools as to the information to which their children will be exposed while enrolled as students,” and “... there is no fundamental right of parents to be the exclusive provider of information regarding sexual matters to their children.”   
In this case, children in first, third and fifth grade were given a questionnaire that included sexual content.  Among the questions included was whether the children thought about having sex, if they could “stop thinking about having sex,” and if they thought about touching others’ “private parts.”
