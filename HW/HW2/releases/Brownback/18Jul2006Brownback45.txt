  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage by 100-0 of S.3054, the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, which prohibits the practice of initiating pregnancies in either women or animals for the purpose of obtaining human organs or tissue for research.     
"Mankind has always regretted it when the stronger take advantage of the weaker," said Brownback.  "We should not treat our fellow humans, embryo or otherwise, as raw material.  I'm pleased that all of my Senate colleagues agree that human fetuses should not be developed for research purposes."     
The fetus farming bill is expected to quickly pass the House and be signed into law by President Bush.     
Brownback continued, commenting on Senate passage by 63-37 of HR.810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which provides taxpayer funding to expand embryonic stem cell research:     
"While I am disappointed the Senate voted to use taxpayer funding for immoral and unnecessary embryonic stem cell research, I have confidence that President Bush will stand for the protection of human life and veto the bill.  The federal government should not use public funds for unethical embryonic stem cell research in light of the fact that adult and cord blood stem cell research has yielded 72 peer-reviewed treatments for conditions ranging from spinal injuries to leukemia."     
Brownback also commented on passage by 100-0 of S.2754, the Santorum-Specter Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act:     
"I am pleased to support research into alternative forms of pluripotent stem cell research that do not involve the destruction of human embryos.  If it is possible to conduct stem cell research without destroying human life, we owe it to the lives at stake to fully investigate these possibilities."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee.
