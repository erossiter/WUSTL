  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today testified before a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing and urged greater U.S. action to end the genocide in Darfur, Sudan.       
"The American people have shown their compassion by calling for an end to the genocide in Darfur," said Brownback.  "More than 200,000 people have died in Darfur and more than 2.5 million have been displaced.  I encourage all Americans, from lawmakers to civilians, to do their part to end the genocide in Darfur."       
Brownback today encouraged state governors to help end the genocide in Darfur by divesting their state's public pension funds from companies that assist or do business with the Sudanese regime.  Six states (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey, and Oregon) have already passed divestment legislation.  Earlier this month, the Kansas State Senate unanimously passed Sudan divestment legislation; the legislation is now awaiting approval from the Kansas State House.       
Brownback continued, "Sudanese President Bashir has made clear his unwillingness to cooperate with diplomatic efforts to bring peacekeepers into Darfur to protect innocent lives.  We must intensify our efforts to end the genocide in Darfur by taking more coercive actions, including tough sanctions and divestment."      
Brownback cosponsored S. 831, the Sudan Divestment Authorization Act of 2007, which would authorize states and local governments to prohibit investment of state assets in any company that has a qualifying business relationship with Sudan.      
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
