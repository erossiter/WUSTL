  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today strongly condemned a conference held this week in Tehran which called the Holocaust a myth.     
"This conference is beyond deplorable and a complete affront to history, decency and peace," Brownback stated.  "The Iranian regime has the publicly stated goal of wiping the state of Israel off the face of the earth, and this mockery is clearly a tactic in that effort.  To deny history is to deny truth.     
"We must stand united around the world and decry any attempts to deny the Holocaust, which we all know to be a real and horrible tragedy that must be remembered and passed on to future generations so that it will never happen again.     
"If the Iranian regime hopes to be thought of with respect in the world community, they cannot engage is such hateful dialogue."
