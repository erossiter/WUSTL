  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded passage of an amendment he cosponsored to the energy bill that would require the increased use of ethanol in gasoline beginning next year.   
 
“When the overall energy bill is ultimately passed, this amendment will put our nation on the path to energy independence, as well as helping Kansas farmers,” Brownback said.  “It will increase farmers’ incomes by expanding current markets, creating jobs, helping our environment and lowering our dependence on foreign oil.”    
 
The amendment, sponsored by Senator Pete Domenici and cosponsored by Brownback, would require that gasoline sold or introduced into commerce in the United States on an annual basis contain 4 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006, with the requirement rising incrementally to 8 billion gallons by 2012.  Gasoline sold in Hawaii and Alaska would be exempted from the requirement.   
 
The Renewable Fuels Standard would also provide safe harbor for renewable fuels, meaning that no renewable fuel or motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuel would be deemed defective in design or manufacture.  Safe harbor would not apply to fuels that actually are defective in design or manufacture.     
 
The amendment would eliminate the use of MTBE as a fuel additive within four years.   
 
The U.S. Senate this week is debating amendments to the national energy bill currently under consideration.   
 
Brownback was first elected to the Senate to fill the unexpired term of Bob Dole in 1996.  He was returned by the voters of Kansas for a full term in 1998, and reelected this past November.  He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1994-1996.  Brownback serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Joint Economic Committees.  He also is chairman of the Helsinki Commission and co-chairman of the Senate Cancer Coalition.
