  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the death of Gordon Parks, a native of Fort Scott, Kansas.   
“One of our greatest native sons, Mr. Parks achieved worldwide success for his work as photojournalist, photographer, author, poet, filmmaker, director and composer but may best be known for his haunting photographs of poverty and racism,” said Brownback.  “He shed light on human suffering both here and abroad as well as on the beauty of our Kansas prairies.  His body of work and his passion for excellence and life will inspire others for many generations to come.   
“From humble beginnings, Mr. Parks accepted his mother’s challenge that he could achieve whatever he set his mind to doing.  It was that confidence instilled by her and his quest for excellence that guided him throughout his life.  He never lost sight of his Kansas roots and the strength he drew from his native state.   
“While Kansas and all America mourn the loss of Mr. Parks, we celebrate his life and the countless gifts he left us.  He will always be remembered as the Renaissance Man and native son of Fort Scott, Kansas.”   
Parks, 93, died Tuesday in his New York City apartment.
