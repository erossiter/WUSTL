  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) introduced a Senate Resolution condemning the murder in Moscow of American journalist Paul Klebnikov and urging the Russian government to aggressively continue its investigation and accept U.S. offers of assistance.     
"Paul Klebnikov's murder is deeply troubling and a vivid example of the dangers faced by investigative journalists in Russia," said Brownback.  "I commend the Russian government's efforts to date and urge them to continue their aggressive investigation to determine all parties involved in Klebnikov's murder.  My heart and prayers are with Paul's wife and children as they fight for justice."     
"Nearly two years after the murder of Paul Klebnikov, his family is still waiting for answers and long overdue justice," said Clinton.  "I urge the Russian government to continue its aggressive efforts to identify and prosecute those responsible for this horrible crime and to take appropriate action to protect the independence and freedom of journalists in Russia."     
Gunmen killed Klebnikov, the editor of Forbes Russia and an American citizen, as he exited his Moscow office on July 9, 2004.     
The Russian Prosecutor General's office arrested and tried two ethnic Chechens for Klebnikov's murder but both were acquitted by a jury in May.  The prosecutor has reportedly announced his intention to appeal the verdict on procedural grounds.  Russian officials have claimed that a Chechen underworld figure ordered Klebnikov's killing, but he has not been brought to trial.     
The State Department's 2005 Country Report on Human Rights Practices noted that Russia continues to weaken the independence and freedom of the media. Twelve journalists have been murdered in Russia since 2000, and according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, none of these murders have been solved.     
Klebnikov is survived by his wife Helen and three young children.     
Senator Brownback chairs the Helsinki Commission and is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
