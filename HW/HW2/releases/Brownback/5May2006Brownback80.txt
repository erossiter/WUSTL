  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the peace agreement signed by the government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Army rebels after days of negotiations in Nigeria.     
"The peace agreement between the Sudanese government and the main rebel faction is an important first step, but more needs to be done before we see peace in war-torn Darfur," said Brownback.  "I urge the remaining rebel factions and groups to continue engagement with the African Union and American negotiators so that all parties can find agreeable terms for peace.  I commend the government of Sudan and the SLA for signing the agreement, but I also urge them to abide by its terms."     
Civil war has ravaged the Darfur region of Sudan since 2003, when rebel groups started an insurgency to foment unrest and destabilize the official Sudanese government in Khartoum.     
Brownback continued, "The U.S., the U.N., and the African Union have an important role to play in enforcing the agreement and keeping the remaining rebel groups at the negotiating table.  Stability in this region is elusive, and it will take active monitoring and engagement from the U.S., the U.N., and the African Union to make this peace a lasting one."     
This past week Brownback cosponsored two Senate amendments that provide $60 million to fund a U.N. peacekeeping force in Darfur and establish an Office of the Presidential Envoy for Sudan.     
Brownback visited Darfur in June 2004 and later authored a resolution passed by the Senate declaring genocide in Darfur.  In November 2005 he authored and the Senate passed the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, and in March 2006 he joined Sen. Joe Biden to author a resolution passed by the Senate calling for NATO troops to aid the African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur.     
Senator Brownback sits on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.
