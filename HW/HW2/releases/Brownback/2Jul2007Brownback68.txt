  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback and the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, R. David Paulison, discussed the flooding in Southeast Kansas and the need for expedited processing of federal disaster declaration for Kansas.       
"I am pleased with my discussion with FEMA Administrator Paulison, and look forward to working with him," said Brownback.  "We discussed the immediate needs of restoring water and power to the affected communities as well as the long term needs of clean-up and recovery.   I know that the local, state, and federal agencies can work together to quickly respond to the needs of the residents affected by the flooding.  FEMA has been very responsive to Kansas's needs during the storms of the past year, like the Greensburg tornado.  Paulison assured me FEMA is committed to delivering a high level of service to Kansans in need of assistance."        
The flooding effected 17 counties across Southeast Kansas, including Anderson, Allen, Butler, Bourbon, Chautauqua, Cherokee, Coffey, Cowley, Elk, Franklin, Greenwood, Linn, Miami, Montgomery, Neosho, Osage, Wilson and Woodson.  Many residents have been evacuated from their homes.  Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius submitted a request to President Bush that an expedited major disaster be declared for Kansas.         
Brownback continued, "We will keep all of the residents affected by this disaster in our thoughts and prayers.  I am proud of my fellow Kansans for pulling through and pushing forward, even in the midst of devastating disasters such as this flooding."
