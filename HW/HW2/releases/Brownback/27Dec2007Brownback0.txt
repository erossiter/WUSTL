   WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today offered condolences for former Pakistani Prime Minister and opposition leader Benazir Bhutto who was assassinated today while leaving a political rally where she addressed her supporters leading up to the January 8 parliamentary elections. The gunman shot Bhutto twice and then blew himself up, killing at least 20 others. Brownback also offered prayers to those affected and to the leadership and people of Pakistan in hopes that this terrible tragedy will not escalate to further bloodshed.  I offer my deepest condolences for the loss of Benazir Bhutto and to the families of those killed today. This is a terrible loss to her supporters, the people of Pakistan and for democracy, Brownback said. I hope and pray that that the people of Pakistan and President Musharraf can avoid further bloodshed and continue down the road to democracy. Pakistan has been a good friend to the United   States in fighting fundamentalist terrorism, and I sincerely hope we can continue to work together. Pakistan needs to continue to work toward a peaceful, stable and democratic nation if they hope to maintain our strong friendship. Brownback is formerly the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee with responsibility for Southeast  Asia.
