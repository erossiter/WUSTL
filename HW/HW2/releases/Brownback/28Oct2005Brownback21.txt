  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today made the following remarks on the passage of Senate and House resolutions allowing the remains of Rosa Parks to lie in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol:     
"With quiet dignity and exceptional strength of character, Rosa Parks' refusal to give in to bigotry and oppression galvanized the civil rights movement in this nation.  Her act of bravery helped America achieve the ideals set forth in the Constitution, that all men are created equal under God.     
"It is more than fitting for the United States Congress to allow the nation to mourn the passing of this great American by allowing her to lie in honor in the Capitol rotunda, a tribute reserved for our nation's most revered leaders."     
The resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 61, reads as follows:     
"Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That, in recognition of the historic contributions of Rosa Parks, her remains be permitted to lie in honor in the rotunda of the Capitol from October 30 to October 31, 2005, so that the citizens of the United States may pay their last respects to this great American.  The Architect of the Capitol, under the direction and supervision of the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, shall take all necessary steps for the accomplishment of that purpose."     
Rosa Parks, whose refusal to yield her seat to a white passenger sparked the 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery, AL, passed away on October 25th, 2005.  She was 92.
