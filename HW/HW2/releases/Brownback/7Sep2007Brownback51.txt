  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the Mexico City Policy Amendment and the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, two amendments that he offered to the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill.  The language of both amendments would have maintained long-standing U.S. policies.       
"I am disappointed that my Senate colleagues voted against the Mexico City Amendment, which protected long-standing policy that American tax-payer dollars should not to be used to fund overseas abortions," said Brownback.  "The failure of the Senate to adopt my amendment unfortunately slows the approval process for the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill as President Bush has promised to veto any bill which weakens current pro-life policy."       
The Mexico City Policy Amendment would have prohibited U.S. funding to private overseas organizations that perform, or actively promote, abortion as a method of family planning.  The Kemp-Kasten Amendment prohibits U.S. funding from going to any organization that supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.  Brownback sponsored both amendments.         
Brownback continued, "I am happy that the Kemp-Kasten Amendment was adopted into the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.  While my colleagues and I may continue our debate about abortion, I think we can all agree that involuntary, forced sterilization and abortion is wrong on all accounts.  As a global leader, America must continue to protect life."        
While Brownback supported many projects within the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, he voted against final passage of the bill due to his objection to the weakening of pre-existing pro-life policy.     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
