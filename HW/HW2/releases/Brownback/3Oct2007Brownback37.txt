  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs about pending legislation that would use targeted divestment as a tool for ending the genocide in Darfur.     
"The United States continues to lead the world in pressuring the government of Sudan to end its genocidal campaign in Darfur, but we can do more," said Brownback.  "We must send a strong message that the genocide in Darfur will not happen on our watch or on our dime.  I urge my colleagues to support legislation that would authorize states to divest their assets from corporations that do business with Sudan."     
Legislation is currently pending in both the House and the Senate which would explicitly provide authorization for state and local governments to divest from Sudan.  Thirteen of states have already passed a model of targeted Sudan divestment: California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont.        
Brownback continued, "As with Apartheid in South Africa, my hope is that divestment from Sudan will be the beginning of the end of the genocide in Darfur.  More than 400,000 citizens have been killed and two and a half million people have been displaced in the Darfur region.  The Sudanese government is the principle catalyst of this genocide and the Sudanese government must know that America will no longer tolerate the violence."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
