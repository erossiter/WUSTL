  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today spoke at a rally calling for the release of three Israeli soldiers held hostage since last summer by Islamic terrorists.      
"Today, I send a message to Gilad, Ehud, and Eldad: do not lose hope, and do not despair," said Brownback.  "Your cause is just, your nation is strong, and your friends pray for and await your return.  We shall look to you for inspiration as you stand at the front lines on the war against radical Islamic terrorism."     
The rally, which was sponsored by the Jewish Council For Public Affairs and the United Jewish Communities, comes in response to more than six months of captivity for three Israeli soldiers.  On June 25, 2006, Gilad Shalit was abducted by members of Hamas.  On July 12, 2006, both Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev were abducted by members of Hezbollah.        
Brownback continued, "To the terrorist abductors I say this:  Yours is the path of despair.  As more time passes, your actions strengthen our convictions and harden our resolve.  We will not give in, and we will not succumb.  We will continue to stand firm and demand the release of these soldiers."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
