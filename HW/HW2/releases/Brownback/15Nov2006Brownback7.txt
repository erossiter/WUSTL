  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage of the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill.     
"I'm pleased the Senate passed this important funding bill for new military construction projects and Veteran's programs," said Brownback.  "I hope the House and Senate can quickly reconcile their respective versions of this bill and send it to the White House for the president's signature."     
The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill now heads to a House-Senate conference committee.  The bill allocates $16.3 billion for military construction, $77.9 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and $143.2 million for related agencies.     
The bill lists the following Kansas projects as federal priorities:   $15 million for a battle seminar facility at Fort Leavenworth   $32 million for a barracks complex at Fort Riley   $5.2 million for a child development center at Fort Riley   $10.2 million for a vehicle inspection and cargo processing facility at Fort Riley     In addition to these Kansas programs, Brownback successfully fought for the inclusion of provisions that expand the healthcare benefits of all veterans.  Specifically, the bill includes language that encourages the Veterans Administration to provide faith-based counseling for victims of post-traumatic stress syndrome as well as a provision that starts an education initiative to inform veterans of certain health benefit programs for which they may be eligible.     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
