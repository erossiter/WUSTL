  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today pledged to support a presidential veto of the Emergency Supplemental Act if the House-Senate conference bill exceeds the White House-approved limit of $94.5 billion.     
"We have to get spending under control," said Brownback.  "Congress needs to show the American public that it is capable of fiscal restraint, and this emergency spending bill should not exceed what President Bush requested.  If President Bush vetoes this bill because it spends more money than he approved, I will vote to uphold his veto."     
On April 26, Brownback joined 34 Republican senators in signing a letter pledging his vote to uphold a presidential veto of the bill if it exceeds the president's requested funding level.  The spending bill, H.R. 4939, passed the Senate on Thursday and awaits action from a House-Senate conference committee so that both chambers can agree on a final version to send to the White House.     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
