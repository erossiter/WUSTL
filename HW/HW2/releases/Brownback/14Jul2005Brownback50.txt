   WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today praised the Bush Administration and lauded news that the federal budget deficit is projected to be dramatically reduced this year. The bedrocks of strong economic policy are a robust economy, tax cuts and vastly reduced budget deficits, stated Brownback. I commend President Bush on his strong pro-growth agenda and the recent news of significant drops projected in the federal deficit. Increased revenues and steady economic growth are clear signs that we are headed in the right direction, and we need to do more. We should make the Bush tax cuts permanent, and we should work toward consistent and strong long-term economic growth. The White House budget report projects that the deficit for this year will be $79 billion below last year's levels and nearly $100 billion less than previous estimates. The overall deficit is projected to drop to $333 billion. The reduction is generally credited to higher revenues and a growing economy.
