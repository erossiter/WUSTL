  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback welcomed the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that the U.S. economy added 166,000 new payroll jobs in October. The 50 consecutive months of payroll employment growth is the longest on record.       
"Despite turmoil in the housing industry and rising energy prices, the American economy has continued to grow and create new jobs," Brownback said.  "The 50 consecutive months of job gains is the longest on record."     
The economy produced an annualized 3.9% rate of economic growth in the 3rd quarter, following a rate of 3.8% growth for the 2nd quarter. Over the past 50 months, more than 8.3 million news jobs have been added to U.S. economy.     
Brownback continued: "Despite the strength of recent data, the economy faces significant challenges.  Turmoil in housing and financial markets, coupled with rising energy prices, pose a threat to continued economic growth.  Raising taxes on American families would be a huge mistake and would almost certainly move the economy toward recession. Continuing to grow the economy and getting spending under control are the keys to putting the government's fiscal house in order."     
Brownback is the Senior Republican Senator on the Joint Economic Committee
