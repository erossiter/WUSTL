  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the announcement by the Department of Defense that the Army’s First Infantry Division, known as the “Big Red One,” is returning to Fort Riley.   
 
“This is wonderful news for Fort Riley and for the state of Kansas,” Brownback said.  “Big Red One will be back home where it belongs.  This decision clearly demonstrates Fort Riley’s place as one of the finest Warfighting Centers in the U.S. Army.”     
 
Brownback has been aggressively urging President Bush and the Department of Defense to return the First Infantry Division to Fort Riley.  He has met personally with the Chief of Staff of the Army regarding this important issue, and in 2003 traveled to Europe to visit the Big Red One and meet with the Commander of U.S. Forces there.   
 
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Brownback has secured funding to improve Fort Riley’s training and housing facilities.  For the coming fiscal year alone, Brownback secured more than $100 million for projects at Fort Riley.   
 
Fort Riley will have more than 17,000 soldiers stationed on base after the Big Red One returns.  The headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division was moved to Würzburg, Germany in 1996.  The 2nd, 3rd, Aviation, and Engineer Brigades are currently stationed in Germany, along with the Division Artillery and Support.  The 1st Brigade and its support elements are stationed at Ft Riley, Kansas.   
 
Brownback continued, “Fort Riley and the Big Red One are vital to our nation’s fight against those who would do our country harm.  The United States is fortunate to have these fine soldiers defending our freedom on a daily basis.”   
 
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Construction.
