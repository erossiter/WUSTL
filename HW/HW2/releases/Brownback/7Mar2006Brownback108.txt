  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today met with Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato to discuss delays in Japan’s resumption of American beef imports.  Senator Brownback requested the meeting because Japan has refused to import American beef since December 2003, when it closed its markets because a cow born in Canada but found in Washington state tested positive for BSE.   
“The Japanese embargo on U.S. beef has gone on too long, and an amicable agreement must be reached soon or Congress will have no choice but to impose trade sanctions against Japan,” said Brownback.  “Our beef is the safest and highest quality in the world, and it’s high time for Japan to recognize this and lift its trade embargo.  The political games and maneuvering are disappointing, and the Japanese need to start basing their decisions on internationally recognized science standards, not emotion.”   
Japan initially announced it would re-open its market to American beef in December 2005, but after an isolated incident in January, Japan closed its markets again.  Since Japan first closed its market to U.S. beef exports over two years ago, the USDA has tested well over 500,000 cattle for BSE.  The USDA has found and confirmed only one case.   
Brownback continued, “I was pleased to meet with Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato, and I appreciate his acceptance of my invitation to discuss resuming the beef trade between the U.S. and Japan.  In our meeting I relayed how important this issue is to my constituents and the Kansas economy.”   
Brownback’s efforts to re-open the market include a visit to Japan in January 2004 to discuss the safety of U.S. beef with government officials and hosting a Japanese technical team at a Kansas beef ranch and processing plant in the spring of 2004 to highlight the quality and safety of U.S. beef.   
Sen. Brownback sits on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
