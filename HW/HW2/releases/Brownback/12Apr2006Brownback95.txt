  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded China's decision to conditionally reopen its market to American beef imports following meetings with Bush Administration officials.     
"I applaud China for recognizing that the United States has the safest, highest-quality beef in the world," said Senator Brownback.  "I hope we can finalize the terms of the agreement soon and begin shipping American beef to China.  I congratulate the Bush Administration for its diligent work reopening China's market and its focus on other countries who remain closed to American beef."     
Recently, Brownback led a group of 20 senators who sent a letter to President Bush requesting that he raise the issue when he meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Washington on April 20.  China's 1.2 billion people and rapidly expanding economy makes it one of the most promising and growing markets for U.S. beef exports.     
Brownback continued, "The unscientific ban on U.S. beef in many countries across the world has gone on too long.  Japan and other countries who continue to stall should realize the error of their ways.  American producers and ranchers deserve to have international markets open to their products immediately."     
In 2003, more than $100 million in U.S. beef was exported to China, making it the fifth largest export market for American beef.  Like other countries, China closed its markets to U.S. beef in December 2003, when a cow born in Canada but found in Washington state tested positive for BSE.     
Senator Brownback serves on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
