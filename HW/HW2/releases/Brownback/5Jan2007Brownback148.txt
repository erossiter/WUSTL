  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated Lt. Gen. David Petraeus on being named by President Bush as the new top military commander in Iraq.     
"Over the course of his time at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, I have gotten to know Dave Petraeus very well," said Brownback. "We've spent a great deal of time discussing Iraq and our strategic options. General Petraeus is an exceptionally smart and thoughtful man who will bring an intellectual creativity to his new mission, and I know that he will do a superb job."     
Shortly after assuming command at Fort Leavenworth, Petraeus offered to travel to Brownback's home in Topeka to share his personal experiences and insights on the war on terrorism. Brownback has discussed the situation in Iraq with Petraeus on several occasions since, most recently during a trip to Fort Leavenworth in December.     
Petraeus replaces Gen. George Casey, Jr., and has been the commander at Fort Leavenworth since October 2005.  He will receive his fourth star upon Senate confirmation.     
Brownback is planning, over the next couple of weeks, to visit Ethiopia, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
