  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback tonight commented on the life of Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and praised his 34 years of dedicated service.  Rehnquist passed away in his home late Saturday night.     
"My heart goes out to the Rehnquist family and we all mourn their loss.  Chief Justice Rehnquist was a model jurist, a champion of federalism, and served his nation with distinction," Brownback stated.  "The Chief Justice stood firm in his adherence to the rule of law and the intent of the Framers during his 34 years on the Court.  He will be truly missed, not only on the bench, but far beyond."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights.
