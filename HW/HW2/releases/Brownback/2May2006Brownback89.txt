  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback praised President Bush for his historic Oval Office meeting last Friday with defectors from North Korea and family members of a Japanese girl abducted by the North Korean government.     
"President Bush's powerful gesture has given hope to North Koreans suffering in both the country at large and in its gulags," said Brownback.  "History will show that, just as Ronald Reagan cast the crisis with the Soviet Union in terms of right and wrong, President Bush has brought moral clarity to a part of the world in desperate need of it."     
At Friday's meeting, President Bush met with Kim Seung-Min, a former member of the North Korean military, and Kim Kwang-Chul and his wife Kwi-Ok Lee, who defected from North Korea in 2001 when Lee was five months pregnant.  The couple's now 5-year-old daughter, Han Mee Lee, was also in attendance.     
President Bush also met with Sakie Yokota and Shigeo Iizuka, the mother and brother of Megumi Yokota, a Japanese national who was abducted in 1976 by the North Korean government.  The Yokotos are still searching for Megumi.  In the 1970s and 1980s, the North Korean government abducted hundreds of people from many different countries in an effort to improve its espionage program.     
 
Brownback continued, "By embracing these courageous people in the Oval Office, President Bush has inspired us all.  To the millions in North Korea and across the world who are persecuted, without hope, and seeking refuge, the President sent a message: Do not give up hope."     
 
In May of 2002, Brownback first brought to the Senate's attention the plight of Kim Kwang-Chul and Kwi-Ok Lee, who at the time were seeking sanctuary in the Japanese consulate in Shenyang, China.  With the support of the Senate and non-governmental organizations, the family was able gain passage to South Korea in July of that year.
