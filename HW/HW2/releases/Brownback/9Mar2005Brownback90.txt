  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback yesterday made the following statement from the floor of the Senate in opposition to the Schumer amendment, which was defeated in the Senate 46-53.    
 
“As we have learned in previous Congresses, this amendment is a ‘poison pill’ amendment meant to kill the overall bankruptcy reform bill,” Brownback said.  “This amendment thrusts the abortion issue into the bankruptcy reform debate.  Aside from the abortion issue, however, I am deeply concerned about what I feel to be a lack of fairness and justice embodied in this amendment.   
 
“No one in this chamber condones violent crime, and I am certain that everyone in this chamber believes violent crime should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  While the pending amendment is presented as a way to address violent crime, it would primarily—and inappropriately—intimidate and harm peaceful protesters.  In fact, were the Schumer amendment to become law, no crime would even be necessary to trigger its sanctions; merely violating a federal or state civil statute—such as a minor trespass—would be enough to place a violator in financial jeopardy.   
 
“While I make no excuse for violations of the law, I have to ask:  Shouldn’t the gravity of the punishment correspond with the offense?  Historically, this legislative body has fashioned criminal and bankruptcy penalties in a manner proportionate to the gravity of the offense and the degree of injury and culpability.  If enacted, this amendment would be a radical break with this tradition of prudence and fairness.”
