   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today met with Admiral Jay Cohen, Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of Homeland Security, to discuss the possibility of building the new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility in Kansas. I was pleased to meet with Admiral Cohen to discuss the many advantages to having Kansas house the new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility, said Brownback. Coupled with the veterinarian research corridor, top-flight agricultural research, and strong community support, Kansas has put together an outstanding proposal. Manhattan and Leavenworth are two of the eighteen sites nationwide currently being considered to house the new facility. Cohen is leading the selection committee and next week will visit Manhattan and Leavenworth. NBAF will be dedicated to researching the biological threats of foreign animal diseases and diseases transferred from animals to humans. Brownback continued, I'm glad I was able to communicate Kansas's strengths to Admiral Cohen, and I look forward to lending my support to help to move this project forward. NBAF belongs in Kansas. It is estimated that over a twenty year period, NBAF would have a $3.5 billion impact on the Kansas economy. The proposed site would be a $451 million, 500,000 square foot building and will create as many as 500 high-paying, scientific federal jobs in the state of Kansas and will bring additional jobs in research partnerships to the state.
