   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today congratulated Leon Trammell, a Kansas businessman, who this week was notified that the President intends to appoint him to serve on the President's Export Council. I congratulate Leon Trammell for his upcoming appointment to the President's Export Council, said Brownback.  I am certain Mr. Trammell will serve the Nation well in his new role and will make Kansas proud.  Mr. Trammell over the years has proven he is a great businessman and a true entrepreneur. Trammell owns several businesses and in 1967 founded Tramco, a Wichita-based business which employs over 120 people.  Trammell also is a U.S. Chamber of Commerce Board Member and is on the Kansas World Trade Center Advisory Committee.  The President's Export Council is a venue through which the business community advises the Administration on U.S. trade policy.
