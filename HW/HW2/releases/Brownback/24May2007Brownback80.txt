   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts today announced final passage of $40 million in disaster relief funding for victims of the violent storms that hit Kansas in early May. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 80 to 14 and now heads to the White House for the president's signature. The people affected by these storms are not alone in their efforts to rebuild, said Brownback. I applaud my colleagues in Congress and the Kansas delegation for working together to get this bill to President Bush as fast as possible. The funds in this bill will provide real relief to victims of the tornados and beyond that, to our farmers and ranchers that have also been suffering from severe weather conditions including drought and winter storms, said Roberts. So the score has finally been settled, Mother Nature zero, Kansas two. The bill also includes $3 billion in agricultural disaster assistance for producers in counties declared a disaster in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 crop years. Kansans who lost livestock in this winter's blizzard or crops in this spring's freeze are also eligible. Additionally, the bill directs the Small Business Administration to provide low-interest guaranteed loans to Kansas businesses and homeowners affected by the tornados. Senator Brownback is the Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government Appropriations, which oversees SBA funding. Senator Roberts is a member of the Agriculture Committee.
