  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the 49-48 Senate vote on the Marriage Protection Amendment, which would send a Constitutional amendment to the states for ratification that would define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.     
"We are making progress," said Brownback.  "Since the last Senate vote, the citizens of 14 additional states have voted to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.  We will not stop until we have protected this fundamental institution in our society.     
"Make no mistake: if we allow activist judges to redefine marriage it will dramatically alter our society, as it has done in the European countries who are embracing same-sex marriage.  Marriage is about our future and about how we raise our children."     
Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Appropriations Committee.
