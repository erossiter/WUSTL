  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Indian Affairs Committee passage of S.J. Res. 4, the Native American Apology Resolution, legislation to offer an apology from the United States government to American Indians.       
"The Native American apology resolution recognizes and honors the importance of Native Americans and their contributions to our nation," said Brownback.  "This is a resolution of apology and reconciliation.  It offers an official apology to the Native peoples for the poor choices our government made in the past."     
The resolution, first introduced in the 108th Congress, apologizes on behalf of the United States to all Native peoples for the instances of violence, maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on them by the United States.  It also commits to build on the positive relationships of the past and present to move toward a brighter future.       
Brownback continued, "It is past time for us to heal our land of division, and come together as one people.  We cannot erase the past.  We can, however, acknowledge our past failures, express our sincere regrets, and work toward establishing a brighter future for all Americans."     
The resolution of apology does not authorize or serve as a settlement of any claim against the United States and does not resolve many challenges still facing Native peoples.       
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
