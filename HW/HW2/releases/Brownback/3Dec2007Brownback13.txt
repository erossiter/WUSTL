  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the new National Intelligence Estimate regarding Iran's nuclear weapons program.        
"Here is what we know for sure about Iran: it has no need for nuclear energy, it is a theocratic regime that prioritizes the destruction of Israel, and Tehran is actively enriching uranium," said Brownback.  "Today's National Intelligence Estimate stated that Iran has halted its nuclear weapons program but still desires nuclear weapons.  Given the civilian nuclear work that the NIE did not analyze, as well as the bellicose statements from Iran's senior leaders, the threat of a nuclear armed Iran remains real."      
Mike McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, today released a new National Intelligence Estimate assessing the status of Iran's nuclear weapons program.       
Brownback continued, "The NIE makes clear that, on its current course, Iran will eventually develop a nuclear weapon.  America must work with its allies to convince Iran to end its illegal nuclear activities.  We should use any delay in Iranian nuclear weapons development to empower the Iranian people to change their leaders and moderate their government.  We should support Iran's pro-democracy movement, designate a special envoy to focus on Iranian human rights, and divest ourselves of those companies that do business in Iran."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary Committees.
