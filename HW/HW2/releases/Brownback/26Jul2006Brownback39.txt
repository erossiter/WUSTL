  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded Senate passage by 65-34 of the Child Custody Protection Act, which prohibits minors from crossing state lines for an abortion without their parent's consent.     
"An abortion is a significant medical procedure and involves a decision that parents should be involved with," said Brownback.  "When a minor goes to another state for an abortion, it circumvents the parental rights laws in the minor's home state.  Regardless of a person's position on abortion, we should all agree that it is a serious medical procedure and that parents have a right to be informed of any such procedure performed on their child."     
A similar measure passed the House last year.     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights.
