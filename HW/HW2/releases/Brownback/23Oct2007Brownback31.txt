  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Pat Roberts (R-KS) today introduced the Atomic Veterans Medal Act of 2007, legislation which would honor members of the Armed Forces who were exposed to atomic testing between 1945 and 1963.    "America owes a great debt of gratitude to all those who made sacrifices while serving our nation," said Brownback. "I am proud to join my colleague Senator Roberts in commending the service and bravery of these veterans."      
Atomic veterans were exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of participating in a test of atomic weapons conducted by the United States between 1945 and 1963. The legislation introduced today calls on the Secretary of Defense to design and produce a military service medal to honor atomic veterans. Similar legislation was introduced in September in the House by Representative Todd Tiarht (R-KS).     
"These veterans showed courage to further the cause of liberty and freedom and deserve recognition," Roberts said. "Our inherent rights are protected by the men and women who have worn and are wearing the uniform and I am pleased to work with Members of our Kansas delegation to honor those who have sacrificed."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary Committees. Senator Roberts is a former Marine and former senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
