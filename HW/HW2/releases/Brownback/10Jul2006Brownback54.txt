  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded a compromise which would supersede the Wright Amendment, a 1979 law which currently restricts airline travel through Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and Love Air Field.       
"I commend all parties involved for reaching a community-based compromise," said Brownback.  "This agreement is a great victory for Kansas travelers, as it will allow airlines to continue to provide competitive ticket prices and afford Kansans more travel options."     
Last month the decision was reached by American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and the mayors of the cities of Forth Worth and Dallas.  Under the terms of the agreement, the service limitations of the Wright Amendment on Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and Love Air Field will cease in 2014.  Effective immediately, the agreement allows for "through-ticketing" from Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to airports beyond Texas and the eight states currently exempt for the limitations of the Wright Amendment.       
Brownback continued, "For too many years Kansans have been hurt by the Wright Amendment, which goes against the spirit of a free market economy.  Airlines should be allowed to provide consumers with the lowest airfare possible, using the most convenient routes."        
The agreement, which requires Congressional approval, this week heads to a House subcommittee hearing.         
Senator Brownback is a member of the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
