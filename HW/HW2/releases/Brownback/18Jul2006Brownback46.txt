  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded subcommittee passage of the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill.     
"Fully funding the Department of Veterans Affairs is the least we can do to show our gratitude for the veterans who gave so much to America," said Brownback.  "This bill also provides for new construction at Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth, which provide crucial services to the Kansas men and women in uniform."     
The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill now heads to the full appropriations committee.  The bill allocates $16.3 billion dollars for military construction, $77.9 billion dollars for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and $143.2 million for related agencies.     
The bill lists the following Kansas projects as federal priorities:   $15 million for a battle seminar facility at Fort Leavenworth   $32 million for a barracks complex at Fort Riley   $5.2 million for a child development center at Fort Riley   $10.2 million for a vehicle inspection and cargo processing facility at Fort Riley     In addition to these Kansas programs, Brownback successfully fought for the inclusion of provisions that expand the healthcare benefits of all veterans.  Specifically, the bill includes language that encourages the Veterans Administration to provide faith-based counseling for victims of post-traumatic stress syndrome as well as a provision that starts an education initiative to inform veterans of certain health benefit programs for which they may be eligible.     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
