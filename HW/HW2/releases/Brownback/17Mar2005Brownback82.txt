  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA), along with Representatives Dave Weldon (R-FL) and Bart Stupak (D-MI), today reintroduced legislation to ban all forms of human cloning.   
“Human life should be cherished and human dignity should be protected,” Brownback said.  “We should not create human life just to destroy it.   
“All human cloning is reproductive.  What we must decide as a society is what do we do with the young, cloned human?  We have yet to collectively answer the ethical questions involved with implanting that clone or destroying it for research.”   
The Brownback-Landrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act, which has passed the House twice by large margins, is the only truly comprehensive ban on human cloning.   
The United Nations recently passed a resolution to ban all forms of human cloning.  President Bush has stated he supports a ban on reproductive and research cloning and recent polling data shows that 63% of Americans “highly” agree with the President.   
Brownback continued, “I strongly support the advance of ethically-sound research and science in finding cures for diseases and look forward to working with my colleagues to further advance morally and ethically sound science.”   
The bill currently has 26 Senate cosponsors.
