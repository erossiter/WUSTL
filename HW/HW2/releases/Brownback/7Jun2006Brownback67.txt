   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded House passage by 379-35 of S. 193, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which increases fines for broadcasting indecent material by a factor of ten. This is a victory for children and families, said Brownback. After two years Congress is sending a bill to the president that will raise broadcast indecency fines to a meaningful level. Parents have a hard enough time as it is raising their children in a world saturated with violent and explicit media. Raising the fines for abusing the public airwaves will hold broadcasters accountable for the content and consequences of their media. The bill passed the Senate in May and the now heads to the White House for the president's signature. Brownback authored and introduced the bill last January. Current fines levied against broadcasters by the Federal Communications Commission are limited to $32,500 per violation, and the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act increases those fines to $325,000 per violation. The bill only raises FCC fines, and does not address other issues such as the definition of indecent material or how the fines are assessed. The bill does not grant the FCC new powers to revoke licenses from broadcasters who play offensive content. Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Appropriations Committee.
