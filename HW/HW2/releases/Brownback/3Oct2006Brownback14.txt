  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the scandal involving Mark Foley.     
"I am deeply saddened and deplore the sordid and abhorrent nature of this incident," Brownback stated.  "It is wrong for someone in authority to prey on others, especially minors.  I support the full investigation and adjudication of this incident.  Parents expect their children to be safe when they come to Capitol Hill and we should ensure that is the case."
