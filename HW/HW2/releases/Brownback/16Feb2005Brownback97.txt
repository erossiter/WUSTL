  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today praised the announcement of U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to appeal the dismissal of federal criminal indictments against a California pornography producer charged with violating federal obscenity laws.  The original indictments were dismissed last month by U.S. District Judge Gary Lancaster.   
 
“I commend Attorney General Gonzales’ decision to appeal the Extreme Associates decision,” Brownback said.  “The Justice Department’s decision indicates a renewed effort to go after purveyors of pornography, whose products are so damaging to our culture, our families, and our nation.  Judge Lancaster’s decision to dismiss the Justice Department’s case was entirely without merit, and a product of judicial activism of the worst sort.”     
 
Brownback encouraged Gonzales in his confirmation hearing to make the prosecution of illegal obscenity a priority.  The Senator also co-authored an opinion editorial with Senator Orrin Hatch decrying Judge Lancaster’s decision in the Extreme case.   
 
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee.
