   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today offered prayers and support to the people of Greensburg and Kiowa County, Kansas, which was devastated by a tornado last night which reportedly destroyed over 60 percent of the city with over 50 people injured and seven deceased. The city is conducting search and rescue today. Our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Greensburg, Brownback stated. The people of Kansas are tough and know how to deal with hard weather, but the people of Greensburg are dealing with more than anyone should. Even though the town was severely damaged, I will work with my colleagues in the Kansas Congressional delegation to ensure that this city is rebuilt. Our prayers are with all the people of Kiowa, Stafford and Barton counties who were affected by this tornado. Brownback will visit the affected area tomorrow and will join a student prayer vigil at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas today at 4:00 p.m. Central.
