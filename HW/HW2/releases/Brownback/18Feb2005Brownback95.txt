  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commended the United Nations for voting to ban all forms of human cloning.  The measure was adopted by a vote of 71-35.     
“I am extremely encouraged that the international community has made such a strong statement today in support of protecting innocent human life and human dignity,” Brownback said.  “Human cloning is the deliberate creation of a human life for utilitarian purposes.  That life is created simply for research or for the benefit of another.  Any time in history when we have subjected one class of human beings to enslavement by another class has been wrong.  This time is no different.”   
The adopted measure states: “Member States are called upon to prohibit all forms of human cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life.”  The U.N. voted for a comprehensive ban on human cloning after two years of debate.   
Brownback continued, “The House of Representatives has twice passed legislation to ban human cloning, and the president supports such a ban.  In the coming weeks I will be reintroducing my legislation to ban human cloning, and it is my hope that the Senate will pass the ban this year.”   
Brownback was first elected to the Senate to fill the unexpired term of Bob Dole in 1996.  He was returned by the voters of Kansas for a full term in 1998, and reelected this past November.  He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1994-1996.  Brownback serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Joint Economic Committees.  He also is chairman of the Helsinki Commission.
