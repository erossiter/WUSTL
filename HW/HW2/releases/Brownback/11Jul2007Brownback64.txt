  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback mourned the loss of Lady Bird Johnson, who passed due to natural causes in her Austin, Texas home today.  Johnson was the widow of President Lyndon Baines Johnson.     
 
"Lady Bird Johnson will be missed and she and her family are in my prayers," Brownback stated.  "She was known for her grace and sincerity as well as ushering in an era of natural beautification and bringing environmentalism to the public conscience.  She also helped heal a nation after the loss of President Kennedy, torn by war and civil strife.  She was an outstanding First Lady and a great American."     
 
Lady Bird Johnson is survived by her two daughters, Lynda and Luci.
