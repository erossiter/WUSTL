  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage by unanimous consent S.Res 539, a resolution commending and congratulating the Department of Agronomy at Kansas State University for 100 years of excellent service.     
"I am happy that my colleagues in the Senate have recognized the important role of the Department of Agronomy at Kansas State University," said Brownback.  "For 100 years, the Department of Agronomy at Kansas State has provided excellent training."     
Brownback sponsored the resolution to honor K-State's Agronomy Department, which later this month will hold its centennial celebration.     
Brownback continued, "I received my undergraduate degree from Kansas State, so I know first-hand what a great university it is.  Kansas State is a valuable asset to my home state of Kansas and to America."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Appropriations Committee.
