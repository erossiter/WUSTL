  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded an announcement from the United States Agency for International Development that it will dramatically change internal guidelines that determine how it spends malaria funds.  The change of course comes in response to demands made by Congress in the Eliminate Neglected Diseases Act, introduced this April.  Brownback authored the END Act.     
“Malaria is a curable and preventable disease, and our failure to reduce death rates from malaria is inexcusable,” said Brownback.  “Although malaria kills 1-2 million people a year, and is the leading killer of children in Africa, the tools to fight malaria are readily available today.  I congratulate USAID for making these necessary changes to its malaria policy.  This issue deeply concerns me, and I have been working for over a year to reform the current system so that it focuses on life-saving commodities.  I’m hopeful this change will dramatically reduce mortality rates and ultimately lead to the eradication of malaria.”   
Prior to this policy change, USAID officials estimated that only 5-7 percent of the agency’s malaria funding was spent on life-saving commodities such as mosquito netting and insecticides.  The rest of the money was used for conferences and advice-giving efforts.  Under the new initiative, the following reforms will be implemented:   
•	Of the remaining $60 million in bilateral funds, 40 percent will be directed to purchasing life-saving malaria-fighting commodities, with an increase to 50 percent by next year.   
•	25 percent of the $60 million will be spent on insecticide spraying of homes, a dramatic increase from the 1 percent spent on this program in fiscal year 2004.   
•	Programs that are too small to be effective (under $1.5 million in one country) will be ended so that funds can make a greater impact by being consolidated into fewer countries.   
•	Strategic leadership and policy planning for the malaria program will be centralized and led by the Global Health Bureau.   
•	Rigorous transparency standards will be applied, and information on funding and results will be available on a public web site.   
Senator Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
