   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on his trip with President Bush to survey the tornado damage in Greensburg, Kansas. The devastation is just so incredible, and yet you're lifted by the spirit of the people that you see. They're going to rebuild; they're rebuilding their community now. I'm really pushing for all the federal assistance we can get. One of the things I want to see us do is get a waiver on the local match of the 75% federal and 25% local so that we can help the community rebuild. There is no tax base left in Greensburg, Kansas. The second thing I'd like to see us do is rebuild jobs in Greensburg. I've had a bill in for some period of time, the New Homestead Act, and I'd like to see us take the provisions of that and try it on a pilot basis. It offers a $5,000 tax credit for first time home buyers; rural investment tax credit; and a reduction for 3-5 years of student loans for people who resettle in areas that have been depopulated over the past twenty years. Those are the sorts of things to bring in new people and new opportunity and fresh ideas that I think would be a helpful thing throughout Kansas, but particularly in the rebuilding of Greensburg. I was really impressed with the President going person-to-person in the community, and trying to assure them that the country cared and that the federal government would be there anyway we possibly can. I thought he did a wonderful job of touching the hearts of the people of Greensburg that have been so wounded through this tornado. Our hearts and prayers go out to the people who are there, and it is time to start thinking about rebuilding. And Greensburg will come back.
