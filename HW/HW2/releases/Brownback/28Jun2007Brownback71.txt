  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted against the cloture motion on the immigration bill.  The cloture motion failed with a vote of 46-53, ending the current immigration debate in the Senate.     
"We need comprehensive immigration reform, but the country is not accepting of this bill," Brownback stated.  "We need to listen to the American people on both timing and substance.  We need to help 'the widow and orphan and foreigner amongst us,' but must do so in a way and at a time the American people support.  This is not yet the right way.  We should let the topic rest for now while we work diligently to secure our borders.  Americans support legal immigration, not illegal immigration.  We desire to be compassionate but demand adherence to the rule of law."     
Brownback has called for a comprehensive approach that secures the border, provides interior workplace enforcement, and a workable guest worker program.     
"I became convinced along with many of my colleagues on the floor that this version of the immigration bill was not, and would not become the vehicle that would fix our broken system as I had hoped."
