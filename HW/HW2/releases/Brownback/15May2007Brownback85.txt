   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback yesterday sent letters to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Iraqi Speaker of the Council of Representatives Mahmoud al-Mashhadani urging them to prevent the Iraqi Council of Representatives from adjourning for summer recess. Excerpts from the letter are below. I urge you not to allow the Council of Representatives to recess during the summer months and focus on legislation needed to further reconciliation between Iraq's ethnic and sectarian groups. I support the continued presence of American forces to help secure Iraq, but their efforts cannot be successful unless Iraq's political leaders make the compromises necessary to end sectarian violence. Our forces, as well as the Iraqi Security Forces, will not take a break this summer; they will continue to focus on their mission. It is essential that the Council of Representatives make the same level of commitment that U.S. and Iraqi Security Forces are making on Iraq's behalf..... Iraq cannot become a safe haven for terrorists or descend into a full civil war. U.S. forces, in conjunction with the Iraqi Security Forces, can prevent both of these outcomes, but they cannot achieve long term success without political progress. I hope that you will keep the Council of Representatives in session without recess and demonstrate a strong commitment to the future of your country.
