  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today called for recognition of November as National Adoption Month and encouraged more support for adoption.     
“My family has been personally touched by adoption,” said Senator Brownback.  “My wife and I adopted our two youngest children, and I continue to experience joy from the relationships we built through our adoption experience.”     
Brownback cosponsored S. Res. 299, a bill recognizing November as National Adoption month, with the hope of encouraging more families to consider adoption as a way to provide permanent and loving care for children from around the globe.  Senator Brownback’s office is featuring the photographs of two foster children in Kansas who are looking for a loving family.  Tres'Vonte and Au’Janae, ages 11 and 10, have been available for adoption for three years.     
Brownback continued, “The people-to-people contact made through international adoption provides suffering children with the care and attention they need.  In addition, beyond domestic and international adoption, there are many loving families who chose to adopt children with AIDS or children with disabilities like Down syndrome.  These families not only open their homes, but they provide lifelong care.  I commend the adoption and foster care organizations who strive to bring greater attention to the needs of these children, and I urge more families to consider expanding their families by adopting.”     
There are 129,000 children in foster care in the United States waiting to be adopted.
