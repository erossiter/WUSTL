  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback commented on the legacy of Pope John Paul II, who passed away today.   
“The Pope has fought the good fight, he has finished the course, he has kept the faith.  He is an incredible individual and his willingness to confront evil and stand for the dignity of the individual was unparalleled.   
“Pope John Paul II is a figure of hope and a beacon of light for people of all faiths and all walks of life.  The Holy Father has a very deep and personal affect on my faith journey and I mourn his loss.  But this is also a joyous moment, as Karol is now with God, and God has now welcomed home one of his greatest modern saints.   
“The Pope was not only a spiritual anchor for more than a billion Christians, but a strong and unwavering world leader who stood up in the face of assassination and political pressure to root out injustice all over the world.  Pope John Paul was a rare soul who knew the nature of good and evil in the world and stood up at a unique point in history and fought against the concentrated evil of Nazism and communism.  He also saw a cultural springtime when others did not and fought against the culture of death which has changed the way we debate life issue around the world.  Pope John Paul II was a leader and an example to us all that transcended faith or politics and he will be very much missed.”
