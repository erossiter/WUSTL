  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today delivered a speech on the Senate floor in which he commented on the improving situation in Iraq.       
"The numbers coming out of Iraq indicate that the United States military surge is successfully working," said Brownback.  "Admittedly, I had reservations about the surge at the outset, but my concerns have been proven wrong."       
In January of 2007, President Bush announced a "surge" troops to Iraq, increasing by 30,000 the number of troops on the ground.  U.S. military deaths have decreased by more than 50% since June, and Iraqi civilian deaths have decreased by 50% since August.  Sectarian violence also has decreased.  Mortar rocket attacks are at their lowest level since February 2006.      
Brownback continued, "We must emphasize a political solution and capture this moment of greater stability in Iraq.  My colleague Joe Biden and I introduced legislation encouraging federalism.  I think now is the time for us to push more aggressively for this kind of political solution."       Earlier this year, Brownback and Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) introduced the Biden/Brownback Iraq Federalism Bipartisan Amendment, which calls for a political settlement in Iraq based on federalism.  The bill passed the Senate by a 75-23 vote.      
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
