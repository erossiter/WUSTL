  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on recent action in the House of Representatives that could deprive key military bases in Kansas of $450 million in federal funds.     
"I share the concern of our military commanders that recent actions in the House of Representatives could deprive Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth and McConnell Air Force Base of crucial federal funding, and I am working hard to see that this funding is restored by the Senate," said Brownback.     
Yesterday, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a stopgap measure to fund this year's government operations at last year's levels, which would deprive Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth and McConnell Air Force Base of $450 million that the Senate approved in draft form last year.     
Brownback continued, "If we fail to fully fund current military construction projects, soldiers from Fort Riley's Big Red One—who will soon deploy to Iraq—will not have adequate housing when they return.     
"If Congress is serious about confronting new and emerging threats, we must give the Department of Defense the resources it needs by passing a fiscal year 2007 military construction bill. I had hoped the Democratic majority would make military construction shortfalls a priority, but the recent action in the House makes me less optimistic.     
"The recommendations of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission require fully funding construction projects at Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth, which would not be possible with the bill that the Democrats passed in the House."     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.
