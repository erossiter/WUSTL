  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback tonight commended the Senate for approving, by unanimous consent, $10.5 billion in emergency funding for the Gulf Coast region struck by Hurricane Katrina.  The emergency supplemental appropriations bill will cover the initial costs of relief and recovery efforts in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.  The funding will be made available for use by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Defense as they continue to move personnel and supplies to the hardest hit areas.     "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of this unprecedented disaster, and we hope for the quick reuniting of families," Brownback said.  "We are coming together as a nation to help those of us in need and will continue to do so until the job is done.  FEMA, the United States military, and so many other state and local first responders have been active in ongoing relief efforts in and around the disaster area, and with this funding they will be able to expand their immediate presence by evacuating the City of New Orleans and providing needed relief for survivors all over the Gulf Coast."     $10 billion from the bill will be made available to FEMA for Disaster Relief, and these funds will be used for direct interventions in caring for the victims and survivors of the hurricane.  $500 million will be made available to the Department of Defense to cover expenses incurred by the Armed Forces in responding to the disaster, including expenses for evacuations.     Senator Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Committee, which oversees the drafting of the twelve annual bills that fund the functions of the federal government as well as various emergency supplemental appropriations bills.
