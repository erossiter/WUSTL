  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator and Chairman of the Helsinki Commission Sam Brownback recently urged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to uphold the bedrock democratic principles of the 55-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by blocking creation of a “Working Group on Elections.”  There is growing pressure from the Russian Federation and others to revisit longstanding commitments on free and fair elections.  The campaign to undercut these standards aims to cement Russian ties with former Soviet republics that have poor human rights records and to distance the United States from these countries.   
Chairman Brownback (R-KS) and Co-Chairman Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ) wrote to Rice as she prepares for next week’s summit meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia between President George Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the architect of post-Soviet “managed” democracy.     
OSCE concluded that the 2004 Russian presidential election that returned Putin to the Kremlin “did not adequately reflect principles necessary for a healthy democratic election.”      
The initiative by the Commission leaders comes as Russia rhetoric assailing the democracy-promoting activities of the OSCE has intensified in the aftermath of Ukraine’s successful Orange Revolution.     
The letter concluded, “Having stood firm against rigged elections in Ukraine, the United States must not be bullied into concessions.  Watering down the democracy content of the OSCE would not only undermine the organization’s reason for being, but undercut the very people struggling to be free.”
