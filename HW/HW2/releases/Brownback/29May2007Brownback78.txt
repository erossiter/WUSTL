  U.S. Senators Sam Brownback, Pat Roberts and Congressman Jerry Moran today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs plans to build a new health care clinic in Hutchinson.     
"The new VA clinic in Hutchinson will help our veterans access doctors and seek medical attention without the hassle of traveling to inconvenient locations," said Brownback. "I salute our veterans for their service and express my gratitude for their sacrifice."     
"This is great news for the region," said Roberts. "Veterans deserve easy access to quality care without planning a day trip to get it."     
"At a veterans forum I hosted in Hutchinson in 2004, access to health care services in South Central Kansas was the top priority of the veterans in attendance," said Moran. "It has taken awhile, but the VA listened and this is one more step toward fulfilling the promise made to America's veterans."     
"VA is committed to providing world-class health care to the men and women who have served this nation," said VA Secretary Jim Nicholson. "These new clinics will bring VA's top-notch care closer to the veterans who have earned it."     
The new facility, part of a nationwide plan to expand community-based outpatient clinics, should open in approximately one year.     
With 153 hospitals and more than 700 community-based clinics, VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the country. VA's health care budget of more than $34 billion this year will provide health care to about 5.5 million people during nearly 800,000 hospitalizations and 60 million outpatient visits.
