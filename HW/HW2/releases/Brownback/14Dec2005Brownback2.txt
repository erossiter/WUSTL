  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback applauded Kansas City Power & Light for undertaking its first wind power project.  The project, which will generate enough electricity to power approximately 33,000 homes, will be installed on 5,000 acres of farmland near Spearville, KS.     
“I am pleased that Kansas City Power & Light chose Spearville for its first wind power generation site,” said Brownback.  “I am also pleased that this project has such broad support in both the city and county.  Not only will this project boost economic develop in western Kansas, but it also protects our native tallgrass prairie in the Flint Hills from further wind-generation development.”     
Expected to start producing power in the third quarter of 2006, the 67 turbines will generate approximately 100 megawatts of power.  By national standards, this makes the Spearville project a significant new wind power site.  Spearville is about 15 miles northeast of Dodge City, KS.     
Brownback continued, “I have long felt that Kansas can be an energy producing state due to our vast resources of renewable energy sources like ethanol, agricultural waste products, and wind.  But we also need to support renewable energy in a way that protects and enhances our environment and native lands.”     
Sen. Brownback sits on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
