  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today announced final passage of H.R. 2863, the FY2007 Department of Defense Appropriations bill.  This $453.28 billion funding measure also includes necessary funding to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina rebuild their lives and preventative funding to build our nation’s capacity to respond to a possible outbreak of avian flu.  As reported, the emergency provisions to provide for Katrina reconstruction and avian flu preparedness are completely offset.  H.R. 2863 now goes to the president’s desk to await his signature.   
“I am pleased that the Senate has passed this necessary funding measure before the end of the year,” Brownback said.  “Congress faces very few issues as important as keeping our national defense strong and helping our fellow Americans who have been afflicted by a terrible natural disaster.  Although the discussions on this bill have dragged on well into Fiscal Year 2006, the issues it addresses are important enough to warrant vigorous debate.  I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues on drafting a fiscally responsible bill that makes difficult spending decisions in challenging times.”   
H.R. 2863 provides comprehensive funding for the operations of the Department of Defense, including $50 billion for contingency operations in the War on Terror.  $29 billion in emergency funding is set aside for reconstruction efforts along the Gulf Coast, most of which will be used to address critical infrastructure needs such as levee enhancement, road and bridge reconstruction, and electricity and water transmission redevelopment.  $3.8 billion is provided for programs to prepare the United States for a possible outbreak of a pandemic flu epidemic.  The bill also provides more than $55 million for projects in the State of Kansas.  Selected projects include:   
$1,200,000 for flatbed semi-trailers, Marysville   
$4,800,000 for aging military aircraft support at the NAIR, Wichita State University   
$7,000,000+ for the airborne laser missile defense research project, a national project located in Wichita.   
$4,800,000 for the Army Extended Range Attack Missile (AERAM), Lansing   
$3,300,000 for an ASR-11 Radar system near Ft. Riley that will serve most of North-Central Kansas   
$2,000,000 for air traffic management systems for the KC-135   
$17,000,000+ for the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS), a national program based in Wichita.   
$12,000,000 for 155mm artillery, Kansas Ammunition Plant, Parsons   
$3,300,000 for technical support for titanium honeycomb sandwich and composite design (light and durable materials used on high performance aircraft), a program based in Wichita.   
$3,800,000 for the Urban Operations Environmental Laboratory, Kansas State University
