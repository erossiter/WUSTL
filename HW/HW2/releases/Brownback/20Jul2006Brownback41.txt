  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.     
"I am a proud cosponsor of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization bill," said Brownback.  "The right to vote is the bedrock of our great democracy and this right must be protected for everyone.  Since the Voting Rights Act was first signed into law four decades ago, America has made great strides in race relations, and we must continue to work toward racial equality."       
The Senate reauthorized certain provisions of the Voting Rights Act that were set to expire in 2007.  These provisions were established in 1965, when a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Act and it was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson.       
Brownback continued, "The importance of the Voting Rights Act cannot be underestimated.  America has come a long way in the last four decades, and it is my hope that reauthorizing the bill will help us continue to extend the promise of democratic participation to every American."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights.
