   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the change in command of the First Infantry Division, headquartered at Fort Riley, Kansas. I want to congratulate Major General Carter Ham on his new assignment as Director of Operations on the Joint Staff, said Brownback.  I wish General Ham great success in his new role in Washington, D.C., but he will be missed in Kansas.  The First Infantry Division plays a crucial role in the Global War on Terrorism, and General Ham provided excellent leadership during a crucial time over the past year. General Ham came to Fort Riley in August, 2006, when the headquarters of the First Infantry Division returned from Germany to Kansas.  During his tenure, Ham oversaw the First Infantry Division's program to develop training teams to be embedded with units of the Afghan and Iraqi Security Forces.  The embedded teams teach indigenous forces how to operate professionally and independently and are an essential part of the effort to transfer security responsibility from Coalition to local forces. Brownback also welcomed Major General Robert Durbin, who will replace General Hamm as Commander of the First Infantry Division. Brownback said, I met General Durbin in his capacity as the Commanding General of the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan.  I appreciate his leadership in that role, and I am confident that his experience building the Afghan Security Forces will be of particular value at Fort Riley. Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees. -30-
