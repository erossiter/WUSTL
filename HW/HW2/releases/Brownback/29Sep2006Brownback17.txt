  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded Senate passage by 80-19 of a bill that would authorize the construction of 700 miles of fencing along the southern U.S. border.  The bill now heads to the White House for the president's signature.     
"We need to secure our border as the first step in fixing a broken immigration system and restoring public trust in the government's ability to manage this situation," said Brownback.  "Many people have told me they will support comprehensive immigration reform if we secure the border first.  Building 700 miles of fencing along the most vulnerable sections of our southern border goes a long way toward securing the border, and I hope we can use passage of this bill as a starting point toward long-term, comprehensive immigration reform."     
H.R.6061, the Secure Fence Act, instructs the Department of Homeland Security to install fencing, sensors and cameras along five specific stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.     
The bill also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to achieve "operational control" over U.S. borders within 18 months of the bill's enactment into law.     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Judiciary Committee.
