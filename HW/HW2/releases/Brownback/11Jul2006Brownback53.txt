  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded new tax revenue figures showing that the federal budget deficit will be approximately $127 billion less than projected.     
"I'm pleased that strong economic growth and increased tax revenues are driving down the deficit," said Brownback.  "I hope Congress builds on this good news by showing a real commitment to reducing spending.  The system in Washington is built to spend, which is why I support structural reform like the line-item veto and an independent panel to review federal spending."     
Last month the Senate Budget Committee passed a spending reform package that included Brownback's Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies Act.     
Brownback continued, "As Ronald Reagan once said, 'there's nothing more permanent than a temporary government program.' CARFA is the antidote to Congress's general unwillingness to end politicians' pet-projects."     
CARFA is modeled on the successful military Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which covers only a small percentage of federal spending, yet has resulted in more than $50 billion in taxpayer savings through closing and realigning lower-priority military bases. The bill would call on the president and Congress to appoint members to an independent, bipartisan commission that would review federal programs for waste, ineffectiveness, and duplicity.     
Over the course of four years, the CARFA commission would report four bills to Congress, each addressing approximately 25 percent of the federal budget. Congress would consider each measure on an expedited basis with a comment period from the committees of jurisdiction. Within the expedited timeframe, Congress would hold a simple up-or-down vote on the legislation, without amendment.     
Senator Brownback is a member of the Joint Economic Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Judiciary Committee.
