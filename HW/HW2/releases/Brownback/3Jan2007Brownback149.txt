  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today toured Fort Riley, Kansas, for a progress update on the Army’s program to train soldiers to be embedded as military advisors to native troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.   
“Training the Iraqis and Afghanis to manage their countries’ security is a key component of our strategy,” said Brownback. “The men and women at Fort Riley are doing an outstanding job operating the primary training center for the soldiers who are transitioning the security mission in Iraq and Afghanistan from American to local troops.”   
Fort Riley’s transition team training program immerses soldiers in demanding scenarios that closely approximate situations they will find as embedded military advisors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fort Riley includes mock villages complete with buildings, streets, and native-speaking role players.    
During the tour, Brownback observed combat lifesavers training and a live IED demonstration. He also toured the language lab, where soldiers practice Arabic and Dari, and ate lunch in the mess hall with several soldiers. Brownback met with the Commanding General, Major General Carter Hamm, and the Garrison Commander, Colonel Ty Smith.   
Fort Riley is the home of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division, also known as the Big Red One, which relocated to Fort Riley last August after ten years in Germany. The Big Red One has fought in major engagements ranging from D-Day on Omaha Beach in World War II to responding to the Tet Offensive in Vietnam.  The Big Red One played integral roles in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to the present.   
Fort Riley is named after Major General Bennett C. Riley, who led the first military escort along the Santa Fe Trail.   
Senator Brownback is planning a trip to the region in the next few weeks.
