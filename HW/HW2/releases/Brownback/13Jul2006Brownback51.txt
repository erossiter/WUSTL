  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded unanimous Senate passage of S.Con.Res. 96, a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the national motto, "In God We Trust."     
"I am very pleased that the Senate unanimously passed a resolution to honor our national motto," said Brownback.  "The phrase 'In God We Trust' has had great historic and symbolic significance for America, not only during the past fifty years, but since the birth of the nation.  It is important that we reaffirm 'In God We Trust' as our national motto, especially now when references to God in the public square continue to be groundlessly challenged."           
In 1861, Secretary of the Treasury Samuel P. Chase ordered that coins bear a motto expressing the American people's trust in God.  The first coins with the phrase "In God We Trust" were minted in 1864.  In 1955 the phrase was required for all new currency and coins, and on July 30, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a joint Congressional resolution officially making "In God We Trust" the national motto of the United States.       
Brownback chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution.
