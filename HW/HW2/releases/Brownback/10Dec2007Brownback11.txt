  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today introduced S. Res. 399, a resolution that sets the conditions for the State Department's proposed removal of North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.        
"If the United States takes the step of removing North Korea from the terrorism list, let's at least make clear the conditions for such a removal," said Brownback.  "I question the merits of the State Department's decision to remove North Korea from its terrorist list, but this resolution allows the Senate to voice its views on a key American foreign policy objective."     
In October, North Korea agreed to disable its key nuclear facilities and declare its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year.  Contingent on North Korea's execution of this agreement, the United States may remove North Korea from the State Department list of state sponsors of terrorism.       
Brownback continued, "It is important that the United States sends a loud and clear message to the North Korean regime that we will remain vigilant.  There are talks underway to continue subsidizing the North Korean regime with tangible economic and political benefits, re-legitimizing the regime after its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons tests of last year."       
The resolution, co-sponsored by Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), and Joe Lieberman (I-CT), establishes benchmarks which must be met before the United States eases certain restrictions against the government of North Korea.  The resolution also states that the United States government should not provide any financial assistance to North Korea until Secretary of State Rice ensures certifications regarding the submission of applications for refugee status.         
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committee.
