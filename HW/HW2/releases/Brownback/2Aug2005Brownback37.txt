  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, along with Senators James Inhofe (R-OK) and Pat Roberts (R-KS), last week introduced the Communities First Act, legislation that helps address regulatory and tax burdens that are detrimental to our nation's community lenders and the communities they serve.  The bill was first introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Jim Ryun (R-KS).     
 
"The Communities First Act recognizes the heavy burdens that are currently placed on our community banks and offers initiatives to ease those burdens," Brownback said.  "This is a large step forward to expand on previously passed relief bills that did not include true relief for our smaller financial institutions, of which there are over 500 in Kansas."     
 
Fully titled the "Community Banks Serving Their Communities First Act," the bill provides targeted regulatory relief and tax reform for community banks.  The legislation provides regulatory relief by:     
 
Directing the Federal Reserve to provide greater flexibility for bank borrowers to waive the three-day right of recession to access loan funds quicker;   Permitting reporting agencies to adjust the examination interval for qualified banks with up to $1 billion in assets;   Allowing qualified banks with up to $1 billion in assets to file a short-form call report in two quarters of each year;   Exempting banks with up to $1 billion in assets from costly internal control and attestation and audit requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and   Permitting banks that do not share customer information the option to forego the annual privacy notice to customers unless there have been changes in their policies.        
The Communities First Act also includes tax reform provisions that:    

Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for banks with up to $5 billion in assets.   Allow a 20% tax credit for C-corporation banks and bank holding companies up to a maximum credit of $250,000 per year.  S-corporation banks could exclude 20% of distributable income not to exceed $1.25 million of income;   Provide qualified banks and bank holding companies in distressed areas with a 50% tax credit.  The credit for C-corporation banks could not exceed $500,000 and S-corporation banks would be able to exclude 50% of income up to $2.5 million;   Defer the recognition of interest income on long-term certificates of deposit, and reduce the top rate to the capital gains rate; and   Exempt the income earned on agricultural real estate and mortgage loans in communities of 2,500 or less population.
