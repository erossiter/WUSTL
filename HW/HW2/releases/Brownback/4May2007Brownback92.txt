  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded President Bush's vow to veto any legislation which weakens current pro-life laws and polices.     
"I am pleased that President Bush has reminded my Senate colleagues of his strong pro-life stance," said Brownback.  "By promising to veto new legislation that would weaken current pro-life policies, the President has taken a strong moral stand."     
In a letter sent yesterday to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, President Bush expressed his concern that Congress may consider legislation that would change current federal policies and laws to allow federal funding of abortions.   President Bush stated in the letter his intent to veto any such legislation.       
Brownback continued, "A letter sent to Congress from President Bush is a powerful reminder that we live in a country that is committed to protecting the dignity of every human life.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on important life-related legislation."     
In February, Brownback authored a letter, signed by 34 other senators, to the White House asking President Bush to inform Congress of his intent to uphold pro-life legislation.       
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
