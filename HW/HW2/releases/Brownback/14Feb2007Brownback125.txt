  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Senate passage of the continuing resolution, H.J.Res.20, a stopgap measure to fund this year's government operations at last year's levels.       
"The continuing resolution passed today by the Democrat-controlled Senate deprives crucial military bases of much needed federal funding," said Brownback.  "Our men and women in uniform perform invaluable services to our nation, and now is certainly not the time to strip money away from our armed forces."     
The continuing resolution passed the Senate today by a vote of 81-15.  The bill cuts a total of $4.3 billion from Base Realignment and Closure funding and traditional military construction funding.  As a result, Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth and McConnell Air Force Base, all in Kansas, may lose as much as $450 million total.      
Brownback continued, "Our nation is at a crucial point in the Global War on Terror.  The Department of Defense must have the necessary resources to protect America and keep our citizens safe from terrorists."       
Brownback was also disappointed that the continuing resolution does not include funding for Marriage Development Accounts, a program started by Brownback used in the District of Columbia to offset financial disincentives to marriage in the welfare system.       
Brownback is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.  -30-
