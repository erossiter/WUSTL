  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today recorded an audio statement celebrating Veteran’s Day and commending those who have served our country.   
“To our veterans, I say thank you on behalf of a grateful people.  You’ve put your lives on hold and gone off to war around the world in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan.  You’ve stood for freedom, justice, and the rights of others, and because of your actions we are safer and more people are free.  Thank you, and God bless you,” said Brownback.
