  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback criticized the “Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research” released today by the National Research Council of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.   
“These so-called ‘guidelines’ for destructive human embryonic stem cell research try to put a good face on an unethical line of research,” Brownback said.  “They attempt to frame the issue as ‘how to conduct ethical research,’ but the guidelines entirely miss the point:  We should not be destroying young human lives for the benefit of others.     
“These guidelines will be yet another distraction from all the wonderful advances and treatments resulting from ethical adult stem cell research.  So far, at least 58 treatments in humans have come about through ethical adult and non-embryonic stem cell research.  I will continue to push for federal funding of ethical research, which is resulting in real treatments for real people.”
