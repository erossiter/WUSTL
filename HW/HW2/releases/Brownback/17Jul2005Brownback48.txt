  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today clarified a misstatement on Fox News Sunday.  Commentator Juan Williams stated that Brownback has already met with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and inferred that Brownback is completely comfortable with Gonzales as a nominee.     
"I have requested a meeting with Attorney General Gonzales but have not met with him yet," Brownback stated.  "I will not be supportive of any nominee who is not clear about his or her view of the Constitution. America needs a nominee who will stand for the plain meaning of our central document. This is critical to being a nation based on the rule of law not man."     
Brownback asked for a meeting with Attorney General Gonzales this past Monday.  The Department of Justice has acknowledged the request, but has yet to accept or decline.  Brownback stated that he would understand if the Administration or the Department of Justice would rather not have the meeting, but prefers to have a discussion prior to any eventual nomination, which would begin a formal process that may preclude informal conversations.     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights.
