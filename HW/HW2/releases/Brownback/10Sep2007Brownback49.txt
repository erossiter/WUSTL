  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the testimony of General David Petraeus and Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker.     
"We should promote the development of a Sunni region to take advantage of the situation described today by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker," said Brownback.  "The progress cited by General Petraeus creates a unique opportunity to forge a Sunni region similar to the Kurdish region in the northern part of Iraq," Brownback said.     
General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker today testified before a joint session of the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees.  Today's testimony highlighted the improving security situation in Anbar province, an area of Iraq dominated by Arab Sunnis.   Ambassador Crocker testified that Sunnis are learning to rely more on local, rather than national, institutions to improve their communities.       
Brownback continued, "Sunnis previously opposed the creation of new regions in Iraq, but they are now beginning to see the advantages of a federal system.  We should not wait for national reconciliation to take advantage of the bottom-up political progress in Anbar province and create a Sunni region that would play an integral role in a united Iraq."     
Brownback is a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations.
