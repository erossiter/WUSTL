  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the resignation of Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns.       
"I commend Secretary Johanns for his service to the President, to the country, and to the American agriculture industry," said Brownback.  "Johanns' leadership and insight over the past three years has led to more prosperous farms and farm families across this nation and has set us on a good course as we begin to write a new farm bill.  I wish Johanns the best of luck in his future endeavors and thank him for his service."     
Johanns is planning to return to Nebraska and run for the United State Senate.  Deputy Agriculture Secretary Charles Conner will take over as acting Secretary of Agriculture.     Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.
