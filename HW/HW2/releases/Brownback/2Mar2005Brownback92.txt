  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ) today introduced the Darfur Accountability Act of 2005.  The legislation calls for U.S. and multilateral sanctions against those responsible for the genocide in Darfur and prompt prosecution in an international court of justice, for immediate U.N. Security Council sanctions against Sudan, and for accelerated assistance to the African Union to be able to alleviate the current cycle of genocide.   
 
“Yesterday I spoke on the Senate floor in an attempt to display the face of genocide,” Brownback said.  “Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times provided us with photographs of scorched bodies, castrated men, dead children and burned villages.     
 
 “Unfortunately the debate on Darfur has been hijacked by groups and countries wishing to push their political agenda on the U.S. over the International Criminal Court.  Senator Corzine and I feel that the real issue is to seek immediate reprieve of the crisis on the ground.     
 
“We do not have days or weeks to spare when millions of lives are in jeopardy.  We cannot grant the government of Sudan and the Janjaweed more time to execute the African tribes in Darfur.  I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Corzine and me in moving this bill through Congress.”    
 
The Darfur Accountability Act:   
 
·        Reiterates that the atrocities taking place in Darfur are genocide   
·        Calls on the administration to seek sanctions in the U.N. Security Council   
·        Calls for accelerated assistance to the African Union force in Darfur   
·        Calls for the establishment of a military no-fly zone in Darfur   
·        Calls for an extension of the multilateral arms embargo to include the government of Sudan   
·        Freezes the assets and property of and denies visas and entry to those named by the U.N. Commission that investigated crimes against humanity   
·        Calls for a Special Presidential Envoy for Sudan   
·        States that the United States supports accountability through action by the U.N. Security Council, pursuant to Chapter VII, to ensure the prompt prosecution and adjudication of those named by the U.N. Commission through a competent international court of justice, and requires that the administration report to Congress on such efforts    
 
Brownback continued, “The United Nations should take immediate steps to end the genocide and Kofi Annan should lead the Security Council to pass a strong, meaningful resolution that will immediately change the situation on the ground.  There is no longer an excuse; we must call this what this is, and we must immediately act to prevent further pillaging and death.  I have called on Annan several times to lead or leave.   
 
“The United Nations should vote to immediately levy hefty and serious economic and diplomatic sanctions against the government of Sudan, the government-sponsored Janjaweed, and any businesses or companies complicit through their government connections.  We must insist upon an arms embargo against the government of Sudan, travel restrictions of Sudanese government officials, and a freeze on the assets of companies controlled by the ruling party that do business abroad.  Two years after the conflict in Darfur began, not one punitive measure has been imposed on the government of Sudan.”   
 
Brownback and Corzine previously introduced S. Con. Res. 124, which formally declared genocide in Sudan.  It has been nearly six months since that legislation was passed by the U.S. Congress, followed shortly thereafter with a similar declaration by former Secretary of State Colin Powell.  However, since that time, attacks aimed at killing innocent civilians and destroying villages have continued and aid groups have withdrawn from the region.   
 
Despite numerous calls from the U.S. Congress and the U.N. Security Council, the government of Sudan has not made any attempt at ending the violence against civilians, disarming the Janjaweed, and abiding by cease-fire violations, including use of air power against civilians.   
 
Brownback is chairman of the Helsinki Commission and a former member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
