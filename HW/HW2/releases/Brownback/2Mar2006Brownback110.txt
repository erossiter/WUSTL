  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on a new study from the Parents Television Council showing that children’s television programming contains increasing amounts of violence:   
“I fear too many parents have an unjustified sense of security when they place their children in front of the television.  I hope this new study from the Parents Television Council will demonstrate that children’s programs are not necessarily free of violence, crude language, and coarse humor.  I encourage broadcasters and network producers to consider the content they are disseminating to children, and I encourage parents to educate themselves about the content of their children’s favorite shows.”   
Last year Brownback introduced a bipartisan bill called the Children and Media Research Advancement Act.  This bill would allocate $90 million over five years to further study the effects of media on children.  It would establish a panel of experts within the Centers for Disease Control to review current research on the role of media.  The bill would also establish pilot projects in the Department of Health and Human Services.  A similar bill is pending in the House of Representatives.   
The study, released today by the Parents Television Council, is titled “Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing: A Content Analysis of Children’s Television.”
