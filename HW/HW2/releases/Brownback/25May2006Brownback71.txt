  WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded the U.S. Treasury Department’s decision to end the century-old tax on long-distance telephone service.   
“The longevity of the phone surcharge tax, which was instituted over a hundred years ago as a temporary measure to help finance the Spanish American War, goes to show how hard it is for the federal government to wean itself from so-called ‘temporary’ taxes and programs,” said Brownback.  “I applaud the Treasury Department and the Bush Administration for ending the phone tax and for pursuing a pro-growth tax relief strategy.  The deficit is going down because of the strong economic growth stimulated by the Administration’s tax relief policy.”   
The Treasury Department announced that the Internal Revenue Service will issue refunds on taxes paid over the past three years, and the refunds will be processed with 2006 tax returns, which will be filed in 2007.  The decision to end the long-distance phone tax comes after several years of federal litigation.  Local phone taxes will not be affected.   
Brownback is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Joint Economic Committee.
