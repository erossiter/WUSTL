FL  today praised the agreement reached by Senate and House conferees on the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  and Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU   The Senate is expected to approve the conference report today sending the bill to the White House for signature  This bill is good for Florida  Its better than the previous law  said Martinez  Unfortunately  Florida maintains its role as a donor state but were making progress in getting more of our tax dollars back into our roads   Martinez pointed out that Floridas share of the six year allocation improves significantly over the previous law  The funds authorized by SAFETEA LU provide Florida a six year share of highway funds  2004 to 2009  totaling over  10 3 billion  That represents a 31 percent increase over previous law  TEA 21   Over the same period  Floridas total transit funding increases 146 percent to  1 46 billion   Our highways are becoming more congested and our commutes longer every year because Florida continues to be a high growth state  said Martinez  The projects funded and authorized by this six year plan will enhance mobility within the state and improve the quality of life in a great number of Florida communities     Martinez played an integral role in securing language that will allow the state of Florida to use its  100 million commitment to a Miami Intermodal Center extension project as matching funds for future Miami Dade projects  This has been one of the Florida Department of Transportations top priorities for the past several years  SAFETEA LU is an important bill that will help Florida and the nation  Martinez concluded      TRANSIT AND HIGHWAY PROJECTS  BY REGION       NORTH    Jacksonville Transportation Authority    14 964 000    Bus
