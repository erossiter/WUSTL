                               SENATOR MARTINEZ STATEMENT ON EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL   May 3  2006   Mr  Martinez  Mr  President  war is difficult  War is not pretty  War sometimes unfortunately leads to death and injury   Our country has been blessed over our history  though there have been willing men and women who believe enough in our system  who believe enough in the system of democracy that we are so fortunate and blessed to have that are willing to give their lives so that this system may endure  so that this system may continue  so that our country may continue to be free    And  Mr  President  I believe that as we look at the difficult situation in Iraq  the last thing we need is a policy of defeatism  a policy that looks to ways in which we can criticize and critique without offering an alternative path and without offering an alternative solution    The fact is that there was a worldwide failure of intelligence in the days leading up to the war in Iraq  But the fact also is that we are there today and that thousands of America s best and brightest  those who we are the proudest of  are there serving this nation with distinction  with valor  And I would dare say with great success  And our hope for them must be that they complete their mission and come home  that they can come home with their heads held high for a job well done    Mr  President  I also believe that the civilian concept of leadership over our military is well ingrained in our system  I had the distinction  the honor and the privilege of serving in the Cabinet of this president with Secretary Rumsfeld    Secretary Rumsfeld is a man of great distinction  He s also someone who has tackled the very difficult job of transforming our armed forces  He has taken on the very difficult job of moving forward into a post cold war sort of world with an armed force that is very different than the one we ve had  And anytime a large bureaucracy undergoes change  there s difficulty with that change  and sometimes there are different opinions about how that change would take place    And there s no doubt that there are people who have had different ideas about how to that approach change  Whether it was a war effort or whether it is the reorganization of our armed forces  their ideas differ from those of Secretary Rumsfeld  But to those who have have those kind of different ideas  I would say that we only elect one President at a time and that that president only has one Secretary of Defense at a time  And that is why we have a chain of command  Because someone has to lead and someone has to make the decisions    I believe our country  at a time when we were unfairly and unwontedly attacked by terrorists  has been fortunate to have a decisive President at the helm  who has had the good fortune to have dedicated people like a Don Rumsfeld to serve by his side    You know  Mr  President  this is a President who did not seek a war with terrorists but who had a war brought to us in the streets of New York with over 3 000 American casualties on a given day    And the fact is that this president was also confronted with the need to act in this global war on terror  And I can remember when in the mountains of Afghanistan there seemed to be a stalemate after about a month or two of our initial conflict there and the naysayers were saying that we hadn t sent enough troops  And then all of a sudden a tremendous breakthrough in modern warfare took place as we saw our special forces operating on the backs of horses with laptop computers directing fire and a whole new era of warfare evolved   But we liberated the people of Afghanistan  who have since then had elections  where women and children of all sexes can now go to school  women can walk the streets without fear  where children can go to school  whether they be little boys or little girls  Where they ve had that unique opportunity in the world that we so much take for granted in this country    But for those of us who were born other places  who understand the uniqueness of voting  have had the right and the opportunity to elect their leaders  And now more recently  11 million Iraqis voted in the third election in one year  followed by now the formation after some politicking and some good old fashioned democratic horse trading have formed a government    The moment today ought to be to highlight the hope of a new Iraq  the hope of a democracy in the Middle East  which is so unique to that region of the world  The fact that a new government has been formed not to try recount all of the potential for different moves at any given point  all warfare is riddled with difficulties and second guessing  But here we have a moment of hope and opportunity    Defeatism is not a policy  It is only a prescription for failure  And I m hopeful that as we go forward  we recognize the successes of the Iraqi people and the difficult task of forming a democrat dlearks we relish    democracy  that we rel initial their accomplishments  that we understand that it s an incomplete project in democracy but one moving in the right direction    And I  for one  with thank all of those who are serving under these difficult circumstances over there and their families for the sacrifices they re making so that we might be successful  so that we might find a way forward than is better than defeat  than is better   that is better than negativism and is better than second guessing    Thank you  Mr  President  I yield the floor
