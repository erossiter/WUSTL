                               MARTINEZ ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR BUSH ADMINISTRATION TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM   February 3  2006   Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mel Martinez today announced his support for the Bush Administrations terrorist surveillance program  Speaking at a U S  Capitol news conference  Martinez said the National Security Agencys terrorist surveillance program is an integral part to the war on terror    Martinez was joined by Sens  Jeff Sessions  R AL   Jon Kyl  R AZ   Mike Crapo  R ID   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   and John Cornyn  R TX    The senators announcement came on the eve of next Mondays Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the surveillance program   Martinez said   Let me begin with the context of my prior service in the Cabinet  I believe that as we talk about the authorization for the use of force that the president received from the Congress  in frankly rather overwhelming numbers  it came at a time when our country was under attack and when there was great unanimity about the president doing whatever it would take to keep our country safe  I think the imminence of another attack was on all of our minds and so when you look at a statutory pronouncement of the Congress  you also want to look at what the legislative intent of it might have been    And  at that time  in that context  and at that moment in history  I dont believe there would have been too many questions raised about the president putting in place a program that would provide the opportunity to connect the dots as we know we didnt connect on 9 11    or prior to 9 11    to allow us to be able to monitor the conversations between a known terrorist organization outside the United States and the incidental conversation with someone within the United States  who we know was talking to them for a purpose of aiding in their continuing war against the United States    In addition to that  I looked at this problem as one of What am I going to do now as a senator  What is my responsibility  How do I react to thisinformation  The first thing to do is to get the facts  And as we get the facts  the facts today are not as they might have appeared on the first day we heard about this  The facts  in fact  are that it was not a widespread domestic surveillance program  but it is a very limited program  very narrow in its scope  and focused purely on terrorist organizations making calls into the United States    With that context  I believe that this is an integral part to the war on terror and it is a part of the battlefield plan that the president is carrying out under his authority as commander in chief and under his constitutional authority to respond in a time of war with timely intelligence so that we can respond to battlefield needs  The fact is that this surveillance is not being done for any purpose other than to be utilized as early warning intelligence for us to be able to respond to potential attacks on the United States   There are two other issues that I would like to touch on  One is about the leak  It is terrible that we have to talk about this program because it might be of assistance to those abroad who seek to harm the United States  It is too bad that we might  even as we go forward in this process of hearings  to discuss something that ought to not be discussed  As I recall  in WWII there were things we were able to do through our intelligence that no one would dare talk about  because they were so secret  so instrumentally valuable to the United States that it was best left undiscussed  So I hope that as we go forward to discuss this program  we keep in mind the necessity for national security  the necessity for discretion  the necessity for secrecy    And lastly I would only say that  again looking back to that historical time of WWII  and in the aftermath of it  the United States engaged in a great enterprise called the Cold War  which ultimately was successfully concluded  But during that entire time  there was a great need for espionage and a great need for the United States to work cooperatively with other countries  but also  for those of us in this nation  As a citizen of this country  I have always prided myself on the fact that when it came to national affairs of great importance to the security of this country  at the height of the Cold War  this nation spoke with one voice  It wasnt Republicans  it wasnt Democrats  We worked together as a nation  as Americans  to protect the security of our country    And I hope that as we go forward in this great and important discussion that we will remember the need for us to remain in a working together mode    working together as Americans    to ensure the safety and security of our people  while also keeping in mind the very important safeguards that our Constitution provides to civil liberties    END                                                              February 2006 News Releases             Browse by
