                               MARTINEZ  ROBERTS QUALIFIED IN EVERY RESPECT   September 28  2005   WASHINGTON  DC  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  delivered the following statement yesterday on the Senate floor in regards to the confirmation of Judge John Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States    Maritnez said   Mr  President  Today I rise for the first time as a United States Senator to exercise my constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent to a presidential nominee for Chief Justice to the United States Supreme Court  It is a high privilege that carries with it great responsibility  The responsibility to ensure  in so much as is possible  that the nominee is not only of the highest intellect  integrity and character  but that he or she comes to the process with no personal ideological agenda  That the nominee recognizes there is no room in the business of judging for the personal policy ideals of individual judges and that the symbolism of the judges black robe to shield both the litigants and the country from the personal idiosyncrasy must be carried out in the discharge of the heavy responsibilities of the Court     Today I add my voice to that of my colleagues speaking in support of the nomination of John Roberts to become the 17th Chief Justice of the United States    Before the confirmation hearings began  we knew that John Roberts had impeccable academic qualifications to serve as the chief judicial and administrative officer of the highest court in the land     Before the hearings began we knew that John Roberts had the wholehearted support of prior Solicitors General  in both Democrat and Republican administrations     We knew that he had the overwhelming support of a majority of members of the    District of Columbia bar and we knew that he received the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association     In short  we knew that his qualifications to serve were impeccable and unassailable     And what we now know after the confirmation hearings  after extensive interaction with Members of the Senate  20 hours of testimony and the give and take of responding to over 500 questions  is that Judge Roberts is possessed of      A quiet humility    A deep understanding and modest view of his own significance    A healthy appreciation of the role of the Court in the governance of our nation    A respect for the limitation of precedent    An awareness of the dangers of looking to foreign jurisdictions for guidance in shaping the laws of our land   And a commitment to respecting the proper role of the courts in interpretation of the law     I am persuaded that Judge Roberts will look to established precedent  be respectful of the doctrine of stare decisis and will use the constitution and the law as his guideposts as opposed to any personal whim or political agenda     In my private meeting with Judge Roberts we discussed his view of the role of the Chief Justice  From his thoughtful response  it was clear that he had well considered ideas about providing effective and constructive leadership to his colleagues on the Court  In every institution or endeavor  great leadership finds a way to unite rather than to divide  I am confident that Judge Roberts will provide that leadership     Mr  President  I want to mention that while a nominees views on issues such as the right to privacy are unquestionably significant and have occupied a great deal of the time dedicated to the confirmation process  our entire judiciary looks to the Supreme Court for guidance on many other issues other than the great constitutional questions of our day     Im hopeful that as we go forward with our next nominee  we can find some time to also discuss issues that are vital to the day to day administration of justice     What are the nominees views on the cost of litigation in our country or the length of time required for litigants to have their claims adjudicated  Is there a fair mechanism to address legitimate concerns about non meritorious cases     What has the effect of the speedy trial rule been on the ability of litigants in civil case to have a fair and prompt resolution of their claims     What are the nominees views on the argument that complex cases involving scientific evidence are beyond the ken of average jurors     Where does the nominee stand on the difficult issue of sentencing guidelines and the current tension existing between the Congress and the Courts on the appropriateness of giving federal judges discretion in the imposition of sentences     Where does the nominee stand on the problems of electronic discovery in civil and criminal cases     What are the nominees views on the importance of 12 member juries in civil cases  Could juries of 6 serve justice just as well  Why are unanimous verdicts required in civil cases  could another method lead to a better quality of justice     Mr  President  these questions may not make for good headlines  but they surround issues that are vital to the administration of justice in our great land    It is my hope we will to take the time to discuss them in the coming weeks as we go forward with the confirmation process of a nominee to replace Sandra Day OConnor  These are the questions we should consider as we depoliticize the confirmation process and return our attention to working together to advance the cause of justice in our nation    Mr  President  my colleagues should take note that the American Bar Association gave Judge Roberts the rating of Well Qualified for Chief Justice of the      To earn that rating  the    ABA says  the nominee must be at the top of the legal profession  have outstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience and meet the highest standards of integrity  professional competence and judicial temperament     The evaluation of Well Qualified is reserved for only those found to merit the Standing Committee s strongest affirmative endorsement     In conducting its investigation  the ABA reached out to a wide spectrum of people across political  racial and gender lines  including lawyers  judges and community leaders  people with personal knowledge of Judge Roberts     The ABA interviewed federal and state court judges  including all members of the Supreme Court of the   members of the Courts of Appeals  members of the United States District Courts  United States Magistrate Judges  United States Bankruptcy Judges  and numerous state judges  The results were as follows    On integrity  He is probably the most honorable guy I know and he is a man of his word  I would be amazed if anyone had any greater integrity on either a personal or professional level  Hes a man of extraordinary integrity and character     On judicial temperament   He has the kind of temperament and demeanor you would want in a judge  He was extremely even tempered and was so good that he could give classes on it  John Roberts is respectful  polite and understated  He has no bluster and is a fabulous lawyer  He has no need to impress anyone     On professional competence  He is brilliant and he understands the importance of the independence of the judiciary and the role of the rule of law  His opinions are clear  succinct and very well written  His opinions are in the mainstream of American jurisprudence     In my own meeting with Judge Roberts  I was particularly impressed with his discussion of the dangers associated with looking beyond the borders for guidance or the support of precedent     His response reflected a deep and comprehensive understanding not only of the importance of judicial precedent in setting boundaries for the Court  but also the role of the people  the legislative process and our representative form of government  Judge Roberts noted in our meeting and again in his testimony before the committee that our judges are appointed by our elected President and their appointment requires the consent of the duly elected members of the United States Senate   This provides a measure of accountability consistent with the intention of the Founding Fathers     Looking to a foreign source for legal principles deprives the American people of that accountability  To use Judge Roberts words  and I paraphrase  its a bit like looking out over a large crowd to identify your friends  If you look hard enough  you can find something you like     To my colleagues who are poised to cast a vote in opposition to the nominee  I would ask them to take a close look at Judge Roberts testimony at the commencement of the hearing     And I quote     I have no agenda  but I do have a commitment  If I am confirmed  I will confront every case with an open mind     I will fully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented    I will be open to the considered views of my colleagues on the bench  and I will decide every case based on the record  according to the rule of law  without fear or favor  to the best of my ability  and I will remember its my job to call balls and strikes  and not to pitch or bat     And so Mr  President  I must ultimately arrive at my decision based on a considered judgment as to whether this nominee has the qualifications  temperament and experience required of such high appointment  Does he have the requisite personal ethics and moral code to serve as our nations highest judicial officer     Mr  President  I have measured this nominee against this high bar for confirmation and find him qualified in every respect
