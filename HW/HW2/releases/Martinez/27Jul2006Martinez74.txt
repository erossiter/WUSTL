                               MARTINEZ  S  3711 PROTECTS FLORIDA AND HELPS NATION   July 27  2006   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  this afternoon made the following floor remarks on Senate bill 3711  the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  which would provide a zone of protection ensuring Floridas Gulf coast remains free from the threat of offshore drilling  Earlier today  Senators approved the motion to proceed to debating the issue 86 to 12  Senator Martinez voted in favor of the motion   This agreement provides unprecedented protection for the Gulf Coast of Florida  said Martinez  I fully support this bill because these are the best protection Florida is likely to achieve   The following is the complete text of Senator Martinezs remarks made during Senate debate   I want to express my strong support for s  3711  the Gulf of Mexico energy security act of 2006   This is an important and timely piece of legislation that deals with an issue that is very near and dear to Floridians  which is protecting our Gulf Coast from drilling  Protecting Florida s coastline is an issue of monumental concern to me and to my constituents and I want to commend Chairman Domenici and his staff  as well as Leader Frist and Senator Mitch McConnell for their hard work in forging a strong bipartisan compromise that allows just that  I should also thank the distinguished senator from Louisiana for her work in bringing this bill about    As Floridians know and many of my colleagues have learned over the past several months  our beaches are extremely important to our way of life  We value their unique and fragile ecosystem  Our state s special scenery and fragile environment brings millions from across the nation and the globe to enjoy our sugar sand beaches and world class angling and boating  I have spent a great amount of time since arriving in the United States Senate fighting to protect Florida s treasures from the threat of offshore drilling together with my colleague  Senator Nelson  as well as the members of the Florida delegation in the House of Representatives    Several different pieces of legislation have been introduced over the past year  in the House and the Senate  but the Florida delegation has found those extremely worrisome  The drilling battle has gotten fiercer and the stakes have gotten higher as the nation struggles to meet our energy demands in an increasingly uncertain world    Pressure continues to mount in Congress to develop federal deepwater resources in the outer continental shelf of the Gulf and because high oil and natural gas prices are not a Republican or a Democrat problem  but our nation s problem  there is a bipartisan majority that grows stronger each day behind the effort to open the Eastern Planning Zone of the Gulf of Mexico to more drilling    So our options are whether to be part of a solution  a real solution that provides concrete protections to our state  or watch our protections be beaten away year by year by those who don t share Florida s values  I chose to be part of a solution for Florida and for the United States Senate  I want to assure Floridians that Florida is protected under this bill  This legislation  which I was proud to help negotiate  will provide unprecedented protections for the Gulf Coast of Florida   This bill establishes in law a 235 mile buffer from Tampa and a minimum of 125 miles protection from the panhandle of Florida south through the year 2022  It provides over 300 miles of protection from Naples west and it protects our very important military mission line  The military mission line is important to Florida because we re also blessed in Florida to host a great number of military facilities and the very important facilities in the Florida Panhandle  the Pensacola Naval Air Station and others are facilities that rely on the Gulf of Mexico for training and for firing ranges  all of which will be incompatible with drilling    And any lease within 125 miles of the coast inside the no drill zone can be exchanged for new leases in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico  In addition  the critical stovepipe area located in extreme proximity to Pensacola will be protected from oil and gas exploration through the year 2022    These are historic protections that Floridians can count on for years to come  Mr  President  I d like to make clear that this is not an opening for negotiation  I am firmly committed to this deal  Anything else that extracts from the protections of our state are not laid out in this bill    this is it    To me  this compromise is a bridge to the future  It is my hope that by 2022  maybe long before then  we will have really developed a long term energy strategy to lessen our dependence on oil  It is that simple and something I feel very strongly about for our future  Just last year the Senate passed a large bipartisan energy policy act that doubled the amount of ethanol in our fuel mix to 7 5 billion gallons    The bill also included provisions that I supported that increased funding for sugar cane and cellulosic ethanol development as well as  50 million in loan guarantees to build alternative energy plants  We must buckle down and really advance the use of renewables and alternative sources of energy  We re only scratching the surface of our future potential and we shall not limit the potential of America s scientists to tackle this energy problem   However  we need a bridge to get to that future  S  3711 is a way to keep our industries and utilities running while we find new ways to power our cars  heat and cool our homes  and create our energy  America s energy    As important a priority as it is to Floridians that we protect our coast and our environment  we must be realistic about our own energy demands  It is a difficult thing and it has been a difficult thing  as I try to fight for Florida s environment  To stand here and say we want no new drilling  we want no drilling anywhere in the Gulf when Florida s size alone makes it one of the nation s largest consumers  And these consumers are Florida s families who are struggling to fill their cars and heat and cool their homes   These are struggling families who sit around the kitchen table to find the budget busted by yet ever increasing energy costs  The rising cost of fuel and the strains that this is placing on the pocketbook is dominating talk in America s families  In addition  we ve got to keep in mind how critical energy is to many of our industries that help drive the economies of our state  I have heard testimony from our nation s chemical  fertilizer and manufacturing industries that are vitally dependent on natural gas supplies in our nation    Unlike petroleum  which is traded globally  most of the natural gas market is traded on a regional basis and U S  natural gas prices are among the highest in the world  For example  Florida provides 75  of the phosphate fertilizers used by American farmers and growers every day  The Florida phosphate industry is one of the state s oldest and largest economic engines  accounting for more than 6 000 direct jobs  The Tampa Port Authority estimates that that industry has created more than 41 000 indirect jobs and  5 9 billion of economic impact in the Tampa Bay region alone    Prior to the significant increase in natural gas prices  the U S  nitrogen industry typically supplied approximately 85  of U S  farmers  nitrogen fertilizer needs  As a result of the continuing natural gas crisis  farmers have been forced to import more than 50  of the nitrogen fertilizers that they use  In total  at least 21 nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have closed since July of 1998  16 of those plants have closed permanently  Now  that represents a 25  drop in total U S  production capacity while five plants remain idle even today  S  3711 will provide over 5 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas for our imperiled industries  utilities  and also my constituents that are dealing with soaring heating and cooling bills  Mr  President  I would like to focus now on a series of concerns that have been raised regarding this bill  how it is different and  in my opinion  better than O C S  legislation recently passed in the House of Representatives    Let me also say that my colleagues in the Florida delegation worked tirelessly to find and obtain the best protection possible for our state under very difficult circumstances  Some have questioned the protections afforded to the buffer zone around Florida  The buffer zone provided by s  3711  in my opinion  is clearly preferable to any other one that has been offered as an alternative  This legislation ensures that the federal government will continue to have jurisdiction over the federal waters off each state s coast    We do not cede the responsibility of energy development  environmental protection or military preparedness to the desires of state legislatures  The buffer zone in the Gulf of Mexico is good through the year 2022 and also prohibits drilling in our critical military training areas  Some have asked why Florida s Atlantic coast is not included in this bill  and I would say quite simply that Florida s Atlantic coast has not been under relentless attack for the last year for those who want to drill  The Atlantic coast of Florida is still under a presidential withdrawal until 2012 as well as the entire eastern coast and western coast of the United States   This means that until the year 2012  the eastern coast of Florida is safe  Our compromise legislation in no way weakens the existing coastal protections  The house passed O C S  bill removes the entire presidential withdrawals off of every coast and forces state legislatures to pass legislation every five years to keep or extend those protections    Other coastal senators have raised their objection to s  3711 because they want to increase coastal buffer zones in their own states  This is a focused piece of legislation that deals only with the Gulf of Mexico  Adding additional protections to areas that frankly are not promising to the energy industry should not be an impediment to moving this compromise bill forward    To quote the old bank robber when asked why he robbed banks  he replied  Because that s where the moneys at  The area being opened for exploration is the most promising area for the industry and can be leased right away   During negotiations  I chose to focus on protecting the area of Florida under greatest pressure and I thank my colleagues  Senator Domenici  Leader Frist  and Senator McConnell for honoring my and Florida s environmental concerns    The last major concern that has been raised is objection to revenue sharing with Western Gulf states and targeted revenues to the state land and water conservation fund  It is perfectly fitting and appropriate that we share revenues with the states that produce our nation s energy and deal with the corresponding onshore repercussions    We in Florida do not want to participate in the development of this extensive oil and gas infrastructure but recognize that others in the Western Gulf pay the price to bring reliable energy to the country  We share 50 percent of revenues on public land within a state s boundary and it is fitting that we provide energy producing states with at least similar treatment  Sharing 37 5 percent of the new O C S  revenues will not bankrupt the nation nor increase the national debt  Currently  these areas off the coast are not being leased and are providing no revenue to the general treasury  keeping 100  of zero revenues is just that    nothing  Finally  for those concerned with funding the land and water conservation fund  S  3711 will provide a real boost for the program    The mandatory funding stream established under this bill does not replace appropriated funding and does nothing to disadvantage the program in the appropriations process  The president s budget request has been zeroed out the last two years for this program and under our compromise bill  the land and water conservation fund will provide up to  450 million or 12 5 percent of the revenues generated from the new leasing each year    This compromise was delicate and difficult to forge  Some argue more could have been done for Florida  Others protest that Florida s afforded far too many protections given that our state consumes nearly 20 million gallons of petroleum per day  High oil and natural gas prices are not a republican or democrat problem but they are our nation s problem  It is imperative that we pass the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act to provide Florida with the critical environmental protections it needs as well as bringing 1 25 billion barrels of oil and 5 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to keep our industries and nation afloat as we develop future and alternative sources of energy  Failure to act is not an option   I urge our colleagues to support this well crafted bipartisan measure                                                                July 2006 News Releases             Browse by
