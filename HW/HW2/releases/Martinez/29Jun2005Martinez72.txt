for several Florida agriculture projects included in the Fiscal Year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations Bill    This is a critical first step in funding for our states agricultural and conservation priorities  I look forward to securing these projects in the Appropriations Conference with the House in the near future  Martinez said    Approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee  the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill will now move to the floor for consideration    The Agriculture Appropriations Bill will help fund many of Floridas top agricultural projects  Floridas farmers need the resources to be able to complete efficient research  protect crops from devastating diseases and to ultimately improve our states economy   After the unprecedented hurricane season in 2005  Floridas agricultural industry took a hit  and funding these important projects will help the Sunshine State to recover    Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services  FDACS  Citrus Canker Eradication   40 000 000  The allotted  40 million will continue to subsidize the eradication program for citrus canker  Prior to the landfall of Hurricane Charley  FDACS was eradicating citrus canker in Southeast Florida with an anticipated completion date of December 31  2005    However  survey results show the three hurricanes that struck the citrus producing areas in Florida in August and September have caused significant spread of citrus canker The FDACS has launched an aggressive attack on the outbreaks related to the hurricanes    While state and federal officials are confident that the goal of eradication of citrus canker from Florida can be achieved  it is clear that additional resources to conduct survey  control and regulatory activities are necessary and will be well used    University of Central Florida  UCF  Citrus Chloroplast Genomics and Genetic Engineering   700 000  The Citrus Chloroplast Genomics and Genetic Engineering project will allow for research and design of a new procedure whereby scientists and farmers collaborate to develop new methods of creating canker resistant cells  This approach has been developed and advanced in UCF laboratories to confer desired agronomic traits or express human therapeutic proteins    State of Florida Citrus Canker Research   494 000  This will provide funds to the state for the continuation of vital citrus canker research to improve technologies for treatment and detection  methods of movement and containment  and means to control and eliminate this devastating citrus disease   Southeast Climate Consortium  SECC  Risk Reduction for Agricultural Crops   3 602 000  The Southeast Climate Consortium  SECC  has been at the forefront of climate prediction work    The SECC has worked throughout the Southeastern US with support from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  and United States Department of Agriculture  USDA   developing new methods of predicting the consequences of climate variability for agricultural crops  forests  and water resources    More recently  these methods have been applied to the problems that farmers raising specialty crops face relative to rainfall  temperature and assessing the risk of wild fires  The new tasks for FY06 will be to develop drought forecasting methods to help farmers and producers plan for reducing risks of economic losses  develop best management practices that incorporate climate forecasts to give farmers options for compliance with water quality standards  and investigate the possible applications of using climate forecasts to guide disaster preparedness  such as for hurricanes    Floriculture  Nursery Research Initiative   6 000 000  The Floriculture  Nursery Research Initiative represents a strong and cost effective cooperation between industry  scientists  and existing Florida university centers of excellence  including University of Florida  with the experience and research needs of the floral and nursery industry  Floral and nursery crops represent the third largest U S  crop in value  but receive much a smaller proportion of USDA research funding    The Initiative will target more funds toward the industry s needs including research on critical issues like  imported foreign pests and diseases  reduced chemical use  reducing runoff and other environmental management  improved pest and disease management for specific diseases impacting the industry s growers  genetic improvement  and virus identification     Florida Citrus Mutual Diaprepes Research   446 000  There are currently no adequate control measures for this pest  The research will be done at University of Florida   The Diaprepes Root Weevil is considered a severe threat to citrus growers in both Florida and Texas causing an estimated annual impact of over  75 million  Diaprepes causes extensive losses to citrus trees where it has infected over 150 000 acres in Florida is now established in Texas and also inflicts damage to nursery products  cotton  sugar cane and vegetables    Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Lake Okeechobee Watershed Planning   350 000  To allow for additional conservation projects that would ensure the longevity of our states environment  approximately 500 000 acres of agricultural lands will be designated within basins adjacent to Lake Okeechobee for accelerated conservation planning  And  82 comprehensive conservation plans are being developed for these lands    Broward County Rabies Vaccine Program   50 000  Funds will be used to bait approximately 423 square miles of rabies alert area to create a line of defense against the spread of rabies in South Florida  Without this program  rabies from wildlife will continue to increase and spread further into Broward County exposing the public to this deadly disease                                                                   June 2005 News Releases             Browse by
