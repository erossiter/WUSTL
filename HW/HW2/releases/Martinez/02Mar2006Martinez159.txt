                               MARTINEZ OPENING STATEMENT AT BANKING COMMITTEE HEARING United States Senate Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs  March 2  2006   Good Morning  Todays hearing could not be more timely or important and I want to thank Chairman Shelby for scheduling this so quickly  Like many of my colleagues here  I publicly stated my concerns soon after learning that that Dubai Ports World was approved to purchase the London based Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company  giving control of terminal operations at six of our American ports  including one in Miami  Florida  to a company owned by the Dubai Government    As we go forward with this debate  we should be mindful that this decision was not made by one person alone  but by a group of 12 government agencies including the State Department  the Treasury  Defense  Homeland Security  and Commerce Departments  the USTR  OMB and several others  As a former Cabinet Secretary in this Administration  I have great confidence in the Presidents dedication to keeping our nation secure and his commitment to fighting the war on terror at every level  I further trust that this Administration would not purposefully make decisions or endorse foreign investments that would jeopardize the security of our nation   There have been few issues in Washington that have aroused the emotional response that this  6 8 billion acquisition has  And I dont believe that this response is unwarranted  as it has been said  members of the United Arab Emirates have had ties to terrorism in the past and it is appropriate and necessary to debate their management of American ports  However  the UAE made a concerted effort against terrorism after the horrific attacks against our nation in September 2001  and the UAE is now considered an important partner and ally in the war on terror and we rely on them for strategic access to the Middle East    I believe that the most important guiding principal that we should focus on as we examine the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and whether or not Congress should play a role in the review and approval of international corporate business deals  is that we try to remain objective with a focus on good policy and national security   I have several questions and concerns that I hope are addressed during your testimony  I hope to walk away from this hearing with a clear understanding of what this takeover means for our port operations and be assured that in no way will Dubai Ports World be responsible for port security  I am interested in hearing more about the actual agreement  including details of security screening at port facilities in Dubai  tightening security along POs global supply chain and what access U S  officials will have to Dubai Port Worlds records and background information on employees and managers and be assured that this will be available without subpoena  I would also like to know the details on the financing of this acquisition  including who the principal investors are and whether or not there will be other states investing or involved in the deal   When Congress approved the Exon Florio provision of the Defense Production Act in 1988  it set guidelines for the process CFIUS is to follow when considering blocking an application for a foreign acquisition  merger or takeovers  It was at this time that Congress decided that a committee with representation from various government departments would be best suited to investigate foreign investment in the United States and review all applications with a broad spectrum of national securities interests in mind  In your testimony  I would like to hear more about the process through which CFIUS came to its conclusion to approve this acquisition  I also want to hear from those members of CFIUS who are not here today   Ensuring our homeland security is the top priority for all of us here  it would not be in the U S  Governments interest to sign off on a deal that would be detrimental to the progress weve made in fighting the war on terror  I am appreciative of the 45 day extension that Dubai Ports World and the President agreed to and I hope we use this time effectively to review the CFIUS process to determine whether or not there is a real security threat to U S  ports resulting from this deal   Thank you  I look forward to the panel                                                                 March 2006 News Releases             Browse by
