                                                                                                                                                                 Filter by                                                              SPEECH  SENATOR S SPEECH AT CUBA LIBERTY COUNCIL GALA   February 25  2005   It is an honor to be here with you tonight  and I want to thank Luis for his kind invitation and for all of his hard work on behalf of Cuba and the Cuban liberty council for the great honor tonight  I want to begin by thanking everyone here for your steadfast support of me in my race for the United States Senate   I am truly honored and humbled to be serving you all as your Senator and representing the great state of Florida in our nation   s capitol  And I mean this so sincerely when I say  I couldn   t have done this without you    Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your great faith in me and for your support    I want to tell you a story as it was told to me recently by Congresswoman Sue Kelly of New York   She was visiting a grade school in her district  and a little Hispanic boy came up to her and very proudly said     you know  we have our very own Senator now          referring to me or my colleague Ken Salazar  I   m not quite sure which    But  I   ve been so touched by that story  It represents the magnitude of responsibility I feel in representing not only our Cuban American community and the great state of Florida  but in a way  the entire Hispanic American community in our country        And we have a new milestone to celebrate    Judge Alberto Gonzales was sworn in last week as our Attorney General  General Gonzales is the first Hispanic American to ever serve in one of the four really elite Cabinet posts in government     Defense  Treasury  State and Attorney General   He is an inspiration for our next generation  In America  all things are possible  And of course  the second Cuban American in the Cabinet took office     Secretary Carlos Gutierrez at the Department of Commerce  So I just want to give you a sense of what I think about when I reflect on how far we   ve come here in the U S  since our parents or grandparents     or ourselves     came to find our American Dream here in the United States  Now back to Cuba  The issue of Cuba has always been one of importance     not just to Cuban Americans  but to the security of the United States and the region    From time to time  the irresponsible acts of the Cuban government remind us that this is far more than about the freedom of one country  but it really is about the stability and security of the region and the national security interests of the United States   There have been two events that have really struck me in the last couple of months  One was the second Inauguration of President Bush      I was sitting on the platform listening to what I think was an Inaugural address that history will record as truly great  and I was moved by what I heard     All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know  the United States will not ignore your oppression  or excuse your oppressors   When you stand for your liberty  we will stand with you      To me  the President was directly speaking to the people of Cuba  and his commitment extends directly to them   This Administration is serious about standing with the Cuban people   We will not ignore their continued oppression  We will not excuse their brutal oppressors    Another inspiring moment for me   and I suspect for many here     was the Iraqi elections  The scenes of celebration in the streets  the stories of families waking up at dawn and putting on their finest clothes to go to the polling stations to cast their vote  The old man who could barely walk who was determined he would walk and cast his vote   A day of great hope  of great celebration  pride and strength for the Iraqi people  All I could think about was Cuba  When would it be Cuba   s turn  I know it will come        and we will be ready for that great day   But in the meantime  I want to talk about how we hasten that moment and prepare here and there for such a day  In the past there has been too much talk in Washington about the embargo without putting it in the context of a broader Cuba policy   Thanks to the recommendations of the Cuba Commission that were embraced by President Bush this past May  we are now all talking about a broader Cuba policy  and a commitment to the liberation of Cuba   We really owe a great debt of gratitude to this President for  his unwavering commitment to freedom    To me when we talk about Cuba it should be about human rights    the complete lack of human rights available to the Cuban people under the tyranny of an oppressive regime   When there is talk of trade with Cuba I ask   How can Americans as the freest people on earth support a regime that denies its people their most basic human rights   I have a job to do in the senate to persuade my colleagues to join in the fight for Cuba   s cause   We need to be sharing the individual human stories and personal struggles   As I talk with my colleagues about Cuba  I have been talking about the individual human component  the individual human costs    Just this week I received a letter from one such person     Elsa Morejon     wife of Dr  Oscar Elias Biscet Gonzalez  and her letter in part said     Estimado mel  mi esposo el Dr  Biscet me ha pedido te envie este mensaje que de antemano me honra  no solo te abraza hoy un hombre desde su cautiverio  te abraza un amiog  un cubano que ama la libertad  la justicia y la causa de los derechos humanos  estoy convencida que este abrazo lo recibiras en nombre de todos los hombres y mujeres que dentro y fuera de cuba hemos confiado en tu entereza y en la grandeza de tu corazon para con los cubanos que sufren  anhelan y desean vivir en libertad     Dear Mel   My husband  Dr  Biscet  has asked me to send this message to you and I feel honored to so  He embraces you from his cell as a friend and as a Cuban who loves freedom  justice and human rights  I hope that you receive this embrace in the name of all the men and women in Cuba and abroad who believe in your integrity and  the feelings in your heart for all the Cubans who suffer  hope and wish to live in freedom    So I want to bring my senate colleagues stories about the courageous efforts of individuals like Dr  Oscar Elias Biscet     an Afro Cuba physician civil rights activist  As many of you know  Dr  Biscet was unjustly sentenced on April 7  2003  along with 75 other peaceful dissidents  in a summary trial under Article 91 of the Cuban constitution    The article states that he violated the sovereignty and integrity of the Cuban state     whatever that means     As many of us also know  his actual crimes were publicly opposing crimes in the hospital he and his wife worked in    Mainly  that he did not want to perform abortions as part of his duties at the hospital  And he also publicly opposed the death penalty   For standing up for his principles    for basic human rights    that is why Dr  Biscet is imprisoned   Dr  Biscet is merely one of many human rights activist who have served time in Cuban prisons for protesting an oppressive regime   He continues his work as president of the Lawton foundation for human rights  The plight of these individuals is the exact reason why our battle cry and common fight needs to be for universal human rights   For the basic rights of the Cuban people   For the immediate release of Dr  Oscar Elias Biscet and other unjustly imprisoned dissidents    We need to seek and build partnership     on issues we can all agree on     human rights  human freedom     and the release of political prisoners    In the Senate  I am forming a Human Rights Caucus to   reach out to folks who may be on different sides of the trade issue and work with them on a constructive basis to make sure they understand the enormity of human rights violations being experienced by the Cuban people Last week  a bipartisan group of members including Senators Baucus  Craig and Lugar introduced a bill to loosen the agricultural trade restrictions to allow more sales to Cuba  They said that it had absolutely nothing to do with human rights abuses   For example  this legislation would allow Cuban inspectors to come into the United States to examine corn and potatoes    Why not push to have our diplomats be allowed to inspect something much more important     the rights of human beings   U S  diplomats in Cuba are denied free access of movement the island  It   s completely unfathomable to me that Cuban inspectors could come to the U S  to check our potatoes  but U S  officials are unable to check on the health and well being of Cuban dissidents    it just makes no sense  Loosening the agricultural restrictions would have one result    To give the Cuban government a new source of income with which to oppress its people and suppress their human rights    How can we reward the oppressors for that   In addition to the Human Rights Caucus  I am also looking at introducing a bill that would focus exclusively on the implementation of the Cuba Commission recommendations related to human rights    a first step to ensure all points in the report are implemented  And  I don   t think we can have a conversation about human rights in Cuba without talking about the great job James Cason is doing as Chief of mission at the U S  Interests Section   He has really helped to embolden the Cuban people  On November 2  for example Cason held a    mock election    at his residence in Havana and 180 Cubans participated   I am proud to tell you that George Bush won overwhelmingly  And I am also proud to tell you that everyone stayed until three in the morning  so they must have had a great time  And just maybe they were up late following a very close Florida Senate race       James Cason has really mobilized the mission   s role in Cuba  and reached out directly to the Cuban people in such simple  but such powerful ways   Relatedly  we need to be supporting the dissident community as much as possible in Cuba  Strong outreach to the dissident community is a critical component of the President   s Cuba commission recommendations      We need to provide encouragement and assistance so that budding groups can continue to thrive  understanding that they operate under tremendous and difficult circumstances   I am very pleased with President   s commitment to Cuba in his FY06 budget request   His request includes  15 million in FY06 for the Economic Support Fund for implementation of the Cuba Commission recommendations   Equally as important  we must keep the Cuban government from shutting their people off from information  I was pleased to hear my friend  Secretary Condoleeza Rice   s continued strong commitment and support for Radio and TV Marti during her recent testimony at the Foreign Relations Committee   The President   s budget request contains a request for  37 7 million to support Radio TV Marti as well as new aerial transmission capabilities   This is first year Cuba receives a separate line item in the budget request  which shows to me the administration is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to fostering democracy in Cuba   To directly quote Secretary Rice       the day that the people of Cuba are finally free is going to be a great one for the Western Hemisphere  and the commission recommendations were intended to try and hasten that day and also to try and prepare the ground for a peaceful transition   And it   s an important goal  and you can be certain that we   ll pay extremely close attention to it      This is the perfect message to receive from our new Secretary of State and reinforces what has already been a strong commitment from this Administration to a free Cuba  U S  foreign policy needs a greater focus on the hemisphere   We should all be very concerned about the trends taking place in many countries in Latin America  An area of deep concern is the dangerous relationship between Cuba and Venezuela  Castro is providing the technical assistance  the know how and the manpower  in return  Chavez is providing the oil  the money and a sizeable population   We are seeing a    Cubanization    of Venezuela     Chavez is increasingly following the Cuba playbook  and this is sad for the Venezuelan people and a destabilizing and dangerous force in the region  We are looking at the potential for a renewed arms race in this hemisphere  So for very selfish reasons     human interests aside     we need to take notice of the greater Latin American region and be very concerned about the happenings there  We need a new Latin American policy that is bold     different    We need to focus on building civil society  focus on the lack of infrastructure   We need look at ways to foster economic opportunity    There needs to be a more comprehensive economic vision in the region   We need to focus on empowering individuals in their own lives  using tools like microlending     that will improve the quality of life of individuals and families  Through my membership on the Foreign Relations Committee  I am hopeful that I will be able to advance these ideas and goals both about human rights in Cuba  and the need for a stronger  clearer Latin American policy   We need to generate a greater awareness and understanding about the region both in the halls of Congress and with the American people  We are at a time of great opportunity  The President has been very firm about the need to promote freedom and democracy around the world in order to ensure our own national security   where better to start than in our own backyard   I look forward to spreading the message of freedom  opportunity and human rights for all of Latin America to my colleagues in the Senate and to the Administration    We can make a difference                                                              February 2005 News Releases             Browse by                                              Current record
