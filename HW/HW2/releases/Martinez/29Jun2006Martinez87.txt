priority projects for Floridas agricultural community are moving forward in the U S  Senate  Martinez said the fiscal year  FY  2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee contains more than  63 million specifically for Florida priorities   This bill contains a number of priority projects for Florida  I applaud the work of the committee and I look forward to seeing the interests of Floridas agriculture industry advance  said Martinez   The bill could be brought up for consideration by the full Senate in July   FY 2007 Agriculture Appropriations Highlights  Citrus Health Response Plan  APHIS  Emerging Plant Pests Senate Allocation   37 371 000 After two unprecedented  devastating hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005  APHIS determined in January 2006 that eradicating citrus canker from Florida is no longer feasible  As a result  APHIS downgraded the program goal from eradication to management  The presence of citrus greening in the state is another threat to the industrys viability  In light of these developments  APHIS has terminated the canker eradication program and instead is instituting a Citrus Health Response Plan  CHRP   This holistic approach affords the Florida Citrus industry the best chance of protection from citrus pests and diseases of regulatory significance  The CHRP will provide a regulatory framework that identifies minimum production standards to enhance the industrys ability to produce fruit suitable for trade  protect the integrity of the citrus nursery certification program  and provide a mechanism by which citrus pests and diseases do not spread to other citrus producing states    Specialty Crop Block Grant Agriculture Marketing Service Senate Allocation   10 000 000 The Specialty Crop Block Grant  authorized in P L  108 465  the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act  will promote investment in marketing and research strategies that will enable U S  specialty crop  non subsidized  producers to remain competitive in global markets  The block grants are provided to the state departments of agriculture in the 50 states to support specialty crop research  promotion  foreign market access  food safety and inspection and other programs which enhance the competitiveness and ensure the continued viability of these producers  A state s allocation is based upon it share of the value of specialty crop production nationwide  Florida ranks just behind California and would therefore be eligible for a large amount of this funding   The block grant provides the funding and flexibility needed to provide resources to Florida growers who are struggling to remain viable after 9 hurricanes in 15 months  The block grant will be used to fund research critical to our specialty crops continued viability as well as for marketing and promotion campaigns  The last two years  the marketing efforts were an important component of agricultural operations ability to move their products since many missed market windows due to delayed and or reduced harvests    Tropical Subtropical Agricultural Research  CSREES Senate Allocation   9 453 000 The Tropical Subtropical Agricultural Research  T STAR  program  is authorized by P L  89 106 to enhance research  education and regulatory programs for interdiction  eradication and suppression of exotic plants  animals  insects and disease while conserving the natural environment  T STAR is a partnership of the USDA and American universities in the tropics and is administered by the University of Florida and the University of Hawaii  Florida and Hawaii are both important agricultural states and possess unique subtropical and tropical environments and are prime locations for exotic pest introductions into the U S  from South America  Asia  Australia and Africa  Over the past 20 years  an average of more than one insect per month has successfully established in Florida  Nearly one third of all plants growing in Florida are non native   There is an urgent need to identify the exotic pests in other countries with which the United States maintains frequent and extensive travel and trade in order 1  to determine common avenues of introduction  2  to develop techniques for early detection  and 3  to find effective and environmentally acceptable methods for eradication and containment  The growing threat from foot and mouth disease  Formosan termites  fire ants and a host of other potentially devastating invasions  is heightened by the potential for terrorist induced attacks on the nations food supply   Risk Reduction for Agriculture Crops  CSREES  Senate Allocation   3 566 000 The Southeast Climate Consortium  SECC   which consists of Florida State University  the University of Florida  the University of Miami  the University of Georgia  Auburn University  and the University of Alabama at Huntsville  has been at the forefront of climate prediction work  The SECC has worked throughout the Southeastern US with support from NOAA and USDA  developing new methods of predicting the consequences of climate variability for agricultural crops  forests  and water resources  The new tasks for FY07 are to develop flood forecasting methods to help farmers and producers plan for reducing risks of economic losses and environmental damage  to develop partnerships and methods for incorporating climate forecasts and other climate information into agricultural and water policy decisions   Mote Marine Laboratory Aquaculture Research CSREES Research and Education Activities Senate Allocation   594 000 This project is developing sustainable production technologies marine fish aquaculture using land based recirculating systems  The technologies developed will expand marine fish farming in the U S   provide diversification opportunities for existing agriculture and aquaculture producers  and produce high quality seafood for U S  markets    U S  Horticulture Research Laboratory  USHRL   Ft  Pierce ARS Senate Allocation   500 000 Federal funding would be used to provide and support additional researchers at the USHRL laboratory in Ft  Pierce that will focus on pests that directly impact the fruit  vegetable  and ornamental industries  These researchers would focus primarily on citrus canker and citrus greening and is supported by the Florida fruit and vegetable industry and will great assist nursery and landscaping operations to manage exotic plants and pests    Citrus Canker Greening Research  CSREES  Senate Allocation   495 000 This request is for the continuation of vital citrus canker research by the University of Florida IFAS  through the  CSREES   to improve technologies for treatment and detection  methods of movement and containment  and means to control and eliminate this devastating citrus disease  In 2005  USDA APHIS detected citrus greening in Florida  USDA APHIS and ARS are working in conjunction with Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Plant Industry  FDACS DPI   and UF IFAS to develop a joint citrus health production plan for an interim period  while the scientific community works to find disease resistance or a cure for these diseases  Research efforts will include management of citrus canker and greening to minimize tree mortality and yield loss in a cost effective manner  as well as the economic implications of these diseases in world citrus markets  This joint  coordinated research is not only imperative to Florida citrus  but also important to all U S  citrus production    Lake Okeechobee Conservation Planning Initiative  Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services  Natural Resource Conservation Service  Conservation Operations Senate Allocation   347 000 Since the beginning of this intensive planning initiative  nearly  1 43 million in federal funding has resulted in accelerated conservation planning for over 900 000 acres of agricultural lands within the Lake Okeechobee basin and or tributaries  165 plans are complete or very near completion  Best management practices  BMPs  have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented on over 200 000 acres  These plans are being developed by NRCS certified Technical Service Providers that have been trained and deployed in the Lake Okeechobee watershed  By expediting the delivery of conservation services  agricultural landowners will be able to implement conservation practices sooner  helping to restore the health of the ecosystem    Grapefruit Drug Interaction CSREES Senate Allocation   341 000 The Center for Food Drug Interaction Research and Education  University of Florida  Florida Department of Citrus  and Tufts University  will continue to research  examine and attain more precise data on the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on the absorption of certain medications while at the same time sharing the data and information with consumers   Biofuels from Biomass  Agriculture Research Service  Federal Administration  Senate Allocation   300 000 This problem is the major cost factor for ethanol production from cellulosic biomass that has limited the commercial development of this technology  The University of Central Florida proposes development of alternative sources for cell wall processing enzymes and improved technologies for economical expression of these proteins which would greatly facilitate the development of this industry   Broward County Oral Rabies Program APHIS Senate Allocation   100 000 Funds will be used to bait approximately 423 square miles of rabies alert area to create a line of defense against the spread of rabies in South Florida  Without this program  rabies from wildlife will continue to increase and spread further exposing the public to this deadly disease  The FY 2006 Agriculture  Rural Development  and Related Agencies Appropriation bill committee report included language supporting Broward Countys rabies program and urged that it be funded
