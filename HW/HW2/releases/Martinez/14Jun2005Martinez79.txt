                               MARTINEZ  FIGHTS TO PROTECT FLORIDA S COASTS FROM OFFSHORE DRILLING  June 14  2005    WASHINGTON  DC     During today   s Senate floor debate on the energy bill  U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  said Floridians were united in their opposition to drilling off their coasts      Martinez said        Mr  President  today I rise to address an issue that is of great concern to the people of my state and that is the proposed development of offshore energy resources in the Eastern Planning Zone of the Gulf of Mexico  As my colleagues are well aware  in this bill is an inventory amendment that I will work to strike  There are also efforts to attach additional language to the energy bill that I think would be a poison pill and counter to what this bill is all about     namely conservation  new technologies  and jobs        And before I go further  let me take a moment to compliment the chairman of the committee  Senator Domenici  and the ranking member of the committee  Senator Bingaman  for the fine work they have done in crafting a bipartisan  comprehensive  and significant package that diversifies America   s energy supply  increases conservation and production and employs innovative technologies to meet America   s energy needs  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for allowing me to be a part of this process and this legislation  As the chairman himself has said  this bill will make a real difference in America   s energy landscape         I look forward to voting for this bill if we can address some areas that are critical to my state   s future     environmentally  economically  and militarily         Mr  President  in the energy bill that we are considering there is a provision that requires an inventory of oil and natural gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf  I opposed this amendment in committee because it begins something we in Florida do not want  it starts something that we in the United States do not need  and it opens the door to a number of problems     environmental problems  economic problems  and unnecessary challenges for our military         Mr  President  why would we inventory an area we are never going to drill         The inventory language that   s in the Energy bill is a huge problem for Florida    It tantalizes pro drilling interests  Allowing an inventory is like saying to pro drilling states     Come and get it     Mr  President  I have received assurances from my friends on the other side of this issue that states like Florida     states that do not want drilling     will not have to take it  Fine  That   s Florida   s position         I can clearly state that we do not want drilling now and I do not see a scenario anywhere on the horizon where we would change that position  So why  Mr  President  given our objection to drilling  would we spend the resources and damage the environment in the Eastern Planning Zone to do this inventory  An inventory is not a benign thing  It involves detonating explosives  enough to shake the crust of the earth  We shake the earth  listen to what comes back  and in the meantime destroy fragile sea life         And  just briefly  if you look at the cost of this inventory     people at the Minerals Management Service tell me that to use the most up to date technology to perform any inventory of this magnitude  the cost estimate would run between  75 and  125 million for each frontier planning area  Nowhere in this legislation can I find a section that suggestions how we recoup the cost of such an inventory        So I look forward to working with Senator Domenici and my colleagues to find a solution to this question of the inventory     something that would preserve the inventory option for states that want it  and let states like Florida remain unaffected        But worse than the inventory are what are being called the    Coastal Killer    amendments         We don   t know when these amendments will be offered     if they   re offered     but the language of these proposals first came up in committee     eventually withdrawn     and the nature of these amendments could be so devastating to Florida that I think they ought to be addressed here today     and that these amendments should be explained and  I am here to argue  these amendments must be rejected        The amendments aim at three things  drawing brand new  unprecedented boundaries for each state  allowing states to opt out of the moratorium  and creating huge incentives for states to opt out of the federal moratorium  If these amendments were to become law  that buffer zone shrinks to just 21 miles     well below what it is today  Let me be clear  twenty one miles Mr  President is no buffer zone and it is of no comfort to Floridians        If we open additional drilling in the Eastern Planning Zone  it will damage the fragile ecosystem  it will damage Florida   s economy  it will pull the rug out from under the military that has made the commitment  made the investments  and moved a majority of their training operations from Vieques  to the clear coastal waters of Florida         Mr  President  to say that these Coastal Killer amendments are giving states the freedom to choose is ignoring the fact that Florida would be losing its choice  We will stay in the moratorium but if Alabama opts out  you bring drilling to Florida   s shores     whether we like it or not         It   s this aggressive effort to wade into what has traditionally been Florida   s buffer zone that has drawn opposition  The Eastern Planning Zone must not be opened to this patchwork plan of drilling for gold         For those who don   t know the location of the Eastern Planning Zone in the Gulf of Mexico  let me show you  Here is the Eastern Planning Zone  Over here you have all the active leases in the Gulf  Note that this available portion of the Gulf is literally tapped out    Oil and gas companies are now looking at this portion of the map     Florida   s coastal area     and thinking to themselves        Let   s open that area     My colleagues  the answer from Florida is unequivocally no         Last year more than 74 million people visited Florida to enjoy its pristine coastline and wonderful climate   Families return  year after year  to their favorite vacation spots to relax under our brilliant blue skies  powdery white beaches  and crystal clear emerald waters          The people of Florida share a love and appreciation of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico  its coastal habitat  and our wetlands which make it a very complex ecosystem  and a very special place to live         I share these facts  for one reason  the people of Florida are concerned that their coastal waters are coming under increased pressure to exploit its possible oil and gas resources  The people of Florida do not want that to happen          Floridians are adamantly opposed to oil and gas exploration off our coastal waters     We have serious concerns that offshore drilling will increase the threat of potential oil spills  seriously damaging and threatening marine wildlife and their coastal habitat         In addition  Floridians are extremely concerned that drilling operations would produce massive amounts of waste mud and drill cuttings that would be generated and then sent untreated into the surrounding waters          Mr  President  of the 74 million people that visited the Sunshine State in 2004  to enjoy its beautiful beaches  exciting amusement parks  and wonderfully abundant wildlife and natural splendor  I dare say not a one of those people came to Florida without spending some of their hard earned dollars          Here   s what tourism means to Florida  840 000 people directly employed in the industry and an economic impact of  46 7 billion to our state   s economy   If the unforeseeable happens  whether it   s a hurricane  an industrial accident  an intentional act     what have you  and our coastlines become soaked with oil     there is no amount of relief aid that can clean up the economic disaster  Entire communities would be devastated         At the end of the day  what I   d like to see if for us to codify in law positions that are supported by me  the senior senator from Florida  Bill Nelson  and its citizens         Our view is that we must prevent any further encroachment into Florida   s waters and coastline  This is necessary to protect our tourism industry and the pristine beaches and coastal areas that would be ruined if an unfortunate oil spill or disaster took place        Mr  President     perhaps one of the most compelling arguments entails what drilling in our area of the Eastern Planning Zone would mean to national security        We cannot ignore the fact that lifting Florida   s protections will put our military at a training disadvantage  Let me repeat   lifting Florida   s protections will put our military at a training disadvantage         Let me highlight just some of the military operations that use this platform free zone for training        We have to allow our military to continue training for battle preparedness  Our young men and women deserve the best training we can afford  Vieques gave them that capability  Now that Vieques is closed  Florida   s Panhandle plays an increasingly significant role  Oil and gas operations must not be allowed to impede on that training        Keep in mind  drilling in Florida   s part of the Gulf is not a new argument  This is something that has been attempted for some time  Here is what Major General Michael Kostelnik  the Base Commander of Eglin Air Force Base said in May of 2000        We continue to place the most severe restrictions in the eastern portion of the proposed sale area where oil and gas operations would be incompatible with military training and testing operations           If we allow drilling there now  the military will be set back in their training  their preparedness  and moved back to square one in trying to find an area suitable for this kind of massive military joint operation        Let me reiterate that this is a question of national security  For that reason alone we ought to reject any and all attempts to open up those waters        Before I close  I want to take a moment to discuss how we arrived at the position we find ourselves in today         My good friend from Louisiana  Senator Landrieu  has stated publicly that she wants to be very respectful of states that do not want drilling off their coasts  I appreciate that sentiment and I feel the same respect for the rights and privileges of the various states  In fact  that   s why we are here today         An inventory and the coastal killer amendments will weaken Florida   s protections  Under these amendments  the will of the people of Florida     which is to keep drilling far away from our shores     will be thwarted  Senator Landrieu says she also wants to leave an option open for states that might want to drill off their shore  There is much work to do  but we must work to solve our nation   s energy problems without looking to Florida   s coasts  They are not open for consideration        As many of my colleagues know  Senator Nelson and I working together to engage a coalition of senators to help beat back any efforts to encroach upon our coastal waters  I am proud to say that in doing so I follow in the footsteps of former senators Connie Mack and Bob Graham  and a bipartisan Florida congressional delegation in our firm opposition to drilling off Florida   s coasts         Before I conclude  let me again praise Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman for putting together comprehensive  bipartisan  and significant energy policy that is forward looking  forward thinking  and a roadmap for where we as a Nation need to go in order to address the challenges that confront us today
