announced Senate passage of over  39 million in agricultural project funding for Florida  Included in the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 is  36 6 million for Citrus Canker Eradication  The measure has now passed both the House and the Senate and will be sent to the president for signature  This funding is critical to Floridas agricultural industry  said Senator Martinez  Floridas economy relies heavily on agriculture and I am pleased that these programs will receive the money they need in order to research and provide progress for Floridas farmers  In addition to funding agricultural projects in Florida  the bill contains  28 3 million in funds for prevention  control and eradication of avian influenza  Avian influenza is a public health concern that we cannot ignore  said Martinez  These funds are part of a comprehensive federal effort to ensure that we have a seamless network of protection for everyone in our country  The report also announced that the USDA intends to release an interim report on a feasibility study on converting sugar into ethanol by December 15  2005    I am pleased the final bill includes supportive language for the timely completion of USDAs study on the conversion of sugarcane into ethanol  said Martinez  This feasibility study is critical in providing guidance to Floridas sugarcane farmers for converting excess sugar into alternative fuels  said Martinez  Currently the U S  imports nearly 60 percent of its fuel from foreign countries  we need to continue to develop alternative fuels to make our country more energy independent    During the CAFTA debate last summer  Senator Martinez met with USDA Secretary Mike Johanns and U S  Trade Representative Bob Portman and received assurances that USDA would conduct a feasibility study for the conversion of sugarcane into sucrose ethanol  The Conferees urged USDA to complete the feasibility study by July 1  2006 and issue an interim report to Congress by December 15  2005        Highlighted Florida Projects included in the FY 2006 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report   FL Department of Ag and Consumer Services Citrus Canker Eradication   Allocation   36 629 000 The allotted  36 6 million will continue to supplement the eradication program for citrus canker  Prior to the landfall of Hurricane Charley  FDACS was eradicating citrus canker in Southeast Florida   Survey results show the three hurricanes that struck the citrus producing areas in Florida in August and September have caused significant spread of citrus canker The FDACS has launched an aggressive attack on the outbreaks related to the hurricanes   While state and federal officials are confident that the goal of eradication of citrus canker from Florida can be achieved  it is clear that additional federal resources to conduct surveys and to control regulatory activities are necessary and will be well used    Broward County Rabies Vaccine Program Allocation   23 58 million for Rabies Vaccination nationally An exact figure is unknown for Broward County yet language in the report notes that the Broward County program will be adequately funded  Funds will be used to bait approximately 423 square miles of rabies alert area to create a line of defense against the spread of rabies in South Florida  Without this program  rabies from wildlife will continue to increase and spread further into Broward County exposing the public to this deadly disease    Mote Marine Laboratory Inland Recirculation Marine Aquaculture CSREES Administrative Programs Allocation   300 000 Seafood imports currently represent the number two trade deficit in the country  Many wild fisheries are being fished beyond their ability to recover and others have been closed  Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota  Hubbs SeaWorld Research Institute  CA  and the University of Texas at Austin are seeking USDA funding to address the U S  trade deficit in seafood imports  meet consumer needs and foster domestic economic development through the establishment of a simple  reliable low cost production system to farm new species of high value marine fish in recirculating  economically feasible and environmentally sound systems   University of Central FL Citrus Chloroplast Genomics and Genetic Engineering ARS Federal Administration Allocation   80 000 Funding will be used by UCG to continue their studies of chloroplast genome research  This approach has been developed and advanced in UCF laboratories and further research could lead to breakthroughs in the prevention of diseases and pest infestation of citrus trees The lack of chloroplast genome information is one among the major limitations for agriscientits  only six published crop chloroplast genomes are now available  although 200 non crop genomes have been sequenced or are in progress     FL Department of Citrus Grapefruit Juice Drug Interaction Research USDA ARS Allocation   80 000 The Center for Food Drug Interaction Research and Education  University of Florida  Florida Department of Citrus  and Tufts University  as well as USDA ARS  will continue to research  examine and attain more precise data on the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on the absorption of certain medications   Manatee Agricultural Reuse System  MARS   Florida West Coast RC  D NRCS Operations Allocation   2 million The project provides matching federal funding to bring alternative water resources to area farms for supplemental irrigation to offset increased withdrawals from the Floridan aquifer as a measure to relieve the most impacted area of the Southern Water Use Caution Area as declared by the Southwest Florida Water Management District  Funding for this project is directed to the USDA NRCS through a cooperative agreement with the Florida West Coast RCD  This received  2 million in FY 2005   FL Department of Ag and Consumer Services Lake Okeechobee Watershed Planning NRCS Conservation Operations Allocation   350 000 Since this initiative was funded in 2002  approximately 500 000 acres of agricultural lands within basins tributary to Lake Okeechobee have signed up for accelerated conservation planning  and 82 comprehensive conservation plans are being developed for these lands  These plans are being developed by 36 NRCS certified Technical Service Providers that have been trained and deployed in the Lake Okeechobee watershed  A TMDL has been established for the Lake and a continued accelerated conservation planning effort is necessary to implement the practices on agricultural lands needed to meet Clean Water Act requirements                                                                November 2005 News Releases             Browse by
