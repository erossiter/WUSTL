                               MARTINEZ STATEMENT ON FLAG DESECRATION RESOLUTION  June 27  2006   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  made the following statement regarding the Flag Desecration Resolution  Martinez is a co sponsor of the amendment    Martinez said    Mr  President  I want to speak on this issue of the amendment to protect the flag of the United States  and I want to begin by speaking about it in a slightly different angle    As a young boy in school  I remember when I reached the fifth grade  I was charged with the responsibility of raising the flag in the morning and then bringing it down and protecting it and moving it into a safe place for the evening until the next school day  And I did that for an entire school year  It was with great reverence and ceremony that this took place    And I remember being empowered with this responsibility as a young boy  one of the first I ever had  and I took it very seriously  The interesting thing was that it was in another place  in another land  and it was another flag  It wasn t the flag we honor and revere today  but it was the flag of the country of my birth  of Cuba  But what I noticed then  and came to notice here is that people place great importance on symbols of national unity  No matter what country or where we are  there are very special symbols that from time to time touch a cord within the nation  And no greater evidence of the importance of this symbol can be given as through the history of our country  the stories that we have heard and come to know of great heroism in battle as soldier  perhaps at great risk of his own life  would go to save the flag  go to save the colors  the symbol of the nation that they were fighting for and representing  And many soldiers in the history of our nation have done just that  And  so it seems almost odd that there should be a heated debate    I understand the reason for the debate  It is rooted in the principles of constitutional freedom  It is rooted in the desire to honor those first ten amendments to the constitution  which are really what we call our Bill of Rights and the right of free speech  However  I do recall early in law school studying constitutional law learning that all rights enshrined in the Constitution have certain limits within them  that they all have certain boundaries  that there are no such thing as unlimited rights  Although we treasure and value our right of free speech  I do believe it is important that we understand that there are some things that ought to be protected  We protect our national monuments not just because they re pieces of property that are beautiful  it s really more about the symbols of what they are    The national monuments are protected because they re a symbol of something special in our nation  It might be a person  it might be an historical moment in time  Likewise  this very special system of our nation    our flag    is one that I believe we should also protect  And it is protected in a simple way  It is about the balance of power within our nation  It is about the difference between those things which are reserved for the judicial branch  others which are placed in the hand of the legislative branch  and what the Congress seeks to do in proposing this amendment to the American people  in placing it in a place where it cannot enshrine forever what was attempted to be done legislatively a number of times which the courts have chosen to strike down is to say  you know  the legislative branch of government  that branch closest to the people  elected by the people  shall have the right and the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States  And that s what the article would say  That congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States    When I was young  another life experience now being shared by my youngest son is being a Boy Scout  We see Boy Scouts through the halls of our Congress visiting here  seeing our sacred monuments  where this republic has been a beacon of hope  the Shining City on a hill to many people around the world  And when they come and they relish what they see  they come with a certain pride  They have learned also as young boys to protect the flag  to defend the flag  to honor the flag and to treat it with that very special respect    which is expected of something as important as a symbol of national unity    I am an encouraged supporter of this amendment because I believe that it is important that as our nation goes forward that we always respect and honor the opportunity and the right of those who disagree with the government  the policies of our government to freely express themselves  to have no place where they can not speak  I understand the meaning of freedom  the meaning of the right of free speech  However  I do also understand the very special nature of what the flag represents  In that situation  I believe there are many opportunities available to those who wish to protest  to those who wish to express a point of view different from the government  that can be expressed in ways that does not affront  that does not offend  and that does not destroy that very important symbol of national unity which our flag has been    So  I am proud today to support this amendment  I believe it is important that it be a constitutional amendment because we know that past efforts to legislatively fix the problem  to legislatively say to all that this symbol of national unity that we deem important enough to protect it in a very special way has been frustrated by the inability of the courts to agree with a clear direction that the legislative branch has imposed    And so then  it is upon us that we allow the people of this country to vote on this issue and to allow the various state legislative bodies to move on this issue and to seek to preserve forever more this symbol of national unity  This amendment seeks to prevent the physical abuse of a symbol that has served our country in many valuable ways through its history  It does not so by restricting anyone s speech  but by addressing their physical conduct  We are a free and vibrant people  and we owe that to those who have gone before us  and to those who serve us now in protecting our national interest  The desecrating of the flag does nothing to celebrate our enhanced  our expressive freedoms  while it clearly dishonors those who have served and sacrificed  I urge the Congress to support this amendment and protect the prominent freedom that America represents to the world                                                                 June 2006 News Releases             Browse by
