                               MARTINEZ AND OBAMA URGE COMPREHENSIVE AND REALISTIC IMMIGRATION REFORM   December 15  2005   Washington   U S  Senators Mel Martinez  R FL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today said that any immigration reform legislation must include tough border and workplace enforcement measures as well as a realistic guest worker program that acknowledges the role of the 11 million immigrants currently living and working illegally in the U S    At a press conference in Washington  the two announced a set of principles they believe must be included in any comprehensive immigration reform package  Those principles include combining the strongest elements of the current border security and employment verification proposals by Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE  with the most realistic workplace and earned citizenship reform program proposed by Senators John McCain  R AZ  and Ted Kennedy  D MA     Martinez and Obama pledged to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure these complementary efforts are included in any final legislation   Martinez  the only immigrant currently serving in the U S  Senate  said   Im dedicated to the kind of comprehensive reform that strengthens our borders  and respects our rule of law  Theres no question we need to address border security  However  we must also bring the eleven million illegal aliens already living and working in this country out of hiding and deal with them in a realistic fashion without providing amnesty  said Martinez  These are goals we must accomplish simultaneously or our efforts at immigration reform will fail   Obama  whose father is from Kenya  said   I look forward to working with Senator Martinez on achieving bipartisan  comprehensive immigration reform  For too long  inadequate enforcement of our borders along with employers who turn a blind eye while hiring illegal workers on the cheap have encouraged more illegal immigration  We have to control the border  and we also must create a guest worker program that will discourage employers from hiring illegal immigrants and will give the 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States a reason to come out into the open   Martinez and Obama today sent a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter  R PA  outlining their principles and offering suggestions on how they could be most effectively included into the Chairmans Mark  The two are working to build a bipartisan coalition of likeminded members who agree that any successful immigration reform proposal must include both border security and a realistic guest worker program   Martinez is the only immigrant currently serving in the United States Senate  He came to the United States at age 15 after fleeing communist Cuba through a program called Operation Pedro Pan  His parents joined him four years later in Orlando  Florida   A copy of the letter to Chairman Specter is attached           December 15  2005  The Honorable Arlen Specter United States Senate   Dear Chairman Specter    We have reviewed the Chairmans Mark on comprehensive immigration reform and we commend you for tackling the challenge    We write to express our strong support for the Marks language providing for much tougher border security and employer compliance requirements  We also support the Marks proposed guestworker program  And  while we do not condone unauthorized immigration  we could urge changes to the Mark that would approach the challenge of bringing the undocumented out of hiding in a more realistic way    In an effort to contribute to your deliberations  we submit the following principles for comprehensive immigration reform for your decision  We believe comprehensive reform must include all of the following  much of which is in the Chairmans Mark  1  Very tough enforcement at the border and workplace  2  New guestworker visas to meet future  legitimate labor market demands without disadvantaging American workers  3  A realistic solution to the undocumented population that encourages the 11 million undocumented immigrants here today to become known to the government  pay fines  and become part of the legal labor force with an opportunity to eventually ear permanent residence  4  A renewed and strengthened commitment to family reunification  5  And a process to bring the remittances industry into the fold of regulated banking transactions so that immigrants would be encouraged to participate in the banking system and promoting economic development here and abroad    Border Enforcement   The border with Mexico is the most visible and obvious place where immigration breaches occur  The governors of Arizona and New Mexico both declared states of emergency earlier this year because of drug related violence on their respective borders  According to Secretary Chertoff a lack of detention space on the border is leading us to release unauthorized immigrants knowing that they will likely join the domestic undocumented population  We have to restore order on our Southern border    The Mark identifies the areas of our enforcement infrastructure most in need of investment and proposes improvements in how we defend the border  We strongly support border security provisions in the Mark drawn largely from Senator Hagels  and Senators Cornyn and Kyls proposals that put more officers with new technology on the border  invest in border control facilities  increase the detection of fraudulent documents  increase detention space  increase penalties for alien smuggling  and improve the removal process of unauthorized immigrants   Employer Compliance with Immigration Law  Existing employer sanctions for hiring unauthorized workers have failed because we have not created an effective way for employers to check a new hires legal eligibility to work and law enforcement and Congress have been unwilling to get tough on employers    Congress compromised in 1986 by providing that employees could prove legal status by showing a variety of documents and employers would record their inspection of such documents by filling out an I 9 form for each employee  But instead of forcing employers to hire legal workers  the law created an underground market for fraudulent documents  Additionally employers often fail to challenge fraudulent documents either because they want to access inexpensive  compliant labor or to avoid charges of discrimination     As former Wage and hour Administrator Maria Echaveste has pointed out  while a Wage and Hour investigator has the authority to assess penalties for failure to comply with other labor standards  with respect to I 9 violations  referrals are made to the Immigration and Naturalization Service  INS  now Immigration and Customs Enforcement  or ICE   The INS  and now ICE  has given low priority to these referrals  The intent to fine notices to employers for hiring the undocumented has declined from an insufficient 417 in 1999 to just three in 2004  Too many workplaces  too few Wage and Hour investigators  and inadequate ICE resource have turned employer sanctions into a nuisance paperwork requirement  not a risk of violations producing real penalties    The Mark  modeled on Senator Hagels proposal  makes employer compliances mandatory  easy  and effective  It synchronizes the database at the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security to allow employers to quickly and easily verify the legal status of new hires  We strongly support that language     But investing more money on border security and improving employer compliances are only part of the solution  These reforms will not result in better migration management if we do not also bring the existing undocumented population out of hiding or if we fail to encourage future migrants to come through a new  legal guestworker system instead of illegally   A New Guestworker Program   The Chairmans Mark includes much of Senators McCain and Kennedys language on a new guestworker program that we strongly support  America has a relatively generous employment based quota for high skilled workers and a very small quota for low skill workers  Notwithstanding this small quota for low skilled workers  American business leaders estimate that the labor market demands roughly 500 000 low skill workers a year  A new guestworker program would bring together supply and demand without having employers and industries depend on illegal labor     U S  workers will be much better off if we replace the undocumented migrant stream of workers with a stream of guestowrkers who come legally  enter with inspection  and have full access to labor rights  And American workers will be much better off if entire industries are not reliant on undocumented workers  Replacing the illegal workforce with legal guestworkers who can defend themselves should raise wages and working conditions for everyone  Additional consideration should be given to including those in the United States and TPS status  Including their eligibility to participate in the Guest Worker program without any punitive sanctions would address another serious issue   The Undocumented and Family Reunification    Immigration reform will not work if it does not deal with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in a realistic way  We strongly support the solution to the challenge of the undocumented that Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy have proposed    Under the McCain Kennedy proposal  the undocumented would have an opportunity to stay  but face punishment in the form of stiff fines and a long  rigorous path toward permanent legal residence  None of the undocumented would be able to become permanent residents until those now waiting in line to come legally are processed  The fines and requirements to earn permanent residence constitute punishment for having broken our immigration laws without instituting mass deportations  Our employers support this proposal because this population plays a vital role in our economy and our churches support it because the population plays a vital role in our communities    Senators McCain and Kennedy also propose strong language to encourage family reunification  Families split by immigration law and without other alternatives to stay together often choose illegal status    The proposed alternative for dealing with the undocumented population in the Mark is unrealistic  It would tell 11 million people to go home and try to come back legally  Most of the undocumented would not participate in a forced departure program and mass deportations are not an option  it would cost too much and require excessive measures  Not dealing in a realistic way with the undocumented population would result in a continued and growing undocumented population of multiple millions of people    Remittances   A comprehensive solution to immigration must deal in a positive way with the ever growing remittance industry  We believe registration by aliens in the Guest Worker program should give them the proper identification to access banking services and bring consumer protections  reasonable rates and full disclosure to this ever burgeoning stream of revenue  Through regulation of the remittance industry we can positively impact the Guest Worker  his or her family  our own economy as well as that of the country of origin  In addition we can take measured steps to stem the expansion of the unlawful and unscrupulous in the money transmission business who prey on the uninformed  and provide a source of funds to those who wish to bring us harm  We have provided bullet points to your staff in this area and expect to have discussion draft language available shortly    As an additional incentive to registration  we would like to encourage legislation providing states with the discretion to allow the children of immigrants properly documented and registered in the Guest Worker program the right to claim residency for purposes of in state tuition at public colleges and universities    Again  we commend you for engaging the debate on comprehensive immigration reform  We hope to work with you and the rest of our colleagues to achieve a bipartisan  sensible  compassionate solution to the challenge    Sincerely      Barack Obama
