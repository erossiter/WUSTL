                               SENATOR MARTINEZ OFFERS SUPPORT FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO  January 25  2006   WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today made the following statement on the Senate floor regarding Supreme Court nominee Judge Samuel Alito     Martinez said    Madam President  I also rise today to express my support for the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court  The Constitution demands that the president s nominees to the Supreme Court receive the advice and consent of a majority of senators    The standard to be used is not spelled out in the Constitution  But 200 years of tradition offers a guide and that guide    that standard applied to nominees throughout our history is the very same standard that we should apply today to Judge Samuel Alito  By that standard  Judge Alito is well qualified  Since graduating from Yale law school in 1975  Judge Alito has had an exemplary legal career  serving as United States Attorney  Assistant Solicitor General and for 15 years a member of the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals  During that lengthy tenure in the court we ve had the benefit seeing his commitment to the rule of law and his commitment to an impartial review of the law and the facts of any given case    As Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist Number 78  if the courts are to be truly independent  judges cannot substitute their own preferences to the constitutional intentions of the legislative branch  Judge Alito clearly expressed during his confirmation hearings  and his judicial career attests to the fact that he would not impose his personal views over the demands of the law and precedents  I find that refreshing  I find that encouraging  And I find that a strong reason for supporting the nomination of Judge Alito  I take great comfort in the fact that Judge Alito has received the unanimous approval of the American Bar Associations committee that reviews judicial candidates  This is a committee that is greatly respected by the legal profession as well as the general public for their impartiality and for their demand and their insistence and their careful watch over a quality judiciary    The committee that reviews judicial candidates is interested and committed to a quality judiciary  Judge Alito not only received the unanimous approval but he received their most qualified rating  That means that each and every one of the members of that committee gave Judge Alito their highest  most qualified rating  This should weigh heavily in favor of confirmation of Judge Alito  What we know after the confirmation hearings after extensive interaction of members of the Senate  after three days of testimony from the Judiciary Committee and responses to a wide range of written questions from senators after the hearing is that Judge Alito is a humble and dispassionate judge with a deep understanding and modest view of his judicial role in the governance of our nation and respect for the limitations of precedent  He has an awareness of the dangers of looking to foreign jurisdictions for guidance in shaping the laws of our land and a commitment to respecting the proper role of the courts in the interpretation of the law    I m persuaded that Judge Alito will look to established precedents  be respectful the doctrine of stare decisis and will use the Constitution and the law as his guidepost as opposed to any personal or political agenda  There are those that would think that they are troubled by what they perceive as Judge Alito not siding with the little guy when judging cases  Let me tell you  Im someone who for 25 years took clients matters to court  More than for the little guy or for the big guy I looked for judges to take the facts and the laws and precedents  interpret them and reach a fair and just verdict as dictated by the laws of our nation  not because they favor a little guy  not because they favor a big guy  If the law and the facts happen to be on the side of the little guy  the little guy should prevail  If the law and the facts happen to be on the side of the big guy  then our system of justice demands that the big guy should prevail  I love theanalogy that chief Justice Roberts used  In selecting a justice to the Supreme Court  he said we were looking for an umpire  We are not looking for a pitcher or a batter    we re looking for the umpire    the guy who will call the balls and strikes fairly and impartially to all litigants before the court    Our long held traditions and our system of justice demands fairness  integrity  and demands judicial temperament  Judge Alito fulfills all of those requirements amply  and I am satisfied that he will make an exceptional justice of the Supreme Court  Judge Alito has made it abundantly clear that his personal views have absolutely no place in performing his judicial role in our constitutional structure  Rather  the Constitution  statutes and controlling decisions as applied to the case are the sole basis for his judicial determinations  I find it the correct standard to apply to a judicial nominee for determining his fitness for this high office    Mr  President  at the end of the day  we know that elections have consequences and the fact that the voters have placed President Bush in office  in the office of president  now for a second term has also been an indication that President Bush deserves and should be allowed to have his pick for the court  It is our tradition that presidents nominate  select  and fill vacancies to the court while the Senate s role is one of advice and consent  We simply do not have the prerogative of deciding who it is that we would prefer to see on the court or who it is that we might find philosophically more suitable to us or more to our liking    Our role as senators is to provide the president with the advice and consent on the qualifications of those that seek to be put in this high office  I see an evolving new standard before us  I heard from the members of the Judiciary Committee who did not support this nominee  the setting of a brand new standard  It is no longer qualifications  It is now whether or not they philosophically will judge this person to be the kind of person that they would want    based on their political philosophy  That  I would suggest  is wrong  It has never been sought to confirm justices to our court for over 200 years  and I would say it is absolutely wrong to begin that new standard and leave it unchallenged as we seek the confirmation of one more justice to the Supreme Court  My advice and consent is that Judge Alito is one of the select few that Hamilton had in mind as having the character  intelligence and temperament to guard the liberties secured by our Constitution  and I strongly urge my colleagues to support his nomination to the Supreme Court  Thank you  Madam Chair
