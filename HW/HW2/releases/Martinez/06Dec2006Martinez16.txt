                               MARTINEZ PRAISES GATES CONFIRMATION  RUMSFELD SERVICE   December 6  2006   Washington  DC   U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today voted to confirm Dr  Robert Gates to be the next United States Secretary of Defense  Speaking on the Senate floor before the vote  Senator Martinez praised outgoing Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and applauded the qualifications of Secretary designate Gates  The Senate approved the nomination 95  2   Martinez said   I rise this afternoon for the purpose of  first of all  agreeing with my colleague from South Carolina and previously my colleague from Texas  both distinguished Senators who spoke in favor of the nomination of Dr  Gates to be our next Secretary of Defense  I intend to support his nomination  I think that he has served our country well in the past and I think that were fortunate that he is willing to step into that difficult job at this very difficult time in our history  I intend to support him and I commend the Armed Services Committee for their show of unity and bipartisanship in unanimously supporting his nomination  I hope there will be a strong vote in support of Dr  Gates as he heads into this very difficult assignment   I think its important we note today two other things  One  the need for us to look at this problem in Iraq with a sense of bipartisanship  with a sense of unity as Americans  putting aside the stripes that we usually wear as Democrats and Republicans  but looking at this problem as Americans concerned about a difficult problem  one that has taxed us but one which we must succeed in   Today  the President received the report of the Iraq Study Group  distinguished Americans that came together to give us recommendations  I commend the President for not only accepting the report but also highlighting how clear he was in the seriousness that will be given to the recommendations that it makes   Lastly  Mr  President  I want to also take a moment to commend and thank Secretary Rumsfeld for his service to our Nation  I had the pleasure of meeting Secretary Rumsfeld when I was very inexperienced in the ways of Washington  A person from Florida  I came here to serve in the President s Cabinet  And during the time of transition into this Administration  I met Secretary Rumsfeld as we jointly prepared for our confirmation hearings before the Senate to proceed into our jobs in the Cabinet   I came to know and appreciate this great American patriot  a man of incredible intellect and talent but also incredibly dedicated to our Nation  Initially  through the treacherous attacks of September 11 where he  with his bare hands  was helping to dig the injured from the rubble of the Pentagon as that building was attacked on that unforgettable morning of September the 11th of 2001   I saw him then next in our Cabinet meeting  The President asked all of us to pull ourselves together to help lead our Nation at this very difficult moment  He  in a certain and clear way  showed us a way forward and how our military would respond to the threats to our Nation  first of all  to secure the capital and New York City  but then in a very clear and direct way on how to respond to those who had plotted these attacks in Afghanistan  He led our country into a very successful and very clear and decisive victory in Afghanistan  and then again prepared our country and led us into the war in Iraq with a very difficult and still uncertain outcome   In all of the debate and discussions that have ensued over the last several months about this difficult struggling which we find ourselves in today  I think too often we have been guided by the usual bickering and partisan politics  but not often enough do we stop to recognize a dedicated American who has served our Nation well   I am proud to call Secretary Rumsfeld my friend  but I m equally proud to say today that he has served our Nation with great distinction  that our Nation owes him a great debt of thanks  and to his family as well  to his wife  Joyce  and to his children for the sacrifice that all of them have made so that Secretary Rumsfeld could serve our Nation once again  at a certain age when many of us might be looking forward to retirement  He came to Washington once again to serve in a very difficult job and has done it with great distinction   So I thank Secretary Rumsfeld on behalf of Floridians and I think a grateful Nation as well  The men and women in uniform that he has led  that I know  have thought so much of his leadership  I know hes given so much of himself to the transformation of our military to prepare us for the future  and I  just for one  want to rise today with a voice of thanks to a great American for his service
