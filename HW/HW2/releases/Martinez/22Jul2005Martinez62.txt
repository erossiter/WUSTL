                               MARTINEZ ASKS FOR BRAC ADD  NUCLEAR CARRIER FOR MAYPORT  July 22  2005   Washington  DC  U S  Senator Mel Martinez will deliver testimony this afternoon at Floridas regional hearing of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in New Orleans  In his remarks  Senator Martinez calls for nuclear upgrades and the relocation of a nuclear powered aircraft carrier to Naval Station Mayport     We simply must accelerate the Navys push to upgrade Mayport and relocate a nuclear carrier to that fine  capable  and strategically positioned port  said Martinez  The Navy wants and needs two nuclear home ports for carriers on the East Coast  and Naval Station Mayport offers the best opportunity to fulfill that requirement        Senator Martinez also calls for a thorough reexamination of the weight applied to certain criteria involving Pensacola Naval Air Station  Several missions at Pensacola are slated by the Department of Defense for relocation in the current BRAC proposal        The recommendations and data are consistently inconsistent and incomprehensibly inaccurate  Martinez stated  The numbers simply dont add up        The full text of Senator Martinezs remarks as prepared for delivery is attached below                    Statement by Senator Mel Martinez    To the Base Realignment and Closure Commission    Regional Hearing    New Orleans  LA    22 July 2005       Distinguished commissioners  I appreciate the opportunity to come before you today  in unison with Floridas delegation  to support what I believe to be genuine enhancements to the Department of Defense BRAC recommendations        I also want to underscore the enormous military value the state of Florida offers to our national security and perhaps add perspective to issues yet to be addressed        From its early discovery  Florida has had a rich and unique history of military tradition  Under the leadership of Governor Bush  that tradition has been further strengthened as Florida becomes an even more military friendly state        This is one of the many reasons why Florida consistently scores very high in military value  And the weight is not in our words  its in our actions  From Pensacola to Homestead  from MacDill to Mayport  from the Space Coast to Eglin  you see Floridas military value        The quality  availability  and condition of our joint training ranges  in air  land  and sea  is simply unmatched  And Floridas facilities  workforce strength  quality of life  and perhaps most importantly  our unwavering community support    make our state one of the most versatile and important assets for our nations military        This is clearly evident in Northwest Florida  where favorable training conditions  base facilities  and surrounding areas are truly conducive to meaningful instruction and learning  Additionally  the close proximity of Navy  Marine Corps  Air Force  and Army personnel offers tremendous opportunity for joint operational training        For example  the greater Pensacola area has long served as the cornerstone of the Navys education and training efforts        Since 1825  Pensacola has been an important home to the U S  Navy  and the area has truly led Naval Aviation for nearly a century  In fact  NAS Pensacola was our nations very first naval air station and remains a critical hub of Naval  and increasingly Air Force  aviation training today        The area also offers the most efficient flight training  For example  as several GAO studies have confirmed  NAS Whiting Field is a model of efficiency for advanced helicopter training        That is why I read with apprehension some of the recommendations relating to Officer Training Command as well as to the Naval Education and Training Command        As Representative Miller and Vice Admiral Fetterman expertly outlined in great detail  the recommendations and data are consistently inconsistent and incomprehensibly inaccurate  For example  the considerable difference in cost of living between Pensacola and Newport  Rhode Island  As we have discussed  the Departments Basic Allowance for Housing is a tangible indicator  the BAH rate for an O 3 with Dependents in Newport is  1 952 per month  in Pensacola the rate for the very same officer would be less than half  at  946 per month        The same is true with the GS Locality Pay  in Newport it is 17   yet only 10 9  in Pensacola  Based on that information  you would expect to see the scoring in this area favor Pensacola  Yet  the military value score for that question favors Newport  The numbers simply dont add up        An equally troubling metric is with ET 13  relating to Guard and Reserve use of Officer Accession Training facilities for drill periods  Even if you take into account that we dont have a home reserve unit  Pensacola is home to all Direct Commission Officer Indoctrination  Meaning  all reservists who enter service as a Direct Commission Officer go through Pensacola for their initial training  It is therefore awfully surprising that Pensacola scores a zero in this area  while Newport has a 5  Again  this seems to be a flawed metric  The only thing consistent about the scoring is that it is inconsistent        Put simply  the data supporting the OTC  NETC and DFAS moves just doesnt add up and I would urge the commission to revise that area of the base recommendation        Additionally  I share our delegations request that the Commission meaningfully consider the proposed BRAC enhancement related to relocating a nuclear powered aircraft carrier at Mayport        As my colleagues have shared  the top minds at the Department of Defense have given congressional testimony  stating on the record repeatedly that they want two active carrier homeports on the East Coast  It is also their publicly stated desire to eliminate the two remaining conventional carriers in favor of an all nuclear fleet  Mayport is currently the homeport to the conventionally powered USS John F Kennedy  If we allow the Kennedy to sail off with no capability or anything to replace her we would  in effect  cripple the strategic placement of our aircraft carrier homeport structure on the East Coast        For reasons of continuity and national security  we simply must accelerate the Navys push to upgrade Mayport and relocate a nuclear carrier to that fine  capable  and strategically positioned port        Further  the July 23  2004 briefing given by OSD to the BRAC Infrastructure Steering Group recommended  and I quote        The Military Departments and the Joint Cross Service Groups will not recommend to the Secretary any closure or realignment recommendation that prohibits Fleet basing that supports the Fleet Response Plan and Sea basing concepts         CVN  Nuclear Carrier  capability  2 East Coast ports  2 West Coast ports  and 2 forward based in the Pacific        The Navy wants and needs two nuclear home ports for carriers on the East Coast  and Naval Station Mayport offers the best opportunity to fulfill that requirement        I firmly believe that BRAC offers the Navy a unique opportunity for this critically important national security initiative to become a reality  The move is consistent with other proposed forces structure changes  consolidations  and realignments  And there is a lot of potential synergy        That said  I truly hope the postponement of our regional hearing due to the hurricane has not hampered our states ability to advance a meaningful enhancement to the Commission  As we restructure  realign  and prepare for the future  it makes sense to incorporate and determine nuclear carrier home porting in the context of BRAC  And I urge the Commissions full and fair consideration of this proposal        I would like to conclude by thanking you and your dedicated staff  for your service to our nation under such strenuous and difficult times  I firmly support the BRAC process  and recognize that you have a very tough job to do  I look forward to working with you as the process matures        I leave you with a quote from Pastor William Arthur War  The pessimist complains about the wind  the optimist expects it to change  the realist adjusts the sails     We Floridians are realists whose recommendations merely seek to adjust the sails of BRAC  Thank you                                                                  July 2005 News Releases             Browse by
