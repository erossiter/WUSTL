                               MARTINEZ  CONGRESS APPROVES TAX PACKAGE WITH RELIEF FOR WILMA VICTIMS  Measure headed to White House for signature December 16  2005   Washington   U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today announced that the Tax Relief Act of 2005  has been approved by both houses of Congress and is headed to the White House for the presidents signature  The measure will help many Floridians fix their homes  find temporary housing and get their lives back together after the devastation caused by Hurricane Wilma  In addition  the measure also expands access to low income housing by increasing the applicable housing credit ceiling amount for Florida by  3 5 million for 2006   This bill will help Floridians get back on their feet and back in their homes  said Martinez  I want to thank Chairman Grassley and the Finance Committee for their hard work in putting together a hurricane recovery tax bill  This assures Floridians affected by Wilma that they are not forgotten    Among the provisions included in the legislation that will benefit Floridians  Special Rules for Mortgage Revenue Bonds  Special Rules for Use of Retirement Funds  Employee Retention Credit for Employers Affected by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma  Temporary Suspension of Limitations on Charitable Contributions  Suspension of Certain Limitations on Personal Casualty Losses  and a Special Look Back rule for Determining Earned Income Credit and Refundable Child Credit   Lessening the tax burden on all Americans  especially those affected by Hurricane Wilma  will give people the flexibility they need to recover and rebuild  said Martinez           Provisions of Tax Relief Act of 2005 that are related to Hurricane Wilma  These provisions would apply to Floridians affected by Hurricane Wilma who reside in eligible counties or the Wilma Zone  federally declared disaster areas which are eligible for the FEMA Individual Assistance Program     Relax Restrictions on Mortgage Revenue Bonds  Mortgage revenue bonds are tax exempt bonds that State and local governments generally issue through housing finance agencies  The proceeds from the bonds are used to fund below market interest rate mortgages for certain first time homebuyers meeting income and purchase price restrictions  The provision allows greater access to mortgage revenue bond proceeds by lifting the first time homeowner requirement through December 31  2010  for homes in certain areas damaged by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma  In addition  the provision allows up to  150 000 of the loan proceeds to be used for hurricane related repairs to damaged homes  The proposal is estimated to cost  20 million over five years   Early Withdrawals from Retirement Plans  Present law discourages distributions from tax preferred retirement plans with penalties and other limitations  The provision waives the 10 percent penalty tax for premature distributions from IRAs and qualified retirement plans for individuals who suffered an economic loss because of Rita or Wilma and whose principal residence is located in the Rita or Wilma disaster areas  Individuals eligible for this waiver would be permitted to pay income tax on such distributions ratably over a three year period  Amounts distributed could be re contributed to a qualified retirement plan over the three year period following the distribution date and receive rollover treatment  The waiver of the 10 percent penalty  3 year income averaging and recontribution provisions for retirement plan withdrawals will be limited to  100 000 per individual  Distributions for home purchases which were not finalized because of Hurricanes Rita or Wilma could also be re contributed to a qualified retirement plan or IRA  Limitations on loans from qualified employer plans would be increased for Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma victims by doubling the thresholds to the lesser of  100 000 or 100 percent of the individuals account balance  Payments due from hurricane victims on qualified plan loans on or after August 25  2005  and before January 1  2007  could be deferred  and twelve months could be added to the maximum repayment period of affected loans  The proposal is estimated to cost  162 million over five years   Employee Retention Credit for Small Businesses  Current law allows employers to deduct the cost of salaries paid to employees  This provision establishes a 40 percent tax credit for wages paid up to  6 000 if paid after August 28  2005  and before December 31  2005  by employers located in the disaster zones of Hurricane Rita or Wilma without regard to the size of the employer  The employees usual and principal place of work must have been in the disaster zone  but the credit is not affected if the employee reports to work at another location  Wages paid to relatives would be ineligible for the credit  The proposal is estimated to cost  24 million over five years   Corporate Charitable Contributions  The amount allowed as a charitable deduction for a corporation in any taxable year may not exceed 10 percent of the corporations taxable income  The provision temporarily waives limits regarding charitable cash contributions for Rita and Wilma relief  The provision is effective for contributions before January 1  2006  The proposal is estimated to cost  78 million over five years   Casualty Loss Provision  Under present law  non business casualty losses are deductible by taxpayers who itemize only to the extent they exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income and a  100 floor  In some circumstances  taxpayers are permitted to include a current year casualty loss on an amended prior year return  The provision eliminates the 10 percent and  100 floor for casualty losses resulting from Hurricanes Rita or Wilma and incurred in the disaster area  including those claimed on amended returns  The proposal is estimated to cost  1 174 billion over five years   Special Rules for Determining Earned Income  The provision allows low income working families an election to use their 2004 income for the refundable earned income credit and the refundable child tax credit  The proposal is estimated to cost  28 million over five years    Special Rules for Determining Family Status and Earned Income  Hurricanes Rita and Wilma have also displaced many families  Under present law  a prolonged change in a familys living situation could affect its eligibility for various tax benefits  The provision gives Treasury authority to ensure taxpayers do not lose deductions  credits or filing status because of dislocations from Hurricanes Rita and Wilma  The provision also allows low income working families an election to use their 2004 income for the refundable earned income credit and the refundable child tax credit  The proposal would cost  28 million over five years   Expands Access to Low Income Housing  This provision increases the otherwise applicable housing credit ceiling amount for Florida by  3 5 million per state for 2006  Additionally  the Wilma Gulf Opportunity Zone will be treated as a difficult development area  allowing investors to calculate credits for a project on an amount equal to 130 percent of new construction or rehabilitation expenditures                                                                December 2005 News Releases             Browse by
