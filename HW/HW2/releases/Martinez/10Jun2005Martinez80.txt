help oppose efforts to weaken the federal moratorium on offshore drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf  In a letter to the president  Senator Martinez reiterated his pledge to fight any provision that would weaken the protections granted to Florida by the Presidential moratorium   The letter reads in part       As written  the Senate   s energy bill contains a provision to require an inventory of oil and natural gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf  Additional efforts are underway to amend federal energy policy even further  directing the Department of Interior to draw new state boundaries in the Outer Continental Shelf and give states incentives to withdraw from the offshore drilling moratorium in exchange for 50 percent of active oil lease revenues  Mr  President  these unprecedented changes to federal energy policy would have a permanent and detrimental impact on Florida          since the elimination of military operations at Vieques  many of our Nation   s fighter pilots perform training in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico   These important training missions involve live fire including airborne missiles  If the Eastern Gulf were to be opened to drilling  the clear danger would place a number of personnel  including those of our military  at great risk      Mr  President  in the State of Florida there is a widely held bipartisan agreement among members of Congress and the Governor   s office that we will not support and we will fight any provision that would weaken the protections        The Senate is expected to begin floor consideration of the energy bill on Monday    The complete text of the letter is attached below  For hard copies of the letter  please contact Ken Lundberg in Senator Martinez   s press office at  202 228 5957 or email ken_lundberg martinez senate gov           June 9  2005        President George W  Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  DC 20500    Dear President Bush     I am writing to express my deep concern about efforts in the U S  Congress to remove the existing Presidential moratorium on offshore drilling in the Lease 181 area of the Gulf of Mexico  I urge you to help in opposing these efforts  Removing the moratorium encroaches upon Florida   s historical boundaries     boundaries established in the Eastern Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico  endangers environmental protections on which a core segment of Florida   s economy is built  and threatens our military   s ability to train to the best of their ability to protect National security     As written  the Senate   s energy bill contains a provision to require an inventory of oil and natural gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf  Additional efforts are underway to amend federal energy policy even further  directing the Department of Interior to draw new state boundaries in the Outer Continental Shelf and give states incentives to withdraw from the offshore drilling moratorium in exchange for 50 percent of active oil lease revenues  Mr  President  these unprecedented changes to federal energy policy would have a permanent and detrimental impact on Florida      Florida   s life blood industry is tourism  Offshore drilling will have a chilling effect on this industry and the environmental consequences of an oil spill would cause irreparable harm to our state   s economy  Every year  more than 75 million people come to our state to enjoy its beautiful beaches and coastal habitat  The moratorium areas under attack are directly in the path of some of Florida   s beaches     the most pristine and popular beaches in the world  Any effort at opening the waters off Florida   s coast must be rejected      In addition  Florida is the proud home to many outstanding military installations  and as you know  since the elimination of military operations at Vieques  many of our Nation   s fighter pilots perform training in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico   These important training missions involve live fire including airborne missiles  If the Eastern Gulf were to be opened to drilling  the clear danger would place a number of personnel  including those of our military  at great risk     In fact  on May 5  2000  the Base Commander of Eglin Air Force Base  Major General Michael Kostelnik  wrote in a memorandum regarding oil and gas exploration in the Lease 181 area of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico that        We continue to place the most severe restrictions in the eastern portion of the proposed sale area where oil and gas operations would be incompatible with military training and testing operations      In addition  on June 9  2000  the Director of Operations at the Air Force Material Command stated in another memorandum      in regards to Lease 181  we are deeply concerned over the construction of any oil or gas structures that could impact our critical test programs performed by Air Armament Center  AAC  at Eglin Air Force Base FL        Mr  President  in the State of Florida there is a widely held bipartisan agreement among members of Congress and the Governor   s office that we will not support and we will fight any provision that would weaken the protections granted to us by the Presidential moratorium in the Outer Continental Shelf  We respectfully request your support     Sincerely         Mel Martinez  U S  Senator
