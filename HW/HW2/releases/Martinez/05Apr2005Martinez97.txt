                               MARTINEZ OFFERS TRIBUTE TO POPE JOHN PAUL II ON SENATE FLOOR  April 5  2005   WASHINGTON U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today offered the following remarks on the Senate floor regarding the passing of Pope John Paul II      Mr  President  as the world has taken notice of the passing of Pope John Paul II  I rise to speak  I know today the Senate will be taking a resolution to speak to the issue of his passing       As a person of the Roman Catholic faith myself  I thought it was important and appropriate that this morning I take a few moments to speak to the greatness of this man and the contribution that he s made not only to enriching the faith life of those of us that practice the Roman Catholic faith  but really to the people of the world as a great statesman and moral leader       Pope John Paul was one of the most remarkable people of our times  His papacy lasted 26 years  which is the third longest in the 2 000 year history of our church  But  it was during tumultuous and difficult times  Pope John Paul was prepared for this papacy  he was prepared for this mantle of leadership through tremendous hardships in his life      As a young person  he lost his mother very early in life only to be followed by the very dramatic loss of his only brother and only a very few years later the loss of his very beloved father  At a very young age just as a young man  Pope John Paul was left alone in the world without any close family  He developed a long and strong network of friendships that he maintained all through his life and even through the days of his papacy       But in addition to that  the Pope s youth was tempered but living under tyranny    he had to be subjected to tyrannical occupation of Germany of his Polish homeland and the persecution of people like him    people of faith  In addition to that  once that was over with and he began to seek his vocational pursuit in the priesthood  he had to do so underground because subsequent to the German occupation and the Nazi regime s end it was followed by the Communist takeover of Poland      Eastern Europe    as we all know    became engulfed and contained what came to be known by the words of Sir Winston Churchill as the Iron Curtain  Poland  falling behind the walls of the Iron Curtain  was where faith was not to be practiced openly and where he could not attend a seminary openly but had to do it in an underground fashion       Pope John Paul   s preparation for the priesthood and the papacy was forced in the difficult times that he faced  not only personally but also in his life as a citizen of Poland  It then fell upon him to be a Pope at a time when the world was undergoing change  and at a time when the people of his beloved Poland were energized like no other in history but his papacy and his theme of    Be Not Afraid     His trip back to Poland in the early years of his papal reign was punctuated by his remarkable reception by the people of Poland    people that were thirsting for freedom  thirsting for freedom  So the papal visit was a transcending moment in the history of Poland  but as we now know  it was really a transcending moment in the history of our world because it really did signify and signal the beginning of the end of communist rule in Eastern Europe       Pope John Paul worked closely with several United States presidents  but none more closely than the work he did with President Ronald Reagan during those crucial years when the Cold War came to a head and where we saw the beginning of the fraying of what was a failed system  of what was a system that had only been maintained through terror and through fear  And his theme of    Be Not Afraid    began to be heard  began to be responded to and the people of Poland began that surge toward freedom which was inevitable through all of Europe   So the Pope s contribution there was crucial  was critical and was something that  I think we all saw as a tremendous contribution       Of course  the Pope also visited the United States on many occasions  I believe I have heard over the last several days that it was second most visited country after his beloved Poland  And it was with great significance that we received him here and it made a tremendous difference in the life of our own country      But more recently  the pope visited Cuba eight years ago  Cuba is an imprisoned island in the Caribbean where there never had there been a papal visit before  It is also a country that is ruled very much under the same kind of tyrannical communism that he saw in his native Poland during the days of his youth and that he battled against all of his adult life as a priest being suppressed in his ability to worship freely  Cuba happens to be the place where I was born  It was a place where I began my life and where the principles of the Catholic faith were taught to me early in my life and in the Church  It was in that same land that I came to understand the meaning of oppression  the meaning of tyranny  and the meaning of the lack of freedom that the Pope shared in his youth  He and I in very different parts of the world shared a common experience in understanding the limitations   limitations of freedom sometimes placed on people by governments that protect what we find so basic which is the right of free speech and the right to practice religion freely  The Pope s trip to Cuba was a monumental thing because it allowed the people of Cuba to begin again  to practice their faith in an open way  His theme there    Be Not Afraid    was heard in Cuba and thousands and thousands of Cubans were expressing their faith in an open way  in a way they were not permitted before  which now they dare to do      The Pope s visit did not have the same galvanizing political effect that it did in Poland where it led to change  but it did have a strong pastoral message that the people of Cuba welcomed with open arms and received  It inspired the Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba to speak openly about the lack of religious freedom  the kind of religious oppression that I felt in my own life that led me to seek freedom in the United States with the help of the church that the Pope began to lead      The Catholic Church   s fight against atheistic communism led to a program called Operation Peter Pan that took 14 000 young people from Cuba to freedom here in the United States  I was lucky to be among them  My life here began under the care of Catholic Church  I understand fully the religious oppression that the people of Cuba suffer which continues today     but  which the Pope made a little better  gave them a window  an opening  a moment  For the first time in over 35 years  Christmas was celebrated in anticipation of the papal visit  Unfortunately  Cuba now has fallen back into a more repressive practice and freedom of religion is curtailed even more so today       So as we look at the Pope   s life and as we look at this moment in history that we re living by this remarkable man and this remarkable life  and the contributions that he made  we must continue to understand that there is work that is still to be done  there are people in the world who still are hungry and who still suffer and there are those in the world who still lack the religious freedoms to openly practice their faith much as the Pope in his youth was curtailed from doing  And  those people today in Cuba and other places around the world still yearn for that opportunity to freely worship  still yearn for the opportunity to do what we find so remarkable as we began our proceedings this morning with the Chaplain of the Senate offering a word of prayer       Mr  President  I conclude my remarks by simply saying that we have been touched in our lives by this remarkable man  His life has shaped the world in which we have lived  It is a life well lived and he has come to the end of his journey  I hope that those of us who share in his faith and also share in his ideals of the respect of every human life and every human being will continue to carry on the wonderful legacy that he has left for us      Thank you  Mr  President                                                                       April 2005 News Releases             Browse by
