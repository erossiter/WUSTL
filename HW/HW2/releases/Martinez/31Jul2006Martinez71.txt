                               SENATE CLEARS WAY FOR GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY SECURITY ACT   July 31  2006   Washington  DC   U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today voted in favor of concluding debate on Senate bill 3711  the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711 is a measure that seeks to provide a zone of protection ensuring Floridas Gulf coast remains free from the threat of offshore drilling  The motion to conclude debate passed the Senate 72 to 23  Final passage of the bill is expected later this week  Following Senate action  the measure will go to the House of Representatives for consideration   Now is the time and this is the opportunity to protect the state of Florida  said Martinez  As we sought protection  protection we got  I feel good about this bill  I think it is the best that Florida can do at this point in time    Speaking on the Senate floor  Senator Martinez said   Mr  President  for the last several days  we ve been discussing the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act and today we have a cloture vote on this very important piece of legislation  For my part  Ive tried to make it clear how important this legislation is to my state  to the state of Florida  how important the protection of our fragile environment in our state is to our state  to our people   As a young 15 year old  I came to Florida  as many people who ve transplanted from elsewhere to enjoy Floridas lifestyle  and since that time I have been in love with this wonderful state  what it has to offer to people  to families  and the great traditions that Florida has had as a place to enjoy the outdoors  I have on countless occasions enjoyed Floridas beaches  enjoyed fishing  and enjoyed other outdoor pursuits which are such a natural part of what Florida is about   And as years have gone by  Ive passed that on and instilled that in my children and as I did a little bit yesterday  passed it on to my grandchildren as we were enjoying New Smyrna Beach yesterday under that hot Florida sun with those beautiful sandy beaches  For Floridians  this is about protecting the future  It s about passing that love on to future generations by ensuring that Florida remains pristine  that it remains the kind of place that visitors from all over the country choose to come  to enjoy year after year and where other Florida families might begin and develop and enjoy their own family traditions  enjoying the great outdoors that Florida has to offer  our sandy beaches  the fishing  and other recreational opportunities that come about as a result of this wonderful natural habitat that we have  but also protecting it is important as an important economic condition   Part of what makes Floridas economy so thriving is tourism  Before there was Disney and Universal Studios and those types of attractions  there were beaches  there was the climate that brought folks to Florida to come and enjoy and at the end of the day that is our calling card  So protecting Floridas environment is not something that we take lightly  And protecting Floridas environment is not something that is a Republican or a Democrat issue  That s why Senator Nelson  my colleague from the state of Florida  and I have worked so closely together over the last year or so as this great debate has raged on about what to do to protect Florida while at the same time yielding to evermore increasing pressures to drill and to explore in the Outer Continental Shelf   In the United States Senate  I maintain another tradition    a tradition of Floridas senators Connie Mack and Bob Graham and others who have fought over time to protect Floridas treasures from those interests who don t share our values  So Im proud to be part of that tradition  to have worked for what I believe has been a good compromise for our state  Along with Senator Nelson  the members of the Florida delegation in the House of Representatives have worked diligently as well to protect their areas of Florida and to protect the state and at the same time    understanding the great pressures that we re under and the great battle that has gotten fiercer and fiercer as demands increase for evermore production of gas and oil  as the prices at the pump continue to go up  as the prices drive businesses abroad and overseas because of the high cost of natural gas  that pressure has been ever increasing   But what I want to do here in summary today is convey to the people across the state and also across our nation that this bill puts the control of the future of our state in our hands  It really does because as the map here shows  it provides a tremendous zone of protection for the state of Florida  125 miles south of Pensacola in the Panhandle  but also 320 some miles from Naples  237 from Tampa  This yellow area here is all part of that zone of protection that Florida will enjoy until the year 2022  It s a long time from now   As a result of that protection  we ve also done something very important to our state  which is upholding the tradition of our military readiness  This is the military mission line here  where no drilling will take place east of this    this line right here  And what this does is it protects the training missions that take place out of Eglin Air Force Base  out of Hurlburt Field  and the Naval Air Station in Pensacola as well  They train  they practice  they test in this area here  they use the guided munitions that are such a necessary part of the dangerous world in which we live  But those marvelous weapons that sometimes can make the difference between striking the right target or not are tested here in the Gulf of Mexico  In addition to that  the F 22 fighter  which is going to be a very important part of the future of our military readiness  is going to be training here  Because it is so fast it requires the vastness of the Gulf of Mexico for them to be able to conduct their maneuvers and training exercises that are necessary   So this is a zone of protection for our state until the year 2022 and  you know  some might say  Well it protects the Gulf  but what about the Keys and the East Coast  Fortunately  that part of Florida is under a moratorium and is protected until the year 2012   But in addition we have to remember that the important protection here is to the Gulf coast  Because what has been under siege  what has been gone after is this area here deemed as Lease Area 181 and this area here which is known as the Stovepipe  This is what we ve been seeking to protect so that we can protect our beaches until we had assurances that as we allowed  or as exploration took place in this area here for what is such a needed product  that we also were protecting the military line  we re protecting Floridas west coast  The east coast at this point is not under the same kind of threat and  at the end of the day  there are going to be other attempts that we will have to fight on and do what we can to protect Florida   But at this moment in time the crucial protection was to the Gulf coast  Im very thankful to Senator Domenici  Chairman of the Energy Committee  who has worked closely with me  who has allowed me to play a role in crafting this important legislation  understanding or attempting to understand Floridas concerns  attempting to understand the difficult choices that we have to make in this issue  and also appreciate the members of the House of Representatives  They have passed a very different bill from this one  I believe that the protections for Florida in this bill are superior  but I take a moment here to thank them for their diligence  for their vigilance for our state  for trying to come up with solutions and answers in a different environment than I have worked in here with Senator Nelson in the Senate   I want to make sure that with great respect we hope that this is the legislation that will ultimately emerge and be passed by both Houses  I cannot support the House version of what it passed  and I have had clear assurances from our leaders that we are committed to working from the framework of the Senate bill  That has been important to me  and while I respect the hard work of our House colleagues and their autonomy as a body of Congress  I do believe also that we have to prevail on the Senate version of this bill  It is what the Senate can support  It is what can pass this year  It is the reality of the situation  And Im hopeful that we can impress upon our colleagues in the House by an overwhelming vote of support for this measure that now is the time and that this is the opportunity to protect the state of Florida while at the same time providing some measure of improvement to the conditions that we find ourselves in today with such a desperate need for oil and gas   This area here is rich in not only oil but also in natural gas  And natural gas production    the natural gas production in this area may be greater than that of oil  But that s a tremendously important resource for our nation today  as we continue to try to power our plants and other facilities  at a time when so much of our electricity is being generated by the use of natural gas  It is important that we do all that we can to bring down the price of natural gas  Chairman Domenici believes that in talking with people in the industry that the passage of this bill could have a significant impact on the price of futures as it relates to natural gas  I hope that will come to pass because that will bode well for our nation s energy needs and also bode well for those who are trying to maintain here jobs that have been recently moving overseas   Another part of this bill    and the senator from Louisiana I see here on the floor  who has been such a good person to work with  very understanding of Florida  but while also with a very different perspective from her state  And I know that the revenue sharing parts of this bill are going to be a great opportunity for the Gulf states that do so much of the dirty work involving this  who put their shoreline on the line so that the United States can be more energy self sufficient  will also reap some benefits so they can renourish their shoreline and they can do the things that are necessary as a result of the demanding nature of this work   Florida won t be doing that  Florida sought protection rather than revenue  As we sought protection  protection we got  I feel good about this bill  I think it is the best that Florida can do at this point in time  I think it is also a good thing for our state because the zone of protection that we ve been wanting to have  which was 125 miles  has been greatly exceeded in most dimensions and we can go forward until the year 2022 with a settled plate understanding there will be some production coming out of the Gulf but it will not impact our state                                                                    July 2006 News Releases             Browse by
