                               MARTINEZ  FLORIDIANS PROUDLY CONTRIBUTE TO HURRICANE RELIEF WHILE MANY STILL NEED HELP  September 15  2005   WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today delivered remarks on the floor of the U S  Senate highlighting  Florida  s efforts to help with Hurricane Katrina relief  Senator Martinez also called on his colleagues to remember that  Florida  has also suffered significant damage from hurricanes over the last two years  and assistance is still needed to ensure its long term recovery  The full remarks as delivered on the floor of the Senate are attached below  Mr  President  it has been three weeks since Hurricane Katrina came ashore bringing her wide swath of damage and wind swept structures to devastation  her rains destroyed thousands of agricultural crops  and sadly the force of this storm resulted in death  Mr  President  while today I rise to speak about Hurricane Katrina  I do want to focus my remarks on the devastation that this storm brought to the state of Florida  We all know the devastation in the Gulf Coast states of Alabama  Mississippi  and Louisiana  But before that  Katrina paid a costly and deadly visit to the state of Florida        Fourteen deaths and over a billion dollars in damage to our state  The governor declared a state of emergency and evacuations took place  and as you may recall  last year Florida was visited by four serious hurricanes  By the time Katrina hit  already we had received over 150  of the normal rainfall for the year and more rain brought about a substantial amount of flooding        Mr  President  before Katrina came to Florida  we had been visited by  as I said  four hurricanes last year  Over 10  of Floridas homes were damaged  The storm displaced tens of thousands of people into shelters  And today  Mr  President  over 20 000 Floridians are still living in some form of transitional housing  The backlog of roof repair is so severe that were sending our children to schools that are developing mold problems and whole sectors of our agricultural industry are devastated  Frankly  these crops will take years to replant and renourish themselves        I wanted to take a few moments to mention that even though the people of my state are still recovering from the effects of Katrina and Dennis and Charley and Frances  Ivan  and Jeanne  even though folks are still living in trailers outside their homes that have blue tarps on their roofs  Floridians are proudly pitching in to help the people of the Gulf Coast region        Sarasota  Florida is sending hundreds of teams of Red Cross volunteers in two week cycles and in some cases longer than that  These volunteers are headed to the very areas where evacuees are streaming out  Theres no power  no clean water  no hot showers  and theyre bringing evacuees back with them to Sarasota County  over 300 so far        Earlier this week  I had occasion to visit the Red Cross Center in Orlando  Over 200 volunteers volunteer their services there  as hundreds and the expected thousands of evacuees are coming into that central Florida area  where they are finding that the hotel industry has made arrangements for them to receive temporary housing in the area  Many hotels in the community are pouring out their love and their care in helping find jobs and dealing with issues of physical as well as mental health as well as getting children to reincorporate themselves into the school system        The Tampa Incident Management Group has sent 22 members to Hancock County  Mississippi  where they worked 16 hours for seven days  The group included emergency management personnel  firefighters  logistical support  public information officers  police  and crisis counselors  One of the members of the E O C   Mr  Richard Shepard  says he felt the responsibility to go to Mississippi because he needed to give something back for all the help that he received last year        The South Florida Urban Search and Rescue Team comprised of 80 firefighters from agencies throughout Miami Dade and Broward counties returned home after spending nearly two weeks helping Hurricane Katrina victims in the Gulf Coast        A group of Bask Palmer Ophthalmologists is headed to Baton Rouge this week aboard a van to treat displaced victims of Hurricane Katrina who have lost eyeglasses and suffered other vision problems because of the storm        The Panama City Boatmans Association sent three truck convoys to Louisiana and Mississippi  Among the supplies  150 cases of water  80 cases of Gatorade  and 10 large bags of dog and cat food because the evacuees said they had something to eat  but their pets were literally starving        Similar stories can be heard from throughout the state of Florida  And I want to deal with another one  the members of our armed forces and our National Guard have also answered the call and sought to help        But I want to particularly talk about a Florida resident and Navy pilot  Lieutenant J G  Bale  Dalton    Hes a member of the Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 21  The Blackjack Squadron  out of San Diego        When the call came through that hurricane relief was needed  his squadron flew helicopters across the nation in order to be there in time for them to help  Now  his father  who is my dear and longtime friend and currently my General Counsel  Skip Dalton  has allowed me to read a little bit from his communications in those first few frantic days        September 3  My first sight of New Orleans  writes Lieutenant J G Dalton  was incredibly hectic  We went due east so I was not able to see any of the   Mississippi Coast     The scene was chaos  Hardly anyone was able to get into the city on the ground and the water was still rising        Helicopters from all services and even civilians were operating in the area rescuing people and bringing food and supplies to rally points  An airborne command and control element was tasking P 3 airplanes as fast as they could  But most often they were not able to give more than a G P S  coordinate and a Good Luck        Another entry from September 3  we were sent to a nursing home to remove what we thought were invalid older people  What we found was a small island of land with a field large enough to land three helicopters around what used to be a nursing home        We moved approximately 50 people  all families that were directed by New Orleans police to that spot        September 4  No rest for the weary  After returning to work with about five hours of rest  not sleep  just time for landing and briefing again  we again began to build a picture of what was going on  People that had been stranded since the day of the storm had hit were beginning to come out of the woodwork        It was obvious that the first priority was to save people from the rising tides  I went back into New Orleans later that day with a mission to find fire buckets and begin putting out fires        Heres another entry from later that day  We attempted to hoist people from an apartment complex into our helicopter but were refused when they saw an ambulance a few blocks away that they were going to try to swim to  Hard to understand for me but Im sure the thought of being hoisted up on a wire to a helicopter is a scary prospect for most people  We moved from that area to an affected area in the northern part of the city to evacuate another group of people gathered by the police  We landed on a tennis court        As you heard in the case of Navy Lieutenant J G Dalton  rescuing people from the rising tides  people are working to bring relief to the Gulf Coast  But as dramatic as these stories are  theyre not unusual  This is what America is all about  If there is a need  Americans are there to help        Mr  President  given the impact of the stories and images of the devastation  I understand how our hearts and minds are turned to these current problems        But Im humbly here to ask that we simply do not overlook the fact that there has been a lot of suffering in Florida  that we too have suffered significant losses as a result of four very difficult hurricanes last year  an unprecedented number of major hurricanes to hit  crisscrossing the state of Florida  only to be revisited again by hurricanes Dennis and Katrina this year        The extent of hurricane damage from last year was severe and  in fact  we continue to try to dig out from under it  Long term housing  Mr  President is one of the serious problems  Affordable long term housing is an issue were facing in Florida        Not only because of so much housing stock  particularly the affordable type that was damaged last year  but now with the influx of evacuees into the state  some real long term problems are beginning to present themselves        Ive contacted our president  Ive contacted his agriculture secretary Mike Johanns  and I have talked with FEMA and my colleagues here in the Senate        Weve received some measure of assistance but we must continue to look forward to the time when all Floridians will be made whole and when life will begin to be normal again for all Floridians  Katrina did pay a devastating visit in the early part of that storm  and while we continue to pour out our hearts to those on the Gulf Coast  I do have to insist  I have to hope that the people of Florida will not be forgotten as we seek to make all of the necessary decisions for the relief and recovery not only short term  not only medium term  but where Florida is now  in the long term  The needs of long term housing  the needs of long term health care problems  the needs of reconstruction of public facilities like schools becomes all the more necessary  Thank you  Mr  President                                                                      September 2005 News Releases             Browse by                                                                                                                                                              Current record
