Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today urged his colleagues to swiftly approve the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006  The conference report measure contains billions of dollars that will benefit Floridas military infrastructure and personnel including more than  316 million in Florida related defense projects requested by Senator Martinez  The U S  House of Representatives has approved the measure  Senate passage is being delayed by parliamentary maneuvers unrelated to defense spending   We are a nation at war and we need to move this bill forward  These dollars are critical to the nation  theyre critical to Florida  and theyre necessary for the overall national security missions of the United States  said Senator Martinez  From Floridas perspective  these dollars are critical to maintaining the military infrastructure of our state and ensuring our men and women have the resources they need   Florida is home to 21 military installations and three unified commands  Each of Floridas 67 counties is home to defense related spending  With a high concentration of military installations and defense contractors in Florida  the impact of defense spending on Floridas economy is substantial  an estimated  44 billion economic impact and employing more than 714 000 Floridians  The measure also includes  170 million for Jacksonville based Armor Holdings  Inc   manufacturer of the up armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle  M1114   Senator Martinez singled out three defense appropriations projects that significantly advance areas of need  Under this bill NAS Pensacola will receive  17 million for the procurement of new T 6A Texan trainer aircraft for undergraduate pilot training  Florida State University will receive  2 million for nanotube research  and STIDD Systems in Marathon  Florida will receive  5 million for Multi Role Intermediate Support Craft    Floridas military value is the reason we did so well in the recent round of base closure and realignment  said Martinez  These projects are important to our national security  They speak to the future of our installations and are an important part of the future of Floridas military presence   Also included in the bill is a revenue sharing structure from bonus bids and royalties in ANWR  The state of Florida is expected to receive  300 million initially  and based upon current estimates  the state will potentially receive  50 million a year for 30 years to assist with hurricane recovery efforts  This is a significant amount of money that could provide an immediate shot in the arm for Florida   Florida projects included in the bill   Item  Autonomic Logistics Amount   2 500 000 Account  Research  Development  Navy Recipient  DME
