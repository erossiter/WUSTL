                               SENATOR MARTINEZ  R FL  OFFERS REMARKS IN HONOR OF FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN TILLIE FOWLER   March 3  2005   Washington   U S  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL  today offered the following remarks on the Senate floor regarding the passing of former Congresswoman Tillie Fowler       I rise today with a heavy heart  This week  Florida lost one of its best public servants with the passing of former Congresswoman Tillie Fowler of Jacksonville  Tillie was taken suddenly from us after suffering a brain hemorrhage earlier this week  She was a good friend  a devoted public servant  and a great Floridian        In every way  Tillie was a great lady  She had such unique combination of strengths  Tillie has been referred to as a    Steel Magnolia       She was ever gracious and kind    a gentle soul        But at the same time she was firm in her convictions and had a great intellect and grasp of the issues  She was a natural leader       Even though Tillie had left the House of Representatives  people in the highest ranks of government still wanted to know     Well  what does Tillie think     Especially when it came to matters of our U S  military   Most recently  Tillie served on the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee  which provides counsel to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld on policy and strategy       I relied often on her sound judgment as well  Most recently we had been talking about Mayport and the USS Kennedy and what the Florida delegation could do to best ensure the long term viability of Mayport  And she was an instrumental advisor on BRAC and the BRAC process       Tillie was a great friend and counselor to me personally        It was only about this time last year that she and I were standing near the St  John   s River in Jacksonville and she announced her support of my campaign for the United States Senate  I am so grateful for her support and her faith in me        Her wisdom will be missed  But her legacy is firmly in place        Tillie Fowler began her life as a public servant shortly after earning her undergraduate and law degrees from Emory University        She then came to Washington to work for three years as a legislative assistant to Representative Robert Stephens of Georgia  and shortly thereafter went to work at the Nixon White House in the Office of Consumer Affairs        At the White House  Tillie met and made one of her dearest lifelong friends     our colleague Senator Elizabeth Dole  Tillie and her husband Buck even named one of their daughters Elizabeth in honor of that great friendship         Tillie looked to Elizabeth Dole as a role model for working women     as someone who could be strong without being hard edged  and she followed that example of success  I want to give my condolences and my prayers to Senator Dole today for the loss of her good friend        After her tenure at the White House  Tillie and her husband Buck  moved to Jacksonville where they settled down to raise their family         Tillie became active in several community organizations  including the American Red Cross and the Jacksonville Junior League   She eventually ran for city council in the mid eighties and served for seven years     the last year as City Council President  She was the first female     and the first Republican     to serve as President of the Jacksonville City Council        In 1992  Tillie Fowler became Congresswoman Tillie Fowler and quickly rose to be the one of the top ranking Republican women in the House of Representatives          She became Vice Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and for six years  chief deputy whip        Congresswoman Fowler served on the House Committee on Armed Services and the House Committee on Transportation  Both committees allowed her to become a successful advocate for the city of Jacksonville and the state of Florida         But I think Tillie will always be remembered for her great grasp of defense policy  her impassioned advocacy on behalf of the United States military         In 2000  Congresswoman Fowler voluntarily stepped down to honor her own term limits pledge and returned to private life         Without a doubt the most important legacy left by our friend Tillie Fowler is her family     her husband  Buck  and their two daughters  Elizabeth and Tillie         Our hearts are with you  our thoughts and prayers go out to you during this difficult time         I know that it is never easy to lose a loved one     especially with as little warning as in this case  but I hope that somehow you can take some comfort in the love  the goodwill and true friendships Tillie has generated over her lifetime in Florida and in Washington         We will miss her greatly  God bless                                                                 March 2005 News Releases             Browse by
