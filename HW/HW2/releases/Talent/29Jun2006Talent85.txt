SEN. TALENT SECURES $1.5 MILLION FOR UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI HEALTH SCIENCES RESEARCH CENTER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $1.5 million for the Health Sciences Research and Education Facility at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Sen. Jim Talent's request on behalf of University of Missouri was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The University is an established world leader in health care research and these funds will go toward construction of the new Health Sciences Research Center," said Sen. Talent. "This center will be a state-of-the-art facility that will help MU improve our health care system and save lives. Getting this funding approved in committee was a critical step, now I will continue pushing for it when the bill comes to the floor of the Senate." 
   The new facility will link basic research in cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other major health care challenges with the training and education of present and future health care providers, resulting in safe and cost effective health care. The center also will provide a strong central link in Missouri's biotechnology corridor that stretches from St. Louis to Kansas City. The jobs, research grant funding and commercial impact of the center will increase economic prosperity throughout the state.
   The appropriation will provide the initial money necessary to begin construction on the new 410,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility that will provide students and faculty the space and resources they need to conduct first-class health care research. Last year, Sen. Talent secured $1.5 million to begin initial planning and design for the center. 
   Sen. Talent's funding request passed the Senate Appropriations Committee, and must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill before being signed into law.
