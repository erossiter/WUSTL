SENS. TALENT-OBAMA LEGISLATION TO INCREASE AVAILABILITY OF 85 PERCENT ETHANOL-BLENDED FUEL INCLUDED IN ENERGY BILL
  Sens. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) today successfully added to the Energy bill their bipartisan legislation to increase the availability of fuels blended with 85 percent ethanol.  
 The Talent-Obama bill provides a tax credit incentive for businesses that add one or more E-85 pumps to their fueling stations. E-85 is a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent petroleum gasoline.
   "This legislation is an investment in our energy infrastructure that will help reduce the price of gasoline over the long term," said Sen. Talent, co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus. "Missourians want to buy American fuel - grown by our farmers - but there are only 24 stations in the state that sell E-85. Our legislation provides an incentive for businesses, large and small, to make E-85 more available to consumers."
   Talent and Obama's legislation was originally approved as part of the Senate Highway bill, but this morning an agreement was reached to include it in the Energy bill with other renewable fuels tax credits.
   Talent and Obama's legislation provides a tax credit incentive of 30 percent through 2010 for switching one or more traditional petroleum pumps to E-85 fueling systems. The legislation is strongly supported by the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition.
   There are about 3.5 million E-85 vehicles on the road today. Ford, GMC, DaimlerChrysler and other manufacturers have produced vehicles that can run on E-85 or petroleum gasoline when E-85 is unavailable. Increased availability of E-85 would likely increase the demand for these vehicles, creating jobs and economic growth in America's auto manufacturing sector.
