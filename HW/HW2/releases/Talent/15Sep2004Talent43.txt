SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR BUCHANAN COUNTY, ST. JOSEPH LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $250,000 for the Buchanan County, City of St.  
 Joseph, and Heartland Law Enforcement Communications System to be included in the FY 2005 Commerce Justice State Appropriations Bill. 
   "I have supported this project in the past and will continue to support it," said Sen. Talent. "This communications system will allow for the use of in-car mobile data system. Officers responding to a call will have instant access, via lap top computer, to all critical information, such as criminal and driving records. The system will also add a new user, the Missouri National Guard in order to better coordinate responses to emergency calls." 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
