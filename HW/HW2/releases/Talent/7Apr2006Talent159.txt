SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FIRST DAY OF NEW LIMITS ON COLD PRODUCTS UNDER COMBAT METH ACT
  Sen. Jim Talent today announced that beginning tomorrow, the first purchase requirements required in the Sen. Talent-Feinstein Combat Meth Act will go into effect. On April 8, the consumer purchases cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, the primary ingredients needed to make meth, will be restricted to 3.6 grams in one day and 9 grams per month. The Combat Meth Act requires those medicines to be placed behind the pharmacy counter and sets a limit on how much one person can buy in a 30-day period.  
   "This is a landmark day in the fight against methamphetamine," said Sen. Talent, chief co-sponsored of the Combat Meth Act and co-chair of the Anti-meth Caucus. "This provision in the bill will prevent meth cooks from stocking up on piles of pills, gels caps and liquids containing the key ingredient needed to cook meth. The important thing legitimate consumers need to remember is that they will still have access to the medicine they need, but the meth cooks won't be able to stock up."
   Law enforcement officials from around the country stressed that this step is critical to helping knock down the meth in our neighborhoods. The Talent-Feinstein legislation is modeled after the successful Oklahoma law which saw an immediate 80 percent decline in meth lab busts. 
   The Combat Meth Act is the toughest, most comprehensive anti-meth package ever considered by the Congress. The legislation restricts the sale of products containing ingredients needed to cook meth, provides new tools to states, local law enforcement and prosecutors to combat meth and includes treatment funding to help those affected by meth.
   Restricting the Sale of Ingredients to Cook Meth 
   * Restricts and records the sale of medicines containing meth precursors including pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. 
   * Relocates these products behind the counter, requiring purchasers to show identification and sign a logbook. 
   * Allows legitimate consumers to get the medicine they need, but limits how much one person can buy to 9 grams a month and 3.6 grams in a single day. 
   * Creates a new DEA classification for meth precursors to imposes tougher penalties for meth cooks while allowing legitimate consumers to access the medicines they need without a prescription. 
   Law enforcement organizations supporting the Talent-Feinstein Combat Meth Act include the Missouri Sheriff's Association, the Missouri Highway Patrol, the National District Attorneys Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Attorney Generals Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Narcotics Officers' Association, the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, and the National Alliance of State Drug Enforcement Agencies.
