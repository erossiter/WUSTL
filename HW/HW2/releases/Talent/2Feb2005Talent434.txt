SEN. TALENT COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) tonight attended the State of Union address and issued the following statement on President Bush's remarks: 
   "The President delivered a simple, but powerful speech. He laid out a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda that includes a comprehensive energy bill, liability reform and tax relief for workers and families. These measures will build on the economic momentum of the last few years.
   "I was also pleased the President talked about lowering health care costs through Association Health Plans - legislation I'm sponsoring in the Senate. If you work for a small business or a farm, our legislation will reduce the cost of your health insurance by up to 30 percent, it will provide health care to millions of people who don't have it and it won't cost the taxpayer anything.
   "The President talked about the importance of winning the war on terror and his plan for the future of Iraq which includes additional training for Iraqi security forces to defeat the terrorists. He understands now is not the time to quit in Iraq.
   "It was entirely appropriate and fitting that the President paid tribute to the more than 1,400 men and women who gave their lives to secure our freedom and bring democracy to the Iraqi people. If we hold true to our ideals and our commitment to freedom, this generation of servicemen and women will have extended liberty to the Iraqi people, just as previous generations of Americans have all across the globe."
