SEN. TALENT VOTES TO CONFIRM JUDGE ALITO TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today voted to confirm Judge Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court.  
 The full Senate voted to confirm Judge Alito after yesterday's filibuster overwhelmingly failed. 
   Sen. Talent issued the following statement today following the vote:
   "Judge Alito has the experience, the temperament and integrity that America expects in a Supreme Court Justice.
   "Judge Alito understands that a Supreme Court Justice's only obligation - and it's a solemn obligation - is to the rule of law. As Chief Justice Roberts said when he was testifying before the Judiciary Committee: Judges are umpires. They are not the rule-makers. The people are the rule-makers, through their representatives, in their laws and in their Constitution. 
   "I was proud to vote to confirm Judge Alito and I believe that based on my study of his record and my discussions with him, he will turn out to be one of our best Supreme Court Justices."
