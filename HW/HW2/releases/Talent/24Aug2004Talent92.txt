SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR MISSISSIPPI COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $51,706 Community Facility Grant to the City of East Prairie.  
 The funds will be used to purchase and renovate an existing building.
   "I am pleased that the community of East Prairie will be receiving this funding," said Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "The renovated building will house the City's museum and offices. The facility will also offer new space for a technical skills training center, which will offer educational opportunities for residents in Mississippi County. I appreciate the Administration's efforts in recognizing the needs of rural communities in Southeast Missouri."
   Community Facility Grants may be made to public bodies and nonprofit organizations to assist in the development of essential community facilities for public use in small, poor and needy communities and may be made for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the project. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and health care facilities.
