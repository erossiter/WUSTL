SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR FAMILY HEALTH CENTER OF BOONE COUNTY
 Sen. Jim Talent (R-MO) was in Columbia today to announce a nearly quarter million dollar appropriation for the Family Health Center of Boone County (FHC). Sen.  
 Talent secured $246,040 for the renovation of the facility constructed in the former Nowell's grocery store building.
   "The Family Health Center of Boone County provides critical health care services to those in need," Talent said. "I am pleased to be a part of today's ceremony, and I am confident that this new, expanded facility will be a great asset for the community and the people of Boone County."
   Sen. Talent's funding request for FHC was part of the FY 2004 appropriations package which passed the Senate earlier this year. The newly renovated building will help FHC provide greater access to health care for area residents. The renovation process is scheduled to be completed by next month.
   Since 1992 FHC has grown from serving approximately 2000 patients to over thirty-five thousand in 2003. As a Federally Qualified Health Center, FHC provides medical, limited mental and oral health services including: preventive and health maintenance, chronic disease care, family planning and prenatal care, care for newborns and children, medication assistance, referral to specialty health care providers and social service agencies and language translation services.
   Senator Talent serves on the Special Committee on Aging and is a member of the Rural Health Caucus.
