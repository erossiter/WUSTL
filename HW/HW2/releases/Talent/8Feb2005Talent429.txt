SENS. TALENT, BOND ANNOUNCE FEMA ASSISTANCE FOR LAKE ANNETTE
  Sens. Jim Talent (R-MO) and Kit Bond (R-MO) today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has released more than $1 million in federal funding to help reduce future damages caused by flooding in Lake Annette.  
   "This has been a very difficult time for many Missourians living in Lake Annette," said Sen. Talent. "Unpredictable flooding last summer severely hurt the lives and livelihoods of many families and business owners in the area. Sen. Bond and I have been working with FEMA to make certain we provide as many resources as possible to assist in the rebuilding effort."
   "These funds will make a real difference to the folks at Lake Annette. I am pleased that FEMA has responded to this community's need," said Sen. Kit Bond. "Hazard Mitigation dollars have been critical to countless communities, and without them, thousands of lives would be in jeopardy. I will continue to fight to protect these funds from the IRS. I introduced a bill last week that ensures that the IRS's tax on Hazard Mitigation funds does not see the light of day."
   The money will be provided through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). HMGP provides 75 percent of the funds for approved projects that lessen or eliminate the loss of lives and property in future disasters. The remaining 25 percent must be provided from non-federal sources. 
   In May of 2004, severe weather including tornadoes and flooding caused extensive damages to homes and businesses in Cass County. These funds will be used for the voluntary acquisition of residential flood prone structures within the community of Lake Annette. Once the structures are purchased and demolished, the land will be deed restricted and no future development will occur. 
   The total project cost is $1,395,030. Of that, the federal share is $1,046,273. The remaining 25 percent, $348,757, will be paid by Missouri State General Revenue Funds.
