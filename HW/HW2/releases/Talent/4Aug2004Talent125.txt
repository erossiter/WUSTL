SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $22.78 MILLION GRANT TO MISSOURI FOR DRUG RECOVERY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a $22.78 million grant to the state of Missouri for a drug recovery program.  
 The "Access to Recovery" grant will aid those seeking drug and alcohol treatment and support services through the program. Missouri will receive $7.6 million per year for three years. 
   "I am very pleased to announce that Missouri will be receiving these funds to help those who need help with drug and alcohol abuse," said Sen. Talent. "Substance abuse, particularly methamphetamines, is a very serious problem in Missouri. While we support efforts to curb drug use, we also need to make treatment a priority. Programs like Access to Recovery will allow people to choose service providers to break their addiction. It also ensures that the people who want help can get it. The federal government should continue taking a proactive role in assisting people who struggle with substance abuse."
   The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will administer the grant program. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded nearly $100 million in Access to Recovery grants. Missouri was one of the 14 states that received the funding for this year. In Fiscal Year 2005, President Bush has proposed doubling the funding for Access to Recovery to help even more of those seeking treatment.
