SEN. TALENT APPLAUDS UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-ROLLA STUDENTS FOR SELECTION FOR 2007 SOLAR DECATHLON
  Sen. Jim Talent today congratulated members of the University of Missouri-Rolla for being selected to participate in the 2007 Solar Decathlon.  
 The students will compete with 19 other teams in creating a solar-powered home. Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Energy Committee, said the student's participation is not only another distinction for the University of Missouri system, it also has the potential to increase awareness for energy conservation and independence. 
   "The University of Missouri-Rolla's engineering program attracts the best and brightest students in Missouri and around the country," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent. "I want to congratulate the students and faculty for being selected to compete in the decathlon. And I am confident Missouri's team will raise the bar for excellence and innovation in the competition. I'm a big believer that renewable energy of all kinds will result in greater energy independence and prosperity for Americans. The decathlon is designed to raise everyone's awareness of the importance of energy conservation and independence. I wish Missouri's team the very best in the competition."
   The Solar Decathlon competition takes place every other year in Washington D.C. The teams compete to design, build and operate an energy-efficient, completely solar-powered house. 
   Last summer, the Senate passed an historic Energy bill that included provisions to promote renewable energy of all kinds. Sen. Talent, co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, successfully added a Renewable Fuels Standard to the Energy bill requiring 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel to be added to the nation's fuel supply by 2012.
