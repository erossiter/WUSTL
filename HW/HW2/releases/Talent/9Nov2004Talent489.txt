SEN. TALENT COMMENTS ON ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHCROFT'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on Attorney General John Ashcroft's resignation:
   "John Ashcroft served with distinction as our Attorney General. He was enormously effective after the 9/11 attacks transforming the FBI from strictly a crime-fighting agency to an anti-terror agency and his actions have made the country safer.
   "He is also a longtime servant of Missouri serving with distinction and integrity. I wish him and Janet the best of health and the best in all of their future endeavors."
