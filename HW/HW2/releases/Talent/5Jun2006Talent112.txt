SEN. TALENT WELCOMES DEBATE ON TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a co-sponsor of the Marriage Protection Amendment (S. J. Res. 1), today encouraged debate on the measure that would add to the Constitution the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. The resolution also prohibits the Constitution or any state constitution from being construed to require that marital status or its legal incidents be conferred upon any union other than that of a man and a woman. The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment later this week.  
   "The courts of this country are engaged in a process by which they are going to force the people of this country, whether they like it or not, to accept a fundamental change in the basic building block of our society," said Sen. Talent. 
   Sen. Talent supported a similar measure, S. J. Res 40, in 2004 when it was filibustered by 50 senators voting against the constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage. The resolution before the Senate currently has 32 cosponsors. Sixty votes are needed to bring the amendment to the floor for an up-or-down vote. Then, the amendment will have to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate for final passage.
   "I support the marriage amendment because a Constitutional amendment is the only sure means now remaining for trying to preserve the traditional definition of marriage," said Sen. Talent. "If the courts complete the process of imposing their views on the people, their decisions will be irreversible through any process other than Constitutional amendment."
