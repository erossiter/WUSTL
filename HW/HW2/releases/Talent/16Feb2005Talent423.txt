SENS. TALENT, BOND ANNOUNCE $2 MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FOR KANSAS CITY TRANSIT SYSTEM
  Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond (R-Mo.) today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a $2,061,464 grant to the Kansas City Area transportation Authority.  
 The grant will be used to construct a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and purchase 33 replacement buses in Kansas City. 
   "I am pleased to announce this funding for the City and the Kansas City region," said Senator Talent. "Transportation infrastructure funding is vital across Missouri whether it's roads, bridges or mass transit. These dollars will help relieve pressure on our highway system which improves safety, increases productivity and gets products to market faster."
   "These dollars are an investment in the future of Kansas City. A good transportation system, whether its roads, bridges, or buses, is vital to economic development," said Senator Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "Public transportation is critical for Missourians who depend on buses to get to work, class, the doctor, or to pick a child up from daycare."
   This grant will use the balance of fiscal year 2004 Capitol Investment Bus funds earmarked by Congress to Kansas City, Missouri/Kansas and the State of Missouri. This amendment plus $7,457,052 previously approved by FTA brings the total Federal amount for the project to $9,518,516.
