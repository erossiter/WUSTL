SEN. TALENT SECURES HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR KANSAS CITY'S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE
  The greater Kansas City region's transportation infrastructure got a big boost today thanks to Sen.  
 Jim Talent (R-Mo.). The U.S. Senate approved Talent's request to send a half million dollars to the Kansas City SmartPort, a centralized trading zone connecting transportation infrastructure of all kinds. Talent's request passed as part of the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate.
   "This funding will allow Kansas City to further develop an inland port capable of processing a greater volume of international trade," said Sen. Talent. "This project is a priority for me because trade opportunities in our inland ports are key to Kansas City, which is an important transportation hub. The Kansas City SmartPort is an innovative solution to increase to international trade opportunities. The improvements this funding will make possible will not only attract businesses, but also increase jobs in Kansas City."
