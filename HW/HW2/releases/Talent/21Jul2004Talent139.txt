SEN. TALENT, REP. GRAVES ANNOUNCE FIRE GRANT FOR BRAYMER
  Sen. Jim Talent and Rep. Sam Graves announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $51,498 grant for the Braymer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used for operations and firefighter safety.
   "The federal government continues to provide new resources for our local first responders," Sen. Talent said. "As Braymer fire fighters do their job, we must continue doing ours by providing funding for local needs. The least we can do is help provide protection for the folks who save lives and property in our communities."
   "I appreciate the service of the firefighters in Braymer," Graves said. "We must invest in their safety and effectiveness and this grant will help supply them with the training and equipment necessary to carry out their duty. Firefighters are trained to handle a wide range of problems and disasters and this grant provides the needed investment to help them meet the challenge."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
