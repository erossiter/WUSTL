SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $45,000 FIRE GRANT FOR PLATO
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $45,000 grant for the Plato Rural Fire Protective Association.  
 The funds will be used to purchase ten complete sets of turn-out gear, six new breathing apparatuses and wild land protective clothing.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Plato Rural Fire Protective Association will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters are committed to protecting our homes and business in the event of a fire. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "We will have brand new protective gear," said Lyle Adcock, Secretary of the Plato Rural Fire Protective Association. "We assist other rural fire departments in servicing approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people in the surrounding area. This new equipment will allow us to be a more meaningful part of that protection system."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
