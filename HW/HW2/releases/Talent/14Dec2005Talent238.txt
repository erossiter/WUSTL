SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON TAUM SAUK RESERVOIR BREAK
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the reservoir break at the Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Plant: 
   "We have been working with county and state officials throughout the day in response to the reservoir break. I have spoken personally with the governor and we are getting regular updates. In addition, my staff is assisting on the ground.
   "As always, my primary concern is the safety and health of our people. Officials have notified Missourians in down stream communities who could be threatened by a water surge so they can evacuate and move to higher ground if necessary. And I've been assured that every effort is being made to provide medical treatment to those who need it.
   "We are praying for the Park Superintendent and his family and for the people of Lesterville.
   "I'm continuing to monitor the situation and working with local, state and federal official to assess the needs of Missourians so we can provide whatever resources are necessary."
