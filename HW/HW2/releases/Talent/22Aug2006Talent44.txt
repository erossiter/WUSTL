SEN. TALENT COMMEMORATES 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF WELFARE REFORM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) announced that today marks the 10th anniversary of the enactment of the welfare reform law. Sen. JimTalent was one of the original architects of the legislation while he served Missouri in the U.S. House. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, passed on August 22, 1996, fundamentally changing the nation's welfare system, focusing on work and healthy marriage.  
   "Welfare reform has been one of the most successful social policy reforms in the history of the Congress," Sen. Talent said. "We reformed the old system based on the understanding that the two best anti-poverty programs are work and marriage. This legislation strengthens welfare reform by requiring states to extend the benefits of work to able bodied individuals still on the rolls. It also includes important provisions encouraging healthy marriages which are essential to continuing the success of the original reform." 
   As a freshman member of the U.S. House, then-Congressman Talent introduced legislation that subsequently became the basis for the historic welfare reform law. Since 1996, welfare caseloads have fallen dramatically. The number of families on welfare has dropped from 4.3 million in August 1996 to 1.9 in June 2005. From August 1996 to December 2005, Missouri showed a 50.4 percent decrease in the number of families receiving welfare. 
   "The old welfare system seduced millions of people into poverty by offering assistance on the condition that they didn't work or didn't get married, and had children anyway," said Sen. Talent. "It measured success by how many people it was able to get on welfare. The new system measures success by how many people achieve independence through work or never go on welfare in the first place because they are self-sufficient.".
