SENS. TALENT-BOND SECURE $3 MILLION FOR ST. LOUIS BOTANICAL GARDENS TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $3 million for the St.  
 Louis and Garden District Community Transportation Improvement Initiative in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the House and the Senate today. 
   "This is an important transportation project," said Sen. Talent. "We passed a good Highway bill and in addition I'm constantly working with local officials to identify transportation infrastructure needs that we can fund at the federal level."
   The Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the world's leading botanical research and display institutions and attracts more than 750,000 visitors each year. This funding will help construct a new multi-modal center at I-44. The plan also calls for designing and building additional access lanes from I-44 to Kingshighway, a turn from Kingshighway to Shaw Boulevard, leading directly to the new multi modal center and main entrance.
