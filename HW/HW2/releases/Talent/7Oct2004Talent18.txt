SENS. BOND, TALENT PRAISE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR PROTECTING MISSOURI DEFENSE JOBS
  Sens. Kit Bond (R-Mo) and Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued a joint statement regarding the complaint U.S. trade authorities filed this morning against the European Union to the World Trade Organization. The dispute involves billions of dollars in unfair subsidies provided to aircraft company Airbus by European governments. 
   "I strongly support President Bush's decision to protect Missouri defense jobs," said Sen. Jim Talent, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "America's workers can compete with anyone in the world, provided they have a fair and level playing field. The President is right to vigorously enforce our trade laws against violations by French-made Airbus, and I applaud the President's action that will strengthen our economy and create jobs."
   "American workers like those at Boeing are not asking for a handout or a leg up. They are asking for a chance at fair competition. Just like they use subsidies to provide their farmers a competitive advantage in the world market, the EU is trying to pull a fast one here as well. This type of unfair market manipulation cannot be tolerated, and I commend President Bush and Ambassador Zoellick for their steadfast support of American business and good manufacturing jobs," said Senator Kit Bond.
   The Senators stressed that Boeing and its suppliers in the aerospace sector employ some of the most highly-skilled and best-paid workers in the U.S. Due in large part to European subsidization of Airbus, Boeing's share of the worldwide commercial airplane market has slid from more than two-thirds to less than 50 percent. Bond and Talent pointed out that this occurrence has nothing to do with a lack of ingenuity or determination. Instead, Airbus' rise to market leadership has been driven largely by the unfair subsidies provided by European governments.
