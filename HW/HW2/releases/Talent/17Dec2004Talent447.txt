SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR ST. PATRICK CENTER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced a $250,000 appropriation for the St.  
 Patrick Center in St. Louis for the completion of the Partnership Center to help those in need. Officials and representatives from the St. Patrick's Center joined Sen. Talent for the announcement. 
   "St. Patrick Center is a perfect example of good stewardship in our urban communities," said Sen. Talent."They help provide opportunities for self-sufficiency and dignity for the homeless with an emphasis on those who experience mental illness or chemical dependence and those living at the poverty level. With these funds, the center can transform unfinished space in the facility into areas suitable for providing health care and other services for those in need." 
   The St. Patrick Center opened its doors in 1983 and has assisted thousands of homeless people. The Center serves 10,000 individuals and families annually and is Missouri's largest provider of homeless services including education, employment, and housing programs.
   "With Senator Talent's appropriation, we are hopeful to secure additional partners and create more room in existing program areas," said Dan Buck, Chief Executive Officer of St. Patrick Center. "We will use this money to off-set any and all build-out cost, and maintenance issues associated with future or current partners and for expanding our existing services." 
   The funding will help complete the 100,000 square foot building located in downtown St. Louis. St. Patrick Center is an innovative one-stop center serving homeless and near homeless individuals through user-friendly services under one roof.
   Talent secured the funds in the fiscal 2005 spending package.
