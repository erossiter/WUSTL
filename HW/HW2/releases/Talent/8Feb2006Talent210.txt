SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN, TALENT & DORGAN INTRODUCE BILL TO INCREASE NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) introduced legislation with Sens. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) instructing the Secretary of the Interior to develop an oil and gas leasing program for Lease Area 181, a natural gas-rich area, 100 miles off the Florida Coast.  
   The lease program, which would begin within a year after the bill is enacted, would bring nearly 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to market in the near future, according to estimates by the Minerals Management Service. That is enough gas to heat and cool nearly five million homes for 15 years, according to the American Gas Association. 
   "The best way to protect our energy security is to become more energy independent by accessing our domestic resources," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent, a member of the Senate Energy Committee. "High energy prices have forced our citizens, industry and farmers to pay too much for too long. An abundant supply of clean, reliable domestically-produced energy is the key to our economic prosperity and energy independence. This is a pro-growth, pro-jobs bill that will help energy consumers and increase our domestic supply of natural gas."
   The bill excludes for development any part of Lease Area 181 within 100 miles of the Florida coastline. The bill also places special conditions on any leasing east of the Military Mission Line, which is a military training area. Leasing in that area can only proceed with the permission of the Secretary of Defense after he has reviewed proposed lease conditions to make certain the lease does not interfere with military activities in the area. The Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on the bill later this month.
