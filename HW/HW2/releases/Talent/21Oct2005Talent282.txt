SEN. TALENT'S $250,000 REQUEST FOR COVENANT HOUSE IN ST. LOUIS APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Covenant House Missouri Center for Homeless Youth in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which was approved today by the Senate. 
   "The Covenant House offers a variety of programs for young adults, ranging from transitional housing to educational training," said Sen. Talent. "Currently, there is not an emergency shelter of this kind designated to aid disadvantaged young adults in St. Louis. This funding will allow the center to renovate a facility to house emergency shelter beds, food and clothing to aid the area's most vulnerable young adults." 
   "We are honored that Senator Talent recognizes the importance of what Covenant House is doing for Missouri's homeless, runaway and at-risk youth." Suzanne Wagener, Executive Director Covenant House Missouri.
   Sen. Talent's $250,000 request passed the Senate and will now go to conference with the House version of the bill.
