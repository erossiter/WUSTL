SENS. TALENT-BOND SECURE $5 MILLION FOR ST. LOUIS ZOO TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $5 million for the St.  
 Louis Zoo in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the House and the Senate today. 
   "The St. Louis Zoo is a fun place to visit and it should be a safe and convenient place to get to," said Sen. Talent. "With millions visiting the Zoo every year, we want and need to do everything possible to eliminate dangerous traffic situations. I was pleased to partner with President Bonner and everyone at the Zoo on behalf of this transportation project."
   "We are so gratified to enjoy the Senator's support for this important initiative," said Zoo President Dr. Jeffrey Bonner. "This measure will help the Zoo improve accessibility in and around Forest Park for the millions of visitors who support us each year."
   The St. Louis Zoo is visited by over three million visitors annually. All visitors to the Zoo currently must enter without signal lights, in the way of on coming vehicular traffic, which is dangerous. The funds will be used to close Wells Drive from I-64 to Zoo traffic only. The project will also be used for lane configuration, landscaping and new signage to redirect traffic.
