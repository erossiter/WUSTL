SEN. TALENT ENCOURAGED BY CONTINUED JOB GROWTH IN MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) said today he continues to be encouraged by good economic news. Today the U.S. Department of Labor announced that 27,600 jobs were created in Missouri in June, the second largest increase in the country.  
 Nationwide, 112,000 jobs were created with 1.5 million jobs added over the past ten months.
   Sen. Talent issued the following statement on the Labor Department announcement:
   "I am very pleased that we are getting more and more good news on the economic front in Missouri which should encourage those who are still looking for work. Today's news is further recognition that President Bush's tax cuts are continuing to have a stimulative effect and another reason we should make those tax cuts permanent.
   "We need to continue working in the Senate to pass pro-growth, pro-jobs policies that will strengthen our economy, create more jobs, build transportation infrastructure and lower health care costs for small business people and all Americans."
