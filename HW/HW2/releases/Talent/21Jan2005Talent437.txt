SEN. TALENT, REP. GRAVES ANNOUNCE FIRE GRANT FOR BOONVILLE
 Sen. Jim Talent and Rep. Sam Graves announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $123,386 grant for the Boonville Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used for Operations and Fire Fighter Safety.
   "We really appreciate the opportunity to apply for these grants," said Tim Carmichael of the Boonville Fire Department. "Without this funding, we would have to wait a long time to go through the normal budget process through the city. These funds allow us to speed up the process. This year we are going to update our breathing apparatuses, which might otherwise take us maybe 10 years to replace the air packs."
   "I am very pleased to announce this funding for the Boonville Fire Department," said Sen. Jim Talent. "Our first responders need these funds to protect themselves while volunteering their time to keep our communities safe. We have provided tens of millions of dollars for local fire departments in Missouri and around the country and I am confident we will do even more in the new Congress to support our firefighters."
   "I appreciate the service of the firefighters in Boonville," Graves said. "We must invest in their safety and effectiveness and this grant will help supply them with the training and equipment necessary to carry out their duty. Firefighters are trained to handle a wide range of problems and disasters and this grant provides the needed investment to help them meet the challenge."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
