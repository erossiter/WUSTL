SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $86,141 FIRE GRANT FOR PACIFIC
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded an $86,141 grant for the Pacific Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used to purchase 30 sets of NFPA approved turn-out gear and 48 walkie-talkies. 
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Pacific Fire Protection District will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "Our fire fighters put their lives on the line each day to protect lives and property in the event of a fire. With this funding, our first responders can replace outdated equipment with new gear that will allow them to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "It would have taken us years to budget the funds to purchase this equipment had this grant not been available," said Chief Rick Friedmann of Pacific. "We will be able to equip each position on the trucks with a walkie-talkie and a new set of turn-out gear. Now, if a firefighter is inside a burning structure, they can communicate with their crew leader, which makes the situation safer for everyone inside. I want to thank Senator Talent and the other federal officials that made this funding possible for our fire department."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
