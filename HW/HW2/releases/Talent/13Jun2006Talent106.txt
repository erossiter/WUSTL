SEN. TALENT COSPONSORS AMENDMENT COMMENDING U.S. TROOPS FOR BRINGING ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI TO JUSTICE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, congratulated the United States armed forces, intelligence community and coalition partners in the June 7, 2006, air raid that killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the most wanted terrorist in Iraq. Sen. Jim Talent is cosponsoring the amendment to the FY06 National Defense Authorization Bill, S. 2766, recognizing the U.S. military's exemplary performance in its efforts to eliminate the leadership of al Qaeda in Iraq. The amendment was approved by the Senate with a vote of 97-0.  
   "The killing of Al-Zarqawi is another success for U.S. and Iraqi forces in a very necessary fight," said Sen. Talent. "The intelligence obtained from the strike on his safe house provided coalition forces with information leading to attacks on seventeen subsequent locations in the Baghdad area. Iraqi forces and Iraqi contacts were crucial to this significant success and that shows the importance of having Iraq as an ally in the global war on terror." 
   The amendment also expresses the sense of Congress to commend Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki upon the finalization of the new Iraqi cabinet. Additionally, the measure states that the Senate will continue to support the U.S. armed forces, the democratically elected unity government of Iraq, and the people of Iraq in their quest to achieve freedom and prosperity.
