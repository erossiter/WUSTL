SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FIRE GRANT FOR SARCOXIE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $26,442 grant for the Sarcoxie Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used for operations and firefighter safety.
   "These funds will assist the Sarcoxie Volunteer Fire Department in protecting citizens in the community," Sen. Talent said. "The federal government should continue to ensure that fire grants like this one meet local needs such as requests for training and equipment. I am very pleased to announce that residents in Jasper County, and the surrounding area, will soon have the tools to enhance their firefighting operations."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
