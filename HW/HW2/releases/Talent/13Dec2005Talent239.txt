SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $250,000 TO REVITALIZE URBAN BASEBALL FIELDS IN KANSAS CITY
  Sen., Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he has won approval for a $250,000 appropriation for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City.  
 The funds will be used for construction and upgrading of baseball fields for their Reviving Baseball in the Inner City (RBI) Youth Development Program.
   "We are absolutely committed to partnerships that help Missouri's young people," said Sen. Talent. "When you partner America's pastime with eager Kansas City kids, good things will happen. It is my hope that for years to come, thousands of kids will get the opportunity to play baseball in a clean and safe environment in the heart of downtown Kansas City."
   "We are grateful to Senator Talent for helping us give the children we serve high-quality, effective youth development programming," said David Smith, President & Club Alumnus, Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City. "These funds will allow us to enhance the skills and capacities inherent in every child, positively impacting their lives on and off the field - both immediately and throughout their adulthood."
   The money will be used to refurbish and build baseball complexes in urban Kansas City. The Boys and Girls Clubs has negotiated a long-term lease agreement with the Kansas City, Missouri Parks and Recreation Department to renovate and maintain existing fields. With the receipt of this funding and the strong support of the local community, the RBI program will be able to expand significantly. Sen. Talent requested the funds, which passed the Congress as part of the FY 2006 Transportation/HUD Appropriations bill, now law.
