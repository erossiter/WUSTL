SEN. TALENT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO REAGAN AT STATE FUNERAL CEREMONY IN ROTUNDA
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) tonight will pay tribute to President Ronald Reagan at a State Funeral ceremony to be held in the Capitol Rotunda.  
 Earlier today, Sen. Talent, calling Reagan a personal hero, honored his memory and life in a speech on the Senate floor.
   "This week we are remembering a man who always marched in the ranks of honor," Talent said. "Reagan put his faith in the things the American people build on their own, in their families, small businesses, local schools, voluntary associations, churches, synagogues and temples. What he wanted was for the government to be vigorous in the areas it was supposed to operate, but to respect the institutions of private life rather than trying to overthrow them."
   Tonight, Senators will begin meeting on the Senate floor at 6:15 p.m. eastern time and proceed to the Capitol Rotunda at 6:30 p.m. eastern. The State Funeral ceremony will begin at 7 p.m. eastern in the Rotunda and is scheduled to last an hour. Lying in state will begin at 8:00 p.m. eastern and continue through the night.
