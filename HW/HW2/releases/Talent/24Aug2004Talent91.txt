SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR PHELPS COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved an $11,250 Community Facility Grant to the City of Newburg.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a 4x4 service truck and equipment.
   "I am pleased to announce that the City of Newburg will be receiving this funding," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "These funds will provide a new 4x4 truck and service equipment for city workers of Newburg. I appreciate the Administration responding to the local needs of our rural communities in Central Missouri."
   In FY 2003, the City of Newburg received a pre-Development Grant in the amount of $7,000 to develop a water and waste application. The following year in FY 2004, they received an $11,210 Community Facility Grant to purchase and install an early warning weather siren. 
   Community Facility Grants may be made to public bodies and nonprofit organizations to assist in the development of essential community facilities for public use in small, poor and needy communities and may be made for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the project. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and health care facilities.
