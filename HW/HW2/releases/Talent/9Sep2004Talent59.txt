  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $28,699 grant for the Strafford Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used to purchase Jaws of Life and emergency rescue equipment.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Strafford Fire Protection District will be receiving this funding," Sen. Talent said. "Our first responders keep our communities safe and protect our homes and businesses in the event of a fire. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This is wonderful news and we have really been looking forward to this funding," said Fire Chief Jerry Schiman of Strafford. "This grant will help our fire department tremendously. On behalf of all of the firefighters, I want to express our appreciation."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities.
