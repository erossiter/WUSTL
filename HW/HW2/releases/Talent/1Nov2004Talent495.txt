SENS. TALENT, BOND ANNOUNCE $62,100 FIRE GRANT FOR ASBURY
  Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $62,100 grant to the Asbury Fire Protection District. The funds will be used to purchase twenty complete sets of bunker gear, ten sets of breathing equipment and twenty sets of wilderness protection gear. 
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Asbury Fire Protection District will be receiving this funding," Sen. Talent said. "This grant will allow the department to purchase new safety equipment to enhance service for the area in the event of a fire. I appreciate the Administration for providing resources for training and supplies for firefighters serving Jasper County."
   "For firefighters all over the state, the new money for firefighting vehicles and safety will make a real difference in their ability to protect local citizens," said Sen. Kit Bond. "Our first responders are our first line of defense against any disaster, from fires to traffic accidents to oil spills to terrorism. It is important that we equip them with the resources they need to do their jobs." 
   "Primarily, the grant will get us a lot more protection," said Tim Bartley, Treasurer of the Asbury Fire Protection District. "Only a third of our departments have turn-out gear that complies with standards. Now we will have reliable air tanks that will help us better protect our own lives and save the lives of others."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
