SEN. TALENT DISCUSSES AGRICULTURE ISSUES AT DAIRY PRODUCERS ROUNDTABLE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today hosted a dairy producers' round table discussion in Springfield. Sen.  
 Talent was joined by nearly a dozen area dairy farmers to discuss the Milk Income Loss Compensation (MILC). Sen. Talent is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan legislation, which was established in the 2002 Farm Bill and is scheduled to expire in September of 2005. 
   "Reauthorizing this program is a major priority for dairy producers in Missouri," said Sen. Talent. "This is a key program because it provides a fair and equitable safety net for farmers from every region of the country. It is also a market-oriented program that does not fix prices but simply provides a counter-cyclical safety net when prices are depressed. It seems only fair to me that Missouri dairy farmers continue to have this safety net, just as other farmers do." 
   "It's certainly beneficial to Missouri farmers to have Sen. Talent as a member of the Agriculture Committee in the Senate," said Larry Purdom, Chairman of the Missouri Dairy Farmers Association. "I appreciate all that he has done for Missouri agriculture, especially his interest in the problems we face with the World Trade Organization and other international trade issues." 
   Since MILC was first authorized under the 2002 Farm Bill, the program has provided about $2 billion in needed assistance to hard working U.S. dairy farm families who have struggled over the last two years against collapsed prices with prices in some months falling to levels not seen since 1979. Importantly, this legislation does not increase milk prices paid by consume.
