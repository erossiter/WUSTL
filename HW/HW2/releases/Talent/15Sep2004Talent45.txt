SEN. TALENT SECURES $200,000 FOR METH TASK FORCE IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $200,000 for the Combined Ozark Multi-Jurisdictional Enforcement Team (COMET) to be included in the FY 2005 Commerce Justice State Appropriations Bill.  
   "This task force has been in existence over a decade and provides highly trained staff to seize, dismantle and safely dispose of hazardous waste associated with methamphetamine labs," said Sen. Talent. "Meth is a serious problem in our state and we need to get serious about fighting it. With these funds, COMET will be able to work with local law enforcement to detect and seize drug labs in rural Southwest Missouri to keep our neighborhoods safe." 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Southwest Missouri. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
