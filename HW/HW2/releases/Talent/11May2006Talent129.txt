SEN. TALENT CRITICIZES FILIBUSTER OF SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH PLAN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today criticized senators for playing politics with legislation to reduce health care costs for small business men and women and their employees. The Small Business Health Plans bill would allow small businesses to join together through their trade associations to purchase health care for themselves and their employees. A majority of senators voted tonight to consider the legislation, but a minority of senators voted to filibuster the health care plan. 
   "This vote makes clear who is for changing the system to lower the cost of health care for small businesses and who is for the status quo," said Sen. Jim Talent, a longtime advocate for Small Business Health Plans. "The No. 1 concern for small businesses in Missouri and around the country is the rising cost of health insurance. Our proposal would allow small business people purchase, for themselves and their employees, the same high-quality health insurance offered by big companies, labor unions, Medicare, Medicaid and the federal employee benefit system. Senators should stop playing politics with health care and allow us to pass solutions that would help lower health insurance costs and reduce the number of uninsured Americans."
