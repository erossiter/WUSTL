SEN. TALENT STATEMENT ON ISRAEL'S MILITARY DEFENSE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement regarding Israel's actions to defend herself:  
   "I continue to condemn the recent attacks by Hezbollah and Hamas against Israel and urge the governments of Iran and Syria to cease their support for international terrorism. The continued unflagging support of the United States for the security of Israel is crucial to the hopes for peace. Israel has the right to defend herself. In particular, the United States must continue to make clear that it will not pressure Israel to compromise its security."
