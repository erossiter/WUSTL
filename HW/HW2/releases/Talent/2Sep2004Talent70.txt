SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $82,602 FIRE GRANT FOR GOODMAN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded an $82,602 grant for the Goodman Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used for protective gear and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Goodman Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters put their lives on the line to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "We had a pretty desperate need for this protective gear," said Fire Chief Jerry Richmond of Goodman. "I appreciate the funding and support on behalf of all firefighters."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
