SEN. TALENT APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF BILL TO PREVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM USING GENETIC HISTORY TO REFUSE HEALTH COVERAGE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-MO) today applauded Senate passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (S. 306), which will prevent insurance companies from refusing to offer health care coverage to people based on their genetic histories. Sen.  
 Talent, an original co-sponsor of the bill, recommended the legislation as a member of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured.
   "Discrimination based on a person's genetic history is wrong and the insurance companies need to stop it," said Sen. Talent. "Missourians have told me that this subtle discrimination happens more frequently than you might think. They tell me how based on their genetic histories their health insurers have increased their premiums. We should not allow insurers to deny people access to health insurance for who they are."
   Currently, there is no guarantee insurance companies will not "cherry pick" or choose only to insure individuals who, based on their genetic histories, are less likely to get sick. Or, they may discriminate in a more subtle way, by raising premiums. 
   The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005 will expand the prohibition against discrimination by group health plans and health insurance issuers on the basis of genetic information or services. This will stop enrollment and premium discrimination based on information about genetic testing and receipt of genetic services. The bill also extends medical privacy and confidentiality rules to the disclosure of genetic information.
   The bill will also protect job seekers from being denied employment opportunities by employers, employment agencies, labor organizations and training programs because of genetic information. A Genetic Nondiscrimination Study Commission will be formed to review the developing science of genetics and advise Congress.
