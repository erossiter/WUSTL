SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FIRE PREVENTION GRANT FOR COLUMBIA
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $131,233 fire prevention grant to the Columbia Fire Department. The funds will be used for fire prevention and safety.  
   "These funds will assist the dedicated firefighters in Columbia by enhancing fire prevention programs," said Sen. Talent. "The federal government should continue to provide funding opportunities like this for the safety of Missourians. I am very pleased to announce that our firefighters will receive much needed resources to prevent fire related injuries." 
   "The first line of our mission statement is, 'Fire Prevention through Education,'" said William Markgraf, Fire Chief of the Columbia Fire Department. "The Columbia Fire Department is honored to receive this Fire Prevention grant, which will benefit the citizens and visitors of Columbia by enhancing existing fire prevention programs and allowing new programs to emerge. We appreciate the efforts of our elected officials for their support of the Fire Act Grant which makes these programs possible."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2005, $650 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
