SEN. TALENT URGES IRAQI GRAIN BOARD DIRECTOR TO PURCHASE MORE U.S. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today met with Khalil Assi, the Director of the Iraqi Grain Board, urging him to purchase more U.S. agricultural products.  
 Last week, Iraq purchased 60,000 metric tons of U.S. rice, but in the past they have imported it from other countries such as Vietnam. 
   "We had a good discussion about resuming the sale of our agriculture products which is something I've been pushing for a long time," said Sen. Talent. "One of the reasons I went to Iraq last December was to promote Missouri's agricultural products, including rice. On that trip I met with top U.S. officials on behalf of our rice producers who were concerned that Iraq was looking to other countries to import rice."
   Sen. Talent told Assi he was encouraged by the rice purchase and said he hoped it was just the beginning. Rice is produced in 10 counties in Southeast Missouri.
   For the next several years, and likely longer, Iraq will need to rely on imports to meet a large portion of its food and fiber needs. 
   "These purchases should come from America, and Iraq could once again become a top market for our agricultural products," said Sen. Talent. "And I will continue working in the Senate Agriculture Committee to recapture this market for Missouri producers."
