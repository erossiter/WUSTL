  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, today announced the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has approved a $60,000 loan for Schell City to make improvements to its local central water system.  
   "Improving water quality in Southwest Missouri is a top priority," said Sen. Talent. "We need to make certain more people have access to a safe, abundant water supply and these improvements will help over a hundred households. I am pleased with the progress we have made this year to help improve water quality in and I am optimistic we will do even more next year to provide for Missouri's water supply and infrastructure." 
   "We are pleased to receive this loan," said Dale Hiddix, Mayor of Schell City. "Water Quality is important to our citizens and these additional funds will allow us to complete improvements that will ensure a safe and reliable water supply."
   Rural Development funds will be used for rehabilitation of the existing 50,000 gallon elevated water tower and water treatment plant. The City of Schell City serves 147 users in rural Vernon County.
