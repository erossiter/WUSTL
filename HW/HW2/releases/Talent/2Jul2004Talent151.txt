SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES AGRICULTURE EXPORT ADVISORY COUNCIL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced the formation of his Agriculture Export Advisory Council to establish a dialogue between Missouri's producers, the Administration and representatives of foreign governments. Sen.  
 Talent and the American Royal Association hosted the council's inaugural meeting today with the discussion centering on the future of the Asian market for agricultural exports. 
   "Farmers and ranchers in Missouri are among the most innovative and effective producers in the nation," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection and Product Promotion. "Our producers, and the related agriculture industries, rely on access to export markets to maintain the value of their products. The value of Missouri agriculture exports in 2002 alone totaled $1.18 billion. The advisory council will be a sounding board for ideas and initiatives to help expand these markets and provide leadership in the pursuit of value-added opportunities for our producers."
   Members of the council include Charlie Kruse, President of Missouri Farm Bureau, Dale Ludwig, President/CEO of Missouri Soybean Association, Rusty Kahrs, President of Missouri Cattlemen and a growing number of agriculture stakeholders.
   Council members attending the roundtable discussion had the opportunity to discuss the future of the Asian market with Foreign Agriculture Service Administrator Ellen Terpstra and foreign agriculture leaders including Takao Shibata, Consul General of Japan in Kansas City and Zhao Weining, First Secretary (Commercial and Agriculture) at the Commercial and Economic Office at the Embassy of China in Washington.
   Sen. Talent said the council plans to host similar meetings around the state on a variety of agriculture issues related to expanding our export markets on behalf of Missouri's farmers and ranchers.
