SEN. TALENT PURSUES INCREASED FUNDING FOR DEFENSE
  Calling the Department of Defense budget inadequate, Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, today requested a significant increase in military spending. In a letter, Sen. Talent and eight senators asked Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) for an increase in top-line funding for the Department of Defense. The senators are concerned that the Administration has proposed a $3.7 billion reduction in defense spending. 
   "These reductions were clearly driven by budgetary concerns, not military analysis," the senators wrote. "While important, we must not balance the budget on the backs of our Soldiers, Marines, Sailors and Airmen, particularly in time of war. We have complete confidence that our servicemen and women will, no matter what, always complete the missions assigned; however, inadequate funding will further increase the margin of risk. We request that the Department's budget top-line be increased to at least $443 billion, the Administration's projected funding level for fiscal year 2007 as of last spring."
   In addition to Senator Talent, the letter was signed by Senators Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), Trent Lott (R-Miss.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), Susan Collins (R-Maine), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and John Thune (R-S.D.).
   Sen. Talent has long been a supporter of increased defense spending. He is concerned that the Administration's long-term defense plan does not adequately fund major procurement and modernization programs. Beginning in 2001, the Administration implemented a plan to increase defense spending by a modest amount above inflation in an attempt to modernize our forces. Sen. Talent believes this is insufficient and we should do more.
