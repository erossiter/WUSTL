SEN. TALENT'S $300,000 REQUEST FOR LIBERTY MEMORIAL MUSEUM APPROVED BY HOUSE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $300,000 for the Liberty Memorial Museum in the fiscal 2006 Interior Appropriations spending package, which was approved today by the House. Sen.  
 Talent requested the funds for the final phase of the Liberty Memorial Museum expansion. 
   "The Liberty Memorial is an institution in Kansas City and I believe it's an important memorial for the country," said Sen. Talent. "This funding will help preserve the museum's extensive collections fore future generations. Since the Museum was designated the national World War I Memorial, thousands of visitors to the Kansas City area learned from and have enjoyed one of the largest World War I collections in the country."
   Sen. Talent secured an additional $500,000 for the Liberty Memorial Museum in the Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2006, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   "With this funding, we will be able to distinguish the Liberty Memorial Museum as one of the finest museums in the nation," said Carl DiCapo, Director of Development of the Liberty Memorial Association. "A big 'thank you' goes to Sen. Talent for all he has done for Kansas City and the United States and for securing funds for this world-class museum."
   Sen. Talent's request passed the House and must now be approved by the Senate before being signed into law by the President.
