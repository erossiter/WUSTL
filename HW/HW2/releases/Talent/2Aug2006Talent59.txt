SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES SENATE APPROVAL OF FUNDING TO CONSTRUCT BORDER FENCE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Senate has approved an amendment that would fund 370 miles of triple-layered fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers along the nation's southwest border. Sen. Jim Talent is an original cosponsor of the measure with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. The measure passed 94 to 3.  
   "I share the concerns of many Missourians that the United States requires a border management system that protects us from terrorist attacks, illegal immigration, illegal drugs and other contraband," said Sen. Talent. "I am pleased the Senate overwhelmingly approved our plan to fund the construction of a border fence and 500 miles of vehicle barriers at strategic locations along the southwest border. This measure is long overdue and we can now move forward with a plan to increase America's border security." 
   The amendment calls for $1.8 billion for the National Guard to build the fencing and vehicle barriers. The funds will come from an $86.3 billion emergency contingency fund that was included in the FY 2007 budget resolution. 
   Sen. Talent is also sponsoring comprehensive legislation to secure America's borders with additional manpower, new barriers and high-tech surveillance equipment. The bipartisan Border Security and Modernization Act of 2005 would also increase resources for border detention centers and would enact stricter penalties and fines for those who break our immigration laws. Sen. Talent is sponsoring the legislation with U.S. Senators Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.).
