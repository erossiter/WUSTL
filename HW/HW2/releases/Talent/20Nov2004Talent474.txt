SENATE APPROVES SEN. TALENT REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO HELP PATIENTS WITH SICKLE CELL DISEASE
  The Senate today approved Sen. Jim Talent's (R-Mo.) request for $200,000 to fund what one expert calls the most comprehensive law to help Sickle Cell Disease patients in a generation.  
 The funding passed as part of the fiscal 2005 spending package which was approved by the Senate today.
   "We have worked very hard for this day," said Talent. "Now we have the resources to help the tens of thousands of Americans with Sickle Cell Disease. In the course of working on the new law, I've had the opportunity to meet with so many of the families who are struggling with this terrible disease. I've been inspired by their stories as well as their optimism that we will one day find a cure."
   Talent's request provides $200,000 for a new grant program that will provide funding for entities that have been successful in educating patients about how to grapple with the disease and which encourage early testing for newborns and others who might be carriers of the Sickle Cell Disease trait. It also begins funding for a new National Coordinating Center which will be tasked with finding prevention and treatment options for Sickle Cell Disease patients as authorized in Senator Talent's Sickle Cell Disease Treatment bill, now Public Law 108-357.
   Dr. Michael DeBaun, a pediatric hematologist with Washington University's School of Medicine, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and an expert on the disease said Talent's law is the most significant health care bill for this community in 35 years. 
   Sickle Cell Disease affects approximately 70,000 Americans; more than 2,500,000 Americans, mostly African-Americans, have the Sickle Cell trait. Sickle Cell Disease affects about one in 300 African-American newborns.
