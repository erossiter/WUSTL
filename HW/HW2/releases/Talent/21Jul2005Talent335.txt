SEN. TALENT SECURES $500,000 FOR LIBERTY MEMORIAL MUSEUM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $500,000 for the Liberty Memorial Museum in the Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2006, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Liberty Memorial is an institution in Kansas City and I believe it's an important memorial for the country," said Talent. "This funding will help complete the last phase of construction for space to house the museum's extensive collections. Since the Museum was designated the national World War I Memorial, thousands of visitors to the Kansas City area learned from and have enjoyed one of the largest World War I collections in the country."
   Sen. Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for the Liberty Memorial Museum. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then be reconciled with the House bill.
