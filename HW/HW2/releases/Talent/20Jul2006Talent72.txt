SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR NEGRO LEAGUES BASEBALL MUSEUM IN KANSAS CITY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he has secured $250,000 in funding for the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (NLBM) in Kansas City from the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Heath and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. Sen. Jim Talent's request will be used to develop educational materials on the history of segregation in America.  
   "For more than forty years Negro Leagues teams played the highest level of baseball in front of huge crowds around America," said Sen. Talent. "The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City is a national destination for baseball fans, historians and others seeking to enrich their understanding of this period in America's history. This funding will be used to help them tell their story to the 60,000 fans who visit the museum each year." 
   Sen. Talent is the chief sponsor of legislation, S. Con. Res. 60, to designate the NLBM in Kansas City as America's National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously in April and must now pass the House of Representatives before being signed into law by the President. 
   Sen. Talent's funding requests passed the Senate Appropriations Committee and now must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill before being signed into law.
