  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $13,509 grant for the Caney Mountain Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used for training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   "I am very pleased to announce that Caney Mountain Volunteer Fire Department will be receiving this funding," Sen. Talent said. "This grant will allow the department to purchase new safety equipment to enhance service on behalf of the Caney Mountain community in the event of a fire. I appreciate the Administration for providing our rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This grant helps us out a lot," said Dale Julius, a volunteer from Gainesville. "It makes our job a lot easier and increases the safety for everyone."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities.
