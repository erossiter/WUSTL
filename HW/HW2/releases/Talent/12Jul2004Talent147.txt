SEN. TALENT WELCOMES PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ON FOOD PYRAMID DESIGN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, today issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's announcement that it will allow time for the public to comment on the design of Food Guidance System, commonly known as the Food Pyramid, and to recommend potential changes to its structure: 
   "This announcement is a good first step as we look for possible improvements to the structure that guides our nation's nutritional habits. Obesity is a major problem in the United States. The government should be advocating a healthy balanced diet through a tool that is easy for people to use, and I have concerns that the current structure is not as user-friendly as it could be. 
   "I am pleased that the USDA is seeking comment on this issue and as a member of the Agriculture Committee I look forward to working with the Administration and Chairman Cochran to identify potential solutions if needed."
