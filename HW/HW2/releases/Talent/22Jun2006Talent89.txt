SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $698,000 FOR MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) announces $698,000 in funding for the Missouri Botanical Garden Virtual Plant Database Enhancement Project. Sen. Jim Talent's request was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The funding will be used to expand the Missouri Botanical Garden's online virtual plant database.  
   "The Missouri Botanical Garden is a world leader in plant research," said Sen. Talent. "This additional funding will expand on invaluable resources to include additional medical, nutritional and physical information about plant specimens. The additional database will assist agriculture planning in developing nations around the world. Getting this funding approved in committee was a critical step, and I will continue pushing for it when the bill comes to the floor of the Senate."
   The Garden's online plant database is the world's largest online database containing more than three million specimens. They receive more than 24,000 requests for information daily. The expanded database will allow for data capture of about half a million older African specimen held in the Garden, making it the world's largest repository of plant data. The data is used for ecological conservation, ecological monitoring, global climate monitoring, the monitoring of toxins and land development planning. 
   Sen. Talent secured the funding for the Missouri Botanical Garden in the Agriculture spending bill. Before being signed into law, the bill must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
