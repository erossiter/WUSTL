SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON OPPOSING THE SENATE AMNESTY PROPOSAL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the amnesty proposal:
   "I oppose the amnesty measure being considered in the Senate. This is a nation of immigrants, but it's also a nation of laws. Congress should not give the benefits of citizenship to those who have entered the country unlawfully; and it's especially unfair to put them at the front of the line ahead of those who have waited patiently for years to enter the country lawfully. I will continue to support strong and effective measures to secure the border."
