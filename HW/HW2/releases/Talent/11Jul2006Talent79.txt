SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES CRITICAL DESIGNATION FOR WAYNESVILLE REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation has included the Waynesville Regional Airport at Forney Field - Fort Leonard Wood in the Military Airport Program (MAP). Sen. Jim Talent said that this designation qualifies the airport to be eligible to receive additional funding through the Military Airport Program. The Federal Aviation Administration included the airport in the program for an initial three-year term.  
   "I am pleased to announce this critical designation for the Waynesville Regional Airport at Forney Field at Fort Leonard Wood," said Sen. Talent. "The new designation will allow the airport to work with the FAA to obtain new funds for upgrades and improvements to the region's aviation infrastructure. I will work to help secure funding to promote added commercial service and general aviation operations, while helping to generate economic growth, create jobs and save lives." 
   The MAP program provides capital development funding aid to civil airport sponsors of designated current joint-use military airfields or former military airports. The airports must be in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems. Airports included in the MAP may get discretionary funds for airport development, including certain projects not eligible for support from the Airport Improvement Program.
