SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR RIPLEY COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $159,547 Community Facility Grant to Ripley County.  
 The funds will be used to renovate a county-owned building in Doniphan.
   "I am pleased to announce that the Ripley County will receive this funding," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "Renovations will be made to an existing building in Doniphan, which will house the Ripley County Justice Center. The building will also provide much needed additional space for county law enforcement. I appreciate the Administration responding to the local needs of our rural communities in Southeast Missouri."
   Community Facility Grants may be made to public bodies and nonprofit organizations to assist in the development of essential community facilities for public use in small, poor and needy communities and may be made for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the project. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and health care facilities.
