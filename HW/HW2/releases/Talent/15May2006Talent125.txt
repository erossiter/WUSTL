SENATE APPROVES MEASURE TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE PREVENTION WEEK
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Senate unanimously approved a measure he cosponsored to designate a "National Methamphetamine Prevention Week." The legislation would raise awareness of the dangers of methamphetamine and educate the public on ways to help prevent the use of the deadly drug.  
   "Methamphetamine is the worst drug I've encountered in my nearly 20 years in public life," said Sen. Talent. "Missourians, especially our law enforcement officials, know too well how meth can destroy communities. We especially want to reach young people who need to understand that giving into meth means giving up everything else. Our hope is that this effort will help save lives and protect our communities and our kids from this terrible drug."
   Sen. Talent serves as Co-Chair of the Senate Anti-Meth Caucus. Earlier this year, the Senate approved Senators Talent and Dianne Feinstein's (D-Calif.) Combat Meth Act, the most comprehensive anti-meth legislation ever introduced in the Congress. The President signed Talent and Feinstein's Combat Meth legislation into law on March 9. Sen. Talent also worked with Republicans and Democrats to add more than $1 billion to the Budget to help law enforcement officials fight methamphetamine.
