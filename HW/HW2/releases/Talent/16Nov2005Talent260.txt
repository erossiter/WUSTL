SEN. TALENT SECURES $25,000 FOR CASS COUNTY DRUG COURT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $25,000 for the Cass County Adult Drug Court in the FY 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill, which was approved today by the Senate.  
   "This funding will help the families and recovering addicts get the support they need," said Sen. Talent. "Drug courts in Missouri have been enormously affected in helping people who have become addicted to meth and other dangerous drugs. The Recovery Management project helps participants find a job, find a place to live, arrange transportation, engage in community service and provide support so they can become an active part of society." 
   Methamphetamine is one of the primary drug problems in Cass County. The Cass County Drug Court will use the funds to provide drug testing and rehab for program eligible participants. The goal of the program is to ease the strain of law enforcement, while providing treatment to ex-offenders to become productive, law abiding citizens. 
   Sen. Talent's request passed both the House and Senate and is expected to be signed into law by President Bush.
