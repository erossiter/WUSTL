SEN. TALENT'S ISSUES STATEMENT ON 9-11 COMMISSION'S FINAL REPORT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement on the September 11th Commission's final report: 
   "I appreciate the service of the 9-11 Commission and I believe Americans should be reassured by their findings. The two most prominent features of the Commission's final report are its recommendations and its conclusion that the Bush Administration was actively engaged in how best to counter Al Qaeda.
   "The report finds that on September 11th, we were still transitioning from 45-year-old Cold War intelligence process and culture to a policy that recognized the true threat of terrorism. Our country was attacked before that policy could be implemented.
   "I was pleased the Commission recommends improving human intelligence collection in the field. I have strongly advocated the need to increase the number of intelligence agents stationed overseas rather than relying so heavily on technology. We need people on the ground, inside these organizations, to know what's going on. I will continue to support this effort as we consider the Commission's recommendations.
   "There is no question that we must continue to be vigilant, but I believe Missourians will be reassured when they read the report that our leadership was and is doing everything it can to protect the country against terrorism."
