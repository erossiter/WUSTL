SEN. TALENT SECURES $37.08 MILLION FOR WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE
  The Senate yesterday passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report. Sen.  
 Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, secured $37.08 million for Whiteman Air Force Base in the bill. The funds will be used to replace 160 family housing units.
   "Missouri is fortunate to have such an essential Air Force Base," said Sen. Talent. "Securing resources for Missouri's military bases is a priority for me. These funds will greatly increase the quality of life and morale of our troops and their families by providing them high-quality military housing. I want to thank Sen. Bond for partnering with me in making this a priority in the Senate to benefit our military families in Missouri." 
   This Phase 6 project will fund the design and construction of 160 single and duplex family housing units with all necessary support including garages, storage, and recreation facilities. 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Whitman Air Force base. The bill passed the Senate and House, and must now be signed by the President to become law.
