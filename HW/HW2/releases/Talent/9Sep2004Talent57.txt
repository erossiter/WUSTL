SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $54,000 FIRE GRANT FOR HIGH RIDGE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $54,000 grant for the High Ridge Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a "Safe House" on wheels.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the High Ridge Fire Protection District will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "Education is the key to prevention. This educational classroom on wheels will be used to educate children about fire safety. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the funding they need to do have fire prevention programs like this."
   "The Safe House will not only be a tool to educate about fire safety, but also other emergencies, such as storms and tornadoes," said Deputy Chief Michael Arnhart of High Ridge. "The Safe House is like a mobile home where we can teach children how to evacuate safely rather than to hide, which is what many small children do. $54W,00e will also teach them how to exit out windows, roll out of bed and stay low to the floor, how to call 911 if there is time."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
