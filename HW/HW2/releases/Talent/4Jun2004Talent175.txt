SEN. TALENT'S ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. DANFORTH'S NOMINATION TO BE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement in support of President Bush's nomination of former Missouri Sen. John Danforth to be the United States Ambassador to the United Nations: 
   "President Bush has selected a great man. John Danforth has faithfully served his country and the people of Missouri. His years of distinguished service in the U.S. Senate more than qualify him to represent the United States in this international body. I consider Senator Danforth to be a friend, mentor and model. The President could not have chosen a more qualified individual. I look forward to casting my vote in favor of his confirmation."
