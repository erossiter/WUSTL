SEN. TALENT OPPOSES FILIBUSTER OF JUDGE ALITO'S NOMINATION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today was critical of an effort by some senators to filibuster the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito.  
 Citing Judge Alito's exceptional qualifications, Sen. Talent said Judge Alito deserves a fair, up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.
   "Judge Alito has more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years. He has served for 15 years as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Third District. He participated in the decisions of more than 1,500 federal appeals. He wrote more than 350 opinions. During the hearings, Judge Alito answered over 700 questions for more than 18 hours. This is why I wonder why some people say they do not know enough about him.
   "I have said from the beginning of this debate - and I withheld my decision about him until I had the chance to meet him and watch the hearings - that Judge Alito deserved a fair and respectful confirmation process, ending in a timely up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. 
   "I strongly oppose the filibuster and I will vote today to give Judge Alito the up-or-down vote he deserves."
