SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $32,000 GRANT TO MARKET MISSOURI RICE TO PUERTO RICO
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Agriculture Marketing Services (AMS) division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has awarded a $32,000 grant to the Curators of the University of Missouri to market Missouri rice.  
 The funds will be used to identify marketing, transportation and pricing strategies for rice produced by Mid-South Missouri growers.
   "I am very pleased to announce that our producers will be receiving these funds to market Missouri-grown rice," said Sen. Talent, Subcommittee Chairman for the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. "Missouri producers are leaders in agriculture exports and this grant will help enhance their efforts to market products abroad. I am confident this partnership between the University of Missouri and our producers will create a larger market for our rice in Puerto Rico."
   The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP) is designed to provide matching funds to state agencies to enhance current marketing and research strategies for food and agriculture products. The FSMIP is provided under Section 204(b) of the Agriculture Marketing Act of 1946. For fiscal year 2004, approximately $1.3 million will be distributed by the AMS to fund approximately 25 to 30 projects to 23 states.
   Additional information about the grant program is available online at http://www.ams.usda.gov/tmd/fsmip.htm.
