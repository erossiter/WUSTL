SEN. TALENT DISCUSSES JOB CREATION DURING KONTEK TOUR IN NEW MADRID
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today toured Kontek Industries in New Madrid. Sen. Jim Talent highlighted the importance of high-skill, high-wage job opportunities in Missouri. Kontek currently employs nearly 100 workers in the New Madrid area and continues to grow.  
   "The research and development that Kontek has achieved is helping make America safer and our economy stronger," said Sen. Talent. "Defense spending means jobs for Missourians and this is an example of why small business is the heart of Missouri's and our nation's economy."
   "We are very thankful for all the help and insight that we received from members of our Missouri congressional delegation, including Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO) and Senator Talent" said Don Utz, President of Kontek. "They are very aware of the importance of these projects and what this means for the economy in Southeast Missouri. These contracts have resulted in upwards of 50 additional jobs at Kontek, nearly doubling the number of employees at our company."
   Sen. Talent is working this year to include funding to support Kontek's research in blast-proof barriers in the Senate version of the defense bill. In addition to barriers, the company produces prefabricated armored guard houses and storm-proof safe houses that will withstand the stress of tropical hurricanes. 
   Kontek's customers include the U.S. Air Force, the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Navy, Department of Energy, our national laboratories at Sandia and Lawrence Livermore, most of our nation's major telecommunications companies and twelve nuclear power plants.
