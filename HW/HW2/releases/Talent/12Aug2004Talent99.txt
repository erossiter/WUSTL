SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $84,375 FIRE GRANT FOR DOE RUN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $84,375 grant for the Doe Run Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used for training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the fire department in Doe Run will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These funds will allow the department to purchase new safety equipment to enhance service for Doe Run in the event of a fire. I appreciate the federal government for providing these our rural communities with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This new equipment will allow us to lower our ISO rating, which we've been working to do," Kevin Pritchett, of the Doe Run Fire Protection District. "The thermal imaging camera will also increase the safety of our firefighters as well as our citizens."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
