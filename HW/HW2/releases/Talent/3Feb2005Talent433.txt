SEN. TALENT ADVOCATES SCIENCE-BASED APPROACH TO EXAMINING IMPACT OF BSE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today advocated for a science-based approach to examining the impact of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) on U.S. imports and exports of cattle and beef. Sen.  
 Talent said the U.S. is entitled to take as much time as necessary to make certain we protect our herd and he is looking forward to reviewing the report submitted from the team of USDA experts in Canada now.
   "We need to protect our animals and we are entitled to take our time to make certain everything is safe," Sen. Talent said. "At the same time, we can not close the borders beyond the point where it is clear we don't have an animal safety issue which will imperil our agriculture trading system."
   The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee today held a hearing on the effects of BSEon U.S. imports and exports of cattle and beef. In particular, the committee examined the USDA's proposed rule to open the Canadian border next month. The U.S. shut down the border in December, 2003 after a Canadian-born cow tested positive for BSE.
   "The U.S. continues to have the safest, most abundant and most affordable food supply in the world," said Sen. Talent. "We have to investigate this fully and deliberately, relying on science, but if we keep the border closed beyond the point where there are any risks to our producers, we put our own export markets at risk. At some point we have to treat others the way we want others to treat us."
