SEN. TALENT SECURES $25 MILLION FOR DESIGN OF ADVANCED NASA AIRCRAFT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today secured $25 million for Boeing's Phantom Works to begin design work on NASA's X-43C hypersonic demonstration aircraft, an advanced multi-engine aircraft that will be capable of flying at Mach 10.  
 The purpose of the X-43C will be to demonstrate the ability of multiple hypersonic engines to operate simultaneously on the same airframe. These funds are part of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 2005, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   "The X-43 advanced aircraft program will lead to the development of both manned and unmanned aircraft capable of flying at Mach 10 and above," said Sen. Talent. "Moreover, the more we learn about hypersonic, the closer we will come to eventually developing a follow-on craft to replace the space shuttle. This is one of the most exciting programs before the Congress, both in terms of the operational capabilities that subsequent aircraft will provide to the United States, and in terms of the high-tech employment this work will generate in Missouri. I have focused increasing attention on hypersonic propulsion since my last few years in the House because I recognize how important this technology will for our country, both militarily and for our space program." 
   The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and then reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
