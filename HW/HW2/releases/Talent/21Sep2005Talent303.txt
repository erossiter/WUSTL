U.S. SENATE APPROVES SENS. TALENT-PRYOR AMENDMENT TO PROTECT FARM STATE AGENCY OFFICES IN MISSOURI
  The Senate unanimously approved an amendment sponsored by Sens.  
 Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) to prevent the United States Agriculture Department from implementing a plan to close 665 Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices, including 30 of the 98 in Missouri. The amendment passed as part of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill.
   \"I'm concerned about closing our FSA offices when there has been little or no consultation with our local offices or our farmers and producer groups in Missouri,\" said Senator Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who is meeting today with top officials from USDA to discuss his concerns with the proposal. \"These are the offices our producers have to go to anytime they want to deal with any of the government's various programs that affect them. Some of our producers are already driving 30 or 40 minutes or more to get to these offices. The key with the way we handle FSA must be service and accessibility to the agriculture community and to our producers.\"
   The Talent-Pryor amendment defunds the USDA's efforts to close FSA offices until the Agriculture Secretary has conducted a thorough analysis of the impact of any office closures. The amendment requires the USDA to report their findings to the Senate Agriculture Committee, on which Sen. Talent serves. Sen. Talent said the intent of the amendment is to make certain the Agriculture Department understands the need for service and accessibility for our producers.
   The Senate is expected to pass the Agriculture Appropriations bill as early as this week. The House has passed their version of the bill, but it does not include a companion amendment.
