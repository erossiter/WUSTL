SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $498,520 IN AID FOR MISSOURI MANUFACTURING WORKERS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced a $498,520 grant, as part of the President's High Growth Job Training Initiative, to assist manufacturing workers and training providers in the Kansas City region.  
 The grant, administered by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, was awarded to The Manufacturing Institute of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
   "Job training is a very important part of the pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda we are enacting in the Senate," said Sen. Talent. "One of the ways we can stimulate the economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is to help recruit and train younger workers for high-skilled jobs. With this grant, workers in the Kansas City area will have more and better opportunities to learn the skills they need to enter into the manufacturing industry."
   The Manufacturing Institute of National Association of Manufactures is launching a "Dream It, Do It" careers campaign to inform young people of the rewarding career opportunities in the manufacturing field. The Manufacturing Institute will expand the project through regional "Alliance for Innovation in Manufacturing" teams to total of six manufacturing-intensive regions of the country. The grant will support the development of tools and partnerships between employers, training providers, and local Workforce Investment Boards in Kansas City.
