SEN. TALENT SECURES $100,000 FOR ANTI-METH TASK FORCE IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI
  The Senate today approved Sen. Jim Talent's (R-Mo.) request to send $100,000 to the Combined Ozark Multi-Jurisdictional Enforcement Team (COMET). Sen.  
 Talent's request passed as part of the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate.
   "This task force deploys highly trained law enforcement agents to seize, dismantle and safely dispose of hazardous waste associated with methamphetamine labs," said Sen. Talent. "Meth is a serious problem in Missouri and we need to get serious about fighting it. The task force has been enormously effective and this funding will help them keep our neighborhoods safe." 
   Sen. Talent has also authored legislation to provide Missouri and other states with new resources to stop the production and distribution of methamphetamine. Talent's comprehensive Combat Meth Act provides critical funding for law enforcement and prosecutors and increases community awareness, education and new treatment options for those recovering from a methamphetamine addiction.
