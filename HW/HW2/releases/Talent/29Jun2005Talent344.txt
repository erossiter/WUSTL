SEN. TALENT'S $500,000 REQUEST FOR MARK TWAIN HOME, MUSEUM IN HANNIBAL APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced the Senate has approved his half-million dollars request for the Mark Twain Home Foundation in the Interior Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2006. Sen.  
 Talent requested the funds to make improvements for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home, a national Historic Landmark, and Museum in Hannibal.
   "Mark Twain was one of Missouri's most accomplished citizens," said Sen. Talent. "His boyhood home in Hannibal is one of our state's most treasured historical sites and it draws tens of thousands of visitors each year. These funds will restore Mark Twain's home and museum in an effort to preserve its historical value and boost tourism in the area. Because tourism is a top industry in our State, this funding will also generate economic growth in Northeast Missouri." 
   "The funds will give the museum the opportunity to enhance and preserve some of our nation's unique cultural and literary treasures," said Dr. Regina Faden, Executive Director Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum. "At the same time, the project will help revitalize Hannibal's economy through increased cultural tourism."
   Tourism has become one of Missouri's most profitable industries and is one of the fastest growing sectors of the state's economy. In fiscal year 2004, total industrial output due to tourism in Missouri was estimated at $13.4 billion. 
   The bill must now be reconciled with the House before being signed into law.
