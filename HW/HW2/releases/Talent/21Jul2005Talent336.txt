SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR COVENANT HOUSE IN ST. LOUIS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Covenant House Missouri Center for Homeless Youth in the Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2006, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Covenant House offers a variety of programs for young adults, ranging from transitional housing to educational training," said Sen. Talent. "Currently, there is not an emergency shelter of this kind designated to aid disadvantaged young adults in St. Louis. This funding will allow the center to renovate a facility to house emergency shelter beds, food and clothing to aid the area's most vulnerable young adults." 
   Sen. Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for the Covenant House Missouri Center for Homeless Youth. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then be reconciled with the House bill.
