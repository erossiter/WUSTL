SEN. TALENT INTRODUCES MEASURE TO BOOST HOMEOWNERSHIP
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today introduced legislation that will modernize the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to allow it to compete in today's housing market and increase access to homeownership opportunities for low income buyers. Sen. Jim Talent introduced the Expanding American Homeownership Act (S. 3535) to help first time homebuyers, minorities, and low income and moderate income individuals gain access to the resources necessary to become homeowners by increasing the maximum loan and amounts insurable by Federal Housing Administration. 
   "This legislation will help hundreds of Missouri families receive safe and affordable assistance to purchase a home and become part of the American Dream," said Sen. Talent. "We will be able to increase minority homeownership and help seniors stay in their homes after retirement." 
   The bill, cosponsored by U.S. Senators Mel Martinez (R-Fla.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), will allow FHA to work with borrows to determine an appropriate home loan with greater options than previously offered by FHA. Homebuyers will be able to choose a downpayment amount, mortgage term, and premium options to fit their long-term goals.
   "I applaud Senator Talent for introducing this priority legislation in the Senate," said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson. "I want to offer my full support and urge prompt Senate consideration of this bill that would introduce a new, modern-era FHA and offer hard-working American families a variety of safe homeownership options at a fair price."
   "FHA modernization is a top priority for MBA," said Regina Lowrie, Chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) and President of Gateway Funding Diversified Mortgage Company. "We believe that the Senate must act on Senator Talent's legislation this year to ensure that FHA programs can continue to be sound and relevant tools for lenders to use in serving the housing needs of American families who are unserved or underserved by conventional markets." 
   "The National Association of REALTORS wants to applaud Senator Talent, Senator Isakson, Senator Chambliss, and Senator Martinez along with HUD Secretary Jackson and FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery for their tremendous efforts in keeping the dream of homeownership alive for families across this nation," said Tom Stevens, 2006 President of the National Association of REALTORS. "NAR has long been a supporter of FHA's single family mortgage insurance program, which has proved highly beneficial in helping low-, moderate-, and middle-income people achieve the dream of homeownership."
