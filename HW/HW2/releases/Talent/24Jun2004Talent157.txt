SEN. TALENT SECURES DEFENSE FUNDING FOR MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today praised the swift passage of the Defense Appropriations bill which includes funding he secured for Missouri defense programs.  
   "Defense spending means security for our families and jobs for our workers," said Talent, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "Missouri produces key aircraft, weapons and equipment for all the services and this legislation supports tens of thousands of workers throughout the state. Sen. Bond's leadership on the Appropriations Committee was critical to securing more federal dollars for Missouri's defense programs. I was pleased to work with him on behalf of our nation's security and defense jobs for our workers."
   Sen. Talent today offered an amendment which was passed by the Senate to provide $5 million to begin development of the X-43C Hypersonic demonstration aircraft. This aircraft will demonstrate the feasibility of flying at speeds up to Mach 10. The X-43C program is a partnership between Boeing's Phantom Works in Missouri and ATK in Tennessee.
