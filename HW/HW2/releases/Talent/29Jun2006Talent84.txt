SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES MEASURE TO KEEP MAPPING CENTER IN ROLLA
  Sens. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Kit Bond (R-Mo.) today announced that the Mid-Continent Mapping Center in Rolla would be kept open under language they successfully included in the Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. Additionally, the Center will be able to participate in a fair and open competition to continue future functions of the National Geospatial Technical Operations Center. The Senators' request was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  
   "This is a great victory for the highly skilled employees at the mapping center in Rolla," said Sen. Talent. "We knew from the get go that Department of Interior had an agenda, and this provision stops the closure of the mapping center. It also creates a level playing field for the workers in Rolla. I know that they can compete, and win, if given a fair opportunity." 
   "Today's success is much-needed good news for the dedicated Rolla employees," said Senator Kit Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This action will make right a flawed decision. I have complete confidence in these skilled Missouri workers when they are given a fair chance." 
   The committee report states that a fair and open competition will be held and that both the Rolla and Denver, Colorado, sites will receive funds and support to fairly compete in the bidding process. The MidContinent Mapping Center employs over 130 skilled men and women. Earlier this year, the center was scheduled close and be consolidated by USGS to a National Geospatial Technical Operations Center in Denver. Senators Talent and Bond and Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson (MO-8) worked to keep the operations in Rolla. 
   Senators Talent and Bond's request passed the Senate Appropriations Committee, and must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill before being signed into law.
