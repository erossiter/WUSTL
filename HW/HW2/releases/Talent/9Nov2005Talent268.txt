SEN. TALENT, REP. GRAVES ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR NITRO
  Sen. Jim Talent and Rep. Sam Graves announced today they had secured $200,000 in funding for the Northwest Missouri Interagency Team Response Operation (NITRO). NITRO, which includes a 16-county area of Northwest Missouri, is staffed by full-time law enforcement officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the Maryville Public Safety Department and the Cameron Police Department. Additional law enforcement agencies participate on a case-by-case basis in their jurisdictions.  
   The funding will be used to add five officers to the task force. Talent said thatthe NITRO funding was critical in responding to regional emergencies, particularly when responding to methamphetamine lab busts.
   "This is a critical program which is responsible for deploying highly trained officers to investigate drug offenses and violent criminal offenses including meth cooks," said Sen. Talent. "Law enforcement officials have told me the No. 1 problem in Missouri is fighting the meth epidemic, and these funds will go toward tracking down and locking up meth cooks and other criminals. This response team has been enormously effective in Northwest Missouri and this funding will help them keep our neighborhoods safe."
   Graves, who fought to get a DEA agent stationed in Northwest Missouri, said that this funding would help put drug dealers behind bars.
   "NITRO has done a terrific job in coordinating the efforts of local law enforcement officials," said Graves. "This funding will help our dedicated law officers bring drug dealers to justice and help make our neighborhoods and schools safer for our children."
   The earmark was included in the Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations bill which funds each Department. The House passed the bill today and the Senate will likely act later this week. The bill will then be sent to the President for his signature.
