SEN. TALENT SECURES $2 MILLION FOR NORTH CASS PARKWAY CORRIDOR IN BELTON
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $2 million for the North Cass Parkway Corridor in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the House and Senate today.  
   "We passed a good 2006 Transportation Appropriations bill in the Senate and I'm proud to partner with local communities to deliver additional funding for important transportation projects," said Sen. Talent. "The key is to talk to people in the community to find out what they need and then take those concerns to the Senate. Officials in Belton told me they could use some help funding this project and we successfully advocated for it in the Senate."
   The North Cass Parkway corridor will have a significant impact on improving air quality, improving the severity of traffic incidents, and improving public safety by reducing emergency vehicle response times from U.S. 71 to Mullen Road. The funds will also be used to improve local economic development opportunities in the southern portion of Belton by removing transportation-related impediments related to direct access to US 71. 
   Sen. Talent's request passed the House and Senate today and will then be signed into law by the President.
