SENS. TALENT, BOND, REP. GRAVES ANNOUNCE $48,600 FOR NEW FIRE TRUCK
  Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond and Rep. Sam Graves announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $48,600 grant for the Shelby Rural Fire Department. The funds will be used to purchase a new fire truck. 
   "I am pleased to announce this Homeland Security grant for the firefighters protecting Shelby," said Sen. Jim Talent. "I believe it is important that we provide Missouri's first responders with the resources they need to meet local priorities. This grant will result in better protection for the citizens in Linn County. I will continue to work with Senator Bond and Congressman Graves to do even more for our local fire departments across Missouri."
   "A lack of funding should never make the difference between life or death for a fire-fighter or a victim, which is why I have been committed to ensuring that the federal government meets its responsibilities to fire-fighters," said Sen. Kit Bond. "Our first responders put their lives on the line to protect our families, friends and homes and these dollars will help them do their jobs more safely."
   "I appreciate the service of the firefighters in Shelby," Rep. Sam Graves said. "We must invest in their safety and effectiveness and this grant will help supply them with the equipment necessary to carry out their duty. Firefighters are trained to handle a wide range of problems and disasters and this grant provides the needed investment to help them meet the challenge."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
