SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $568,000 TRANSPORTATION GRANT FOR ST. LOUIS
 Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a $568,000 grant to the East-West Gateway Coordination Council.  
 The funds will be used for phase two of the Metropolitan Planning Study for the Metropolitan Airport System in St. Louis.
   "I am pleased to announce this funding for East-West Gateway Coordination Council in St. Louis," said Sen. Talent. "This study will serve the entire St. Louis area in making necessary improvements to the region's aviation infrastructure. A well coordinated aviation infrastructure is an important part of economic development to our state."
   "This grant will help us plan the future of our five major regional airports so that they can operate more effectively as a system and they can be equipped to play a more prominent role in the nation's aviation system," said Les Sterman, Executive Director of East-West Gateway Council of Governments.
   The Metropolitan Planning Study will begin the process of determining what the capital investment needs of the five regional airports will be in the future. The study will also provide information about how each airport fits into the national marketplace for aviation services. As a result, they will be able to build a market for each of the airports and how to make all the airports together a stronger system for the region. Ultimately, the strategy will outline ways to attract business to the St. Louis region.
