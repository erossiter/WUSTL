   Sen.  
 Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote in support of Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court:
   "Judge Alito is among the most qualified Supreme Court nominees in our country's history. And I'm very pleased that we are now one step closer to confirming him to the Supreme Court. I've said he has the experience, temperament and integrity that Americans should expect in a Supreme Court Justice. 
   "I am hopeful that senators will avoid politics so we can proceed to a prompt, up-or-down vote on Judge Alito's nomination.
