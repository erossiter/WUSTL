SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $24,683 GRANT TO SICKLE CELL DISEASE TREATMENT CENTER IN ST. LOUIS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have awarded a $24,683 grant to the Sickle Cell Disease Medical Treatment and Education Center at Washington University in St. Louis.  
 The funds will be used to help teenagers with Sickle Cell Disease complete their high school education through mentoring and leadership programs.
   "Sickle Cell Disease impacts tens of thousands of Americans and far too long it has lived in the shadows of other diseases that have received more attention and resources," said Sen. Talent, author of the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Act in the Senate. "Secretary Thompson and the Administration understand the importance of making resources available to sickle cell disease patients, especially the many children who suffer from this terrible blood disorder. This grant is good news for the kids that will benefit from Camp Crescent and I am very pleased to partner with CMS in making this important announcement." 
   Sickle Cell Disease affects about one in 300 African-American newborns. It is an inherited defect in blood that causes normally round blood cells to take on a sickle shape. These sickle-shaped cells clog the bloodstream, creating obstructions that result in severe medical complications. The disease affects approximately 70,000 Americans; more than 2,500,000 Americans, mostly African-Americans, have the sickle cell trait. 
   These funds were secured by Senator Talent in the 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill.
