SEN. TALENT TO TOUR LIBERTY MEMORIAL
  On Friday, July 2, 2004, Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo) will take a tour of the Liberty Memorial, including the space that will house the expanded Liberty Memorial Museum. The Liberty Memorial Museum is currently included in legislation that will designate it as "America's National World War I Museum."  
   Sen. Talent successfully added an amendment to the defense bill to designate the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City as America's World War I Museum. Sen. Talent's amendment was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 15.
   "The Liberty Memorial is a national treasure and an institution in Kansas City," said U.S. Sen. Jim Talent. "Our legislation would provide well-deserved recognition for Kansas City which is very proud to have one of the largest World War I collections in the country. I am honored to join with the Liberty Memorial leadership and the people of Kansas City who have dedicated their time, energy and resources to the museum." 
   A similar designation for World War II was recently bestowed on the D-Day Museum in New Orleans. 
   "The designation, if approved, as America's National World War I Museum, will open many doors for us, both financially and educationally," said Steve Berkheiser, Executive Director, Liberty Memorial Association. "We are very grateful that Senator Talent, as well as the rest of Missouri Congressional delegation, has recognized that the Liberty Memorial is truly a national treasure." 
   The Liberty Memorial Museum preserves the most comprehensive collection of World War I historical materials in the United States. The Liberty Memorial was completed in 1926 and is one of the oldest monuments to peace and freedom in the United States, and is the only museum in the United States dedicated to those who served in World War I.
