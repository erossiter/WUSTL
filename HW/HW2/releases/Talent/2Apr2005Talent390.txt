SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the death of Pope John Paul II: 
   "An extraordinary life has come to an end. Pope John Paul II has left an indelible mark on the world and on the history of mankind. The title of George Weigel's biography captured the Holy Father best: he was a witness to hope. The moral clarity his leadership provided helped build democracies and brought faith and hope to the empty and hopeless.
   "This faithful servant of the Lord was an inspiration to Missourians and countries and cultures around the world. Certainly he was an inspiration to me. One of the greatest honors I've had in all my years in public life was meeting him when he visited Missouri six years ago.
   "As we mourn the Pope's passing, we also celebrate his spiritual leadership, his humanness, his courage and his works that for years to come will continue helping the people of this world prepare for the next."
