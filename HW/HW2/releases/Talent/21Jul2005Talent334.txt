SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 TO REVITALIZE URBAN BASEBALL FIELDS IN KANSAS CITY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 to revitalize urban baseball field for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City. Sen.  
 Talent secured the funding in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   "We are absolutely committed to partnerships that help Missouri's young people," said Sen. Talent. "When you partner the great American pastime of baseball with eager Kansas City kids, good things will happen. It is my hope that in the years to come, thousands of kids will get the opportunity to play baseball in a clean and safe environment in the heart of downtown Kansas City."
   Sen. Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then reconciled with the House bill.
