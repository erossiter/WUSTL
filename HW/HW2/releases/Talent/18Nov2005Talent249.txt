Over the years, I have worked closely with business leaders in the community and we need to provide them with the tools they need to start new businesses to the St. Louis area so we can create jobs."
   "This funding will help the get the Bosnian Cultural Community Center project off the ground," said Sadik Kukic, Vice President/Treasurer of the Bosnian Chamber of Commerce. "We will be able to provide citizenship classes, among other educations courses to help Bosnians start a new life in the St. Louis area. We appreciate Sen. Talent for his support in securing these funds."
