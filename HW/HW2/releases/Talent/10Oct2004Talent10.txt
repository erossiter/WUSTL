SENATE PASSES SEN. TALENT BILL TO EXPAND TRUMAN FARM HOME
  The U.S. Senate today passed legislation to nearly double size of the Harry S. Truman Farm Home in Grandview, Missouri. This legislation was sponsored in the Senate Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.)  
   "The Truman Farm home is a national treasure and a tremendous source of pride for the people of Grandview and Kansas City," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "It is here that Harry S. Truman's mother said he got his common sense. This bill will permit the National Park Service to ensure the protection of the Farm Home and the historic grounds for generations to come. I am please we could pass this in the senate and send it to the President for his signature."
   Sen. Talent sponsored the Truman Farm Home Expansion Act (S. 2499) in the Senate and U.S. Rep. Karen McCarthy (Mo.-5) then introduced the companion to this legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Talent, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, worked to bring this legislation out of committee and today brought up the companion measure for passage in the Senate. 
   Currently the Truman Farm is located on a 5.2 acre site. Sen. Talent's legislation would nearly double the size of the Harry S. Truman Historic site by giving the government the authority to purchase approximately 5-acres of land on the south side of the property. This area is basically undeveloped except for a small retail paint store located at the west end and fronting on Blue Ridge Boulevard. The proposed 5-acre strip is the only undeveloped land that remains of the original 600-acre Truman Farm.
   The bill is now waiting to be signed by President Bush to become law.
