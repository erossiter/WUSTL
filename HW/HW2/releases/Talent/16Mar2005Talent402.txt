SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES LEGISLATION TO PERMIT BOY SCOUTS TO GATHER ON FEDERAL PROPERTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced legislation to allow the Boy Scouts of America equal access to public facilities, forums and programs, even if the federal government owns the property.  
 The legislation, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn), would make certain Boy Scouts are treated fairly. Sen. Talent is an original co-sponsor of the Support Our Scouts Act.
   "Scouting is an American institution that has helped millions of young people become adults with good hearts and virtuous characters," said Sen. Talent. "Our legislation says you can hold an activity on federal property even if you are a member of the Boy Scouts. The Boy Scouts of America is a great organization and the federal government needs to make clear that it views the Scouts as partners, not adversaries."
   The Support Our Scouts Act guarantees the Boy Scouts' right to equal access in the following ways: It removes any doubt that Federal agencies may welcome Scouts to hold meetings and go camping on federal property, and it makes certain that the Defense Department can continue to provide the support it has in the past consistent with U.S. law. 
   The bill will help make sure state or local government entities do not deny Boy Scouts equal access to public facilities, programs, or forums. This legislation also clarifies that federal law does not compel a federal agency from providing less support to the Scouts than the agency has in the past.
