SEN. TALENT: GOVERNMENT'S NEW DIETARY GUIDELINES ARE COMMON SENSE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, commented on new dietary guidelines issued today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advising Americans to exercise regularly, consume fewer calories, drink low fat milk and eat more nutrient-dense foods.  
 The new guidelines will eventually replace the 12-year-old food pyramid.
   Sen. Talent's statement follows:
   "These are common sense guidelines. Each of us should take personal responsibility for our diet, and our children's diet, and the government's role should be to make certain it provides the best information possible to help people stay healthy. The food pyramid needs revision and I'm hopeful these guidelines will help people achieve their personal goals to eat better and live healthier lives. I look forward to working with the incoming Agriculture Secretary on this important issue."
