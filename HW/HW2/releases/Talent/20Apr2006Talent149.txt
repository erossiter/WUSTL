SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES OVER 648,000 MISSOURI SENIORS NOW HAVE DRUG COVERAGE UNDER NEW MEDICARE LAW
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that nearly 71 percent of Missouri seniors are enrolled in the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Since last month, 44,602 additional Missouri seniors signed up for the benefit bringing the total to 648,058. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released the new numbers today.  
   "Each month, tens of thousands of Missouri seniors are signing up to pay less for their prescription drugs or to access a drug benefit for the first time," said Sen. Talent, who helped pass the Medicare prescription drug bill in the Senate. "My office has been working very hard to help Missouri seniors get the information they need about the new Medicare drug benefit. I've encouraged all those who are eligible, especially those without drug coverage, to take a look at the new plans and consider which one might be right for them."
   Seniors who have not yet signed up have until May 15, 2006, before the next enrollment period begins in November.
   There are 917,102 seniors and disabled people eligible for the Medicare benefit in Missouri. As of April 18, nearly 71 percent of those eligible in Missouri are enrolled in the new voluntary prescription drug benefit. According to CMS, nationwide, more than 93 million prescriptions were filled during March for the more than 30 million Medicare beneficiaries who are receiving drug coverage. 
   Sen. Talent has held 56 Medicare prescription drug town hall meetings since the passage of the new law including events this week in Jackson, Joplin, Kennett, Neosho, St. Joseph, Sikeston and Warrensburg. Sen. Talent and his office continue to reach out to seniors who might still have questions about the new drug plans to help address their concerns and provide them with the information they need.
