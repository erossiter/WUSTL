SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES ARRIVAL OF $247,902 FOR IN POWELL GARDENS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the $247,902 for the Heartland Harvest Garden at Powell Gardens in Kingsville is on the way.  
 The funds will be used to enhance programs educating children about plant science and water conservation. Sen. Talent secured the funds in the fiscal 2005 spending package.
   "Powell Gardens is a beautiful facility that provides our students with a unique insight into the science behind the foods we eat," said Sen. Talent, member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "With this funding, Kansas City's botanical garden can expand their interactive exhibits with new educational programs for kids on plant science and conservation."
   The Heartland Harvest Garden has many components, including the Youth Education Garden. Here, school groups can learn about how fruits, vegetables and food crops make the journey from seed to the kitchen table. In addition, they will focus on the importance of water for crops, water conservation measures and the science of water. Visitors will have opportunity the experience modern agriculture production practices and preview what is to come in the industry. 
   "As family farms have disappeared, people have fewer and fewer opportunities to observe food plants growing," said Eric Tschanz, President and Executive Director of Powell Gardens. "We will surprise visitors with a fun, stunningly beautiful and educational garden of all of the plants that sustain us."
   The history of Powell Gardens dates to 1948, when the land was purchased by George E. Powell, Sr. The land has served as a dairy farm, Boy Scout camp and agricultural and natural resource center. In 1988 it was transformed into a botanical garden. The 915 acre Gardens provide opportunities for learning and reflection through a year-round education program, research and special events.
