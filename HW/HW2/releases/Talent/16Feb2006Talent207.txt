SEN. TALENT PUSHES BIPARTISAN PLAN TO LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES
  Frustrated by the rising cost of natural gas and the federal government's reluctance to allow access to domestic supplies of natural gas, Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) is pushing a bipartisan plan to develop an oil and gas leasing program 100 miles off the Florida Coast. The plan would help sustain jobs in Missouri by lowering natural gas prices. 
   Sen. Talent's bill, (S. 2253), would allow access to enough natural gas to heat and cool nearly five million homes for 15 years. He is co-sponsoring the legislation with Senators Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). The legislation was discussed today at a hearing in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which Sen. Talent serves.
   "The best way to protect our energy security is to become more energy independent by accessing our domestic resources," said Sen. Talent. "High energy prices have forced Missourians to pay too much for too long. An abundant supply of clean, reliable domestically-produced energy is the key to our economic prosperity and energy independence. This is a pro-growth, pro-jobs bill that will help energy consumers and increase our domestic supply of natural gas."
   The legislation instructs the Secretary of the Interior to develop an oil and gas leasing program for Lease Area 181, a natural gas-rich area, 100 miles off the Florida Coast and very strictly excludes any development within 100 miles of the coastline. The lease program, which would begin within a year after the bill is enacted, would bring nearly 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to market in the near future, according to estimates by the Minerals Management Service. 
   According to the American Gas Association, there is an abundant supply of natural gas in this area, enough to heat and cool nearly five million homes for 15 years.
