SEN. TALENT URGES SENATE TO MAKE CHILD TAX CREDIT PERMANENT PRINTER FRIENDLY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today introduced an amendment expressing the Senate's support for making the child tax credit permanent.  
 In 2003, the Senate voted to increase the per child tax credit to $1,000, but if Congress doesn't act, taxes will go up for qualifying families by $500 in 2011. Sen. Talent offered a Sense of the Senate amendment, which was approved unanimously, putting the Senate on record that the child tax credit should be made permanent.
   "The child tax credit makes a big difference to families in Missouri," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent. "Families like Beth Davis, a hairdresser in Kansas City, and a single mother of three, who uses this money to help pay for necessities. The Senate should make this tax relief permanent so families can plan ahead and have the peace of mind in knowing they aren't going to pay higher taxes in the future."
   According to the Treasury Department, 543,000 married couples and single parents in Missouri have benefited from the increase in the child tax credit. 
   The child tax credit was nearly reduced by $300 in 2005, but with the strong support of Sen. Talent, the Congress prevented that tax increase by passing the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 to keep the Child Tax Credit at $1,000 per qualifying child through 2010.
   To qualify for the child tax credit, families must meet an income threshold, and qualifying children must be 17-years-old or younger, among other requirements.
