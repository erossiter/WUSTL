   "The blog will allow me to regularly share my experiences with people while I'm in Iraq and Israel," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "It's a way for me to report back to Missourians my impressions and it allows people to follow along with me as I travel in the region."
   Short for Web log, a blog is a site to which writers regularly post dated entries, much like a personal journal. Sen. Talent is encouraging readers and fellow bloggers to frequently check his Website for daily updates during his upcoming visit.
