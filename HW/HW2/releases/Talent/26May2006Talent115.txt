SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES PLAN TO END LONG-DISTANCE TELEPHONE TAX
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will stop collecting the three percent federal excise tax on long-distance telephone calls beginning July 31. The Internal Revenue Service will refund this tax collected during the past three years to businesses and individual taxpayers. Sen. Jim Talent is a cosponsor of the Telephone Excise Tax Repeal Act, to repeal the excise tax on local telephone service for Missourians.  
   "This is great news for Missourians who have been paying this unfair tax," said Sen. Talent. "For too long, our consumers have paid this tax dating back to the Spanish-American war. I will be working in the Senate to make certain Missourians will receive their full refund after filing their taxes next year." 
   Senator Talent is urging taxpayers to apply for refunds on their 2006 tax forms. The Department of Treasury estimates the national rebate total for the taxes paid over the past three years will be $15 billion. 
   Key Facts Regarding Tax Refunds: 
   * No immediate action is required by taxpayers. 
   * Refunds will be a part of 2006 tax returns filed in 2007. 
   * Refund claims will cover all excise tax paid on long-distance service over the last three years. Interest will be paid on refunds. 
   * The IRS is working on a simplified method for individuals to use to claim a refund on their 2006 tax returns.
