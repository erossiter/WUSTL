SEN. TALENT'S QUARTER-MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR ST. PATRICK HOMELESS CENTER APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today secured $250,000 for the St.  
 Patrick Homeless Partnership Center in the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate.
   "St. Patrick Center is a perfect example of good stewardship in our urban communities," said Sen. Talent. "They help provide opportunities for self-sufficiency and dignity for the homeless with an emphasis on those who experience mental illness or chemical dependence and those living at the poverty level. With these funds, the center can transform unfinished space in the facility into areas suitable for providing health care and other services for those in need."
   The funding will help complete the 100,000 square foot building located in downtown St. Louis. St. Patrick Center is an innovative one-stop center serving homeless and near homeless individuals through user-friendly services under one roof.
