SEN. TALENT JOINS FIGHT AGAINST CHILDHOOD CANCER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he is cosponsoring legislation to help find a cure for childhood cancer. Sen. Talent is supporting the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2006, which will expand research programs aimed at preventing cancer in children. More than 12,500 children are diagnosed with cancer each year, and it is the No. 1 disease killer of children.  
   "Like so many others in Missouri and around the country, my family has lost a loved one to cancer," said Sen. Talent who lost his mother, Marie, to breast cancer. "This legislation seeks to help the thousands of children who suffer from this terrible disease with a new investment in childhood cancer research. We believe this bill will offer new hope in the search for a cure for the children who are coping with cancer and their families."
   The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2006 is designed to provide funds to raise awareness about childhood cancer and support children and their families who are suffering from this disease. Cosponsors of the bipartisan bill include Senators Talent, Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Johnny Isackson (R-Ga.), Thad Chochran (R-Miss.), Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Ark.), Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), and Mary Landrieu (D-La.). 
   Each year, cancer claims the lives of over 2,000 children while an additional 10,000 are diagnosed with the disease. The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2006 will distribute $20 million dollars over a 5-year period, and create a biomedical research program aimed at curing and preventing childhood cancer. Additionally, the legislation will establish a national childhood cancer registry to monitor the incidence of childhood cancers, support a long-term survivorship center and provide informational and educational services.
