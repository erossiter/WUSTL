SEN. TALENT SECURES $300,000 FOR PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC SPRINFIELD CITY HALL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $300,000 for the continued renovation of Springfield City Hall in the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate.
   "These funds will preserve one of Springfield's most notable historic landmarks," said Sen. Talent. "It serves as the cornerstone for the City of Springfield Government Plaza. Preserving it will allow future generations to enjoy this architectural treasure."   
   Springfield City Hall was originally built in 1894 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
