SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR HISTORIC COMMERCIAL CLUB BUILDING RESTORATION IN SPRINGFIELD
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Springfield Commercial Club Building in the Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2006, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Commercial Club Building is one of just a few remaining original buildings in Springfield dating back to 1928," said Sen. Talent. "We need to restore it so we can maintain the history of the Commercial Street district." 
   The funding will be used to restore the exterior structure, replace the roof, and repair electrical and plumbing infrastructure. 
   Sen. Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Springfield. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then be reconciled with the House bill.
