SEN. TALENT HOLDS HEARING TO DISCUSS SIZE OF NAVY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), Chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, today held a hearing to examine whether the U.S. has enough ships in its fleet. Sen.  
 Talent's subcommittee received testimony from Admiral Clark, the Chief of Naval Operations, and from industry officials and the Congressional Research Service (CRS).
   "This is an extremely important hearing," said Sen. Talent. "There is no doubt that there are significant budgetary pressures on the Department of Navy. The overarching issue, however, budget pressures aside, is what is the size and composition of the Navy that we need?"
   Admiral Clark, in what is likely his final appearance before the committee, shared his concerns on future threats we face and how best to fund the naval forces our country will need. Witnesses from Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics shipyards, and from Ron O'Rourke at CRS, presented a number of recommendations that will assist the full Senate Armed Services committee as it drafts the next fiscal year's defense bill. 
   "There is a pressing need to develop a consensus both within the Congress and with the Administration that we must adequately support our naval forces," Sen. Talent said. "This means stability in funding, not only over the next few years, but over the long term, and some additional flexibility in how funds are spent. With proper oversight, Admiral Clark made a convincing case that greater flexibility is needed to realize the greatest value of our shipbuilding dollars."
