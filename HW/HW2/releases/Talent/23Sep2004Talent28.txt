SEN. TALENT NOW ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR U.S. SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Survives Committee, today announced that he is accepting applications for the U. S. Service Academies for the 2005 school year.  
   "U.S. Service Academies are among the most selective and prestigious schools in the nation," said Talent. "It is an honor for me to select and nominate young men and women from Missouri with the courage and ambition to serve our country. Year after year I am continually impressed by the talent and intelligence these students possess." 
   There are four academies: the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado; U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York; and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York. Generally, any student who will complete high school no later than spring of 2005, is a U.S. citizen, and is younger than 25 with no dependents is qualified to apply. 
   Students are asked to complete an application with a resume, an essay on why they want to enter the Academy, three letters of recommendation and a high school transcript. Interested applicants are encouraged to visit http://talent.senate.gov and download the information packet or contact Sen. Talent's Jefferson City office at (573) 636-1070 to request an application.
   Last December, Sen. Talent's Academy Review Board interviewed 121 applicants. All applications must be received by Sen. Talent's Jefferson City office by November 12, 2004.
