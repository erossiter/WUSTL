SENS. TALENT, BOND ANNOUNCE $85,500 GRANT FOR NEW FIRE TRUCK FOR CABOOL
  Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded an $85,500 grant to the Cabool Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a new tanker fire truck. 
   "I am pleased to announce this Homeland Security grant for the firefighters protecting Cabool and surrounding areas," said Sen. Jim Talent. "I believe it is important that we provide Missouri's first responders with the resources they need to meet local priorities. This new fire truck will result in better protection for the citizens of Texas County in the event of a fire. I applaud the Administration for providing these grants to local fire departments across Missouri." 
   "For firefighters all over the state, the new money for firefighting vehicles and safety will make a real difference in their ability to protect local citizens," said Sen. Kit Bond. "Our first responders are our first line of defense against any disaster, from fires to traffic accidents to oil spills to terrorism. It is important that we equip them with the resources they need to do their jobs." 
   "Right now we don't have a tanker truck for the rural areas we cover," said Fire Chief Jim Brown. "We just want to thank you all for getting us some money. The grant will be greatly appreciated."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
