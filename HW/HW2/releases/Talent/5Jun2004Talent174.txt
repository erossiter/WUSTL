SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement:
   "Ronald Reagan was larger than life. He was a great and decisive leader and a person of simple beliefs.
   "He really communicated the idea that what we do on our own in our homes, families and local schools is more important than what the government does.
   "His greatest achievement was the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   "His passing is a tremendous loss for the country. My thoughts and prayers go out to Nancy and the entire Reagan family."
