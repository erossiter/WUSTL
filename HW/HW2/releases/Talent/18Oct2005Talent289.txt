SEN. TALENT BRINGS AGRICULTURE SECRETARY TO MISSOURI FOR FARM BILL
  Sen. Jim Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today announced U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns has accepted his invitation to come to Springfield, Missouri, to host one of USDA's Farm Bill Listening Sessions. Sen.  
 Talent, who will help write the new farm bill, will attend the USDA session with Secretary Johanns, and the public is invited to attend. The event will take place on November 4, 2005, from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. The location for the event will be announced in the coming days. 
   "I wanted Secretary Johanns to come to Missouri to give producers an opportunity to provide input as the Congress begins work on the next Farm bill," said Sen. Talent. "This listening session is a chance for the Secretary to talk with, and more importantly, listen to Missouri farmers and ranchers. The best way to produce a successful Farm bill is to start working from the ground-up rather than waiting for Washington to tell our farmers w hat's best for them."
   The current 2002 Farm bill is set to expire in 2007. USDA officials will be traveling to each state over the next few months holding public listening sessions for farmers and ranchers who wish to comment on the new Farm bill. The meeting in Springfield will be open and the public is encouraged to attend.
