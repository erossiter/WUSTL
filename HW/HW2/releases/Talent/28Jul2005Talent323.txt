SEN. TALENT SECURES $3 MILLION FOR ROUTE 59 IMPROVEMENTS IN ST. JOSEPH
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $3 million to upgrade Route 59 in St. Joseph. Sen.  
 Talent added the money as an earmark to the $286.4 billion Highway bill. The funds will be used to construct an overpass bridge that would provide grade-separated access for the Stockyards Redevelopment area and improve safety for a nearby grade school located near the train tracks.
   "We are now closer than ever to passing a pro-growth, pro-jobs Highway bill that includes significant funding for important road and bridge projects in Missouri," said Sen. Talent. "I'm a big believer that transportation infrastructure funding creates jobs, generates economic growth and saves lives. By increasing the size of the transportation pie we were able to get a bigger slice for Missouri. The money it takes to widen lanes, straighten curves, broaden shoulders and build new roads and bridges is a small price to pay for economic growth and saving lives."
   The final Highway bill could be approved by the Senate and the House as early as this week. Once the Senate and House approve the Highway bill, it will be sent to the President's desk for his signature.
