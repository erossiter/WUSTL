SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $49,766 USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR PURDIN DAIRY FARM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) will help present a $49,766 Value-Added Agriculture Product Market Development Grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, to Green Hills Harvest dairy farm.  
 The mock check was presented to Kerry and Barbara Buchmayer, who operate the organic dairy farm.
   "I come from a long line of dairy farmers," said Sen. Talent. "My mother grew up on a dairy farm in Jefferson County, and I understand the amount work and investment Missouri farmers put into the industry," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "This program will help our producers capture more of the consumer dollar by adding value to their commodities. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for making investing in Green Hills Harvest dairy farm as a prosperous business in Linn County." 
   The Burchmayers bottle and distribute milk produced on their farm. They own a 65-cow cross-bred dairy herd and distribute organic milk to Columbia and Kansas City, Missouri and to Iowa City, Iowa. The funding will be part of a project to allow them to switch from plastic jugs to returnable glass.
   The grant is one of seven projects funded in Missouri for approximately one million dollars and is part of a national $13.1 million program. Missouri received 12.5 percent of the national funds.
