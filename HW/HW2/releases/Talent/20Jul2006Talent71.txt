SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR CROWDER COLLEGE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he has secured $250,000 in funding for the Crowder College Workforce Development Program in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Heath and Human Services and Education for fiscal year 2007. Sen. Jim Talent's request will be used to develop a workforce development program in Neosho.  
   "Southwest Missouri is already a leader in economic development and is one of the fastest growing regions in the country," said Sen. Talent. "With this funding, Crowder College will have the resources they need to continue working to create jobs and economic growth in the region. This initiative will help keep Neosho and the surrounding communities' economy strong by preparing workers for success in areas where there is enormous potential for new jobs and growth." 
   Crowder College provides technical education programs and customized training services for area businesses and industries. The funds will be used to add three new services to support new and existing businesses: a staging and production center, a new-business start-up center and a new-business incubator focused on renewable energy technologies. Crowder College will provide matching funds for the project. 
   Sen. Talent's funding requests passed the Senate Appropriations Committee now must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill before being signed into law.
