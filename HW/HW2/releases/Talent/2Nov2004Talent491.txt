SENS. TALENT, BOND ANNOUNCE $84,124 FIRE GRANT FOR TRENTON
  Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded an $84,124 grant to the Trenton Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a Mobile Live Fire Training Trailer.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Trenton Fire Department will be receiving this funding," Sen. Talent said. "This grant will allow the department to purchase new safety equipment to enhance service for the area in the event of a fire. I appreciate the Administration for providing resources for training and supplies for firefighters serving Grundy County."
   "For firefighters all over the state, the new money for firefighting vehicles and safety will make a real difference in their ability to protect local citizens," said Sen. Kit Bond. "Our first responders are our first line of defense against any disaster, from fires to traffic accidents to oil spills to terrorism. It is important that we equip them with the resources they need to do their jobs." 
   "As a local fire chief of a small rural community, I believe the Fire Act is the best thing that has happened with the fire service," said Tony Ralston, Trenton Fire Chief. "This grant process gets the money to the departments that have needed equipment for years. The Fire Act will continue to help local departments to better service their respective communities."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
