SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF MIERS TO ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court: 
   "The President nominated a person he believes has the integrity, legal judgment and record of accomplishment to serve on the nation's highest court. Harriet Miers has had a distinguished legal career and much of her professional life has been dedicated to public service.
   "I've always said I would support the President's Supreme Court nominee provided the person is honest, has a strong record of accomplishment and applies a consistent jurisprudence. Her record needs to be thoroughly vetted during the confirmation process, but Harriet Miers appears to be another outstanding nominee. 
   "To the Senate's credit, the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts was handled with respect and civility. My hope is that the Senate will treat Harriet Miers in the same way, avoiding personal attacks during the confirmation process."
