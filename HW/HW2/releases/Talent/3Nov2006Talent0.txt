SENS. TALENT-BOND ANNOUNCE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FOR STORM DAMAGE IN ST. LOUIS
  Sens. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Kit Bond (R-Mo.) today announced that the President has approved Gov. Matt Blunt's request for a major disaster declaration for the City of St. Louis for the devastating storms that occurred July 19-21.  
   "This announcement is good news for Missourians who were hurt by the storm," said Sen. Talent. "The St. Louis region was hit with one of the worst storms in recent history causing millions of dollars worth of infrastructure damage. This funding will help provide much needed additional assistance to help our people recover."
   "Today's disaster declaration is an important step in getting St. Louis much-needed assistance," said Senator Kit Bond. "Federal funds will play a critical role in this community's recovery."
   This declaration for Public Assistance provides supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities.
