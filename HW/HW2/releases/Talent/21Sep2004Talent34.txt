SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY, RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN PUTNAM COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Green Hills Regional Planning Commission in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 2005, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee.  
 The funds will be used to construct renewable energy and rural economic development projects in Putman County.
   "With these funds, Putman County will be able to obtain the resources they need to attract new business," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "This project is a priority for me because economic development projects are critical in rural areas. I believe these improvements will not only attract businesses, but also increase regional jobs."
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Green Hills. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then reconciled with the House bill.
