SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $3.4 MILLION IN AID FOR DISLOCATED WORKERS IN MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced a National Emergency Grant (NEG) of $3.4 million to assist former airline workers in the St.  
 Louis area. The grant, administered by the Department of Labor, will be awarded to the Missouri Division of Workforce Development. The initial release will be $851,293. 
   "I am very pleased to announce this grant for the St. Louis area," said Sen. Talent. "These funds are crucial in helping the former TWA and American Airlines workers who have been laid off. I want to thank Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao for showing the Administration's commitment to helping these workers find jobs."
   The grant will provide assistance to approximately 750 workers in the St. Louis metropolitan area affected by the downsizing of American Airlines at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. Since March 2003, Missouri has received a total of $12.9 million in NEG funds to serve over 2,600 airline workers dislocated from American Airlines. In that time, Missouri Senators Kit Bond and Jim Talent have worked closely with the Labor Department to help the dislocated airline workers.
   This grant will fund employment-related programs including individual counseling, career planning, employment development and occupational skills training. The project will be operated by the St. Louis County Missouri Career Center, St. Louis City Agency for Training and Employment, the St. Charles County Missouri Career Center and the Jefferson/Franklin Counties Missouri Career Center.
   National Emergency Grants are part of the Secretary's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.
