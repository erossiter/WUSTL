SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR WEAPONS TEST
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement on North Korea's nuclear weapons test:  
   "The reports of North Korea's test of a nuclear device demands an immediate and substantive response from the United States working in concert with Japan, South Korea, and hopefully with the support of China and Russia. I fully support U.S. and Japanese diplomatic efforts through the United Nations Security Council to impose economic and commercial sanctions that would persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. These measures could also include the inspection of all commercial vessels leaving North Korea."
