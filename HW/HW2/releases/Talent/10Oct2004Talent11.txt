SENATE PASSES SEN. TALENT BILL TO PRESERVE CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI
  The Senate today passed legislation to preserve the historic Wilson's Creek Civil War battlefield near Springfield, Missouri that stands at-risk in one of the fastest growing areas in the country. This legislation was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) 
   "This is a historically significant battlefield and we need to expand it because of the rapid growth in the Springfield area," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Energy Committee. "Our legislation would protect the field on which the battle was fought so that the full story of the first major Civil War battle west of the Mississippi can be preserved for generations to come."
   Sen. Talent's legislation was cosponsored in the Senate by U.S. Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.). Majority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) introduced the companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. Talent, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, worked to pass this legislation out of committee and today brought up the companion measure for passage in the Senate.
   The current acreage of the Wilson's Creek battlefield park is approximately 1,750 acres, but only 75 percent of the actual combat areas associated with the battle are within the park's boundaries. Sen. Talent's bill would provide permanent protection from development for significant resources that are integral to the historic events that the park was established to commemorate.
   The legislation will add approximately 615 acres from six parcels of land that make up the remaining significant resources outside the park boundary that are directly related to the battle. This bill also authorizes the acquisition of the Sweeney Museum property and collections, one of the most complete private civil war artifacts collections in existence.
   The bill is now waiting to be signed by President Bush to become law.
