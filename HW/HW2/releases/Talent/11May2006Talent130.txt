SEN. TALENT DISAPPOINTED IN CORPS SPRING RISE DECISION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement in disappointment of the Corps of Engineers decision to begin the spring rise at midnight on Friday, May 12, 2006: 
   "Last week the Corps of Engineers said the Missouri River was too high, now they are saying it's too low," said Sen. Jim Talent. "Who knows what they will tell us next week. The Corps has been void of any rational thought on this issue. Their announcement today that they will go forward with a man-made rise lacks common sense. I continue to question the science behind this reckless decision that puts the livelihood and property of Missourians at risk.".
