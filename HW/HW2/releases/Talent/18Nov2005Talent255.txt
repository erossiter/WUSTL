SEN. TALENT SPONSORS COMPREHENSIVE BORDER SECURITY BILL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he is sponsoring comprehensive legislation to secure America's borders with additional manpower, new barriers and high-tech surveillance equipment. The bipartisan Border Security and Modernization Act of 2005 would also increase resources for border detention centers and would enact stricter penalties and fines for those who break our immigration laws. Sen. Talent is sponsoring the legislation with Sens. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). 
   "I share the concerns of many Missourians that the United States requires a border management system that protects us from terrorist attacks, illegal immigration, illegal drugs and other contraband," said Sen. Talent. "A lot of people view border security as an immigration issue. It's not. It's a national security issue. Our bill represents a comprehensive approach to protect our borders and our people."
   Key Provisions in the Border Security Bill
   * Authorizes $5 billion over five years to acquire new technology, construct roads, fences and barriers, and purchase air assets like helicopters.
