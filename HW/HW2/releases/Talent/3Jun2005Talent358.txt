SEN. TALENT, REP. EMERSON ANNOUNCE $59,800 GRANT FOR PEMISCOT PORT AUTHORITY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Rep. Emerson (Mo-R) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has awarded a $59,800 Rural Business Enterprise Grant to the Pemiscot County Port Authority in Caruthersville.  
 The funds will be used to construct a new turnout on the existing railroad owned by the port. 
   "Making our ports more secure for river traffic and businesses is vital for jobs and economic growth in Southeast Missouri," said Sen. Talent. "The Pemiscot Port Authority serves as a hub to help transport products from our inland waterways to market. I will continue working with Congresswoman Emerson to do everything possible to invest in transportation infrastructure in Missouri from our roads to our waterways." 
   "The Pemiscot Port Authority is a vital link in our transportation infrastructure," said Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson. "Improvements to the railroad will help our farmers and manufacturers get their products to markets around the world. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for identifying this opportunity to invest in Southern Missouri jobs and growth."
   "The port is very pleased to receive this funding which will be used to install a turnout switch in our rail spur," said David Madison, Executive Director of the Pemiscot County Port Authority. "This will attract shippers that need to use rail to move products. In this way, the grant funds will increase economic activity in our area." 
   The project will benefit a small and emerging company located in the Hayti Industrial Park and will create approximately ten new jobs. The Pemiscot County Port Authority provides an effective entry into the inland waterways in Southeast Missouri. The project will extend the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, which currently services Pemiscot County, with access available at Hayti.
