SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONDEMNING TERRORIST PLOTS TARGETING U.S. AND BRITISH CITIZENS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement condemning the terrorist plots targeting U.S. and British citizens:  
   "This morning's announcement by British and U.S. officials that terrorists were plotting to destroy commercial aircraft in flight between Great Britain and the United States underscores the barbaric nature of the terrorist groups that seek to harm the U.S. and its allies. This morning's announcement is also a reminder of the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety and security of America with intelligence-gathering and terrorist surveillance. 
   "No matter what the terrorists' objectives, we will not falter in our mission, nor waver in our resolve. Either we take the war to the terrorists, or we face them at home. 
   "All Americans are grateful to our British allies for their dedication and their efforts to put a stop to these planned attacks."
