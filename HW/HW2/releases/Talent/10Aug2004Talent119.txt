SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN FOR CAMDEN COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $130,000 Water and Waste Disposal Direct Loan to the Camden County Sewer District.  
 These funds will be used to construct a new water infrastructure system.
   Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee, said, "I am very pleased to announce that the Camden County Sewer District will be receiving this loan. Having access to efficient water systems is essential to the infrastructure of Camden County. I applaud USDA Rural Development for its commitment to meeting local needs in rural Missouri."
   The new water system will include septic tank effluent pumping collection system with re-circulating sand filter treatment. And estimated 209 residential users will be served by the new system. In FY 2003, they had previously received a loan of $1,840,000 and a grant of $1,540,000. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers water and wastewater loan and grant program to improve the quality of life and promote economic development in rural America.
