SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIVE-YEAR OBSERVANCE OF SEPT. 11 ATTACKS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the five-year observance of the September 11th attacks: 
   "It is very important, five years after the attacks of September 11th, to reflect on the loss of so many American lives. We are engaged in a great endeavor to protect freedom-loving people everywhere. 
   "The Americans who died that day deserve our unflagging efforts to ensure our security now. We must not rest until we win the war against terrorism. As in previous conflicts, our servicemen and women deserve our unwavering support. 
   "We are taking the fight to the terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq where our men and women are heroically defending this nation. We owe the members of our military and their families our respect and gratitude for their sacrifice and service. 
   "The defining fact of the past five years is that if terrorism is to be defeated - and it will be defeated - the United States must lead. Success hinges on our perseverance. 
   "Abraham Lincoln was right more than he knew when he said America is mankind's last best hope. America is going to lead in this struggle and America is going to prevail. I believe very strongly with all of us pulling together freedom will triumph over darkness and fanaticism and the victims of September 11th will not have died in vain."
   Sen. Talent this morning participated in an "America Supports You" Freedom Walk in Missouri to honor and support those who are currently deployed in the global War on Terror. The Freedom Walk is an initiative of the Department of Defense to establish a national tradition to reflect on the lives lost on September 11, renew our commitment to freedom and the values of our country and to honor our veterans, past and present.
