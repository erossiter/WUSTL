SEN. TALENT'S RENEWABLE FUELS LEGISLATION BECOMES LAW AS PRESIDENT SIGNS ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today praised the signing of the comprehensive Energy bill which includes four provisions he added to the legislation to boost the production and availability of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. The President today signed the Energy bill into law providing a national blueprint for the supply, delivery and efficient use of energy resources of all kinds. 
   "Today marks a new day of economic prosperity for Missouri and the country," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent, a member of the Senate Energy Committee who helped craft the new law. "For years to come, the new Energy law will help lower energy prices for consumers by diversifying our energy supply and promoting energy of all kinds. I'm especially pleased we now have a robust Renewable Fuels Standard which will help lower gas prices over the long term. Renewable fuels are at the heart of economic growth and jobs for the future; at the heart of energy independence from foreign energy producers; at the heart of environmental quality; and at the heart of value-added agriculture for our family farmers and producers."
   The Energy bill includes the following renewable fuels initiatives sponsored by Sen. Talent:
   * 7.5 Billion Gallon Renewable Fuels Standard
   Sen. Talent was an architect of the Renewable Fuels Standard included in the new Energy law. Working with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), Sen. Talent helped negotiate the Renewable Fuels Standard which would add 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol, biodiesel and other renewables to the nation's fuel supply by 2012. Sen. Talent championed the Renewable Fuels Standard in the Energy Committee, during the floor debate and while the bill was before the Senate and House Conference Committee.
   * Talent-Obama E-85 Tax Credit
   Senators Talent and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) added to the Energy bill their bipartisan legislation, now law, to increase the availability of fuels blended with 85 percent ethanol. Talent and Obama's legislation provides a tax credit incentive of 30 percent through 2010 for switching one or more traditional petroleum pumps to E-85 fueling systems. E-85 is a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent petroleum gasoline.
   * Talent-Lincoln Biodiesel Tax Credit Extension
   Senators Talent and Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) successfully added a measure, now law, extending through 2010 the $1.00 per gallon biodiesel tax credit designed to make soybean-based biodiesel fuels cost competitive with conventional diesel fuel. Sen. Talent also worked on this initiative with Congressman Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) who was the chief sponsor of the companion legislation in the U.S. House. 
   * Talent-Lincoln Small Producer Tax Credit
   Senators Talent and Lincoln also attached to the bill a provision, now law, expanding the ten-cent-per-gallon small ethanol producer tax credit to those who produce up to 60 million gallons annually and establishes the tax credit for small biodiesel producers that make up to 60 million gallons of biodiesel per year.
