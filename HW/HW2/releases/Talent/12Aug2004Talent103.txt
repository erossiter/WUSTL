SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR NEW MADRID COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $172,000 grant and $41,600 loan to the Howardville Development Corporation.  
 These funds were made available through the Community Facility program and will be used to construct a new public safety facility.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Howardville Development Corporation will be receiving these funds," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "This new facility will provide the space necessary for our law enforcement officers and first responders. I applaud USDA Rural Development for providing funding solutions for rural communities in New Madrid County and across Missouri."
   The new facility will provide 2,900 square feet for a city hall, police station and fire department. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and healthcare facilities.
