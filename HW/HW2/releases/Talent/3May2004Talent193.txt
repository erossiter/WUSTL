SEN. TALENT INFORMS MISSOURI SENIORS OF MEDICARE RX DRUG CARD SIGN UP
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) helped inform Missouri Medicare recipients that today, May 3, marks the first day they can sign up for the new Medicare Prescription Drug Discount Card. Sen. Talent is encouraging Missouri seniors to learn about the new card and determine whether it is right for them.  
   "Approximately 900,000 Missouri Medicare beneficiaries who want it will receive in June a prescription drug card," said Talent. "The card works two ways. Every senior who wants the card can use it for a discount of up to 10 to 25 percent on prescription drugs. In addition, low-income seniors can use the card to pay for up to $600 in drug purchases. Seniors who want the card will pay an annual enrollment fee of no more than $30. Lower income seniors get the card for free."
   Beneficiaries can choose between 28 Medicare-approved cards and can compare prices of drugs offered by the drug card programs at www.medicare.gov or by calling 1-800-MEDICARE. 
   This information will help them compare discount prices negotiated by card sponsors, as well as the enrollment fees, and other card program features. Customer service representatives at 1-800-MEDICARE also will be able to answer questions about the program, help them compare drug cards and refer callers to other appropriate resources.
   "The availability of the drug discount cards means for the first time no senior will have to face the big drug companies alone," said Talent.
   The cards are an early drug benefit for seniors which passed as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug law. Starting in 2006, beneficiaries will have access to the full prescription drug benefit.
   Talent added, "Most importantly, seniors now have the security of knowing that if at any time they need a very expensive prescription drug, they will not have to choose between the necessities of life and the drugs they need to stay healthy."
