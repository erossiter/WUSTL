SENATE PASSES SEN. TALENT AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE MISSOURI MORE FLEXIBILITY ON HOMELAND SECURITY SPENDING
  Last August, Missouri hosted the Maccabi Games in which thousands of Jewish teens from across the U.S. and around the world competed in Olympic-style events. During event planning, representatives at the St. Louis Jewish Community Center, which hosted the event, were told their security budget of $55,000 was inadequate and that an additional $300,000 in funding would be necessary. Federal regulations, however, prevented the state from using available federal funds to enhance security at the event. Sen. Talent said the inflexibility was inexcusable. 
   "For the teens, families and staff who participated in the 2003 Maccabi Games, I was relieved the games went on without incident," said Sen. Talent, who along with Sen. Bond fought for more security at the Maccabi Games. "But we knew we needed to make some changes so this kind of thing doesn't happen again."
   Presently, states are required to provide a plan to the Department of Homeland Security for spending the grant funds. However, once the plan is submitted, states must spend their share of the grant money according to their plan, with little flexibility for dealing with new threats or emergencies.
   Sen. Talent's amendment calls on the Homeland Security Department to allow states flexibility in reprogramming homeland security grant funds if they determine new threats or insufficient funds in their federally approved request. Under the amendment, states would be allowed to reprogram up to 10 percent of their annual appropriations from the grant program. 
   The Homeland Security Appropriations bill now goes to a conference committee. Sen. Talent said he would continue working to make certain his amendment remains in the legislation.
   During fiscal 2004, Missouri has received $42.2 million in homeland security grants and $23.9 million for the Urban Areas Security Initiative Grant Program.
