SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S RETIREMENT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: 
   "Justice O'Connor deserves our gratitude for her nearly four decades of distinguished service to our country. She worked hard and always conducted herself in a manner fitting of the Supreme Court of the United States. Moreover, Justice O'Connor broke an unfair and unjust tradition when she became the first woman to serve on the nation's highest court and for this reason she deserves her place in history.
   "We all wish President Bush wisdom as he makes the difficult decision in choosing her successor. I am going to look carefully at his nominee and my intent is to vote to confirm this individual provided they are honest, effective, a leader in the legal community and have a consistent application of jurisprudence that is within one of the mainstreams of American law.
   "My hope is that the Senate will proceed expeditiously to a fair hearing and an up or down vote on his nominee. I also hope that everyone will treat the President's nominee with respect and avoid personal attacks during the confirmation process."
