SENS. BOND-TALENT ANNOUNCE $360,526 FOR FLINTLOCK ROAD OVERPASS
  Sens. Kit Bond and Jim Talent today announced that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded a $360,526.93 grant to help pay for the new Flintlock Road Overpass near the City of Liberty.  
 The new road would extend to Liberty Drive and reduce traffic congestion on the Missouri 152 bridge over I-35.
   "By investing in our nation's roads and bridges we are investing in our economy. Most importantly, increasing investments in our system of roads and bridges saves lives," said Senator Kit Bond. "I am glad that we were able to secure the funds for this important overpass in Liberty. These funds are good news for the community."
   "The Flintlock Road Flyover is a top priority for the community and it's a top priority for me," said Sen. Talent. "This expansion will save lives and improve and the quality of life for Missourians. It's also an investment in our state's transportation infrastructure which will generate jobs and economic growth."
   Senators Bond and Talent secured these funds through the FY 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. Earlier this year, the senate approved the measure 65-28 and it was later signed by President Bush.
