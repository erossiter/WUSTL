SEN. TALENT STATEMENT ON DECISION TO INCREASE AIRPORT SCREENERS AT LAMBERT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) announcement that they are scrapping a plan to cut screeners at Lambert Airport in St.  
 Louis, and will instead add 29 screeners to the security workforce:
   "This is great news for the St. Louis area and everyone in Missouri who uses Lambert Airport. We recognized immediately that a substantial cut in the number of screeners means longer lines and less security. We shared our concerns with TSA officials, asking them to review their analysis using current data. To their credit, they agreed with us. Adding screeners at Lambert will help maintain the highest level of security and service for everyone who uses the airport."
