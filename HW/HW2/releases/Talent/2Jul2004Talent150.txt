SEN. TALENT ENCOURAGED THAT JOBS ARE INCREASING AS ECONOMY GROWS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today said he continues to be encouraged by good economic news including today's announcement by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor that the U.S. added 112,000 in June.  
 Nationwide, over 1.5 million more jobs have been created over the past ten months: 
   Sen. Talent issued this statement following today's announcement:
   "The economic recovery has been underway for months now and we should all be encouraged by this news. President Bush's jobs and growth agenda is working and the tax relief package we passed last year continues to stimulate the economy.
   "The federal government is doing its part to promote an economic climate that helps employers hire more people, purchase new equipment and expand their businesses, whether they're big or small.
   "The Congress must continue to enact a pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda so we can do even more for the economy. We need a good highway bill, a comprehensive energy package, Association Health Plans and medical liability reform. This good news should make the Senate even more vigilant to pass this agenda."
