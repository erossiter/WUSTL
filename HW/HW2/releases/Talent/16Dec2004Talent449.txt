SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR HARVEST GARDEN IN POWELL GARDENS
 Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced $250,000 for the Heartland Harvest Garden at Powell Gardens in Kingsville. The funds will be used to enhance programs educating children about plant science and water conservation. Officials and representatives of Powell Gardens joined Talent for the announcement at the facility. 
   "Powell Gardens is a beautiful facility that provides our students with a unique insight into the science behind the foods we eat," said Sen. Talent, member of the Senate Committee for Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. "With this funding, their interactive exhibits will expand with new educational programs for kids on plant science and water quality."
   The Heartland Harvest Garden has many components, including the Youth Education Garden. Here, school groups can learn about how fruits, vegetables and food crops make the journey from seed to the kitchen table. In addition, they will focus on the importance of water for crops, water conservation measures and the science of water. Visitors will have opportunity the experience modern agriculture production practices and preview what is to come in the industry.  
   "As family farms have disappeared, people have fewer and fewer opportunities to observe food plants growing," said Eric Tschanz, President and Executive Director of Powell Gardens. "We will surprise visitors with a fun, stunningly beautiful and educational garden of all of the plants that sustain us."
   The history Powell Gardens dates to 1948, when the land was purchased by George E. Powell, Sr. The land has served as a dairy farm, Boy Scout camp and agricultural and natural resource center. In 1988 it was transformed into a botanical garden. Groundbreaking for the new Heartland Harvest Garden is scheduled for spring of 2005 and construction is to be completed by 2007. 
   Talent secured the funds in the fiscal 2005 spending package.
