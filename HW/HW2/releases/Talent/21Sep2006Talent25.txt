SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES OFFICIAL DESIGNATION OF LIBERTY MEMORIAL IN KANSAS CITY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) announced that the Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne today designated the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, as a national historic landmark in recognition of its role in memorializing World War I service as well as its notable design. In 2004, Sen. Jim Talent successfully amended the Defense Authorization bill to designate the Liberty Memorial as the National World War I Museum.  
   "The Liberty Memorial is an institution in Kansas City and I believe it's an important institution for the country," said Sen. Talent. "This designation will provide well-deserved recognition for Kansas City, which is very proud to have one of the largest World War I collections in the country. I want to thank John Dillingham, Carl DiCapo and everyone at Liberty Memorial who worked hard to make this designation possible and make certain as many Americans as possible have the opportunity to experience the museum."
   "The Liberty Memorial in Kansas City is one of the most compelling monuments constructed in honor of those who gave their lives in World War I," said Secretary Kempthorne. "Its beautiful monument and museum complex exemplifies visionary city planning and architectural innovations of the early 20th Century. 
   The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum in the nation dedicated exclusively to interpreting the experiences of the United States and its allies in the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the battlefield and on the home front. Today, the museum seeks to educate all Americans through its comprehensive collection of historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of soldiers on the battlefield and Americans on the home front, and the impact of World War I on Americans, then and now.
