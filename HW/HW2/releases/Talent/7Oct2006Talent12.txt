   "I will always cherish the opportunities I had to visit with Buck O'Neil. He was a great and loving man with a heart as big as Kansas City. He belongs in America's Hall of Fame for his contributions on and off the field as a ballplayer, veteran, community leader and role model. He will be missed, but never forgotten. His legacy as the Ambassador of the Negro Leagues will continue forever at America's National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum - a gift he left for us all."
