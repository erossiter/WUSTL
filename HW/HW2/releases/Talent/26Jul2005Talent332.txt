SEN. TALENT VOTES TO PERMIT BOY SCOUTS TO GATHER ON FEDERAL PROPERTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today voted for an amendment guaranteeing the right of the Boy Scouts of America to have equal access to public facilities, forums and programs for their events.  
 The amendment, which passed today as part of the Defense bill, removes any doubt that federal agencies may welcome Scouts to hold meetings and go camping on federal property. 
   Some special interest groups have insisted that allowing Scouts to camp or hold events on federal property is a violation of the law.
   "Scouting is an American institution that has helped millions of young people become adults with good hearts and virtuous characters," said Sen. Talent. "The Boy Scouts of America is a great organization and the federal government needs to make clear that when the Scouts are given permission to hold a jamboree or a campout on federal property, it is not an illegal activity."
   The Support Our Scouts amendment guarantees the Boy Scouts' right to equal access by removing any doubt that federal agencies may welcome Scouts to hold meetings and go camping on federal property. It also makes certain that the Defense Department can continue to provide the support it has in the past consistent with U.S. law. 
   The amendment was added to the Defense Authorization bill which is currently being debated in the Senate. The Defense bill must now be voted on by the full Senate.
