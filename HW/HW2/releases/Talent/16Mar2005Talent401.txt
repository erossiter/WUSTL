SEN. TALENT VOTES TO ALLOW OIL EXPLORATION IN ANWR
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Energy Committee, today voted to allow oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Region in Alaska, a measure the Teamsters Union has estimated will create 14,000 jobs in Missouri.  
 The Senate struck down an amendment to strip the provision in the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution by a vote of 51-49.
   "The Senate today supported a pro-jobs, pro-growth measure that will reduce America's dependence on unreliable foreign sources of oil," said Sen. Talent. "We can explore for oil in the Arctic in an environmentally-sensitive way, using the highest technologies, while creating jobs and making energy more affordable for everybody."
   The measure would open up a small portion of the ANWR to oil exploration. No more than 2,000 acres out of the 19-million-acre refuge will be utilized for energy production. This sliver of Alaska's vast coastal plain is roughly the size of Lambert Airport in St. Louis.
   The ANWR is the single greatest prospect for onshore oil and gas development of anyplace in the U.S. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that ANWR contains a mean expected value of 10.4 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. At peak production, ANWR could produce more oil than any U.S. state, including Texas and Louisiana.
   The potential jobs created by exploring for oil in the ANWR is the reason why the Carpenters District Council of Greater St. Louis and Vicinity who represent over 22,000 members and the Missouri Laborers who represent more than 13,000 members, strongly support the measure.
