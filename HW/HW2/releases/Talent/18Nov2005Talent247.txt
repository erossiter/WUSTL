SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR WINSTON CHURCHILL MEMORIAL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $250,000 for the Winston Churchill Memorial in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which is expected to pass the Congress today.  
   "The Winston Churchill Memorial and Library houses a magnificent collection of documents and exhibits showcasing Churchill's historic visit to Westminster College," said Sen. Talent. "The Memorial is a cultural treasure in mid-Missouri. Renovating the library and museum is a very crucial step in preserving the integrity of this historic site." 
   "Westminster is deeply appreciative of the efforts of Senator Talent to help us ensure the Churchill legacy continues," said Westminster President Fletcher M. Lamkin. "We look forward to celebrating the 60th anniversary of Churchill's Iron Curtain speech on our campus with the grand reopening of the newly renovated Churchill Museum March 5--an achievement made possible because leaders such as Senator Talent share our vision for what an important influence the life and work of Churchill can offer future generations."
