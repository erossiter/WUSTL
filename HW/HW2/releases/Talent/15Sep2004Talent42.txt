SEN. TALENT SECURES $26,000 FOR MOBILE DRUG COMMAND IN WIGHT COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $26,000 for the Wright County Sheriff's Department in Hartville to be included in the FY 2005 Commerce Justice State Appropriations Bill.  
   "These funds will provide a 16 foot mobile command trailer to infiltrate rural meth production sites," said Sen. Talent. "Meth is a serious problem in our state and we need to get serious about fighting it. This trailer will include a fingerprint station, evidence storage, AFIS computer capabilities and hazardous materials disposal ability. The Wright County law enforcement officers will be able to use this equipment to eliminate meth in our communities and keep our neighborhoods safe." 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
