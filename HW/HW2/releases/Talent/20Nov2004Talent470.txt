SEN. TALENT'S QUARTER-MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR POWELL GARDENS APPROVED BY CONGRESS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $250,000 for Powell Gardens in Kingsville for plant science and water conservation in the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the House and Senate. 
   "Powell Gardens is a beautiful facility that provides our students with a unique insight into the science behind the foods we eat," said Sen. Talent. "With this funding, their interactive exhibits will expand with new educational programs for kids on plant science and water quality."
   Powell Gardens will teach school groups about how fruits, vegetables and food crops make the journey from seed to the kitchen table. In addition, they will focus on the importance of water for crops, water conservation measures and the science of water.
   Sen. Talent's request passed the House and the Senate today and now must be signed into law by the President.
