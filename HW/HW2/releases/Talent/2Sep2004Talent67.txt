SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $86,390 FIRE GRANT FOR BRADLEYVILLE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded an $86,390 grant for the Bradleyville Rural Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase water pumps for the firefighting vehicles used to extinguish brush and forest fires. 
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Bradleyville Rural Volunteer Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters volunteer their time to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This grant is great news for our fire department," said Fire Chief Kenyon Whittaker of Bradleyville. "This new equipment will give us the ability to better fight brush and forest fires in our area."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
