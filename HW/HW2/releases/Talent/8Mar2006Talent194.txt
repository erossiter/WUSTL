SEN. TALENT LEADS EFFORT OPPOSING PROPOSED AGRICULTURE BUDGET CUTS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, is leading an effort against a proposal by the Bush Administration to cut agriculture spending by about $6 billion over five years. Sen. Talent and 25 senators on both sides of the aisle sent a letter today to leaders on the Senate Budget Committee making the case against the cuts. 
   "We should not try to balance the budget on the backs of Missouri's farmers and ranchers," said Sen. Talent. "Our producers create jobs, generate economic growth, and provide the safest, most abundant and most affordable food supply in the world. The Senate should support our farmers and ranchers by supporting an adequate budget for agriculture."
   The senators point out in the letter that farm programs only amount to 0.76 percent of federal spending, while generating about 17 percent of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 25 million jobs and $3.5 trillion in economic activity. 
   Agriculture is a leading industry in Missouri where farmers and ranchers contribute $5 billion to the state's economy through crop and livestock sales. 
   Sen. Talent said he supports the effort to reduce the deficit, but he emphasized the need to consider how much the Farm bill has contributed to deficit reduction. According to the Congressional Budget Office, U.S. farm policy for commodities has already achieved $12.9 billion in savings compared with 2002 projections.
