 Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), U.S. Department of Transportation, has awarded a $991,374 grant to Southwest Missouri State University.  
 The grant will be used to fund construction of an intermodal transfer facility on the Springfield campus.
   "I am pleased to announce this funding for Southwest Missouri State University," said Sen. Talent. "Transportation infrastructure is also important to our higher education institutions. This project will benefit faculty and students by offering them safe and reliable transportation around campus."
   Southwest Missouri State University will use the $991,374 to continue construction of an intermodal facility on campus. The project consists of park-and-ride facilities, installation of surveillance equipment, bicycle lockers, landscaping, lighting, passenger amenities and information kiosks. The grant will also provide funding to construct a transit way connection with bicycle paths and sidewalks adjacent to the transit ways. In FY 2004, the university received $2,427,184 for the transfer facility.
