SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR SAVANNAH
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $400,000 Rural Rental Housing Loan to Savannah Housing, Inc.  
 The funds will be used to make repairs and improvements to a senior citizen housing complex. 
   "Our seniors kept their commitments to us and now it's time for us to keep our commitments to them," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. "These funds will help improve the quality of life for the seniors who live there. I applaud the Savannah Housing Inc. for all of their work in making improvements to the facility on behalf of our seniors."
   The Savannah Housing Inc. will be using the funds to install heat pumps, replace sidewalks, siding and windows. The Rural Rental Housing Loam (RRHL) program provides loans to increase the number of affordable moderate income rural rental housing by issuing approved loan guarantees. This program allows recipients to construction, purchase and rehabilitate buildings, as well as improve the land surrounding the facilities.
