SEN. TALENT QUESTIONS ADMINISTRATION'S PORT PLAN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today questioned a Bush Administration plan to turn over control of six major American ports to a foreign company owned by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Missouri's senator also called on U.S. Treasury Secretary Snow to investigate the proposal.  
   Sen. Talent issued the following statement:
   "This strikes me as a very dangerous move. I have to question the decision to turn over the operations of key American ports to a company inside the UAE, especially when we know our ports are a target for terrorists seeking to destroy critical infrastructure and disrupt world trade.
   "Secretary Snow should thoroughly investigate this proposal and I will be talking with senators in both parties about what steps the Senate may need to take to make certain our ports continue to be protected.".
