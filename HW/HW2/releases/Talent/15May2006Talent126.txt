SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS ON IMMIGRATION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) issued the following statement tonight following the President's remarks on immigration: 
   "We need to protect America's security and that means securing America's borders. Border security is a national security issue rather than an immigration issue and the President was right to discuss the need to better protect our borders.
   "I've proposed a bipartisan Border Security bill with Senators Domenici and Dorgan that would help protect us from terrorist attacks, undocumented immigration and the importation of illegal drugs such as methamphetamine. We must provide assistance to those states along the border whose local authorities have been overwhelmed by this problem. I believe the National Guard proposal is a good short-term solution, but we must do more to provide additional resources for border protection as we have outlined in our Border Security bill.
   "While I appreciate the President's remarks on border security, I can not support his guest worker proposal because I believe it amounts to amnesty and I do not support amnesty for those who have violated our laws. As I've said, this is a nation of immigrants, but it's also a nation of laws. I will continue to support strong and effective measures to secure the border as the Senate continues debate on this issue."
