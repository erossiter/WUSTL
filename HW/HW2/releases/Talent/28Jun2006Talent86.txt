SENS. BOND-TALENT ANNOUNCE OVER $1 MILLION TO AID LAID OFF ST. LOUIS AUTO INDUSTRY WORKERS
  Sens. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) and Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced a National Emergency Grant (NEG) of $1,030,535 to assist former workers of Ford Motor Company and Lear Seating Corporation in the St. Louis area. The grant, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), will be awarded to the Missouri Division of Workforce Development.  
   "Federal assistance funds will be key in helping the former Ford and Lear workers who have been laid-off," said Sen. Kit Bond. "This is much needed relief for the hard working Missourians who devoted years of service to these companies. I am pleased that the Administration recognizes the plight of these folks who are working to get back on their feet." 
   "Many of these men and women have dedicated their lives to Ford," said Sen. Jim Talent, a long-time advocate for the Ford Assembly Plant. "This assistance is critical for them and for their families. Sen. Bond and I have been advocating for additional help for these workers and this funding will provide them with the resources they need to get back to work." 
   This is the second installment of funds and will assist over 1100 workers affected by the layoffs at Ford Motor Company and Lear Seating Corporation. The DOL awarded $497,176 on April 15, 2005, to aid the same group of workers, bringing the total amount of assistance to $1,527,711. Senators Bond and Talent have worked closely with the Department to help the dislocated workers.
   This grant will fund employment-related programs including individual counseling, career planning, employment development and occupational skills training. The NEG program is part of the Labor Secretary's discretionary fund and is awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.
