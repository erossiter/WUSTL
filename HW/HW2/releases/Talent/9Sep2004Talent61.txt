SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $7,106 FIRE GRANT FOR LILBOURN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $7,106 grant for the Lilbourn Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase water line equipment.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Lilbourn Volunteer Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters volunteer their time to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "These grants are great for small towns like us," said Fire Chief David McLarty of Lilbourn. "We will use this grant to buy a Large Diameter Hose (LDH), which is like running a water line above ground. With a five inch diameter, it increases the volume of water produced tremendously. We greatly appreciated this funding."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
