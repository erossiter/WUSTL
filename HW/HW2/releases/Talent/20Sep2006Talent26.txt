SEN. TALENT-REP. EMERSON HELP 40 MISSOURI SCHOOL DISTRICTS ABSOLVE $5 MILLION IN SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM DEBT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (Mo.-8) today announced that, at their request, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has forgiven over $5 million in debt being assessed on 40 Missouri school districts. Earlier this year, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) directed the school districts to transfer funds into their nonprofit food service accounts due to an accounting dispute with the USDA. Talent and Emerson worked with USDA and Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to resolve the accounting error and to have the debts forgiven.
   "As we start a new school year, this announcement is a great relief to the forty school districts that will no longer be required to transfer additional funds into their food service accounts," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Many of these schools, located in rural areas with severe budget constraints, can now focus more time and attention to meeting the educational needs of their students. I asked Under Secretary Johner to look into the matter earlier this year, and I'm pleased USDA and DESE came to a positive agreement." 
   "These school districts were not at fault for the change in accounting rules, and they were unfairly being assessed for the debt after the fact. I'm glad we could set this matter straight and relieve a burden from their shoulders as school faculty and administrators prepare their budgets for the coming school year," said U.S. Rep. Emerson. "There was no wrongdoing in Missouri, but there was some heavy-handed, out-of-touch government regulation in Washington. At the end of the day, thanks largely to the efforts of Senator Talent, common sense prevailed, and I want to thank USDA for seeing the light and lifting this debt from our public schools."
   The problem resulted from an accounting disagreement between the USDA and DESE involving the way food service contractors handled commodity foods in the bidding process from 1997 to 2002. In a reply to Sen. Talent, Nancy Montanez-Johner, Under Secretary, Food, Nutrition and Consumer Service (FNS), said the $5 million debt forgiveness is based upon the assurance that internal controls are now in place to ensure that commodity values are properly credited to the nonprofit school food service accounts.
