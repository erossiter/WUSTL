SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $47,700 GRANT FOR FIRE TRUCK FOR HALFWAY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $47,700 grant for the Halfway Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a fire truck with turnout gear.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Halfway Volunteer Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "I believe it is important that we provide Missouri's first responders with the resources they need to meet local priorities. This additional fire truck will result in better protection for the citizens of Polk County in the event of a fire. I applaud the Administration for providing these grants to local fire departments across Missouri."
   "This is fantastic news for our fire department," said Fire Chief Chuck Rowely of Halfway. "This new truck will operate out of the main station and allows us to have a vehicle in all three stations. Now, each residence in Halfway will be within five miles of a fire station."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
