SENATE APPROVES SEN. TALENT LEGISLATION HONORING NEGRO LEAGUERS
  The Senate approved a measure sponsored by Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) that designates May 20, 2006 as national "Negro Leaguers Recognition Day." Sen. Talent introduced the legislation, S. Res. 466, with Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), which passed the Senate unanimously last night.  
   "Many of the greatest ballplayers to grace the diamond either played their entire career or part of it in the Negro Leagues," said Sen. Talent. "But for many Negro Leagues players, their contributions on the field, are often rivaled by the contributions they made off the field in the battle to end segregation. I believe the time has long since passed when we should stand up and recognize the lives of these extraordinary individuals."
   In 1920, an organized league structure was formed under the guidance of Andrew "Rube" Foster - a former player, manager, and owner of the Chicago American Giants. In a meeting held at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri, Foster and a few other Midwestern team owners joined to form the Negro National League. Soon after the Negro National League was formed, rival leagues formed in Eastern and Southern states, bringing black baseball to all parts of the U.S., Canada and Latin America. 
   In addition to this effort, the Senate approved Sen. Talent's legislation, S. Con. Res. 60, to designate the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (NLBM) in Kansas City as America's National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. The NLBM was founded by Buck O'Neil and Horace M. Peterson III in 1990 and is the only public museum in the nation that exists for exclusively portraying the players in the Negro Leagues from 1920 thru the 1960s. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously and must now be approved by the U.S. House before being signed into law.
