SEN. TALENT OUTLINES ANTI-METH LEGISLATION IN ST. CHARLES
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today outlined his comprehensive anti-meth bill to limit access to cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine, the primary ingredient used to make methamphetamine. The Senate Judiciary Committee is soon expected to consider the legislation, which is modeled after the successful Oklahoma law that resulted in an immediate 80 percent drop in meth labs seized. Sen. Talent has introduced the legislation with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D. Calif.). 
   "There has been a tremendous shift in momentum for this legislation since Senator Feinstein and I first introduced it," Senator Talent said. "We have always had the strong support of law enforcement, and now we are joined by a diverse group of industry leaders, including major retailers, some of whom since the introduction of our bill, have taken voluntarily steps to move products with pseudoephedrine behind the counter. Our enhanced legislation would enact the toughest standard in the country to cut off the meth cooks from the ingredient they need to make this deadly drug. By keeping products with pseudoephedrine behind the counter, we can keep methamphetamines out of our neighborhoods and schools."
   Senators Talent and Feinstein first introduced the Combat Meth Act in January 2005. Since that time, they have worked with law enforcement, retailers, and consumers to develop strengthened legislation that continues to place strict limitations on pseudoephedrine products while ensuring that legitimate consumers continue to have access to cold medicines. 
   The Talent-Feinstein bill:
   * Moves cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine behind the counter - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to appropriately limit the sale of medicines containing pseudoephedrine by placing them behind the counter and sets a limit on how much of such medicines one person can buy in a month - 7.5 grams.
   * Requires signature and identification for purchases - The Attorney General will develop regulations to ensure uniformity.
   * Creates alternate procedures for stores without pharmacies and stores in rural areas - The Drug Enforcement Administration and States will develop regulations to continue to allow cold medicine to be sold at retail stores without pharmacies and in rural areas (but which meet appropriate security criteria), consistent with the intent of the bill to limit access to pseudoephedrine.
   * Creates an airport exemption - Allows retail facilities located within a commercial airport to sell cold medicine with pseudoephedrine (in liquid form or gel caps) in single packages containing no more than 360 milligrams in a 24-hour period and requires them to follow the log book procedures established by the bill.
   * Sets a national standard - But allows states to determine appropriate penalties. 
   * Effective Date - Cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine must be moved behind the counter within 6 months of enactment.
   * Creates a national Meth treatment center - To research effective treatments for Meth abuse. 
   * Authorizes $43 million for enforcement, training, and research into treatment. This includes: 
   * $25,000,000 for local law enforcement and federal prosecutors to bring meth manufacturers and dealers to justice
   * $3,000,000 for meth treatment and research 
   * $5,000,000 to help children who have been affected by meth 
   * $10,000,000 for precursor monitoring grants 
   Sen. Talent said the continuing proliferation of methamphetamine production continues to put a severe strain on federal and local law enforcement resources. Fighting meth requires a comprehensive approach designed to assist states, local law enforcement and prosecutors to crack down on cooks and traffickers of meth while enhancing community education and awareness and treatment options for those addicted to this dangerous drug.
