SEN. TALENT'S $500,000 REQUEST FOR LIBERTY MEMORIAL MUSEUM APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $500,000 for the Liberty Memorial Museum in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which was approved today by the Senate. 
   "The Liberty Memorial is an institution in Kansas City and I believe it's an important memorial for the country," said Talent. "This funding will help complete the last phase of construction for space to house the museum's extensive collections. Since the Museum was designated the national World War I Memorial, thousands of visitors to the Kansas City area learned from and have enjoyed one of the largest World War I collections in the country."
   "This HUD funding is a great shot in the arm for us" said General Steve Berkheiser, Executive Director of the Liberty Memorial Association. "We are now in position to create a real learning laboratory utilizing our extensive museum collection of artifacts, objects and materials from World War I, and make these national treasures more assessable to the public." 
   Sen. Talent previously included $300,000 in the 2006 Interior Appropriations bill to preserve the museum's unique collection of World War I artifacts, which was signed into law by President Bush on August 2, 2005. 
   Sen. Talent's $500,000 request passed the Senate and will now go to conference with the House version of the bill.
