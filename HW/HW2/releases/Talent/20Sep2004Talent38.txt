SEN. TALENT SECURES $37.08 MILLION FOR WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today announced that he secured $37.08 million for Whiteman Air Force Base to be included in the Military Construction Appropriations Bill which passed the Senate.  
 The funds will be used to replace 160 family housing units.
   "Missouri is fortunate to have such a mission essential Air Force Base," said Sen. Talent. "Securing resources for Missouri's military bases is a priority for me. These funds will greatly increase the quality of life and moral of our troops and their families by providing them superior military housing. I want to thank Sen. Bond for partnering with me in making this a priority in the senate to benefit out military families in Missouri." 
   This Phase 6 project will fund the design and construction of 160 various single and duplex family housing units with all necessary support including garages, storage, and recreation facilities. 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Whitman Air Force base. The bill passed the full Senate this evening, and before being signed into law the bill must be reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
