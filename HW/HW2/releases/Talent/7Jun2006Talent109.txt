SEN. TALENT WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING TO PROTECT TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) said he was disappointed, but not surprised by the filibuster against the measure which would add to the Constitution the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. Sen. Jim Talent is a co-sponsor of the Marriage Protection Amendment (S. J. Res. 1).  
   "This is just the beginning of the effort to protect traditional marriage and today's vote lays the basis for a victory down the road," said Sen. Talent. "Supporters of the amendment should see this as a sign of progress and I want to encourage them to continue working to build support for this effort."
   In order to break the filibuster, 60 votes were necessary to bring the amendment to the floor for an up-or-down vote at which point it would have to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. In all, 49 senators supported the amendment by voting against the filibuster, with 48 senators voting against changing the Constitution to protect traditional marriage. 
   "This debate was forced on us by the courts of this country who are engaged in a process by which they are trying to force the people, whether they like it or not, to accept a fundamental change in the basic building block of our society," Talent said. "We have to keep the pressure on to keep the courts from changing our cultural institutions."
