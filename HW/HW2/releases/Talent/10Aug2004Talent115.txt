SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON REP. GOSS NOMINATION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Rep.  
 Porter Goss to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency:
   "Porter Goss will hit the ground running. As a former U.S. Army Intelligence officer, CIA employee and current Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he has a lifetime of experience on intelligence issues and is well-qualified for this position.
   "As head of the CIA, he will be tasked with improving our human intelligence capabilities overseas and overhauling the sharing and analysis of that information with other intelligence agencies.
   "I've had the opportunity to work with Porter Goss in the Congress and because he comes from the Congress he will know how to work with it on oversight issues related to intelligence.
   "I'm pleased that President Bush has selected such a well-qualified individual to run the CIA."
