SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY TO IRAQ
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement on the transfer of sovereignty to Iraq: 
   "This is another milestone in the road to victory in the war against terrorism. Americans should pause to take satisfaction in our achievement. We have led a coalition that has removed Saddam Hussein from power, ending his reign of tyranny. Now we have transferred sovereignty back to the people of Iraq where it belongs.
   "The road ahead is long. We must continue to be resolute because the terrorists will be looking for any sign that we do not have the conviction to see this war through."
