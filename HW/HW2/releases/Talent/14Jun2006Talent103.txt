SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT IN OBSERVANCE OF FLAG DAY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement in observance of Flag Day:  
   "On Flag Day we honor the American flag as one of the unifying symbols of our Republic. It was Harry Truman of Missouri who signed an Act of Congress in August 1949, designating June 14th of each year as National Flag Day.  
   "Our flag represents that common history and heritage which holds America together notwithstanding religious, cultural or political differences. 
   "Physical desecration of the flag degrades and coarsens our political dialogue far more than any speech or political dissent possibly could. We should never support restricting anyone's right to say or write anything they want about the flag or America. But burning a flag is not speech; it is an act with expressive overtones, and that distinction is crucial for constitutional purposes. 
   "I've cosponsored a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the flag. I urge the Senate to pass it so we can protect this vital American symbol now and for future generations."
