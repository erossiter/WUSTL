REP. EMERSON, SENS. BOND, TALENT ANNOUNCE MO-08 PROJECTS
  With today's passage of FY05 federal spending legislation (H.R. 4818), Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (MO-08) and Sen. Kit Bond, members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, respectively, today announced much-needed projects for Southern Missouri. Sen. Jim Talent also announced two initiatives on health care and energy which are included in the bill. 
   "These programs are vital to jobs, growth, and public programs in our congressional district. This is how Southern Missourians get a return on our investment of federal taxes - transportation, infrastructure, higher education, community betterment, and help in our fight against drugs," Emerson said.
   "This funding is an investment in the future of American families," said Senator Bond, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. "From caring for our veterans, to making our homes lead-safe and helping our law enforcement in the war against meth these dollars will provide the resources needed to make our communities safer and stronger."
   "Access to health care and reliable energy infrastructure is absolutely critical to our state's rural communities, particularly in economically distressed neighborhoods," said Sen. Talent. "This initiative will provide these areas with access to quality health care by taking the care to them. I am strongly committed to improving the quality of health care in Southeast Missouri. I am also pleased the package includes funding for the University of Missouri-Rolla. The University is already a leader in science and engineering and this funding will help them modernize our electricity grid to prevent blackouts like the one experienced on August 14, 2003. I will continue working with Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson to make certain the University always remains on the cutting edge of new technologies."
   The conference report on the omnibus appropriations bill passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 344-51, contains federal spending measures for much of the federal government, including Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Transportation, and Energy and Water.
