SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR TRUMAN STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Truman State University Enhanced Speech and Hearing Clinic in the Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2006, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Speech and Hearing Clinic at Truman State not only serves as an instructional lab for students, but a clinic serving clients from all over the Northeast Missouri region," said Sen. Talent. "With this funding, the University will be able to construct the facility it needs to help speech pathologists better serve their patients." 
   Sen. Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for the Truman State University Enhanced Speech and Hearing Clinic. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then reconciled with the House bill.
