SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $32,400 FIRE GRANT FOR JENNINGS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $32,400 grant for the City of Jennings Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase new protective clothing and firefighting equipment. 
   "I am very pleased to announce that the City of Jennings Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters put their life on the line to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This grant is a major shot in the arm for our fire department," said Fire Chief Joe Zlotopolski of Jennings. "We are getting new protective clothing for the firefighters to replace the worn-out gear and also a new hydraulic rescue tool that will do more than the standard 'jaws of life' equipment." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
