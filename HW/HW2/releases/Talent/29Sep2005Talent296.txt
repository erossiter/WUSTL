SEN. TALENT LAUNCHES FIRST PODCAST WITH SPEECH IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE ROBERTS FOR CHIEF JUSTICE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today launched his first Internet podcast featuring a speech he delivered on the Senate floor in support of Judge John Roberts for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Anyone can listen to the speech or subscribe to Sen. Talent's podcast by visiting his Website at http://talent.senate.gov/podcast/podcast.cfm.
   "Podcasting is an innovative way for me to communicate with Missourians," said Sen. Talent. "With this technology, Missourians who want to can download legislative updates and speeches into their MP3 player and listen anytime, anywhere. Or they can listen to the audio reports on their computer through my Website at talent.senate.gov. We want to provide Missourians with as many options as possible to get information from their Senate office whether it's a personal meeting, a phone call, through the Internet or on their iPod."
   A "podcast" is the combination of the words iPod and broadcast, which is simply an audio file, typically an MP3 file. The files can be downloaded and saved to a computer or portable media player, such as an iPod. Missourians can subscribe to Sen. Talent's Podcast on his Website, which will allow you to automatically download new podcasts to your computer. All of Sen. Talent's podcasts and audio files can be accessed without a portable MP3 player. All one needs is a personal computer and an Internet connection.
   Sen. Talent is one of first senators to use the podcast technology. He was also one of the first senators to post a blog on his Website. Last year, Sen. Talent traveled to Iraq and Israel and posted his impressions on a blog available on his Website at http://talent.senate.gov.
