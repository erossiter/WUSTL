SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES GRAND OPENING OF NEW ST. PATRICK CENTER EXPANSION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today joined volunteers and agency officials for a ribbon cutting ceremony to mark the opening of The Partnership Center in downtown St. Louis. The new facility, a 15,000 square foot extension of the St. Patrick Center, will serve as an innovative one-stop center offering services to homeless and near homeless individuals. Sen. Talent secured $250,000 to help complete the building project in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act.  
   "St. Patrick Center is a perfect example of good stewardship in our urban communities," said Sen. Talent. "They help provide opportunities for self-sufficiency and dignity for the homeless with an emphasis on those who experience mental illness or chemical dependence and those living at the poverty level. Today, we can officially open the doors to this center to help provide health care and other services for those in need." 
   The St. Patrick Center opened in 1983 and has assisted thousands of homeless people. The Center serves 10,000 individuals and families annually and is Missouri's largest provider of homeless services including education, employment, and housing programs. 
   "The ongoing support from Senator Talent has allowed us to expand the assistance we have been able to give to those who are homeless or at risk of become homeless, especially in the areas of housing, health care, our Disaster Relief Team, and employment," said Jan Rasmussen, Chief Development Officer, St. Patrick Center. "Additionally, his continuing aid helps us to leverage additional funding needed in this ongoing battle; by virtue of the Senator's backing, he lends credence to the continuing need for programs at St. Patrick Center." 
   This new addition builds on St. Patrick Center's past successes of operating 19 programs, partnering with 10 tenant agencies and 35 active collaborations throughout the community serving 23,000 unduplicated clients.
