SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $124,650 FOR NEW FIRE TRUCK FOR BUCKLIN
  Sen. Jim Talent today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $124,650 grant to the Bucklin Rural Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a new fire truck.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Bucklin Rural Volunteer Fire Department will be receiving this funding," Sen. Talent said. "I believe it is important that we provide Missouri's first responders with the resources they need to meet local priorities. This additional fire truck will result in better protection for the citizens of Linn County in the event of a fire. I applaud the Administration for providing these grants to local fire departments across Missouri." 
   "This grant means a lot for our department," said Fire Chief Glenn Watson. "Our firefighters protect nearly 800 people and our newest truck was a 1974. There are also two railroads that go through town. This new truck will help us better respond to accidents that might occur."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
