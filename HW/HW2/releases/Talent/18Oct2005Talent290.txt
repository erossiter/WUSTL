SEN. TALENT'S EFFORTS STOP PLAN TO CLOSE FARM SERVICE AGENCY OFFICES IN MISSOURI PRINTER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has succeeded in stopping a USDA plan that would have shuttered thirty-one Farm Service Agency offices in Missouri. Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who earlier passed legislation to delay the office closure plan, had been meeting with top officials at USDA asking them to reconsider their FSA Tomorrow plan which aimed at closing more than 713 farm offices around the country. The USDA announced today it is scrapping the FSA Tomorrow plan. 
   "This is tremendous news for our producers who rely on their local Farm Service Agency offices to provide a wide range of agricultural services," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent. "I was especially concerned because the office closure plan was issued with little or no consultation with our local offices and producers. We all want our FSA offices to operate as efficiently as possible, but the key with the way we handle these offices must be service and accessibility to the agriculture community and to our producers."
   On September 21st, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved an amendment sponsored by Senators Talent and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) to prevent the USDA from implementing the office closure plan. The amendment passed as part of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill. However, there was concern that USDA may move ahead with the FSA Tomorrow plan as the appropriations bill awaited final approval by the Congress.
   USDA's announcement comes just days before the Senate Agriculture Committee was to hold a hearing on the FSA Tomorrow plan. Sen. Talent had requested the hearing and 
   Chairman Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) had agreed to hold it this Thursday. That hearing is no longer necessary.
   Sen. Talent said he would work with USDA officials on proposals to help improve efficiencies at local FSA offices that wouldn't sacrifice service and accessibility for our producers.
