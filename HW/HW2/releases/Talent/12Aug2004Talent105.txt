SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR MADISON COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved an $8,360 Community Facility Grant to the City of Marquand.  
 These funds will be used to purchase new street lights for the downtown area.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the City of Marquand will be receiving this grant," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "Illuminating the downtown area will help improve safety for residents and attract visitors to the downtown area. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for assessing the need for projects like this to benefit communities in the Lower Mississippi Delta Region."
   The City qualifies for a 55 percent grant, with the remaining 45 percent to be paid from the Missouri Department of Transportation.
