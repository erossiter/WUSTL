SENS. BOND, TALENT, REP. EMERSON REQUEST DISASTER DECLARATION FOR MISSOURI
  Sens. Kit Bond and Jim Talent and Rep. Jo Ann Emerson today sent a letter to the President requesting quick approval of the Governor's request for a disaster declaration for the Missouri communities hit hard by severe storms and tornados.  
   On September 22, severe storms and tornados swept through the state. Missouri continues to be hit with severe weather, including high winds, hail, 12 tornados and flooding. Yesterday, Governor Matt Blunt requested a disaster declaration for the entire state. Blunt requested approval for Individual Assistance for 12 of the hardest-hit counties and Hazard Mitigation Assistance for all of Missouri.
   In the letter, Bond, Talent and Emerson said, "These significant and devastating events resulted in more than 500 homes and business being damaged. Also we ask that you keep in mind that Missouri has had three federal disaster declarations declared within the last seven months. The damages and associated response and recovery costs for these disasters have significantly impacted the ability of the state and local governments to recover effectively from this current disaster."
   Bond, Talent and Emerson stressed that quick approval of the Governor's request will help Missouri begin to recover from this disaster.
