SEN. TALENT CALLS PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL VICTORY FOR MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today praised the Senate's overwhelming passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which includes four renewable fuels provisions he sponsored. The Energy bill, which passed 74-26, would provide a blueprint for the supply, delivery and efficient use of energy resources of all kinds including renewable resources such as ethanol and biodiesel. 
   "Passage of the Energy bill is a real victory for Missouri," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent, a member of the Senate Energy Committee who helped craft the bill. "The legislation will help lower energy prices for consumers by diversifying our energy supply and promoting energy of all kinds. There are also significant conservation and efficiency measures in the bill. I'm especially pleased the final package includes a robust Renewable Fuels Standard which will help lower gas prices over the long term. Renewable fuels are at the heart of economic growth and jobs for the future; at the heart of energy independence from foreign energy producers; at the heart of environmental quality; and at the heart of value-added agriculture for our family farmers and producers."
   The Energy bill also includes the following renewable fuels initiatives sponsored by Sen. Talent:
   * 7.5 Billion Gallon Renewable Fuels Standard
   Sen. Talent was an architect of the Renewable Fuels Standard included in the Energy bill. Working with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), Sen. Talent helped negotiate the Renewable Fuels Standard which would add 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol, biodiesel and other renewables to the nation's fuel supply by 2012. Sen. Talent championed the Renewable Fuels Standard in the Energy Committee, during the floor debate and while the bill was before the Senate and House Conference Committee.
   * Talent-Obama E-85 Tax Credit
   Senators Talent and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) added to the Energy bill their bipartisan legislation to increase the availability of fuels blended with 85 percent ethanol. Talent and Obama's legislation provides a tax credit incentive of 30 percent through 2010 for switching one or more traditional petroleum pumps to E-85 fueling systems. E-85 is a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent petroleum gasoline.
   * Talent-Lincoln Biodiesel Tax Credit Extension
   Senators Talent and Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) successfully added a measure extending through 2010 the $1.00 per gallon biodiesel tax credit designed to make soybean-based biodiesel fuels cost competitive with conventional diesel fuel. Sen. Talent also worked on this initiative with Congressman Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) who was the chief sponsor of the companion legislation in the U.S. House. 
   * Talent-Lincoln Small Producer Tax Credit
   Senators Talent and Lincoln also attached to the bill a provision expanding the ten-cent-per-gallon small ethanol producer tax credit to those who produce up to 60 million gallons annually and establishes the tax credit for small biodiesel producers that make up to 60 million gallons of biodiesel per year.
   The U.S. House has also passed the Energy bill. Now the legislation will be sent to the President and he is expected to sign the bill into law soon.
