SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $44,000 USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT IN UNIONVILLE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today helped present a $44,000 Community Facility Grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, to the Putman County Memorial Hospital in Unionville to purchase emergency and operating room equipment.  
 The mock check was presented to Nettie Lewis, President of the Hospital Board of Directors and Ray Magers, Chief Executive Officer. 
   "Having access to quality health care is so critical to our rural communities," said Sen. Talent. "It is our job to make sure residents of Unionville and surrounding areas have access to quality emergency medical treatment services for critical care situations and these funds will go to improving those services. It is important that our rural health care facilities receive the funding they need to offer quality health care locally without forcing patients to travel to larger cities to receive treatment. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for making this crucial health care investment in Putnam County."  
   The grant will be used to purchase a microscope for the emergency room, an instrument sterilizer for the both the emergency and operating rooms, gurneys to transport patients around the hospital and new interior equipment for the emergency room including essential lights. The new high-illumination lights will replace a 40-year old light system that was installed when the hospital was built in the 1960s.
