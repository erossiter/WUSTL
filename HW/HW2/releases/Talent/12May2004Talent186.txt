SEN. TALENT PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF TAX INCENTIVES FOR RENEWABLE FUELS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, praised passage of the JOBS Act (FSC/ETI) which includes important tax provisions for renewable fuels. 
   Sen. Talent's statement follows:
   "The Senate once again demonstrated its commitment to renewable fuels by enhancing the ethanol incentive. The bill we passed includes the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) which extends the ethanol tax incentives by 10 years and provides $2 billion more for our roads and bridges in the highway trust fund.
   "The current structure of the ethanol tax incentive has had an unintended consequence - it reduces federal funds available to states for highway construction. Sound energy, economic and environmental policy need not be mutually exclusive of America's investment in transportation infrastructure.
   "VEETC also provides a new tax incentive for biodiesel that will stimulate tremendous new production of biodiesel which is great news for our soybean producers. The biodiesel provisions mirror VEETC by providing flexibility for gasoline marketers to claim the credit for both on-road and off-road diesel uses, and similarly protects the Highway Trust Fund. 
   "Today our country is importing more gasoline than every before. Ethanol will add more than 3.5 billion gallons of much-needed supply to the fuel marketplace this year, helping to drive down prices. With VEETC enacted, ethanol will continue to expand U.S. fuel supplies into the future. 
   "Our commitment to renewable fuels is clear. It is time for this Congress to send these important tax changes to the President."
