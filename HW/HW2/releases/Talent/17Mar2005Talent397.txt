SENATE PASSES SENS. LINCOLN, TALENT AMENDMENT TO INCREASE FUNDING TO FIGHT METHAMPHETAMINES
  The Senate tonight approved an amendment offered by Sens.  
 Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) and Jim Talent (R-Mo.) to provide $160 million to combat methamphetamines. The amendment restores funding for the COPS Methamphetamine Enforcement and Clean-Up Program to the current level over the next five years. The bipartisan amendment, which was also co-sponsored by Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), was approved as part of the Senate Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 18).
   "I have the dubious distinction of representing a state that leads the country in the production of methamphetamine," said Sen. Talent. "Law enforcement agents, some with as many as 30 years experience, have told me methamphetamine is the worst threat they have confronted in their careers. It is by far the worst drug I have seen in all my years in public life. Our amendment provides the resources necessary to ensure that meth labs are thoroughly decontaminated, protecting victims and children from the toxic chemicals used to produce this dangerous drug."
   The Senate Budget Resolution would have reduced by 62 percent, the COPS Methamphetamine Enforcement and Clean-Up Program. The Lincoln-Talent amendment restores that funding. The Senators said the program has been instrumental in helping state and local law enforcement combat meth production and distribution, targeting "hot spots," and removing and disposing of hazardous materials at clandestine meth labs.
   Sen. Talent is also working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on legislation to curb methamphetamine production by moving pseudoephedrine, the primary ingredient to make meth, behind the pharmacy counter. Their legislation, the Combat Meth Act (S.103), would also provide an additional $15 million under the COPS program to expand the "hot spots" program and provide other tools to help local law enforcement fight methamphetamines.
