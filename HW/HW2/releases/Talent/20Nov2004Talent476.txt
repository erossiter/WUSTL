 The Senate today approved Sen. Jim Talent's (R-Mo.) request to send $975,000 to the Kirksville Regional Airport for the purchase of a new Instrument Landing System that will allow pilots to safely navigate their aircraft in low visibility conditions. Sen.  
 Talent's request passed as part of the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate.      
   "This funding for the Kirksville Regional Airport will improve safety, increase access to the region and generate economic growth," said Sen. Talent. "We must continue to improve our transportation infrastructure to help generate economic growth, create jobs and save lives. Senator Bond and I have made this funding a priority on behalf of Kirksville and we will do even more to improve Missouri's transportation infrastructure."
