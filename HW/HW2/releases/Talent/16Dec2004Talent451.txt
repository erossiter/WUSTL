SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION FOR ROUTE 152 COMPLETION IPLATTE COUNTY
 Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced the $2 million appropriation he secured in the fiscal 2005 spending package to help complete Route 152 in Platte County at the Platte County Resource Center.  
 These funds will be used to upgrade a portion of the National Highway System and will complete the lane freeway between I-435 and I-29 providing better connection to Kansas City International airport.
   "The Route 152 expansion project in Platte County has been a top priority for the community and it's a top priority for me," said Sen. Talent. "This expansion will improve and the quality of life for Missourians traveling in the Kansas City area. It is also an investment in our state's transportation infrastructure which will generate jobs and economic growth." 
   "This project will complete a four lane divided facility between I-435 in Platte County and I-35 in Clay County," said Sharon M. Taegel, Assistant to the District Engineer for the Missouri Department of Transportation. "In addition, this completes an important East-West Corridor across the Northland and provides easy access to the airport, which has long been desired."
   Construction on this project began in 1999 and this funding will help complete the expansion. The construction involves creating two westbound lanes on Route 152 and one bridge over Hampton Road.
