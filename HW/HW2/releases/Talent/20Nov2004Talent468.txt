SENATE APPROVES SEN. TALENT'S QUARTER-MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY CENTER IN JOPLIN
  Se. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) was successful in securing $250,000 for the Joseph Newman Business and Technology Innovation Center in Joplin.  
 Talent's quarter-million dollar request passed as part of the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate.
   "The Joseph Newman Business and Technology Innovation Center will attract businesses to the Joplin area," said Sen. Talent. "With access to new technology resources, small businesses can better compete with larger businesses. Moreover, this investment will result in the creation of high skilled, high paying jobs in Southwest Missouri."
   "We appreciate Senator Talent's long-term commitment to supporting small business growth in Missouri," said Rob O'Brian, President Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce. "This funding will create additional opportunities for the start-up and attraction of small firms with innovative products and services to Southwest Missouri."
   Joseph Newman Business and Technology Innovation Center will provide tenants with facilities not currently available in the Joplin market. These facilities will include wet lab space, small offices with high speed internet service and jointly shared conference areas. A professional staff and volunteer business people will provide support and guidance to help insure the success of the tenant firms.
