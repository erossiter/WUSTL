SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $10,220 FIRE GRANT FOR WHEATON
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $10,220 grant for the Wheaton Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase extractor equipment used to clean and protect firefighter turnout gear.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Wheaton Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters put their life on the line to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the federal government providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This grant program is the best thing that has ever happened to rural fire departments," said Fire Chief Bob Lombard of Wheaton. "This new equipment will help us preserve our turnout gear. I appreciate this funding on behalf of the entire fire department."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
