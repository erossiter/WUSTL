SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR CRAWFORD COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $73,350 Community Facility Grant to the Crawford County Foundation, Inc.  
 The funds will be used to purchase playground equipment and fencing for a child care facility.
   "These grant dollars will go a long way to assist parents with their child care needs," said Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "Providing resources for child development activities is a priority and I appreciate the Administration for their efforts in assisting rural communities across the state."
   Community Facility Grants may be made to public bodies and nonprofit organizations to assist in the development of essential community facilities for public use in small, poor and needy communities and may be made for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the project. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and health care facilities.
