SEN. TALENT CHOSEN FOR TOP HONOR BY MISSOURI CORN GROWERS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today was selected to receive the Missouri Corn Association (MCGA) top honor, the Friend of Corn Growers Award, during their annual meeting.  
 The award is given to Missouri's strongest advocates for corn production and market expansion. 
   "This is a tremendous honor," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection and Product Promotion. "It's been a privilege to work with the Missouri Corn Growers Association. I'm looking forward to our continuing partnership as we work to establish a strong Renewable Fuels Standard, open up new markets for our producers and support value-added agriculture."
   "Senator Talent has really stepped up as a leader in agriculture in the U.S. Senate on behalf of Missouri," said B.J. Bailey, President of the Missouri Corn Growers Association. "We wanted to recognize him for his many years of working on behalf of corn growers by expanding ethanol production, value added opportunities, biotech research, trade and transportation. We look forward to many more years of working with Senator Talent on behalf of Missouri and the nation's food, fiber and fuel policy." 
   The Missouri Corn Growers Association started in 1978 as a means for farmers to organize to increase profitability of corn production. MCGA also works on increasing the market for ethanol, a clean-burning fuel produced from corn. Missouri is ranked tenth in the nation in corn production, producing 300 million bushels of corn annually. With the start-up of Mid-Missouri Energy yesterday, Missouri's farmer-owned ethanol industry now have the capacity to produce nearly 120 million gallons of ethanol annually from Missouri corn, adding value to approximately 13 percent of Missouri's annual average corn production.
