SENS. TALENT-BOND ASK PRESIDENT TO APPROVE DISASTER DECLARATION FOR MISSOURI COUNTIES
  Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond today asked the President to approve Gov. Matt Blunt's request for a federal disaster declaration for affected Missouri counties after severe storms swept through the state. 
   "We are working together with state and local officials, law enforcement and the Red Cross to provide assistance for Missourians who were impacted by the tornadoes and storms," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent (R-Mo.). "Many Missourians were hit hard by these violent storms and we are urging the President to approve Missouri's disaster declaration quickly so we can provide additional resources to our people as soon as possible."
   "The President's approval of Missouri's disaster declaration is critical. This approval will provide individuals and communities the resources they need to start rebuilding their lives," said U.S. Senator Kit Bond. 
   On March 11th and 12th, severe storms and tornados hit the state. As a result communities across Missouri experienced hail, high winds and flooding. These storms resulted in a tragic loss of life and extensive property damage in many Missouri communities. 
   In a letter to the President, Talent and Bond pointed out that the storm damage could result in millions of dollars in needed disaster assistance. The Senators asked the President to grant the request promptly in order for state and local governments to begin recovering from this disaster.
