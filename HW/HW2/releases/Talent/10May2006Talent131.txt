SENATE APPROVES MEASURE TO HONOR SURVIVORS OF FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Senate unanimously approved a measure he cosponsored to designate May 14, 2006, as "National Police Survivors Day." Sen. Talent cosponsored the legislation to honor survivors of fallen law enforcement officers.  
   "Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line for us each and every day," said Sen. Talent. "These heroes could not serve our communities without the encouragement and support of their families and loved ones. I think it is important that every Missourian take a moment this weekend to pay respect to the survivors of the fallen heroes of law enforcement." 
   "Coming from the home headquarters of COPS in Camdenton to the Capital to honor fallen police officers is a sad trip we take every year," said Suzie Sawyer, Executive Director of Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. "This year, the State of Missouri lost eight officers and the Missouri Highway Patrol lost four. We are especially appreciative of the Congress honoring those whose loved ones were killed in the line of duty."
   Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc., (COPS) supports the designation. COPS, based in Camdenton, Missouri, serves over 15,000 surviving families of fallen law enforcement officers. They have 48 chapters throughout the U.S. that provide programs of peer support and counseling to law enforcement survivors. 
   This weekend, survivors of fallen law enforcement officers will gather in Alexandria, Virginia, for the annual National Police Survivors Seminar, and at Police Week Memorial Services throughout the Nation. On average one law enforcement officer is killed in America every 53 hours and between 140 and 160 law enforcement officers lose their lives in the line of duty each year.
