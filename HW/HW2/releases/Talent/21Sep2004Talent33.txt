SEN. TALENT'S $500,000 REQUEST FOR WATER QUALITY APPROVED BY COMMITTEE
  Sen. Jim Talent's (R-Mo.) request for a half-million dollars for the Ozarks Environmental and Water Resources Institute at Southwest Missouri State University was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Sen.  
 Talent requested the funds to allow the Institute to begin expanded work in the lab and the field and to purchase key water monitoring equipment.
   "Water quality in the Southwest region is the No. 1 environmental issue facing Missouri," said Sen. Talent. "I've been working with local water quality organizations to find long term solutions and SMSU's proposal is key to protecting our water resources. We are committed to providing additional resources to protect the water in the Ozarks region and I will continue to work in the Senate to make certain the funding remains in the bill." 
   SMSU will match the federal funding with approximately $1 million in in-kind facilities, equipment, faculty research time and administrative staff time.
   As part of the College of Natural and Applied Sciences, the Institute will use this funding to achieve its goals of conducting applied and basic research focusing on the relationship between land use patterns and water quality and quantity. Additionally, the Institute will provide education and training services to local stakeholders and policymakers.
   During the past several decades, the Ozarks has experienced rapid growth and economic expansion and as a result of that growth, the water quality of the region has diminished and, in certain locales, the water supply threatened.
   In addition to this funding request, last month Sens. Talent and Kit Bondannounced a $10 million federal water quality project for the region in collaboration with regional water quality stakeholders.
