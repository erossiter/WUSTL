SEN. TALENT, REP. GRAVES ANNOUNCE USDA GRANT FOR GREEN CASTLE
  Sen. Jim Talent and Rep. Sam Graves announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded a $19,800 Rural Business Enterprise Grant to the City of Green Castle.  
 The funds will be used to conduct a feasibility study for an equestrian center and multi-purpose complex in Green Castle.
   "I am very pleased to announce this grant for Green Castle," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "It is important to provide rural communities with the resources they need to help create jobs and bolster Missouri's economy. This is an example of how the federal government is partnering with the local community to meet the needs of area residents." 
   "These dollars are important to Green Castle and Missouri," said Graves. "Not only are they vital to creating the conditions for economic growth, but they also help better Missouri communities. I am grateful for the work of the USDA staff and I look forward to continuing our work on behalf of Missourians." 
   The USDA Rural Development program has invested over $50 billion since the beginning of the Bush Administration to provide equity and technical assistance to finance and foster growth in homeownership, business development, and critical community and technology infrastructure. As a result, over 800,000 jobs have been created or saved through these investments.
