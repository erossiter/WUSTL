NEED ASSISTANCE WITH A FEDERAL AGENCY? I CAN HELP
  Sometimes dealing with the bureaucracy at a government agency can be too much for one person to handle alone. While many people are aware of my office's work on behalf of Missouri on legislative matters, some may not know that I can also assist them with problems they are having with a federal agency such as the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs.  
   Dozens of Missourians contact me each week requesting assistance with casework. In fact, last year my office fielded nearly 2,500 individual constituent casework requests. Those requests range from helping veterans receive medals of honor, aiding families with international adoptions, assisting seniors with Social Security and helping individuals and small business people deal with the IRS. My offices can act as a liaison between Missourians and the federal government. 
   If you have any questions about casework, you can always send me an email t Caseworker@talent.senate.gov, or contact one of my offices: Washington, D.C. (202) 224-6154; Jefferson City (573) 636-1070; St. Louis (314) 432-5211; Springfield (417) 831-2735; Kansas City (816) 421-1639 and Cape Girardeau (573) 651-0964. 
   Helping constituents who are encountering difficulties with federal agencies is one of the most important responsibilities I have as your Senator. If you or someone you know in Missouri is having a problem with a federal agency here's what you need to d 
   In nearly all cases, it will be necessary for me to have a written and signed request for help which will enable a federal agency to relinquish information to me from your file. This request is mandated by the Privacy Act of 1974 and must be written and signed by the individual requesting the senator's help. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to protect individual rights of citizens by prohibiting the release of personal information about them to unauthorized parties. 
   The written request should be addressed to me and should state that you give permission for me to look into your concern. Your request can be made in the form of a letter or by completing a casework authorization form. The letter should contain your full name; mailing address; telephone number(s); Social Security number, file number or case number; signature of the person involved; and finally, all pertinent details of the case as well as copies of any pertinent documentation. It should be specific as to the exact nature of your request and the desired outcome. The casework authorization form is available on my website at http://talent.senate.gov in the constituent services area, or you may call one of Missouri offices for an authorization form to complete.
   It is important to know that neither I, nor my staff, can approve a claim or appeal, or compel any agency to act in your favor. Those types of decisions by law are made by the federal agency involved based on the facts of the case. However, I am glad to obtain answers to your questions, to make the appropriate officials aware of your concerns and to cut through any red tape you might be experiencing.
   The following is a partial list of some of the federal agencies my office works with on a continuous basis:
   * Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
   * Medicare 
   * Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) 
   * Social Security Administration (SSA) 
   * Department of Veterans Affairs 
   * Military - Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, National Guard, Coast Guard, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) 
   * U.S. Department of State - Passports 
   * U.S. Department of Labor 
   * Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
   * Office of Workers Compensation (OWCP)
   In addition, my Missouri staff continues to travel the state on my behalf to make sure your voice is heard. They schedule meetings we call "Missouri Matters," which are typically scheduled on a rotation at a particular time and location. Constituents are given the opportunity to meet one-on-one with a member of my staff to discuss federal matters, or problems they are experiencing with a federal agency. 
   I am glad to help and always appreciate hearing from constituents. To find out when a member of my staff will be in your community for "Missouri Matters" or to schedule an appointment with a member of my staff, go to the "My County" section of my Website at http://talent.senate.gov.
