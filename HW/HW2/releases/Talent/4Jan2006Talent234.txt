SEN. TALENT ENCOURAGED BY AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION'S RATING OF JUDGE ALITO
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today commented on the non-partisan American Bar Association's (ABA) rating of Judge Samuel Alito.  
 Judge Alito received the ABA's highest rating - "well qualified" - to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Sen. Talent, who met personally with Judge Alito on November 17, issued the following statement:
   "This is another distinction in Judge Alito's career of service. He's a highly qualified nominee and I'm not surprised the American Bar Association holds him in such high regard.
   "If you look at what the ABA focuses on when examining a nominee's record - integrity, competence and judicial temperament - the fact that he received the highest rating in each of these categories is very encouraging.
   "Judge Alito's record must still be thoroughly vetted by the Senate during the confirmation process. I am hopeful that next week's hearings will focus on Judge Alito's professional qualifications and that the Senate will avoid personal attacks during the process."
