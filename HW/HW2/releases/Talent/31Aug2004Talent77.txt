SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $665,000 GRANT FOR METRO TRANSIT SYSTEM IN ST. LOUIS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a $665,000 grant to the Metro transit system in St. Louis.  
 The grants will be used to fund operating expenses associated with adding seven bus routes throughout the St. Louis area.
   "I am pleased to announce this funding for the City and the St. Louis region," said Sen. Talent. "Transportation infrastructure funding is vital across Missouri whether it's roads, bridges or mass transit. These dollars will help relieve pressure on our highway system which improves safety, increases productivity and gets products to market faster."
   The Metro transit system in St. Louis was allocated a portion of the State of Missouri's 2004 Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) funds to help defray operating expenses associated with adding and expanding seven bus routes through the St. Louis, Missouri, and Illinois service area. The purpose of this grant program is to develop transportation services for individuals to and from jobs for residents of urban and rural areas to suburban employment opportunities. Missouri was awarded a total of $3,965,039 through the JARC program for FY 2004.
