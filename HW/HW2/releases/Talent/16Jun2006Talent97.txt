SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES CONTINUED JOB GROWTH IN MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that Missouri's economy continues to be among the fastest-growing in the country. The U.S. Department of Labor released data that 7,600 jobs were created in Missouri in May. From May 2005 to May 2006, Missouri added a total of 28,400 jobs.  
   "This is good news for our workers and our state's economy," said Sen. Talent. "I am pleased that workers in Missouri are continuing to secure employment opportunities in the workforce. The Senate should do its part to continue working to pass pro-growth, pro-jobs policies that will strengthen our economy, create more jobs, build transportation infrastructure and lower health care costs for small business people and their workers. To continue economic growth, one of our top priorities should be making the tax cuts permanent and eliminating the death tax to ease the burden on Missouri's working families and farmers." 
   Missouri was also among the top six states with the largest jobless rate declines from May 2005, along with Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Connecticut and South Dakota. 
   Since last month, the unemployment rate in Missouri has dropped from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent, which is lower than the national average of 4.6 percent. Over the past year, the national unemployment rate has fallen in 41 states and 33 states have reported an employment increase.
