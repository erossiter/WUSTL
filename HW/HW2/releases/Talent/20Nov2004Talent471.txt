SEN. TALENT'S HALF-MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR WATER QUALITY INSTITUTE APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has delivered a half-million dollars for the Ozarks Environmental and Water Resources Institute at Southwest Missouri State University.  
 The money was included in the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate. Sen. Talent requested the funds to allow the Institute to begin expanded work in the lab and the field and to purchase key water monitoring equipment.
   "Water quality in the Southwest region is the No. 1 environmental issue facing Missouri," said Sen. Talent. "I've been working with local water quality organizations to find long term solutions and SMSU's proposal is key to protecting our water resources. We are absolutely committed to providing additional funding to protect our water resources."
   As part of the College of Natural and Applied Sciences, the Institute will use this funding to achieve its goals of conducting applied and basic research focusing on the relationship between land use patterns and water quality and quantity. Additionally, the Institute will provide education and training services to local stakeholders and policymakers. SMSU will match the federal funding with approximately $1 million in in-kind facilities, equipment, faculty research time and labor.
   During the past several decades, the Ozarks has experienced rapid growth and economic expansion and as a result of that growth, the water quality of the region has diminished and, in certain locales, the water supply threatened.
   In addition to this funding request, Sens. Talent and Kit Bond recently announced a $10 million federal water quality project for the region in collaboration with regional water quality stakeholders.
