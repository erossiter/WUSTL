SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON PORT PROPOSAL PLAN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) was one of only three Republicans voting today to allow consideration of legislation to stop a Bush Administration plan to turn over control of six major American ports to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Sen. Talent said he and other opponents of the plan should have the opportunity to vote for legislation that would block the proposal.  
   Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement:
   "I've said this strikes me as a very dangerous move and I felt we needed to make certain the Senate had an opportunity to vote on this issue. I remain unconvinced that the appropriate security agencies had enough input in the process and if you can't trust the process, you can't trust the outcome. 
   "The Administration needs to start from scratch. And I am hopeful that the Congress can work with the President to fix the process and reach an acceptable solution. For my part, I will continue to work with senators on both sides of the aisle in the interest of the nation's security."
   The Senate this afternoon voted to continue debate on the lobbying reform bill by a vote of 51-47. Sixty-six votes were necessary to cut off debate which would have prevented votes on legislation to stop the ports plan.
