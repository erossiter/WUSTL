SEN. TALENT SIGNS PROCLAMATION DECLARING JULY SMART IRRIGATION MONTH
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today signed a proclamation designating July "Smart Irrigation Month" at the Allen Below farm in Dexter. Sen. Jim Talent was joined by Merlyn Carlson U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Deputy Undersecretary for Natural Resources and Environment for the event. Smart Irrigation Month is a way for industry leaders and producers to partner in raising awareness of advances in irrigation efficiency.  
   "Irrigation is a vital part of many farming operations," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "New technologies that conserve energy and reduce water usage are good for production agriculture, and our environment. This designation will help raise awareness of how farmers can improve irrigation techniques and in turn save money through reduced energy costs." 
   "Alan Below exemplifies the best of Missouri's conservationists by implementing modern technology practices to save money, improve water quality and contribute to a healthy watershed," said Merlyn Carlson. "Through the dedication of our national leaders such as Senator Talent, farmers can get the assistance they need to be the best stewards of our nation's land." 
   The USDA, in conjunction with the Irrigation Association, has been seeking signatures for the proclamation to declare July "Smart Irrigation Month." Efforts are being made to raise awareness of new ways and benefits of conserving water and energy while irrigating.
