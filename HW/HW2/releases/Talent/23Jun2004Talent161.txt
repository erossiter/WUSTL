SEN. TALENT PRAISES COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF BILL TO IMPROVE MISSOURI LOCKS, DAMS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today praised passage of a bipartisan bill to modernize the Mississippi and Illinois River lock and dam system.  
 The measure was included as part of the Water Resources Development Act which was approved today by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with the leadership of Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.).
   "The modernization of our water infrastructure is critical to our economy," said U.S. Sen. Jim Talent, a cosponsor of the measure. "This legislation will allow us to maintain our ability to efficiently move products and commodities on the Mississippi River while protecting the environment. We need to update our locks and dams on behalf of Missourians who depend on the river for their livelihoods. I look forward to supporting the measure when it comes to the floor for a vote."
   The locks and dams provision adopts the initial recommendations of the Corps of Engineers to increase the lock capacity on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and begin an ambitious program of ecosystem restoration. It authorizes $2.3 billion for seven new locks and $1.46 billion for ecosystem restoration.
   The Water Resources Development Act which includes the locks and dams provision must now be debated and voted on by the full Senate.
