SEN. TALENT DELIVERS KEYNOTE AT MISSOURI BIOTECH INDUSTRY FORUM IN ST. LOUIS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today delivered a keynote address at the Missouri Biotechnology Association and the Biotechnology Industry Organization forum "Sharpening Missouri's Competitive Biotech Edge" at Saint Louis University. Sen. Jim Talent discussed the importance of biotechnology and its growing impact on Missouri agriculture.  
   "America has the safest, most abundant and least expensive food supply in the world," said Sen. Talent, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection and Product Promotion. "The heart of food production in the United States and the world is the American family farmer and rancher. I'm sponsoring a plan in the Senate to expand the development of research programs to improve human health, increase agricultural production and provide our producers with a competitive edge in the global marketplace." 
   "Sen. Talent is a strong advocate on behalf of biotech plant research," said Dale R. Ludwig, Vice Chairman of the Missouri Biotechnology Association and Missouri Soybean Association Executive Director/CEO. "It is important to have people like Sen. Talent in Washington who are willing to work and advocate for plant biotechnology. It is an industry that continues to show promise of developing higher quality crops for uses ranging from better conversion into biofuels to foods that are richer in the nutrients people need." 
   Sen. Talent is supporting legislation to increase federal funding of plant biotechnology. In May Sen. Talent introduced legislation to establish a National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) at the USDA. NIFA would be a new structure for making competitively-awarded research grants and authorizing a dramatically greater investment in food and agriculture research in addition to, not as a substitute for, existing USDA research funding.
