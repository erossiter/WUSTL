SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $63,000 FIRE GRANT FOR PALMYRA
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $63,000 grant for Palmyra Fire and Rescue.  
 The funds will be used to purchase new clean air breathing equipment.
   "I am very pleased to announce that Palmyra Fire and Rescue will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters put their life on the line to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the federal government providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "I am so pleased to receive this grant on behalf of our fire department," said Lieutenant Paul Frankenbach of Palmyra. "The funds will allow us to replace our outdated SCBA equipment. The new gear will have more safety features and provide more protection for our firefighters." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
