SEN. TALENT: MISSOURI RIVER DECISION DANGEROUS, DEFIES COMMON SENSE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement on the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with their plan for two Spring rises on the Missouri River: 
   "The decision to potentially flood Missouri farms and property twice a year to increase the population of a fish is not only dangerous, it defies common sense. This experiment could devastate tens of thousands of acres of Missouri farmland and may not result in an increase of pallid sturgeon. Additionally, the summer low flows they've proposed will disrupt river navigation which will have a negative impact on jobs and the environment. I am very disappointed that the Corps is moving forward with this reckless plan."
