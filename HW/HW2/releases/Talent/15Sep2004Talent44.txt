SEN. TALENT SECURES $975,000 FOR KIRKSVILLE REGIONAL AIRPORT TO INSTALL INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM
 Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $975,000 for the Kirksville Regional Airport that was included in the FY 2005 Transportation Appropriations Bill.  
   "This funding for the Kirksville Regional Airport will increase access to the region, enhance safety and help continue the growth of the community," said Sen. Talent. "We must continue to improve our transportation infrastructure to help generate economic growth, create jobs and save lives. Senator Bond and I will continue to work together to make this funding a priority." 
   The Instrument Landing System (ILS) will allow aircraft to land in conditions of low visibility through enhanced guidance capabilities and increase the safety of all landings.
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee Tuesday, and before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
