SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN FOR DUNKLIN COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $295,170 Community Facility Direct Loan to the Malden Capital Improvement Corporation.  
 The funds will be used to build a new police station and jail in Malden. 
   "I am very pleased to announce that the citizens in Dunklin County will be receiving this project loan," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "The funds will help increase public safety in Malden. Our local law enforcement officers will soon have a better facility to do their job in protecting and serving the citizens of Malden. I appreciate USDA Rural Devolvement for recognizing the need for such a facility in Dunklin County." 
   "I would like to express my sincere thanks for all the assistance the Malden Capital Improvements Corporation received from USDA Rural Development," said Marilyn Fiddler,
   City Clerk for the City of Malden. "Rural America has serious economic problems. The work Rural Development does and what Rural Development has accomplished for the City of Malden will have real and lasting positive impact on our community."
   The new police station and jail, funding by the Community Facility Direct Loan Program, will replace the current facility which has been condemned. The funding will cover the increase cost of construction after bidding the project. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and healthcare facilities.
