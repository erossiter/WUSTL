SEN. TALENT'S $1.2 MILLION REQUEST TO PRESERVE WILSON'S CREEK APPROVED BY CONGRESS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $1.2 million to preserve the historic Wilson's Creek Battlefield in the fiscal 2006 Interior Appropriations spending package, which was approved today by the Senate. Sen.  
 Talent requested the funding to protect this historic battlefield which stands at-risk in one of the fastest growing areas in the country. 
   "This is a historically significant battlefield and we need to expand it due to the rapid growth in the Springfield area," said Sen. Talent. "These funds will protect the field on which this key battle was fought so that the full story of the first major Civil War battle west of the Mississippi can be preserved for generations to come." 
   Last year, Sen. Talent secured $4.5 million for Wilson's Creek Battlefield. Also last year, the President signed a bill sponsored by Sen. Talent to preserve the historic Wilson's Creek Civil War Battlefield. The bill added approximately 615 acres from six parcels of land that make up the remaining significant resources outside the park boundary that are directly related to the battle. The legislation also authorizes the acquisition of the Sweeney Museum property and collections, one of the most complete private civil war artifacts collections in existence.
   The current acreage of the Wilson's Creek battlefield park is approximately 1,750 acres, but only 75 percent of the actual combat areas associated with the battle are within the park's boundaries. Sen. Talent's 2004 law provides permanent protection from development for significant resources that are integral to the historic events that the park was established to commemorate.
   Sen. Talent's request passed both the House and Senate and must now be signed by the President before becoming law.
