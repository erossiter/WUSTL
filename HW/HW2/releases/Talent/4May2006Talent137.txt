SEN. TALENT PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF EMERGENCY DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR PRODUCERS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today praised Senate passage of the Emergency Disaster Assistance Act as part of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. Sen. Talent is a lead cosponsor of the disaster aid package, which will provide emergency assistance to our nation's farmers and ranchers. 
   "For years, Missouri's farmers and ranchers have had to cope with devastating drought conditions," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "A severe drought is a natural disaster that hurts our farmers, jobs and the health of our state's economy. For example, a reduction of one bushel per acre in soybean production reduces Missouri net farm income by about $25 million. A similar per-acre reduction in corn production results in a $5 million decrease. I'm pleased that the Senate supports our request for assistance."
   The legislation will provide emergency production loss and economic assistance to agricultural producers for losses incurred during the 2005 production year. The Senators pointed out that this legislation is comprehensive and national in scope, covering hurricanes, drought, flood, disease and other weather related disasters.
   Sen. Talent said this legislation is critical for drought-plagued states, like Missouri. Without sufficient rain in 2005, the crop and livestock situation in Missouri is serious. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has declared 112 of Missouri's 114 counties primary agriculture disaster areas. Also, according to FAPRI's most recent analysis, crop and hay production losses are expected to exceed $289 million. Beyond the $289 million crop and hay production losses, Missouri producers also incurred additional livestock losses and production hardship, such as feed shortages. 
   The legislation must now go to conference between the Senate and the House before being signed into law.
