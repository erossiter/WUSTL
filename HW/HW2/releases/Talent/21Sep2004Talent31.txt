SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY CENTER IN JOPLIN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today secured $250,000 for the Joseph Newman Business and Technology Innovation Center in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 2005, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Joseph Newman Business and Technology Innovation Center will attract businesses to the Joplin area," said Sen. Talent. "With access to new technology resources, small businesses can better compete with larger businesses. Moreover, this investment will result in the creation of high skilled, high paying jobs in Southwest Missouri."
   Joseph Newman Business and Technology Innovation Center will provide tenants with facilities not currently available in the Joplin market. These facilities will include wet lab pace, small offices with high speed internet service and jointly shared conference and break areas. A professional staff and volunteer business people will provide support and guidance to help insure the success of the tenant firms. 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Joplin. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then reconciled with the House bill.
