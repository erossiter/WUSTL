SEN. TALENT CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT MISSOURIANS' PHONE RECORDS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced his support for The Protecting Consumer Phone Records Act to prevent unauthorized and intrusive third-party access to consumers' phone records. Sen. Talent is cosponsoring the legislation with Sens. George Allen (R-Va.) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), to outlaw the acquisition, selling or soliciting of someone else's phone records without his or her consent. 
   "Unfortunately, there are some marketers who have no respect for people's privacy and no respect for the rules," said Sen. Talent. "Our legislation will protect consumers and punish criminals seeking to profit from phone record theft."
   In recent months, a number of websites have popped up selling consumer phone records for as little as $100. Experts say that the records are usually obtained fraudulently by individuals who pose as customers and request their records.
   Sen. Talent's legislation increases the penalties against bad actors and provides the Federal Communications, the Federal Trade Commissions and State Attorneys General with strengthened enforcement authority. To further boost enforcement, it would also allow phone companies to take action through lawsuits against data brokers or others who are illegally acquiring phone records to boost enforcement.
   Additionally, the legislation requires phone companies to annually certify that they are in compliance with confidentiality procedures. Phone companies would be hit with a $30,000 penalty for any violation when they do not sufficiently protect their subscribers' phone records.
