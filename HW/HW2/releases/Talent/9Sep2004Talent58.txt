SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $82,178 FIRE GRANT FOR ELSBERRY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $82,178 grant for the Elsberry Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used to purchase clean air breathing equipment, six sets of NFPA approved turn-out gear.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Elsberry Fire Protection District will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters volunteer their time to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "The district began buying new gear two years ago and this award will finally complete the process," said Captain J. Larry Carter of Elsberry. "It would take our district 7-8 years to purchase this equipment with our own budget. The district is still trying to "catch-up" from all the years as a rural department using fire tags and donations to operate on a $10,000 - $12,000 annual budget. I appreciate everyone involved in helping us get these funds."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
