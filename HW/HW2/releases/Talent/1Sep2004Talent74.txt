SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $217,575 FIRE GRANT FOR WASHINGTON
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $217,575 grant for the City of Washington Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used for Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment, air tanks and testing supplies.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Washington Volunteer Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters volunteer their time to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "I appreciate this grant assistance on behalf of firefighters nationwide," said Assistant Fire Chief Mark Skornia of Washington. "Our fire department is part of the St. Louis Area Homeland Response Team so not only will Washington benefit from this funding, but so will communities surrounding the St. Louis region."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
