SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN FOR WARREN COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $650,000 Community Facility Direct Loan to the Boonslick Regional Council of Governments.  
 The funds will be used to purchase an office building. 
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Boonslick Regional Council of Governments will be receiving this loan," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "Facilities such as this one are the foundation of business and economic growth in our communities as they provide important services for Missourians. I appreciate USDA Rural Devolvement for recognizing the need for this facility in Warrenton." 
   "The loan from USDA Rural Development will allow the Boonslick Regional Planning Commission to acquire a 6,000 square foot office facility that will enable our organization to continue to expand our services," said Steve W. Etcher, Executive Director of the Boonslick Regional Planning Commission. "The office will be used as a one-stop center for individuals seeking employment and training, and will serve as a regional small business, community and economic development center. We are delighted to be expanding our facility to better serve the needs of our customers and region."
   This building will allow BRPC to better serve the rural residents of Lincoln, Warren, and Montgomery counties by providing an array of professional services to the member governments within the region. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and healthcare facilities.
