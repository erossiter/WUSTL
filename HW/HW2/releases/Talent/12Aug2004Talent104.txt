  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $9,375 Community Facility Grant to the Village of Allendale.  
 The funds will be used to purchase an outdoor siren system.
   "I am very pleased to announce that Allendale will be receiving this grant," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "These new warning sirens will help protect the citizens of Allendale by alerting them in the event of threatening weather or other emergencies. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for their continued commitment to safety in Northwest Missouri."
   Community Facility Grants may be made to public bodies and nonprofit organizations to assist in the development of essential community facilities for public use in small, poor and needy communities and may be made for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the project.
