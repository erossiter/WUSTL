SEN. TALENT WINS $25 MILLION FOR BOEING-DESIGNED X-43C SCRAMJET
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today secured $25 million to continue research for the X-43 program which has the potential to propel an airplane from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco in about 20 minutes. Sen. Talent's funding request was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The X-43 program is one of our most exciting aerospace programs," said Sen. Talent. "These funds, along with last year's, will allow the program to progress. It is an essential component in going forward with American aerospace technology. It's also important for jobs and economic growth in Missouri." 
   X-43 will develop hypersonic propulsion, or scramjet technology, providing our military with both manned and unmanned flights capable of reaching anywhere in the world in two hours from the continental United States and could lead to a future-generation Space Shuttle that would take off for space like an airplane. 
   The potential offered through continued hypersonic propulsion development is profound, as borne out by last fall's dramatic and successful near Mach 10 flight. With continued support, hypersonic propulsion will be to jet engines what jets were to propeller-driven aircraft in the 1940s. 
   The X-43A flight over the Pacific Ocean last fall reached speeds of nearly 7,000 miles per hour, establishing a new speed record for airbreathing engines.
   In addition to this successful funding request, Sen. Talent worked with the Senate Majority Leader to place language in the FY 2005 defense bill directing Secretary Rumsfeld to work with NASA to fund the X-43 program to develop this technology.
   "We must make the X-43 program a national priority," said Sen. Talent.
   The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, which includes Sen. Talent's funding request, must now be approved by the full Senate.
