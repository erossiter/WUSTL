SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES BILL TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY FUNDING FOR MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today joined Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) at a news conference urging Congress to pass the Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act (S. 196). Sen.  
 Talent is an original cosponsor of the legislation. The bill would allow Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to acquire equipment, digital network and wireless technology, and infrastructure to provide educational services to students, faculty and staff. 
   "Our legislation will benefit schools across the country including Harris-Stowe State College in St. Louis and Lincoln University in Jefferson City," said Talent. "This is an issue of fairness. We need to improve those schools' ability to obtain the latest technology so their students are better prepared to succeed in the job market and to pursue the American dream." 
   The Digital and Wireless Network Technology Opportunity Act seeks to address the technology gap that exists at many HCBUs and MSIs. The legislation establishes a new grant program within the National Science Foundation that provides up to $250 million to help HCBUs and MSIs bridge the digital divide. Last Congress the legislation unanimously passed the Senate but stalled in the U.S. House.
