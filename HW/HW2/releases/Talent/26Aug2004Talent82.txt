SEN. TALENT JOINS NATIONAL PARK SERVICE IN ANNOUNCING FUNDING FOR OUTDOOR RECREATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo) today announced that the National Park Service division of the U.S. Department of the Interior has awarded $417,782 in matching grants to three cities in Missouri as part of the Land and Water Conservation Fund program.  
   "I am very pleased to announce that the National Park Service has partnered with Missouri to develop new recreation projects," Sen. Talent said. "Every community in Missouri should have access to parks and recreational areas for family and community events. This is an important investment in Missouri and I am certain that families in Columbia, Platte City and Willow Springs will enjoy using the new outdoor areas."
   Boone County Fairgrounds was awarded $84,500 to build new baseball and softball fields in a newly developed outdoor recreation area. The Platte Ridge Park received $166,666 to construct football and soccer fields, nature trails, a fishing dock and play areas with appropriate support facilities. Willow Springs Municipal Pool will use the $166,666 grant to completely reconstruct the community swimming pool and renovate the bathhouse. 
   The Land and Water Conservation Fund grants-in-aid program provides matching grants to states and local units of government for the acquisition and development of public outdoor recreation areas and facilities.
