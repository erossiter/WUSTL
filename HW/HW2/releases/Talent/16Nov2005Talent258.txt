SEN. TALENT SECURES $100,000 FOR SOUTHWEST MISSOURI MAJOR CASE SQUAD
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $100,000 for the Southwest Missouri Major Case Squad Drug Task Force in the FY 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill, which was approved today by the Senate.  
   "Methamphetamine is the worst drug I've encountered in my nearly 20 years in public life," said Senator Talent. "Missourians, especially our law enforcement officials, know too well how meth can destroy communities. This funding for the Southwest Missouri Major Case Squad Drug Task Force will help them lock up the meth cooks and help children who are threatened by meth. Through their work and this funding, lives will be saved and our communities and our kids will be protected from this terrible drug."
   The funding will assist the Major Case Squad Drug Task Force with investigating methamphetamine related crimes which include anhydrous ammonia thefts, methamphetamine lab busts as well as investing children who have been victimized by meth related crimes. The Southwest Missouri Major Case Squad will operate in Cedar, Barton, Dade, Vernon, St. Clair and Bates Counties
   Sen. Talent, along with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), has introduced the Combat Meth Act which would restrict the sale of products containing the primary ingredient to cook methamphetamine. The Talent-Feinstein bill, which passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support, would limit purchases of cold medications containing pseudoephedrine, require a log book to track purchases nationally and enact stricter federal penalties to prosecute meth cooks.
