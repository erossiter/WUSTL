SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $40,000 GRANT FOR ALLENDALE WATER IMPROVEMENT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will send a $40,000 grant to the Village of Allendale to help finance the construction of a central water collection and treatment system for dozens of local households.  
   "We are working to improve water quality in Missouri," said Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "I applaud the Administration for delivering this money to assist the Village of Allendale with this vital construction project. I will continue working with local officials to deliver additional infrastructure improvement funds for water, roads and bridges." 
   "This grant will allow our small community to install much needed infrastructure, which would otherwise be fiscally impossible," said Kevin Harding, Mayor of the Village of Allendale.
   USDA Rural Development awarded the Village of Allendale with a $55,100 grant last year. The total project financing is $410,500.
