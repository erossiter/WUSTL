SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR GREENE COUNTY NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Greene County Natural History Museum in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 2005, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Greene County Natural History Museum will provide students, scholars and all visitors with a unique opportunity to fully appreciate Missouri's natural treasures," said Sen. Talent. "This museum will not only serve as an educational tool, but also a means to expand tourism in Southwest Missouri." 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Greene County. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then reconciled with the House bill.
