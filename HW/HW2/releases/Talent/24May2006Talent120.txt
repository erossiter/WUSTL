SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $24,050 FOR RECRUITMENT OF ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN ELK CREEK
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $24,050 grant for the Tyrone Rural Volunteer Fire Department. The funds will be used to recruit additional firefighters.  
   "We must have an adequate number of firefighters to protect our people in the event of a fire," said Sen. Talent. "The SAFER program is designed to help local fire departments recruit and hire additional firefighters and volunteers to achieve this goal. I am pleased to announce that Elk Creek will be able to use these funds to hire skilled firefighters to better protect the homes and businesses in Texas County."
   In FY 2005 Congress appropriated $65 million to support the hiring of full time firefighters and to support the recruitment and retention of volunteer fire fighters. In the current FY 2005 cycle, the Department received 2,986 applications for the "SAFER" hiring and volunteer recruitment program. Approximately 1,700 applications were forwarded for peer review. The Department expects to award approximately 125 grants in FY 2005 under the "SAFER" program.
