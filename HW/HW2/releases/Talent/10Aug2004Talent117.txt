  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $488,000 Water and Waste Disposal Direct Loan to the PWSD #2 of Lafayette, Johnson and Saline Counties.  
 These funds will be used to address deficiencies in the District's South Concordia Pressure Zone distribution system.
   Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee, said, "I am very pleased to announce that Lafayette, Johnson and Saline Counties will be receiving this loan. Projects like this one identify how to make the water system more efficient as we do our part by providing the resources to get the job done. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for identifying and approving water infrastructure projects on behalf of the people of rural Missouri."
   The funds will also help finance a 150,000 gallon water tower and appurtenances. The improvements will benefit South Lafayette County, Northern Johnson County and Western Pettis County. An estimated 115 additional customers will be served by the new system. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers water and wastewater loan and grant program to improve the quality of life and promote economic development in rural America.
