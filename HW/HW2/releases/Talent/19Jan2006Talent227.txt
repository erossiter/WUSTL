SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR JUDGE ALITO TO SERVE ON SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he will vote to confirm Judge Samuel Alito to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Sen.  
 Talent cited Judge Alito's exceptional qualifications and said he was impressed with how he handled himself during last week's hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Sen. Talent issued the following statement:
   "I've said from the beginning that Judge Alito deserved a fair and respectful confirmation process, ending in a timely, up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Judge Alito is exceptionally qualified to serve on the nation's highest court. He has the experience, temperament and integrity that America expects in a Supreme Court Justice.
   "During last week's hearings, Judge Alito answered hundreds of questions for more than 18 hours. I was impressed with how he handled himself in those hearings, particularly when some of the attacks got personal. He was thoughtful and thorough in answering the tough questions and he was humble throughout the process, which is something I look for when considering anyone seeking a life appointment.
   "I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Alito in November and the hearings reaffirmed my initial impression that he is highly qualified for the job. 
   "If confirmed, I believe Judge Alito will respect the Constitution and apply a consistent jurisprudence without imposing his personal views on the law. I will proudly vote to confirm Judge Alito and I am hopeful the Senate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate will give this highly qualified nominee a fair, up-or-down vote as quickly as possible."
