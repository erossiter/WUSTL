SEN. TALENT'S $250,000 REQUEST FOR TRUMAN STATE UNIVERSITY APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Truman State University Enhanced Speech and Hearing Clinic in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which was approved today by the Senate. 
   "The Speech and Hearing Clinic at Truman State not only serves as an instructional lab for students, but a clinic serving clients from all over the Northeast Missouri region," said Sen. Talent. "With this funding, the University will be able to construct the facility it needs to help speech pathologists better serve their patients." 
   "The Truman State University Speech and Hearing Clinic, an important component of our Communication Disorders Program, fills a major void in the health care delivery system for many citizens in our region, especially the elderly who find travel difficult," said Dr. Barbara Dixon, President of Truman State University. "Truman is in a very rural area of Missouri approximately three hours from the major metropolitan areas of Kansas City, St. Louis, and Des Moines, and nearly 100 miles from the University of Missouri teaching hospital. This appropriation will enable Truman to significantly enhance the educational services it provides to our students, and also many citizens in northeastern Missouri and southern Iowa."
   Sen. Talent's $250,000 request passed the Senate and will now go to conference with the House version of the bill.
