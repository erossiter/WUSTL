SEN. TALENT APPLAUDS PLAN FOR MISSOURI'S FIRST MAJOR BIODIESEL PLANT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, today applauded the announcement that Missouri's first major biodiesel production plant will be built in Mexico, Mo. Sen.  
 Talent, a member of both the Senate Energy Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee, said boosting production of renewable fuels will help lower gas prices over the long term and will create jobs in rural Missouri.
   "I am very pleased to announce this new biodiesel production facility in Missouri," said U.S. Sen. Jim Talent. "Biodiesel is a more affordable and cleaner burning alternative than standard diesel fuel. Renewable fuels mean jobs, cleaner air and water and will help us become more energy independent. I applaud all of the farmers and producers for coming together to create Missouri's first major biodiesel plant."
   Mid America biofuels, LLC is a partnership of Biofuels, LLC, a Missouri farmer-owned biodiesel business; Archer Daniels Midland Company; Ray-Carroll County Grain Growers; and MFA Oil Company. The facility will use soybean oil as feedstock and carry 30 million gallons of biodiesel production this year. 
   Sen. Talent is currently sponsoring two bills in the Senate as part of a renewable fuels package. The first bill, S.650, calls for the implementation of a Renewable Fuels Standard, which will phase in renewable fuels over 7 years, beginning with 4 billion gallons by 2006 and ending at 8 billion gallons in 2012. The second bill, S. 610, provides a ten-cent-per-gallon tax credit for small biodiesel producers who make up to 60 million gallons of biodiesel per year. This tax credit would be an incentive for farmers who invest in small ethanol production facilities and producers who want to expand ethanol or biodiesel plants.
