SEN. TALENT SECURES $50,000 FOR POLK COUNTY DRUG COURT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $50,000 for Polk County Drug Court Interface Partners in the FY 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill, which was approved today by the Senate.  
   "This funding will help recovering addicts get the support they need," said Sen. Talent. "Drug Courts in Missouri have been enormously affective in helping people who have become addicted to meth and other dangerous drugs. The Recovery Management project helps participants find a job, find a place to live, get transportation, engage in community service and provide support so they can become an active part of society." 
   "I'm honored Senator Talent has recognized the efforts that we have put forth in this war against methamphetamine," said Mary Ann Cochran, Intervention Ministries Case Manager. "I am a recovering addict of 2 years, and know first hand what goes on in the world of meth. We believe that success breeds success, and it is our goal to guide these individuals through a System of Recovery Management. We want to see them succeed from an active drug lifestyle to a sober lifestyle."
   The funds will be used for the "System Recovery Management" project which will help empower the efforts of Polk County Drug Court by increasing the probability of a sustained recovery for the drug court clients and their families. The drug court program is limited to clinical treatment sessions and client drug screenings only. The "System of Recovery Management" project will offer additional educational, vocational and financial training to clients and their family. 
   Sen. Talent's request passed both the House and Senate and is expected to be signed into law by President Bush.
