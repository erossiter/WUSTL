SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $65,062 FIRE GRANT FOR IRONTON
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $65,062 grant for the Ironton Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to purchase new turnout gear and rescue equipment.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Ironton Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "Each day these firefighters put their life on the line to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This is great for our fire department," said John Mayes, Secretary of the Ironton Fire Department. "We will now be able to replace turnout gear that is fifteen years old and hose that is over thirty years old. We also plan to purchase Jaws of Life, which this fire department has never even had before. On behalf of the department, I want to express our appreciation for this grant."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
