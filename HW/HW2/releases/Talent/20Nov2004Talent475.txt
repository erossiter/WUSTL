SENATE APPROVES SEN. TALENT REQUEST TO SEND $150,000 TO BUCHANAN COUNTY TO UPGRADE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
 Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $150,000 for the Buchanan County, City of St. Joseph and Heartland Law Enforcement Communications System in the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved today by the Senate.
   "I have supported this project in the past and will continue to support it," said Sen. Talent. "With this communications system, law enforcement officers responding to a call will have instant access, via lap top computer, to all critical information, such as criminal and driving records. The system will also add a new user, the Missouri National Guard, in order to better coordinate responses to emergency calls."
