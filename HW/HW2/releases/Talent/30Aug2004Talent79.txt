SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $74,000 GRANT TO IMPROVE MISSOURI HOMES FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES
 Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.)today announced that United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development has awarded a $74,376 grant to the East Missouri Action Agency to make home improvements for low-income families in eight counties in Southeast Missouri.  
 The funds will be used in conjunction with the Agency's Weatherization funds.
   "I am very pleased to announce this grant for Missouri," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "By providing low income Missourians with the resources they need to make home improvements, we are improving the quality of life for people who need help the most. I appreciate the Bush Administration for providing resources for the neediest Missourians in our rural communities."
   The Housing Preservation Grant (HPG) program provides grants to sponsoring organizations for the repair or rehabilitation of low- and very low-income housing. The grants are competitive and are made available in areas where there is a concentration of need. The objective of the HPG program is to repair or rehabilitate individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops owned and/or occupied by very low- and low-income rural persons. In FY 2003 the East Missouri Action Agency, Inc. received a grant for $75,000 from USDA Rural Development. The eight counties in Southeast Missouri benefiting from the program are: Bollinger, Cape Girardeau, Iron, Madison, Perry, St. Francois, Ste. Genevieve and Washington.
