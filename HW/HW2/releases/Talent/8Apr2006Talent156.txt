SEN. TALENT TOURS STORM DAMAGED AREAS IN PEMISCOT COUNTY
  Sen. Talent (R-Mo.) today was in Pemiscot County to tour damaged areas affected by the violent storms that swept through the state on March 29-April 2. Sen. Talent toured the city of Caruthersville with Mayor Diane Sayre and Pemiscot County Sheriff Tommy Greenwell.  
   "I continue to be encouraged by the efforts of Missourians who have demonstrated tremendous resilience in the face of this disaster," said Sen. Talent during the tour. "The losses our communities endured from the storm and tornadoes is devastating, but Missourians are pulling together to help their neighbors clear the debris, recover property and begin the rebuilding process." 
   In Caruthersville, Sen. Talent met with local officials at the fire department, which is currently serving as the command center for coordinating operations. Sen. Talent also toured damaged neighborhoods and schools, and met volunteers and displaced residents at the community center where they are receiving temporary shelter and meals. An estimated 480 Caruthersville homes were affected by the tornado; and nearly 65 residents have been treated for storm related injuries. 
   On Wednesday, Senators Talent and Kit Bond and Congresswoman Emerson announced that the President approved the Governor's request for a disaster declaration for three counties in Missouri. The request will make assistance available for the following counties: Andrew, Pemiscot and Pettis counties.
   The American Red Cross, Salvation Army, Missouri Baptist Convention and AmeriCorps have dispatched volunteers to Pemiscot County. The American Red Cross is coordinating efforts at the Caruthersville Community Center. For more information on volunteering or where to donate food, clothing and supplies, call the community center at 573-333-9921.
