SEN. TALENT DISCUSSES MISSOURI COTTON WITH NATIONAL COTTON COUNCIL CHAIRMAN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today met with the National Cotton Council Chairman, Woods Eastland, in his Washington D.C. office. Sen.  
 Talent discussed ways to promote Missouri cotton as well as the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, agriculture budget reconciliation and the 2007 Farm bill.
   "I wanted to meet with the chairman of the Cotton Council to discuss Missouri's cotton crop as well the broader issues facing our farmers," said Sen. Talent. "Our state's cotton production continues to grow year after year in the Bootheel region and by meeting with the National Cotton Council I want to make certain Missouri cotton and U.S. cotton in general continues to be competitive in the global market." 
   "While in Washington, it was my privileged to meet with Sen. Talent and thank him for his commitment to production agriculture and equitable trade negotiations," said Woods Eastland, National Cotton Council Chairman. "He is a great friend to the cotton industry and to agriculture producers in the state of Missouri."
   Woods Eastland, a Mississippi cooperative executive, was elected in February as chairman of the National Cotton Council for 2005. He has been a cotton, soybean and rice producer in Mississippi since 1974.
   Missouri ranks tenth in cotton production. The cotton crop is predominantly grown in the southeastern counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, Pemiscot, Scott and Stoddard. Last year, cotton production in Missouri was estimated at 380,000 acres, yielding an average of 1,054 pounds per acre.
