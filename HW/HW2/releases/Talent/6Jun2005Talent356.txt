SEN. TALENT, REP. HULSHOF ANNOUNCE $540,000 GRANT TO CONSTRUCT EMERGENCY DISPATCH CENTER IN RALLS COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has awarded a $540,000 Community Facility Direct Loan to the Ralls County Electric Co-op Community Foundation in New London.  
 The funds will be used to construct a new 3,800 square foot facility to house the Ralls County Emergency Dispatch Center. 
  "This is an extremely important project and a vital partnership between the federal government and Ralls County," said Sen. Talent. "When lives are on the line, our rural neighborhoods need a quality emergency response network that dispatches first responders in real time. Together with Congressman Hulshof, we are doing everything possible to protect lives and property in Northeast Missouri." 
  "This is a wonderful example of what the federal government can do to enhance the infrastructure of rural communities," stated Congressman Hulshof. "USDA loans provide substantial resources and establish beneficial partnerships between the federal government and local officials. I'm pleased that they have chosen to support this important project in Ralls County."
  "The loan and grant program for rural America is a tremendous resource for outlying areas, like Ralls County," said Daniel Strode, Ralls County Electric Co-op General Manager and CEO. "Without these funds our community would have gone without these much needed programs." 
  The new emergency dispatch center will service over 9,500 rural residents in Northeast Missouri in Ralls County. Construction is planned to begin later this summer on the Ralls County Electric Co-op campus.
