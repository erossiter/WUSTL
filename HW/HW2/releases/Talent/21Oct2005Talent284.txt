SEN. TALENT'S $250,000 REQUEST TO REVITALIZE URBAN BASEBALL FIELDS IN KANSAS CITY APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 to revitalize urban baseball fields for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City. Sen.  
 Talent secured the funding in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which was approved today by the Senate.
   "We are absolutely committed to partnerships that help Missouri's young people," said Sen. Talent. "When you partner the great American pastime of baseball with eager Kansas City kids, good things will happen. It is my hope that for years to come, thousands of kids will get the opportunity to play baseball in a clean and safe environment in the heart of downtown Kansas City."
   "The baseball complex being constructed by the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City will provide a safe, well-equipped facility for over 800 youth and their families in their own inner-city community that will be enjoyed for many years to come," said Dave Smith, President of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City. "The addition of a quality venue in the city's urban core - combined with the RBI Program (Reviving Baseball in the Inner City) that is nationally embraced - will result in much more than fun for the whole family. The 4-playing field complex will provide a conduit to build esteem and self-worth for boys and girls, with the added benefits of disciplined and improved performance. As the RBI motto states, 'It's more than baseball - it's life.'"
   Sen. Talent's $250,000 request passed the Senate and will now go to conference with the House version of the bill.
