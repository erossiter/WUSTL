SEN. TALENT, REP. HULSHOF ANNOUNCE $30,420 FIRE GRANT FOR CENTRALIA
  Sen. Jim Talent and Rep. Kenny Hulshof today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $30,420 grant for the City of Centralia.  
 The funds will be used to purchase fire safety equipment and supplies.
   "I am pleased to announce this Homeland Security grant for the firefighters protecting Centralia," Talent said. "It is important that we provide Missouri's first responders with the resources they need to meet local priorities. The new safety equipment will result in better protection for the citizens of Boone County in the event of a fire. I applaud the Administration for providing these grants to local fire departments across the state of Missouri."
   "This grant will help ensure that the men and women who put their lives on the line protecting the people of Centralia will have the proper equipment to do their jobs," said Hulshof. "This is a great example of how the federal government can bring essential resources to the local level and better secure our communities."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
