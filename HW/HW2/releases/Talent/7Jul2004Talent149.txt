SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR CROSS TIMBERS TO PURCHASE NEW FIRE TRUCK
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $45,000 grant to Cross Timbers Area Rural Fire Department in Hickory County.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a new fire truck.
   "The federal government continues to provide new resources for our local first responders," Sen. Talent said. "As Cross Timber's fire protection team does their job, we are doing ours by providing funding for local needs. The least we can do is help provide adequate equipment for the people who save lives and property by running into the buildings while everyone else is running out."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
