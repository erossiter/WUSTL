  Sen. Jim Talent today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $127,216 grant to the Sunrise Beach Fire Protection District and $36,000 grant to the Osage Beach Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used to purchase operations and firefighter safety gear.
   "I am very pleased to announce that both of these fire departments will be receiving this funding," said Sen. Talent. "We are absolutely committed to providing Missouri's first responders with the resources they need to keep Missourians safe. We have provided tens of millions of dollars for local fire departments in Missouri and around the country and I am confident we will do even more in the upcoming Congress to support our firefighters."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
