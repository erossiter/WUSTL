SENS. BOND, TALENT ISSUE STATEMENTS ON MISSOURI RIVER
  Sens. Kit Bond and Jim Talent today released the following statements on the news that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Service has successfully constructed the necessary 1,200 acres of shallow water habitat for the endangered pallid sturgeon as recommended by the Service in its 2003 Amended Biological Opinion. 
   Senator Kit Bond said, "We are grateful for the follow-up on meeting the commitment made in March to keep the river open for balanced-uses this summer. Implementation of the new biological opinion will be an ongoing issue for years to come, but this is a key signal, coupled with the recent court decision, that we are moving closer to some measure of predictability which is critical for Missouri citizens. The courts did not give us what we wanted, but the judge clearly told those Washington-based activist lawyers that if they want to eliminate flood control, energy and water transportation, the courts won't do it for them."
   Senator Jim Talent said, "This is an example of how we can succeed in finding solutions that respect multiple uses for the river including maintaining navigation which is critical to our agriculture industry," said Sen. Talent. "Whether it's protecting jobs for those who depend on the river for their livelihoods or protecting endangered habitat, this announcement makes clear that we can address both economic and environmental concerns in the operation of the Missouri River. I've been pleased to work with Sen. Bond on these issues and I know the people of Missouri appreciate his leadership."
