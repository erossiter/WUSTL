SEN. TALENT SEEKS QUICK APPROVAL OF DISASTER DECLARATION FOR 10 MISSOURI COUNTIES
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) tonight contacted the White House requesting quick approval of the Governor's request for another disaster declaration for ten Missouri counties affected by the storm system that swept through the state beginning March 29. 
   "I've asked the Administration to quickly approve this request for Missourians who were hurt by the storms," said Sen. Talent. "We've appreciated the President's positive response to our previous requests and we are hopeful we can provide additional assistance to help our people recover."
   If President Bush approves the request, it will make federal aid available in Andrew, Dunklin, Marion, New Madrid, Pemiscot, Pettis, Ralls, St. Louis, St. Charles and Stoddard Counties.
