SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $65,532 FOR HAZELGREEN FIRE DISTRICT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Emergency Preparedness and Response (EP&R) will send the Hazelgreen Fire Protection District $65,532 to support local fire operations and firefighter safety programs. 
   "The Congress continues to deliver on behalf of Missouri firefighters," Talent said. "Our first responders put their lives on the line everyday to protect us. It is important that we provide them with the funding, training, equipment and resources necessary to do their jobs. I appreciate the Department of Homeland Security for delivering this funding quickly to support the Hazelgreen Fire Protection District."
   The Assistance to Firefighters grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments to enhance and support their abilities to respond to fires and other emergencies in their communities. The Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) will distribute more than $750 million in grants to local firefighters across the country. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
