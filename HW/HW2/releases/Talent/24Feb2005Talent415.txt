  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement on President Bush's appointment of Charlie Kruse to the Advisory Committee for Trade and Policy Negotiations:  
   "Charlie Kruse will be an outstanding advisor to the President and the U.S. Trade Representative as we seek to open new markets for our agriculture products. In selecting Charlie, President Bush has called on a fourth generation farmer with a great deal of contacts with our trading partners. 
   "He will be a tremendous representative for Missouri's farmers and ranchers as well as agricultural producers around the country. I can think of no one better suited for this committee and I look forward to working with Charlie in his new capacity as we continue working together on behalf of Missouri agriculture."
