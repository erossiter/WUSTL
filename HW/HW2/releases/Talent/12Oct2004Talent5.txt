SEN. TALENT SECURES $28.15 MILLION FOR FORT LEONARD WOOD
  Senate yesterday passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report. Sen.  
 Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, secured $28.15 million for Fort Leonard Wood in the bill.
   "Fort Leonard Wood continues to grow at a rapid pace," said Sen. Talent. "Our soldiers need quality training facilities. With these new construction projects, Fort Leonard Wood will continue to lead the efforts in joint training facilities in the country. I want to thank Senator Kit Bond for his partnership in making this a priority for Missouri and our military.
   * Fort Leonard Wood Range: $2.75 million to provide upgrades to the existing range complex including the construction of a classroom and a new observation tower, the addition of latrines and bleachers and the addition of the Next Generation Army Targeting System. 
   * WMD Responder Training Facility at Fort Leonard Wood: $15 million to construct a training complex for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Installation Support Teams, Rapid Response Teams, Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams and emergency responders. The complex will include classrooms, training exercise control and simulation rooms and an open bay for indoor decontamination exercises. 
   * Fort Leonard Wood Countermine Training Complex: $10.4 million to construct a Countermine Training Complex to support training for countermine, counter booby trap and mine detection dog operations.
