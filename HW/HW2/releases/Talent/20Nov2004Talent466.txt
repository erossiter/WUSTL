SEN. TALENT SECURES $25 MILLION FOR BOEING-DESIGNED X-43C SCRAMJET
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today secured $25 million for the X-43 program which could propel an airplane from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco in about 20 minutes. Sen.  
 Talent's funding request passed as part of the fiscal 2005 spending package which was approved today by the Senate.
   "The X-43 program is one of the most exciting programs before the Congress," said Sen. Talent. "Boeing's Phantom Works in St. Louis is on the cutting edge of technology that is not only breaking records, but also offers enormous potential for both our military and space communities." 
   X-43 will develop hypersonic propulsion, or scramjet technology, providing our military with both manned and unmanned flight capable of reaching anywhere in the world in two hours from the continental United States, with enhanced ballistic missile defense capabilities and could lead to a future-generation single-stage-to-flight Space Shuttle that would take off for space like an airplane. 
   The potential offered through continued hypersonic propulsion development is profound, as borne out by today's dramatic and successful near Mach 10 flight. Hypersonic propulsion will be to jet engines what jets were to propeller-driven aircraft in the 1940s. 
   Last week, the X-43A flight over the Pacific Ocean reached speeds of nearly 7,000 miles per hour, establishing a new speed record for airbreathing engines.
   In addition to this successful funding request, Sen. Talent worked with the Senate Majority Leader to place language in the FY 2005 defense bill directing Secretary Rumsfeld to work with NASA to fund the X-43 program to develop this technology.
   "We must make the X-43 program a national priority," said Sen. Talent.
