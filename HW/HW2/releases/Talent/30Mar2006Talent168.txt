SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Jim Talent issued the following statement on border security: 
   "We need to protect America's security and that means securing America's borders. Border security is a national security issue rather than an immigration issue. I've proposed a bipartisan Border Security bill with Senators Domenici and Dorgan that would help protect us from terrorist attacks, undocumented immigration and the importation of illegal drugs such as methamphetamine. 
   "The Senate is debating immigration reform this week. I will be examining the various proposals with a view toward supporting a comprehensive border security plan that does not include anything in the nature of an amnesty."
