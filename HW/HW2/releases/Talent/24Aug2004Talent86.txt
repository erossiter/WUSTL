  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $63,750 Community Facility Grant to the Tecumseh Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used to build a new firehouse. 
   "I am very pleased to announce this funding to the Tecumseh Volunteer Fire Department," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "These funds will provide a brand new firehouse and operational space for the volunteer firefighters in Ozark County. I appreciate the Bush Administration for their continued commitment to the local needs of our emergency response teams."
   Community Facility Grants may be made to public bodies and nonprofit organizations to assist in the development of essential community facilities for public use in small, poor and needy communities and may be made for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the project. A $15,000 Community Facility Direct Loan is being made in conjunction with this grant. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area.
