SEN. TALENT PRAISES SENATE CONFIRMATION OF REP. GOSS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today praised the Senate's confirmation of Rep.  
 Porter Goss to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Goss nomination was approved this afternoon by the Senate.
   Sen. Talent issued the following statement:
   "Congressman Goss will be a constructive agent of change. As a former U.S. Army Intelligence officer, CIA employee and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for the past eight years, he has a lifetime of experience on intelligence issues and is well-qualified for this post. 
   "I served with Porter Goss in the House and believe he will lead do an outstanding job leading our nation's intelligence efforts. I am confident he will make the changes we need to make within the CIA to strengthen the agency and its operations. As director, Porter Goss will be charged with improving our human intelligence capabilities overseas and overhauling the sharing and analysis of that information with other intelligence agencies. 
   "Moreover, Porter Goss will work to strengthen the CIA's internal operations to help us win the war on terror. He knows where we have been and where we need to be. I applaud President Bush for nominating Porter Goss, as he is an excellent candidate for this position."
