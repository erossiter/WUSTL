SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $31,950 FIRE GRANT FOR CLEARWATER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $31,950 grant for the Clearwater Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used for training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   "I am very pleased to announce that Clearwater will be receiving this funding for safety programs and equipment," Sen. Talent said. "The firefighters in Clearwater put their lives on the line for us everyday and that is why it is so important for the federal government to provide them with the resources they need to be safe while serving the community."
   "This grant helps us out tremendously," said Shane Babb, of the Clearwater Fire Protection District. "We have very limited funds and this helps the entire department. We will be able to purchase more turnout gear and forcible entry tools."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
