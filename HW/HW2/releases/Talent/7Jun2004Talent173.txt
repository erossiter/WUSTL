SEN. TALENT HELPS OPEN NATION'S FIRST VETERANS BUSINESS RESOURCE CENTER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today joined area veterans for a ribbon cutting ceremony that marked the opening of the St.  
 Louis Veterans Business Resource Center. The new center, which is the nation's first, will assist veterans who want to start their own small business by providing expertise and resources for veterans entrepreneurs.
   "This is tremendous news for Missouri veterans," said Talent. "I believe strongly that small business is the avenue of opportunity for people of all backgrounds and walks of life. The establishment of this center will make it possible for more than a half-million Missouri veterans to access small business loans, training, resources and other assistance to help them realize their dream of owning and operating a small business. The center will also help produce jobs and economic growth as more Veteran-owned businesses are established in Missouri."
   While serving as Chairman of the Small Business Committee in the U.S. House, Sen. Talent authored the legislation (Public Law 106-50) to establish a network of Business Centers for Veteran entrepreneurs and Service-Disabled Veterans who want to start their own business or grow their existing small business. The Vietnam Veterans of America testified that the law has the potential to be the most significant Veterans legislation enacted since the original GI Bill was signed into law in 1944.
   The Veterans Corporation provides Veterans and Service-Disabled Veterans with the tools they need to start and expand successful businesses, including access to training, access to markets and access to capital and services. No other public or private organization provides this specific assistance to the 24-million-strong Veteran community. All of the services provided by The Veterans Corporation may be accessed via their website, www.veteranscorp.org.
