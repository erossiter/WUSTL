SENS. BOND, TALENT COMMEND AGREEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
  Sens. Kit Bond and Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today praised an agreement by Senate Majority Leader Frist (R-Tenn.) and Sen.  
 Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) to bring 25 judicial nominations to the Senate floor for up-or-down votes by July 2004 with the understanding that President Bush will not make any recess appointments of circuit or district court nominees before January 20, 2005.
   Among the 25 judicial nominations are two Missourians, U.S. Attorney Ray Gruender and Missouri Supreme Court Judge Duane Benton. Both are President Bush's nominees to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.
   Sens. Bond and Talent issued the following joint statement on the agreement:
   "This agreement is good news for Missouri and at least a step forward. For months, Democrat-led filibusters have prevented us from bringing President Bush's judicial nominations to the Senate floor for up-or-down votes. The Senate can finally vote on at least some of the qualified judges for the federal bench like Ray Gruender and Duane Benton without having to first overcome a filibuster. 
   "Filling the vacancies in the 8th District is critical to Missouri. When courts are vacant and cases take longer than they otherwise could, lives are disrupted and justice is slowed.
   "Now that we've stopped the filibusters on at least 25 judicial nominations, we are hopeful for an agreement to stop filibusters on the remaining nominations, the transportation bill, the energy bill, the medical liability relief bill, welfare reform and other measures currently stalled in the Senate."
