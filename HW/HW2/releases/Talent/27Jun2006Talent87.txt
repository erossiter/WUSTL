SEN. TALENT DISAPPOINTED IN SENATE VOTE ON MEASURE TO PROTECT U.S. FLAG
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) said he was disappointed that the constitutional amendment to protect the flag of the United States failed in the Senate tonight by one vote, 66-34. Sen. Talent is an original cosponsor of the Flag Desecration Resolution (SJ Res 12), which would amend the Constitution to allow Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the U.S. flag. 
   "We have a great interest in protecting the physical integrity of the flag," said Sen. Talent. "The flag is the unifying symbol of our Republic. It represents that common history and heritage which holds America together notwithstanding religious, cultural, or political differences. Physical and public desecration of the flag degrades those values and coarsens America far more than any speech or political dissent possibly could. I am frustrated the Senate failed to pass this amendment, but we are going to keep the pressure up and continue to gain support to protect the American flag."
   The proposed amendment protects all actual speech and carves out only the narrowest range of conduct which may be regulated. It will not prevent anyone from saying or writing anything, however offensive, about America, the flag, politics, or anything else. The marketplace of ideas was strong and vital for the first two hundred years of our Republic, during which time States routinely passed such laws.
   In each of the last five Congresses, the House passed proposed constitutional amendments to protect the U.S flag. Sen. Talent also sponsored the amendment when he was in the House of Representatives. The last time the Senate considered a flag protection amendment was on March 27, 2000, when it came four votes short, 63-37, of the necessary two-thirds for passage.
