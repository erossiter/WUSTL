SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 TO COMPLETE ST. PATRICK HOMELESS PARTNERSHIP CENTER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today secured $250,000 for the St.  
 Patrick Homeless Partnership Center in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 2005, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   "The St. Patrick Partnership Center is a perfect example of stewardship in our urban communities," said Sen. Talent. "With these funds, the center will be able to transform unfinished space in the facility, into areas suitable for staff space and healthcare expansion." 
   The funding will help complete the 100,000 square foot building located in downtown St. Louis. The Partnership Center is a nationally innovative one-stop caring center serving homeless and near homeless individuals through user-friendly services under one roof. 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for St. Louis. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and then reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
