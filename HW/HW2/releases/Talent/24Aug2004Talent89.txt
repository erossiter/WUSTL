SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS FOR WORTH COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $3,750 grant to the Worth County Nursing Home District to purchase a natural gas generator and a $13,500 grant for an early warning siren system.  
 Both awards are through the Community Facility Grant program.
   "I am very pleased to announce that Worth County will be receiving this funding," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "The generator will be used as a back-up electrical source for the facility in the event of a power outage. Grant City will also be receiving funds to install and early warning sirens. The new system will alert residents in the area in the event of severe weather and other emergencies. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for their continued commitment to emergency preparedness in Northwest Missouri."
   Community Facility Grants may be made to public bodies and nonprofit organizations to assist in the development of essential community facilities for public use in small, poor and needy communities and may be made for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the project. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and health care facilities.
