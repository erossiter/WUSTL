SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FEDERAL DOLLARS TO EXPAND BROADBAND ACCESS IN HOWELL COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today informed residents of Howell County that access to new broadband services, including high-speed Internet, is on the way.  
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture has awarded Poplar PCS, LLC $56,869,000 to expand broadband access in 75 rural counties in eight Southern and Midwestern states, including Howell County. 
   "Helping close the digital divide in rural communities is a priority," said Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "This funding will help residents, schools and businesses in Howell County access broadband services, including high-speed Internet, which will help save time, increase productivity and provide additional education opportunities for students."
   The Tennessee-based Poplar PCS will use the USDA funding to develop a broadband infrastructure for Howell County and other rural communities in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Kansas, Mississippi and Oklahoma. 
   USDA's Broadband Program provides loans designed specifically to increase the rate of deployment of technology to small towns in rural areas. Additional information is available at http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/index.htm.
