SEN. TALENT SAYS NEW HEALTH SURVEY DEMONSTRATES NEED TO PASS ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) issued the following statement in response to the 2004 Annual Employer Health Benefits Survey, released today by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, which showed health care premiums rising and fewer small businesses offering health insurance: 
   "This survey will not surprise anyone who has talked to small business men and women as I have in Missouri and around the country. The largest segment of America's uninsured either work for a small business, own a small business or are dependent on someone who does. Small businesses are simply running out of options for how to deal with the rising cost of health insurance.
   "The Congress should provide small business people with an option that will work by allowing them to purchase the same quality health insurance that Fortune 500 companies and labor unions offer their workers. I'm sponsoring a bill in the Senate that would allow small business people to join together nationally through their trade associations to purchase quality, affordable health insurance for themselves and their workers. 
   "These Association Health Plans would reduce health care costs for small businesses by up to 30 percent, resulting in millions of people getting health insurance who don't have it, and millions of others getting better coverage at less cost - all at no cost to the taxpayer."
