SEN. TALENT SECURES NEARLY $6 MILLION FOR ZORA ROAD IMPROVEMENTS IN JOPLIN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $5.88 million for the Zora Road Interchange in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the House and the Senate today.  
   "We passed a good Highway bill in the Congress and we are also partnering with local communities to deliver additional funding for important transportation projects," said Sen. Talent. "The key is to talk to people in the community to find out what they need and then take those concerns to the Senate. David Hertzberg and other officials in Joplin told us the Zora Road project was a priority for them which made it a priority me and Congressman Blunt. I am very pleased that we were successful in securing this important transportation funding for this project."
   "This is great news," said David Hertzberg, Public Works Director for the City of Joplin. "This was a much needed project in Joplin and we look forward to getting the funds. This project will not only improve traffic flow, but the safety of everyone traveling on Zora Road." 
   The funding will be used for Zora Road to be raised onto a bridge that crossed Main Street, the Kansas City Southern railroad tracks and connect to Zora Avenue West. The funds will also add ramps to direct traffic off Main Street and then connect to traffic signals on Zora Road.
