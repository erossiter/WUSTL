SEN. TALENT SECURES $1.1 MILLION FOR MARK TWAIN HOME AND MUSEUM IN HANNIBAL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $1.1 million for the Mark Twain Home Foundation in the Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. Sen. Jim Talent requested the funds to make improvements to the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum in Hannibal. Sen. Jim Talent's request was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  
   "Mark Twain was one of Missouri's most accomplished citizens," said Sen. Talent. "His boyhood home in Hannibal is one of our state's most treasured historical sites and it draws tens of thousands of visitors each year. These funds will restore Mark Twain's home and museum in an effort to preserve its historical value and boost tourism in the area. Tourism is a top industry in our state, and I am hopeful this funding will generate economic growth in Northeast Missouri." 
   The Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum consists of eight buildings including six historically significant buildings and two museums. Last year, Sen. Talent secured $400,000 for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum and these funds will be used to continue improvements and renovations to the home. 
   Sen. Talent's funding request passed the Senate Appropriations Committee, and must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill before being signed into law.
