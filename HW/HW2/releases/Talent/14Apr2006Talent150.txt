KIRKSVILLE LAW ENFORCEMENT HONOR SEN. TALENT FOR PASSAGE OF COMBAT METH ACT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) was honored today by the Kirksville Police Department for his effectiveness in fighting methamphetamine. Sen. Talent met with law enforcement officials in Kirksville where he was praised for sponsoring though anti-meth legislation. Sen. Talent sponsored the Combat Meth Act with California Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein. President Bush signed the legislation into law on March 9. 
   "The impact of the Combat Meth Act will be immeasurable," said Sen. Talent. "It means fewer people will suffer because of the consequences of methamphetamine; fewer addicts because meth won't be as readily available; fewer neighborhood labs producing meth; fewer toxic waste dumps in neighborhoods that are created by meth labs; fewer fires in communities because of meth; fewer kids will be brought up in homes where they are making meth and fewer local sheriffs and counties will have their budgets overwhelmed by the cost of fighting meth."  
   "I am impressed with the language and legal provisions included in the Talent-Feinstein Anti-Meth Legislation, and with the hard work Senator Talent put in addressing the methamphetamine epidemic in this country", said Kirksville Police Chief Jim Hughes. "This event was as a perfect opportunity to honor that effort, as well as the community collaborations, in Kirksville and Adair County, that have been very successful at the local level." 
   The heart of the Combat Meth Act restricts sales of products necessary to cook meth. Law enforcement officials from around the country stressed that this step is critical to helping eliminate meth in our neighborhoods. The Talent-Feinstein legislation is modeled after the successful Oklahoma law which saw an immediate 80 percent decline in meth lab busts. 
   The Combat Meth Act is the toughest, most comprehensive anti-meth legislation ever considered by the Congress. The bill restricts the sale of products containing ingredients needed to cook meth, provides new tools to states, local law enforcement and prosecutors to combat meth and includes treatment funding to help those affected by meth.
   Combat Meth Act: Restricting the Sale of Ingredients to Cook Meth 
   * Restricts and records the sale of medicines containing meth precursors including pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. 
   * Relocates these products behind the counter, requiring purchasers to show identification and sign a logbook. 
   * Allows legitimate consumers to get the medicine they need, but limits how much one person can buy to 9 grams a month and 3.6 grams in a single day.
   * Creates a new DEA classification for meth precursors to imposes tougher penalties for meth cooks while allowing legitimate consumers to access the medicines they need without a prescription. 
   Additional Components of the Anti-meth Package 
   * Provide critical resources to local law enforcement and state and local governments - Provides an additional $99,000,000 per year for the next five years under the Meth Hot Spots program to train state and local law enforcement to investigate and lock-up meth offenders and expand funding available for personnel and equipment for enforcement, prosecution and environmental clean-up. 
   * Enhance international enforcement of meth trafficking - Requires new reporting and certification procedures of the largest exporting and importing countries of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and PPA. 
   * Provide services for children affected by the spread of meth - Provides $20,000,000 in grant funding in 2006 and 2007 for Drug Endangered Children rapid response teams to promote collaboration among federal, state, and local agencies to assist and educate children that have been affected by the production of methamphetamine. 
   * Enhance environmental regulation of methamphetamine byproducts - Requires reports to congress on agency designations of by-products of meth labs as hazardous materials and waste. 
   * Provide tools to prosecute meth cooks and traffickers - Enhance criminal penalties for meth production and trafficking. 
   Methamphetamine is perhaps the most deadly, fiercely addictive and rapidly spreading drug the United States has known. During the past decade, while law enforcement officers continue to bust record numbers of clandestine labs, meth use in communities has increased by as much as 300 percent. Meth is cheap, potent and available everywhere. 
   The goal of the Combat Meth Act is to provide legitimate consumers the access to the medicine they need, while cutting off the meth cooks from the ingredients they must have to cook meth. 
   Law enforcement organizations supporting the Talent-Feinstein Combat Meth Act include the Missouri Sheriff's Association, the Missouri Highway Patrol, the National District Attorneys Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Attorney Generals Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Narcotics Officers' Association, the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, and the National Alliance of State Drug Enforcement Agencies.
