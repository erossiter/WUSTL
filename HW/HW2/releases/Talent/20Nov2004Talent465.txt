SEN. TALENT SECURES $26,000 FOR MOBILE DRUG COMMAND TRAILER TO FIGHT METH IN WRIGHT COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $26,000 for the Wright County Sheriff's Department as part of a combined spending bill that was approved today by the Senate. 
   "These funds will provide a 16-foot mobile command trailer to infiltrate rural meth production sites," said Sen. Talent. "Meth is a serious problem in our state and we need to get serious about fighting it. This trailer will include a fingerprint station, evidence storage, AFIS computer capabilities and hazardous materials disposal ability. The Wright County law enforcement officers will be able to use this equipment to eliminate meth in our communities and keep our neighborhoods safe." 
   Sen. Talent has also authored legislation to provide Missouri and other states with new resources to stop the production and distribution of methamphetamine. Talent's comprehensive Combat Meth Act provides critical funding for law enforcement and prosecutors and increases community awareness, education and new treatment options for those recovering from a methamphetamine addiction.
