SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR WINSTON CHURCHILL MEMORIAL IN FULTON
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Winston Churchill Memorial in the Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2006, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Winston Churchill Memorial and Library houses a magnificent collection of documents and exhibits showcasing Churchill's historic visit to Westminster College," said Sen. Talent. "The Memorial is a cultural treasure in mid-Missouri. Renovating the library and museum is a very crucial step in preserving the integrity of this historic site." 
   Sen. Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for the Winston Churchill Memorial. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then be reconciled with the House bill.
