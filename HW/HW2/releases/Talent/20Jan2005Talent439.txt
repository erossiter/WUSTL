SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today attended the 55th Presidential Inauguration of George W. Bush.  
   Sen. Talent's statement follows:
   "Inauguration Day is a celebration of the peaceful transfer of power that is the essence of our democracy. It's always awe inspiring to be part of that. 
   "I thought the President delivered a simple and powerful speech and it was clearly from the heart. And he discussed a very important agenda that we need to accomplish. We need an energy bill to stabilize energy prices for Missourians so we can create jobs. We need strong liability relief for the same reasons so we can create jobs that will help us with education and health care. We need to get health insurance premiums down, particularly for employees of small businesses. 
   "As the President said, we have a historic responsibility to protect our own freedom, by helping the people of Iraq complete the process of building a democracy. It was very appropriate that everyone stopped on multiple occasions to thank our men and women in uniform for their service and for helping us accomplish this goal."
