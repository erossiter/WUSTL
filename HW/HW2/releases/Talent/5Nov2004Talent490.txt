SEN. TALENT COMMENTS ON 337,000 NEW JOBS CREATED IN OCTOBER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on a report issued by the Department of Labor report that showed 337,000 new jobs were created in October: 
   "We've bolstered the economy by cutting taxes and allowing families to keep more of their hard-earned money. This Congress has enacted a pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda that included tax relief for everyone who pays taxes and help for the small businesses that create the majority of new jobs in the United States. But we should not rest until everyone who wants a job can find one.
   "We've got a lot of work to do. The Senate should pass Association Health Plans which will reduce the number of uninsured and lower health care costs for small business people and their workers. We need to pass a highway bill to make our highways safer and create jobs in the transportation infrastructure sector. And we need to pass an energy bill to make America less dependent on foreign oil. The economy is soaring and we need to seize the moment and do what is necessary to create additional jobs for our workers and expand economic growth in Missouri and around the country."
