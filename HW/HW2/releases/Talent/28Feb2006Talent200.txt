SEN. TALENT SEEKS ANSWERS ON PLAN TO SELL PORTIONS OF MARK TWAIN NATIONAL FOREST
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today questioned what Missouri schools stand to gain in a proposal by the Bush Administration to sell portions of the Mark Twain National Forest. The plan was revealed earlier this month as part of the budget, but few specifics were provided about how Missouri would benefit from the proposed land sale. Sen. Talent expressed his concerns today at a Senate Energy Committee hearing on the Forest Service Budget. 
   "We need to see more of the benefit of this proposal than we are now seeing," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "I am very concerned about the way this bill is structured because there is no guarantee that the revenue provided will stay within Missouri."
   The Mark Twain National Forest is a series of land tracts throughout southern and central Missouri covering 29 counties in the state. The U.S. Forest Service is proposing to sell as much as 21,566 acres of the 1.5 million acre Forest to provide funding for a five-year extension of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act.
   Sen. Talent said he's not opposed in principle to the sale of land within the forest but he is concerned about how much revenue would go to Missouri schools. He pointed out that the proposed land sale in Missouri would be the third largest in the country, but Missouri schools are not getting a third of the revenue.
   "Our schools need the money and we view the Mark Twain as a national treasure and a Missouri treasure," Sen. Talent told Dale Bosworth of the U.S. Forest Service, who appeared before the Committee. "I hope we can work together to equalize the formula."
   Bosworth agreed to work with Sen. Talent and the Senate Energy Committee on both the funding formula and the selection of portions for sale in the Mark Twain National Forest.
