SEN. TALENT SECURES $500,000 FOR KANSAS CITY SMARTPORT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that he secured $500,000 for the Kansas City SmartPort to be included in the Commerce Justice State FY 2005 Appropriations Bill.  
   "This funding will allow Kansas City to further develop an inland port capable of processing a greater volume of international trade," said Sen. Talent. "This project is a priority for me because trade opportunities in our inland ports are key to Kansas City, which is an important transportation hub. The Kansas City SmartPort is an innovative solution to increase to international trade opportunities. I believe that these improvements will not only attract businesses, but also increase regional jobs." 
   Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for Kansas City. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law the bill must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
