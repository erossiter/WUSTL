SEN. TALENT'S STATEMENT ON THREE-YEAR OBSERVANCE OF 9-11 ATTACKS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the three-year observance of the September 11th terrorist attacks:  
   "Today is an opportunity for us to again remember the victims of the September 11th attacks and their loved ones. Three years have passed since terrorists attacked us, and September 11th will continue to be a day of reflection for Americans everywhere.
   "This attack on our country was also an attack on the American ideal that every life is precious. We have responded bravely making clear to the world that the United States will not rest until we win the war against terrorism. We have taken the fight to the terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq where our men and women are heroically defending this nation. We owe the members of our military and their families a debt of gratitude for their sacrifice and service to our country.
   "Today, we remember each life that was lost three years ago and I want us as a nation to take continued resolution to continue this fight until we win. I join Missourians in praying to our merciful God for our country and for those who carry personal burdens of grief from the attacks on our country and from the war."
