SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES ARRIVAL OF $421,600 FOR NATIONAL CENTER FOR FATHERING
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the $421,600 appropriation he secured in the fiscal 2005 spending package for the National Center for Fathering (NCF) at Sanford B. Ladd Elementary School is on the way. The funds will be used to establish the WatchD.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students) Program in schools and Head Start facilities in Kansas City. Sen. Talent secured the funds in the fiscal 2005 spending package. 
   "It is important for fathers to be active and engaged in the lives of their children, and the WatchD.O.G.S. program is a perfect avenue for fathers to do just that," said Sen. Talent. "The program allows dads to partner with their child's school and to take a greater role in their education. This funding will go a long way in aiding the good work the National Center for Fathering is doing. I believe strongly in the government partnering with community-based organizations that have been successful in improving the lives of children and their families. The National Center for Fathering is a success and this funding will help make them even more successful." 
   "We are thankful for Senator Talent's partnership," said Dr. Ken Canfield, Founder and President of the Kansas City-based National Center for Fathering. "We believe that every child needs a dad they can count on and are exited about the opportunities the funding will provide as we seek to inspire and equip fathers throughout the state of Missouri." 
   WatchD.O.G.S. has a history of great achievement. It has been successfully initiated in 20 urban Kansas City schools, with several hundred committed volunteers. A 1997 Department of Education study found that children achieve greater educational success when a father or male role model is actively participating in the educational experience of a child.
