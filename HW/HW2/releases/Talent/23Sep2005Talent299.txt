SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES NEW INFORMATION ON MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR MISSOURI SENIORS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has made available to Missouri seniors new information about the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Seniors can now access Missouri-specific information about Medicare prescription drug plan approvals by calling 1-800-MEDICARE or on the Web at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/map/map.asp.
   \"In a historic vote, the U.S. Senate passed a new Medicare Prescription Drug bill,\" said Sen. Talent. \"Starting on January 1, for the first time, every Medicare beneficiary in Missouri will have access to a voluntary prescription drug benefit. We still have a lot of work to do to implement the new plan. I hope seniors will take a moment to learn about the new Medicare prescription drug plans approved in Missouri and find out if the new benefit is right for them.\"
   Every Medicare beneficiary is entitled to enroll in the new plan if they choose. Seniors with more limited incomes - as many as 473,706 people in Missouri - could be eligible for extra help paying for the medicine they need.
   In addition to providing a prescription drug benefit, the new law also provides for a one-time wellness exam within six months of enrolling in Medicare. Screenings include early detection of breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
   For more information, Missouri seniors can contact Medicare directly at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or visit http://www.medicare.gov.
