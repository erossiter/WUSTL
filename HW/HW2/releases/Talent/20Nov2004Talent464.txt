SEN. TALENT SECURES $4.5 MILLION TO PRESERVE CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $4.5 million to preserve the historic Wilson's Creek Battlefield near Springfield, Missouri in the fiscal 2005 spending package, which was approved by the Senate. Sen.  
 Talent requested the funding to protect this historic battlefield which stands at-risk in one of the fastest growing areas in the country.
   "This is a historically significant battlefield and we need to expand it because of the rapid growth in the Springfield area," said Sen. Talent. "These funds will protect the field on which the battle was fought so that the full story of the first major Civil War battle west of the Mississippi can be preserved for generations to come."
   The President recently signed into law a bill written by Sen. Talent and Congressman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) which authorized the purchase of approximately 615 acres from six parcels of land that make up the remaining significant resources outside the park boundary that are directly related to the battle. Today's action provides the funding for the purchase. 
   The current acreage of the Wilson's Creek battlefield park is approximately 1,750 acres, but only 75 percent of the actual combat areas associated with the battle are within the park's boundaries. Sen. Talent's law provides permanent protection from development for significant resources that are integral to the historic events that the park was established to commemorate.
