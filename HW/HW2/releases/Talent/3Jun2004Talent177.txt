SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES NEW MEDICARE PROJECT TO BENEFIT MISSOURIANS RECEIVING HOME-BASED CARE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today joined HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson to announce that Missouri will be one of three states in which Medicare will conduct a demonstration project involving a new definition for homebound that would allow disabled Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health benefits to leave their home more frequently and for longer periods without risking the loss of those benefits. 
   "This is a great day for all of us who have been working to assist individuals with disabilities," said Talent. "Under the current rules, if a homebound person receiving payment for services at home through Medicare, has a relative or friend who wants to take them to a sporting event or out to dinner, they may decline the opportunity out of fear of losing their home-based care. The demonstration project eliminates this concern by allowing more homebound individuals to take advantage of activities outside the home."
   The demonstration in Missouri, Colorado and Massachusetts will mark an important step in identifying strategies to promote greater freedom and independence for people with disabilities who require daily assistance. As part of the three-state demonstration, which was authorized by the Medicare modernization legislation enacted last year, Medicare will relax the definition of homebound to allow greater mobility to those receiving home-based services.
   Up to 15,000 beneficiaries will be eligible to enroll in the two-year demonstration, which will begin in the fall. To qualify for the demonstration, Medicare beneficiaries must have a permanent, severe disability that is not expected to improve. In addition, the individual must meet each of the following needs-based criteria:
   * Needs permanent help with three of five activities of daily living;
   * Needs permanent skilled nursing care, and daily attendant visits to monitor, treat;
   * Or provide Assisted Daily Living assistance;
   * Requires assistance to leave home, and
   * Is not working outside the home.
   The goal of the demonstration is to determine the cost impact on the demonstration for patients with chronic illnesses - a population that otherwise may be at risk for costly institutional care.
