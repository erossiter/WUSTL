SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR EARLY WARNING SIREN IN DALLAS COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development, has awarded an $8,410 Community Facility Grant to the City of Urbana. The funds will be used to purchase a emergency storm warning system.  
   "Already this spring we've seen the devastating effects of tornadoes and storms," said U.S. Sen. Jim Talent. "Without question, early warning systems save lives. This funding will be used to purchase a new outdoor emergency warning siren for the residents of Urbana so they are better prepared in the event of an emergency." 
   The grant is administered by Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, which is a part of the USDA's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers grants designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and healthcare facilities.
