SEVEN OF SEN. TALENT'S BILLS AWAIT PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE TO BECOME LAW
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that seven measures he authored successfully passed the House of Representatives and the Senate this week. The legislation must now be signed by the President to become law.  
   "I am very pleased that the Congress was able to pass these important pieces of legislation," said Sen. Talent. "We passed the most comprehensive bill to fight Sickle Cell Disease in a generation, we approved legislation to keep our troops healthy and improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform, and we passed priorities involving some of Missouri's most important landmarks. I look forward to these bills becoming law."
   SICKLE CELL TREATMENT ACT 
   The Sickle Cell Treatment Act will increase health care access for patients by providing federal matching funds for Sickle Cell Disease-related services under Medicaid, making it easier for doctors to treat patients with the disease. The legislation will also expand awareness for Sickle Cell Disease and increase the number of services available to include counseling, community outreach and education. The legislation was part of the FSC/ETI bill. 
   MILITARY HEALTH READINESS PLAN 
   The Armed Forces Personnel Medical Readiness and Tracking Act of 2004 addresses a major health care issue that arose from the first Gulf War. The bill will provide for a before and after snapshot of the medical fitness of every service member deployed to a theater of war. The results can then be compared to help determine whether or not an individual, or their unit, was exposed to a dangerous substance or pathogen. 
   BILL TO AUTHORIZE THE GATEWAY ARCH TO BE ILLUMINATED IN PINK FOR BREAST CANCER AWARENESS 
   Lighting the Arch, one of Missouri's most prominent and recognized landmarks, in pink will recognize the millions of women battling breast cancer and those who lost their lives fighting this disease. Congress passed legislation giving the National Parks Service authority to illuminate the Gateway Arch in St. Louis with pink lighting in October to honor Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
   "OPERATION HERO MILES"
   The "Operation Hero Miles" amendment will allow Americans to directly support and assist our service men and women and their families by donating frequent flyer miles. Families of wounded service personnel will now be able to visit their loved one in a military hospital at no personal expense for the airfare. The legislation was included as part of the Defense Authorization Conference Report. 
   TRUMAN FARM HOME EXPANSION 
   This legislation will nearly double the size of the Harry S. Truman Farm Home. The Farm is currently located on a 5.2 acre site. This bill authorizes the government to purchase approximately 5-acres of land on the south side of the property, the only undeveloped land that remains of the original 600-acre Truman Farm. 
   WILSON'S CREEK NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2004 
   Wilson's Creek Civil War battlefield is historically significant and we need to expand it because of the rapid growth in the Springfield area. This bill will add approximately 615 acres of land to Wilson's Creek battlefield park that are directly related to the battle. 
   BILL TO DESIGNATE LIBERTY MEMORIAL AS THE NATION'S WORLD WAR I MUSEUM 
   The Liberty Memorial in Kansas City will now be recognized as America's World War I Museum. The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum in the nation dedicated exclusively to interpreting the experiences of the United States and its allies in the World War I years, both on the battlefield and on the home front. This legislation was included in the Defense Authorization Bill.
