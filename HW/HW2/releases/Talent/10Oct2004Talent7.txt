SENS. TALENT, CLINTON MILITARY HEALTH READINESS PLAN PASSES HOUSE-SENATE
  Sens. Jim Talent (R-MO) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) today announced that the Senate and House approved legislation that addresses a major health care issue that arose from the first Gulf War.Sens. Talent and Clinton, who were both members of the joint House-Senate conference committee which gave final approval for the bill, sponsored the Armed Forces Personnel Medical Readiness and Tracking Act of 2004 to establish a new tracking system that would make certain that active duty military personnel and Reservists would receive regular health screenings. The senators offered their legislation as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, which passed the House and Senate. The bill must be signed by the President to become law.  
   "Our legislation addresses a major health care issue that arose from the first Gulf War, in which some of our servicemen and women returned home with symptoms of an illness commonly referred to as Gulf War illness," said Senator Talent. "The bill we passed requires pre- and post-deployment blood samples, and a thorough post-deployment health assessment. The legislation will provide a before and after snapshot of the medical fitness of every service member deployed to a theater of war. The results can then be compared to help determine whether or not an individual, or their unit, was exposed to a dangerous substance or pathogen. We owe it to our troops who deploy to take the necessary steps to address possible medical problems."
   "With American troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere, we need to make sure that our men and women in uniform get the best possible health care," said Senator Clinton. "The legislation we passed provides a comprehensive approach to tracking the health of our soldiers before and after an overseas deployment so that we have adequate information if medical problems develop."
   * Medical Tracking
   The Armed Forces Personnel Medical Readiness and Tracking Act of 2004 would establish procedures to ensure that information about soldiers' health is systematically collected so that if a group of soldiers begins to exhibit symptoms consistent with exposure to some hazard, there will be adequate information to help identify the cause. The bill establishes a program for collecting baseline medical data for recruits and establishes a Joint Medical Readiness Oversight Committee. It also requires a report on Department of Defense responses to concerns raised by members of the Armed Forces regarding exposure to environmental hazards. Current law requires that information about the health of soldiers returning from deployment be collected but it appears that these provisions are not being enforced. This legislation establishes audits of the blood serum collection program as well as the pre-deployment and post-deployment health assessment database that DOD maintains. 
   * Medical Readiness of Guard and Reservists
   The Armed Forces Personnel Medical Readiness and Tracking Act of 2004 also focuses on another problem that came to light with the unprecedented demands being placed on our National Guard members and Reservists. Many of the Guard and reserve units activated are not at full strength because of a lack of medical or dental readiness. It requires a GAO study of the health of reserve personnel ordered to active duty for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. The bill also requires DOD to prescribe a policy that specifies: (1) the circumstances under which treatment for medical conditions may be deferred to be provided in the theater of operations in order to prevent delaying a unit's deployment; and (2) the circumstances under which medical conditions are to be treated before deployment.
   * Medical Tracking Provisions in FY 2005 Department of Defense Authorization Bill
   * SECTION 731 MEDICAL READINESS PLAN AND JOINT MEDICAL READINESS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE - directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive plan to improve medical readiness, and Department of Defense tracking of the health status of members of the Armed Forces throughout their service, and to improve medical readiness and tracking before, during, and after deployment. It also requires the establishment of a Joint Medical Readiness Oversight Committee to review the medical readiness of service members, make recommendations on improvements to the medical readiness tracking and health surveillance policies, and monitor compliance of medical readiness standards.
   * SECTION 732 MEDICAL READINESS OF RESERVES - requires a GAO study of the health of reserve components ordered to active duty for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom and requires reservists to receive a detailed health assessment at least every two years. This provision also requires DOD to prescribe a policy that specifies: (1) the circumstances under which treatment for medical conditions may be deferred to be provided in the theater of operations in order to prevent delaying a deployment; and (2) the circumstances under which medical conditions are to be treated before deployment. 
   * SECTION 733 BASELINE HEALTH DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM - establishes a program for collecting baseline medical data from recruits. Requires blood samples to be taken not earlier than 120 days before an overseas deployment and not later than 30 days after return from deployment. 
   * SECTION 1304 MEDICAL CARE AND TRACKING AND HEALTH SURVEILLANCE IN THE THEATER OF OPERATIONS - requires records of medical care provided to service members in theater to be maintained as part of the complete health record of the member. Also, it requires a report on the strengths and weaknesses of the medical tracking system for service members and an analysis of the efficacy of health surveillance systems as a means for detecting health problems and exposures of assessed members to environmental hazards that could lead to future health problems. The report should also include a summary of scientific literature on blood sampling procedures used for detecting and identifying exposures to environmental hazards. DOD shall prescribe a policy on the collection and dissemination of in-theater personnel and unit location data. 
   * SECTION 735 DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION ON EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS - DOD shall review and revise classification policies with a view to facilitating the declassification of data that is potentially useful for the monitoring and assessment of the health of members of the Armed Forces who have been exposed to environmental hazards during overseas deployments. 
    * SECTION 736 REPORT ON TRAINING TO DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS - requires a report on the training of field medical personnel within a year. 
   * SECTION 737 UNIFORM POLICY FOR MEETING MOBILIZATION-RELATED MEDICAL CARE NEEDS AT MILITARY INSTALLATIONS - requires the Secretary of each service to identify and analyze the anticipated health care needs of service personnel who may deploy or redeploy at each mobilization station. 
   * SECTION 738 FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION AND READINESS PROGRAM - Authorizes such actions as necessary to ensure that each service fully implements at all levels the Medical Readiness Tracking and Health Surveillance Program and the Force Health Protection and Readiness Program of the Department of Defense. 
   * SECTION 739 REPORTS AND INTERNET ACCESSIBILITY RELATING TO HEALTH MATTERS - requires an audit of records of blood samples in DOD's serum repository. Also, it requires an annual report on the Force Health Protection Quality Assurance Program and an annual report on the compliance by military departments with applicable law and policies on the recording of health assessment data in military health records. It makes DOD health assessment policy information available on the internet.
