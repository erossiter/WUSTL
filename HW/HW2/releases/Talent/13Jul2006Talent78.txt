SEN. TALENT PRAISES SENATE APPROVAL OF BORDER TUNNEL SECURITY MEASURE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced the Senate has approved a bipartisan amendment he cosponsored to shut down border tunnels used to smuggle drugs and undocumented immigrants into the United States. The Senate unanimously passed the Border Tunnel Prevention Act as an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill which would criminalize and punish those who construct and use unauthorized tunnels across borders to enter the United States. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), also doubles sentences for those who use the tunnels to smuggle drugs, illegal aliens, weapons, terrorists or illegal goods into the U.S. 
   "I share the concerns of many Missourians that the United States requires a border management system that protects us from terrorist attacks, undocumented immigration, and the trafficking of drugs and other contraband," said Sen. Talent. "Our plan will protect our borders and our people." 
   Key Provisions in the Border Tunnel Amendment
   * Criminalize the construction or financing of an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an international border into the United States with a term of imprisonment up to 20 years;
   * Punish those who use a tunnel to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or illegal goods by doubling the sentence for the underlying offense;
   * In addition to imprisonment, ensure that assets involved in the offense, or any property traceable to the offense, may be subject to forfeiture; and 
   * Instruct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to promulgate or amend sentencing guidelines to provide for criminal penalties for persons convicted under this amendment, and to take into account the gravity of this crime when considering the base offense levels.
   Sen. Talent said the amendment will help prevent the illegal importation of methamphetamine.
   Senators Talent and Feinstein were the chief sponsors of the Combat Meth Act, now law, which restricts the sale of products necessary to cook methamphetamine and provides new funding and tools for law enforcement to fight meth in our neighborhoods. The Senators wrote a letter to President Vicente Fox of Mexico, Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada and President Bush to take greater efforts together to combat international traffickers in methamphetamine and its precursors.
   "Methamphetamine traffic across our border from Mexico has increased substantially," said Sen. Talent. "Smugglers are moving precursor chemicals and the drug itself in greater volumes. Our plan will cut off avenues for smuggling this deadly drug into our country."
