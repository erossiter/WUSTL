SEN. TALENT BLASTS PLAN TO RETREAT FROM WAR ON TERROR
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, spoke on the senate floor last night urging his colleagues to oppose any measure that would set an artificial date for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq:  
   "This war is serious and necessary and must be won. Our service men and women are doing their duty magnificently, and will continue doing it until they have won. They have shown by their sacrifice how much they value the safety of their families and the freedom of their country and we need to back them up. That means, among other things, resolving to stay and fight in Iraq until the battle is won. To pull out now or to set an artificial timeline on withdrawal - especially after the victories of the last few weeks - would imperil everything the sacrifice that our service men and women has gained. It would encourage the enemy to struggle even more tenaciously and ruthlessly in the hope that America could be made to quit.
   "We are winning, not just in Iraq, but in the larger global war on terror. The operation against al-Zarqawi shows the value of our alliance with the new Iraqi government and the increasing sophistication of our intelligence. In short, there is no question that the United States, with its coalition partners, has the power to win in Iraq. The question is whether we have the resolution to win. I trust our leaders will be resolute in the struggle as well, and that by its votes tomorrow, the Senate will signal that we too have confidence in the success of our efforts, the worth of our sacrifice, and the justice of our cause."
