SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FIRE GRANT FOR DE SOTO
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $131,355 grant to City of De Soto Fire and Rescue.  
 The funds will be used for operations and firefighter safety.
   "The federal government continues to provide new resources for our local first responders," Sen. Talent said. "As De Soto's fire protection team does their job, we are doing ours by providing funding for local needs. The least we can do is help provide adequate protection for the people who save lives and property by running into the buildings while everyone else is running out."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
