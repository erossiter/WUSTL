SEN. TALENT STATEMENT ON FEDERAL JUDGE RULING ON NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE CASE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement in response to U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor's ruling in the National Security Agency terrorist surveillance program case: 
   "Today's ruling by the U.S. District Court in Detroit, if allowed to stand, would harm the security of the United States and the American people.
   "We all recognize that intelligence is the key to defeating the terrorists and we have to be willing to get the intelligence to keep our nation safe. 
   "As the arrests in Great Britain make clear, there are a large number of terrorist cells and organizations plotting to carry out attacks against the U.S. and all who oppose their barbaric vision of the future. 
   "The court's ruling fails to recognize the primary objectives of winning the war and the interdependence of liberty and security. 
   "We must make our intelligence gathering efforts focused and effective. Nothing in the Constitution was intended to prevent the exercise of those powers that are necessary to protect our people."
