SEN. TALENT URGES PRESIDENT TO NOT LIFT TARIFF ON IMPORTED ETHANOL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) is urging President Bush not to lift the tariff on imported ethanol. Sen. Talent, co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, today sent a letter to the President together with Sens. Kit Bond (R-Mo.), Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), John Thune (R-S.D.) and George Voinovich (R-Ohio). The President recently called on Congress to temporarily lift or suspend the tariff on imported ethanol.  
   "There simply isn't a shortage of ethanol in this country," said Sen. Talent, member of both the Senate Agriculture and Energy Committees. "Lifting tariffs on imported ethanol would not only put our farmers and producers at a direct disadvantage, but also cost the American taxpayer. I strongly urge the President to reconsider his plan and agree that our long-term energy independence is more important than a short-sighted proposal."
   "Brazil has built its ethanol industry through 35 years of tax incentives, production subsidies, mandates, export enhancement, infrastructure development, debt forgiveness and currency devaluation. Foreign countries, like Brazil, do not need U.S. tax dollars to compete effectively," the senators said in the letter. "Lifting the import tariff would only further subsidize these industries, but at the expense of American taxpayers." 
   Sen. Talent, who added the Renewable Fuels Standard to the Energy bill in Committee, said that with a minimum of 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, scheduled to be added to the nation's fuel supply over the next six years, there will be plenty of corn-based ethanol available to meet domestic demand.
