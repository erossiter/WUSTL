SEN. TALENT SECURES $1.75 MILLION FOR HIGHWAY 67 IN DESLOGE
   Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $1.75 million for the U.S. Highway 67 Eastern Outer Road Project in Desloge in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the House and Senate today.  
   "Highway 67 is a big priority for me in Senate," said Sen. Talent. "Improving our transportation infrastructure in Southeast Missouri will make our roads and bridges safer while creating jobs and economic growth. I know how important this funding is for people who routinely travel Highway 67 and I've continue to bring additional funding back to Missouri for this project and others around the State."
   The funds will be used to relieve congestion along U.S. Highway 67 and construct a three-lane eastern outer road along U.S. Highway 67 from the Missouri Highway 8 interchange to the Parkway interchange.
