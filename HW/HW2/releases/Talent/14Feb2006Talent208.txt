SENATE PASSES SENS. TALENT, LINCOLN MEASURE URGING CONGRESS TO MAKE CHILD TAX CREDIT PERMANENT
  The Senate today approved a measure offered by Sens. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) urging the House and Senate to make the Child Tax Credit permanent. Talent and Lincoln's measure instructs House and Senate negotiators to support the permanent tax cut as they work to approve the tax reconciliation bill (H.R. 4297). The Talent-Lincoln measure was unanimously passed by voice vote in the Senate.  
   "The child tax credit makes a big difference to families in Missouri," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent. "Families like Beth Davis, a hairdresser in Kansas City, and a single mother of three, who uses this money to help pay for necessities. The Senate should make this tax relief permanent so families can plan ahead and have the peace of mind in knowing they aren't going to pay higher taxes in the future."
   According to the Treasury Department, 543,000 married couples and single parents in Missouri have benefited from the increase in the child tax credit. 
   The child tax credit was nearly reduced by $300 in 2005, but with the strong support of Sen. Talent, the Congress prevented that tax increase by passing the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 to keep the Child Tax Credit at $1,000 per qualifying child through 2010.
   To qualify for the child tax credit, families must meet an income threshold, and qualifying children must be 17-years-old or younger, among other requirements.
