GOV. BLUNT, SENS. TALENT, BOND ANNOUNCE $1.5 MILLION TO AID LAID OFF ST. LOUIS AUTO INDUSTRY WORKERS
  Gov. Matt Blunt and Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond today announced a $1,527,711 National Emergency Grant (NEG) for more than 400 former workers of Ford Motor Co. and Lear Seating Corporation in Hazelwood who lost their jobs because of a drop in car sales.  
 The Missouri Division of Workforce Development will administer the grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor. The initial outlay for the services this grant will provide is $497,176.
   This is a dual-enrollment project to provide "wrap-around" services not covered under Trade Adjustment Assistance, such as assessment, counseling, case-management, supportive services and follow-up. The project will also provide short-term training not allowable under the trade program. 
   "Many of these men and women have dedicated their lives to Ford," said Sen. Talent, a longtime advocate for the Ford Assembly Plant. "Some have families and mortgages, and are at a stage in life where it might be difficult for them to retrain and find other employment. The least we can do is provide the resources they need to get back to work."
   "For the former workers at Ford Motor Company and Lear Seating, today's announcement is much-needed good news," said Senator Kit Bond. "These federal dollars will provide crucial assistance to these families who are working to get back on their feet."
   "This kind of assistance is critical to former workers and their families and I appreciate the Labor Department's response to our request," Governor Blunt said. "We hope that this additional funding will be beneficial to these individuals in helping them find new jobs."
   The Department of Economic Development's Work Force Development Division submitted the grant application on Feb. 9, 2005.
