SEN. TALENT VOTES TO CUT TAXES FOR MISSOURIANS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) tonight voted for a tax relief package for Missourians that extends for another five years tax relief for married couples, tax cuts for families with children and tax benefits for employers.  
 The tax cut extension prevents the expiration of tax relief passed by the Congress.
   "This is a pro-growth, pro-jobs tax relief package for everybody," Talent said. "I'm particularly pleased the package continues to reduce the marriage tax penalty. I don't believe couples should have to pay more in taxes just because they get married. We also stopped a reduction in the per-child tax credit which would have gone down by $300. Now families with kids will continue receiving the $1,000 per-child tax credit. This is important savings for families."
   The tax relief package prevents the 10 percent tax bracket from increasing to 15 percent which lowers taxes for every taxpayer in Missouri. An estimated 709,000 married couples and 507,000 families with children in Missouri will benefit from the tax cut extensions.
   Without action, the tax relief passed by the Congress would expire, effectively raising taxes for millions of Americans. Sen. Talent explained that this why we need to make the tax relief permanent.
   "We need to create an environment in which people can plan their family budgets without worrying about whether their taxes will go up," said Talent. "What we did today is a step in the right direction. Now we need to make the tax cuts permanent."
   The House passed the tax relief extension earlier today. Now the bill goes to President Bush where he is expected to sign it into law.
