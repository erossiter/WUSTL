SEN. TALENT DISCUSSES RENEWABLE FUELS IN CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR AGRICULTURE SECRETARY NOMINEE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today supported Nebraska Gov.  
 Mike Johanns to be the next Agriculture Secretary. With Sen. Talent's support, the nomination was approved today by the Agriculture Committee.
   "I am pleased the President has nominated the son of a dairy farmer from the heartland to lead the Department of Agriculture," Sen. Talent said. "I congratulate you on your nomination and I am proud to support you."
   In his questions to Johanns, Sen. Talent raised key issues for Missouri agriculture including renewable fuels.
   "Gov. Johanns, I appreciate your leadership on behalf of renewable fuels," said Talent. "Ethanol and biodiesel are the fuels of the future that we can use today. Farmers in Missouri and Nebraska have been growing an alternative to imported oil for years. The renewable fuels industry is contributing to our rural economy and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. As Co-Chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, I am confident we will have a strong working relationship with you."
   Sen. Talent added that renewable fuels are at the crux of economic growth and jobs; at the crux of energy security; at the crux of consumer benefits; at the crux of environmental quality; and at the crux of value-added agriculture for America's producers.
   Sen. Talent also thanked the current Secretary Ann Veneman for her service at USDA.
   "The policies she pursued over the last four years have helped our farmers and ranchers earn greater income and to sell record amounts of food and fiber abroad," Sen. Talent said.
   Governor Johanns' nomination now goes before the full Senate. Talent said he is hopeful the Senate will move to confirm him as quickly as possible.
