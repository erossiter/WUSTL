SEN. TALENT SECURES $1 MILLION FOR OZARKS ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES INSTITUTE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $1 million for the Ozarks Environmental and Water Resources Institute in the Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. Sen. Jim Talent's request on behalf of Missouri State University was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  
   "Water quality in the Southwest region is the top environmental issue in Missouri," said Sen. Talent. "Over the past three years, I've been working with water quality organizations to advance solutions that will improve water quality in the Ozarks. The Institute at Missouri State University provides key research and monitoring data that will enable local leaders to implement efforts to mitigate the impact of pollution. Getting this funding approved in committee was a critical step, now I will continue pushing for it when the bill comes to the floor of the Senate." 
   As part of the College of Natural and Applied Sciences, the Institute will use this funding to address the region's water resources issues through applied and basic research focusing on the relationship between land use/urban factors and water supply/quality problems. The University will match the federal funding with approximately $1 million in in-kind facilities, equipment, faculty research time and administrative staff time. 
   During the past several decades, the Ozarks has experienced rapid growth and economic expansion and as a result of that growth, the water quality of the region has diminished and, in certain locales, the water supply is threatened. 
   Sen. Talent's funding request passed the Senate Appropriations Committee, and must be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill before being signed into law.
