SEN. TALENT COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) tonight issued the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Judge John Roberts to the United States Supreme Court:
   "The President nominated a person with an outstanding judicial record after an unprecedented amount of consultation. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for his current job by unanimous consent. His record needs to be thoroughly vetted, but he seems to have an inside track for confirmation. 
   "My hope is that the Senate will proceed expeditiously to a fair hearing and vote on this nomination. I also hope that everyone will treat Judge Roberts with respect and avoid personal attacks during the confirmation process."
