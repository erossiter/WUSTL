SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $35,280 FIRE GRANT FOR PLEASANT VIEW
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $35,280 grant for the Pleasant View Fire Protection District.  
 The funds will be used to purchase an air compressor, a cascade system, a thermal imaging camera and a multi-gas detector.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Pleasant View Fire Protection District will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters put their lives on the line to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the Administration providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "This is the first time we have had this kind of equipment," said Assistant Fire Chief Mike Goodman. "This gear will expand our capabilities and allows us to do our job better. Without this grant, it would have taken us years to get all of the equipment."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
