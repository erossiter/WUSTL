SEN. TALENT JOINS MISSOURIANS IN OBSERVING MEMORIAL DAY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today made the following statement in observance of Memorial Day:  
   "I want to join with every Missourian in observing Memorial Day today. The story of the spread of freedom throughout the 20th century and now into the 21st century is the story of the American service man and woman. We should all honor their willingness to serve in every corner of the world, to fight for our freedom, to preserve hope and opportunity for tens of millions of oppressed people around the world.
   "So many of our brave men and women have made that sacrifice over the generations. Many have not come back. We must honor them. We must remember them. We must take their sacrifice to heart, and the sacrifice of their families.
   "We also owe it to them to preserve liberty for the next generation. That's what Memorial Day is all about. I want to join all Missourians in remembering and celebrating their heroism."
