SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES NEARLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN DROUGHT ASSISTANCE FOR MISSOURI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be sending $857,100 in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds to 14 counties in Missouri. Twelve counties will receive funds to help farmers and ranchers cope with loses from last year's drought. And two counties will receive assistance from damages resulting from last year's tornadoes.  
   "This is good news for the agriculture community in Southwest Missouri," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Our farmers and ranchers battle severe weather conditions year after year and emergency assistance will help ensure they can fully recover from these devastating natural disasters." 
   Missouri counties receiving this drought assistance funding totaling $777,100 include: Barry, Cedar, Crawford, Dade, Dallas, Greene, Jasper, Lawrence, Monroe, Phelps, Polk and Ralls. Dent and Oregon Counties will receive $80,000 in aid for losses resulting for last year's tornadoes. Sen. Talent is working to obtain additional funding for loses endured during the winter drought this year.  
   The Emergency Conservation Program is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) state and county committees. Sen. Talent is encouraging Missouri producers in these counties to contact their local FSA office for more information. More information on ECP and other disaster assistance programs is available at local FSA offices and online at: http://disaster.fsa.usda.gov.
