SEN. TALENT TO CO-CHAIR SENATE ANTI-METH CAUCUS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced the creation of a new, bipartisan Anti-Meth Caucus in the U.S. Senate. Sen.  
 Talent, a co-founder of the Caucus, will serve as the group's co-chair with Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Joe Biden of Delaware, Conrad Burns of Montana and Kent Conrad of North Dakota.
   "We were very successful in building a coalition in the Senate on both sides of the aisle in support of the Combat Meth Act," said Sen. Talent. "One of the goals of the Caucus will be to continue partnering with local law enforcement to push legislation that helps them stay ahead of the meth cooks. This includes additional funding and other tools that will help keep meth out of our neighborhoods and schools. We will also pursue opportunities for treatment and prevention, especially for young people who are among the most vulnerable."
   Last month, the U.S. Senate passed a sweeping anti-meth bill sponsored by U.S. Senators Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) to limit access to cold medicines containing the primary ingredient used to make meth. 
   Talent and Feinstein's Combat Meth Act would move cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine behind the pharmacy counter and limit how much one person can buy to 7.5 grams a month. It is stronger than the successful Oklahoma law that resulted in an immediate 80 percent drop in meth labs seized. The comprehensive bill also authorizes $43 million in new anti-meth funding for law enforcement, training and treatment. 
   The Combat Meth Act passed as part of the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill. Now the bill must be approved by a House and Senate Conference Committee before it can be signed into law.
