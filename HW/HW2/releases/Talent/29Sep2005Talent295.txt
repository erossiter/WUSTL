SEN. TALENT PRAISES SENATE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS AS CHIEF JUSTICE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today praised the Senate's confirmation of Judge John Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  
 Judge Roberts was approved by the Senate 78-22. 
   Sen. Talent issued the following statement:
   \"He is probably the most analyzed and evaluated Supreme Court nominee ever. Based on my study of his record and my discussions with him, I believe that he will turn out to be one of the best Chief Justices ever. 
   \"We have learned a great deal about who he is. We know about his extraordinary professional accomplishments. We have seen the overwhelming bipartisan support that he has earned from his colleagues in the legal profession. We heard from John Roberts himself on the rule of law, on the judicial role, and the kind of service he intends to provide to the Nation as Chief Justice.
   \"He has proven beyond any doubt that he has the qualifications, the temperament, the knowledge, and the understanding to serve as America\'s next Chief Justice. I was particularly impressed by the humility he showed through the process. I think it is very important that judges have a judicial temperament and, for me, that begins with the idea of service.\"
