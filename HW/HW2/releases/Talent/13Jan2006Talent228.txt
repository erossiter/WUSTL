SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES NEARLY $6 MILLION FOR ZORA & MAIN STREET INTERCHANGE IN JOPLIN
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he has won approval for a $5.82 million appropriation for the City of Joplin for improvement to the Zora Street and Main Street interchange in Joplin.  
   "I'm pleased to partner with local communities to deliver funding for important transportation projects," said Sen. Talent. "The key is to talk to people in the community to find out what they need and then take those concerns to the Senate. David Hertzberg and other officials in Joplin told us the Zora Street project was a priority for them which made it a priority for me and for Congressman Blunt. I am very pleased we were successful in securing funding to improve one of Missouri's most dangerous railroad crossings." 
   "This is great news," said David Hertzberg, Public Works Director for the City of Joplin. "This was a much needed project in Joplin and we look forward to getting the funds. This project will not only improve traffic flow, but the safety of everyone traveling on Zora Street." 
   This funding will be used as part of a $15 million plan to raise Zora Street onto a bridge crossing Main Street, the Kansas City Southern railroad tracks and connecting to Zora Avenue West. The funds will also add ramps to direct traffic off Main Street and then connect to traffic signals on Zora Street. Sen. Talent and Congressman Blunt requested the funds, which passed the Congress as part of the FY 2006 Transportation/HUD Appropriations bill, now law.
