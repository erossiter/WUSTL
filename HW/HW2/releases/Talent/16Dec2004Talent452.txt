SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $150,000 FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced a $150,000 appropriation he secured in the 2005 spending package for the Buchanan County, City of St.  
 Joseph and Heartland Health Communications System. Sen. Talent awarded the funding at the St. Joseph Law Enforcement Center with community officials and representatives from local law enforcement.     
   "I have supported this project in the past and will continue to support it," said Sen. Talent. "This communications system will allow for the use of in-car mobile data system. Officers responding to a call will have instant access, via lap top computer, to all critical information, such as criminal and driving records. The system will also add a new user, the Missouri National Guard in order to better coordinate responses to emergency calls." 
   Last year, Talent secured $1 million to start the project. The communications system currently serving the St. Joseph Police Department, the Buchanan County Sheriff's Department, Heartland Health EMS, as well as other first responders and public safety agencies can no longer meet the growing community's public safety needs. This funding will replace the old system with one that includes a minimum of eight talk paths for emergency calls.  
   "The extra funding is extremely important to us," said St. Joseph Police Department Chief of Police Mike Hirter. "These resources come to us at a critical time because we are in the process now of finalizing the contract for the new radio system."
