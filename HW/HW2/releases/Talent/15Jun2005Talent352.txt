SEN. TALENT COMMENDS GOV. BLUNT FOR SIGNING ANTI-METH BILL INTO LAW
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today commended Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt for signing into law legislation that would relocate products that contain the primary ingredient used to make methamphetamine behind the counter. Sen.  
 Talent issued the following statement:
   "I want to commend Governor Blunt for his leadership in getting this bill out of the legislature and onto his desk. The governor understands the need to act quickly to get the pseudoephedrine behind the counter so we can get the methamphetamines out of our neighborhoods. 
   "I have been pleased to support Missouri's new state law and I appreciate the governor's support of federal legislation I have sponsored with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) which would implement a federal standard to ensure meth cooks can't bring into Missouri pseudoephedrine purchased in states that don't have strong anti-meth laws. 
   "In addition to relocating products with pseudoephedrine behind the counter, the federal Combat Meth Act will provide Missouri law enforcement with additional resources to fight meth as well as funding to help treat those addicted to the drug and children who have been exposed to meth.
   "Together, the Missouri law and federal legislation will allow our law enforcement officials to finally get one step ahead of the meth cooks."
