   "I am pleased to announce that Morley and Vanduser fire departments will be receiving this funding for new fire trucks," Sen. Talent said. "The firefighters in both of these communities put their lives on the line for us everyday and that is why it is so important for the federal government to provide them with the resources they need to be safe while serving the community. I appreciate the Administration for providing resources for rural communities in Scott County with the funds they need to protect lives, homes and business in the event of a fire."
   "I am very pleased that we were able to get these grants," said Joe Lane of the Bootheel Regional Planning Commission. "These grants will help firefighters serve the area. We are in great need of fire protection, especially in the Bootheel."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
