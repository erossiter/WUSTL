SEN. TALENT'S $100,000 REQUEST FOR GREENE COUNTY COURTHOUSE APPROVED BY HOUSE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) secured $100,000 for the Greene County Courthouse in the Interior Appropriations spending package for fiscal 2006, which was approved today by the House. Sen.  
 Talent requested the funds to restore and renovate the historic Greene County Courthouse.
   "These funds will preserve one of Springfield's most notable historic landmarks," said Sen. Talent. "The Greene County Courthouse is one of the crown jewels in downtown Springfield. This funding will help restore its original picturesque beauty for generation to come to enjoy."
   "This funding will go a long way to getting the court house ready for the 2011 centennial celebration," said Dave Coonrod, Presiding Commissioner of Greene County. "We have been working on this restoration and renovation project for the past 10 years."
   These funds will be used to the interior and exterior of the historic courthouse. The courthouse needs interior improvements including flooring and lighting renovations. The exterior improvements include roof replacement to restore the original look of the building.
   Sen. Talent's request passed the House and must now be approved by the Senate before being signed into law by the President.
