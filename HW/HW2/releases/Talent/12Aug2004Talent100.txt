SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $66,242 FIRE GRANT FOR ELLINGTON
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $66,242 grant for the Ellington Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The funds will be used for training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Ellington Volunteer Fire Department will be receiving this grant," Sen. Talent said. "These firefighters volunteer their time to make certain our communities are safe. I appreciate the federal government providing these small rural areas with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "I just want to thank our citizens and our state and national support for these programs," said volunteer Mike Morris of Ellington. "These grants are helping out the neediest fire departments. We are finally able to do things that only the larger cities' fire departments could do before. We are very thankful and would love to have the continued support."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
