SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON HURRICANE KATRINA RELIEF EFFORTS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement:
   "This is a terrible disaster.  
 I share Missourians' concern for the victims and their impatience and frustration with the relief effort. 
   "A full range of federal resources and capabilities is being directed to assist and protect the people who have born the brunt of this catastrophe. Officials are working hard to deliver supplies, equipment and medical assistance to those who need it. 
   "Last night, the Senate unanimously approved a Hurricane Katrina aid package of $10.5 billion. Of the funding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will receive $10 billion to replenish its general disaster relief account and the Defense Department will get $500 million.
   "Many Missourians have asked me what they can do to help. They can call the Red Cross at 1-800-HELP-NOW, or visit my Website at talent.senate.gov for more information.
   "I also share Missourians' frustration about rising gas prices in connection with this disaster. I supported the Administration's decision to make oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve available to refiners and I've encouraged the President to ensure that the federal government takes every possible action against disruptions in supply.
   "The Energy bill we passed in the Senate this summer will help make our energy supply less vulnerable to natural disasters in the future, and make us less dependent on foreign oil."
