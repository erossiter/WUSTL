   "This is great news for the tens of thousands of Missouri seniors who will no longer have to choose between the necessities of life and the prescription drugs they need to stay healthy," said Sen. Talent who helped pass the Medicare prescription drug benefit into law. "Under the new Medicare drug law, nearly 124,000 seniors have prescription drug coverage for the first time and hundreds of thousands of Missouri seniors are getting better, more affordable coverage."
   Under the new Medicare prescription drug law:
   560,580 MISSOURI SENIORS ARE ENROLLED IN THE NEW MEDICARE DRUG PLANS
   123,653 MISSOURI SENIORS HAVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME
   There are 917,102 Medicare beneficiaries in Missouri. As of February 11, 61 percent of those eligible are enrolled in the new voluntary prescription drug benefit. Seniors who haven't signed up yet have until May 15, 2006, before the next enrollment period begins in November.
   Sen. Talent has held 44 Medicare prescription drug town hall meetings since the passage of the new law. Sen. Talent and his office have for months been reaching out to seniors who might still have questions about the new drug plans to help address their concerns and provide them with the information they need.
   "For the first time in the history of the Medicare program, Missouri's seniors have access to a comprehensive, voluntary prescription drug benefit," said Sen. Talent. "My office is doing everything it can to help seniors get the information they need to get prescription drug coverage now. I've held dozens of town hall meetings all over Missouri to help our seniors better understand the new prescription drug benefit so they can choose the plan that's best for them and their family."
