SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR CEDAR COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $57,377 Housing Preservation Grant to the West Central Missouri Community Action Agency.  
 The funds will be used to make repairs to the homes that were damaged during the May 5, 2003 tornadoes in Cedar County.
   "I am very pleased to announce that these funds will be going to help families in Cedar County," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee. "Last spring, hundreds of homes across Missouri were destroyed by a series of devastating tornadoes. This grant will help Missouri families rebuild. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for their continued commitment to helping residents in Southwest Missouri recover from the tornadoes and storms." 
   The Housing Preservation Grant (HPG) program provides grants to sponsoring organizations for the repair or rehabilitation of low-income housing. The grants are competitive and are made available in areas where there is a concentration of need. In fiscal year 2003, the West Central Missouri Community Action Agency received a grant of $75,000 from USDA Rural Development.
