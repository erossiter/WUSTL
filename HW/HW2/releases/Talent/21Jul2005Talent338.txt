SEN. TALENT SECURES $250,000 FOR BOSNIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN ST. LOUIS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the St.  
 Louis Bosnian Chamber of Commerce in the Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2006, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   "The Bosnian community has made enormous contributions to our local economy," said Sen. Talent. "They should have a Chamber of Commerce community center to provide the space they need to train and educate entrepreneurs to help them start their own businesses. Over the years, I have worked closely with business leaders in the community and we need to provide them with the tools they need to start new businesses to the St. Louis area so we can create jobs."
   Sen. Talent has worked in the Senate to secure these funds for the St. Louis Bosnian Chamber of Commerce. The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, and before being signed into law it must pass the full Senate and then be reconciled with the House bill.
