SEN. TALENT'S $250,000 FOR HISTORIC COMMERCIAL CLUB BUILDING RESTORATION APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) has secured $250,000 for the Springfield Commercial Club Building in the 2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which was approved today by the Senate. 
   "The Commercial Club Building is one of just a few remaining original buildings in Springfield dating back to 1928," said Sen. Talent. "We need to restore it so we can maintain the history of the Commercial Street district."
   "We very much appreciate Senator Talent's ongoing efforts to secure funding on Springfield's behalf for historic preservation," said Mayor Tom Carlson. "The renovation of the Commercial Club Building is not only a key part of the community's revitalization efforts for the Commercial Street Historic District, but for Springfield's overall cultural opportunities."
   The funding will be used to restore the exterior structure, replace the roof, and repair electrical and plumbing infrastructure. 
   Sen. Talent's $250,000 request passed the Senate and will now go to conference with the House version of the bill.
