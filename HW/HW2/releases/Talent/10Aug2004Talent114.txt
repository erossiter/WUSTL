SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL FUNDING TO INCREASE WATER AVAILABILITY FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $1,148,650 loan and $714,200 grant to the PWSD #2 of Washington County.  
 These funds are part of the Water and Waste Disposal program and will be used to complete the water system in rural Washington County.
   Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agricultural Committee said, "I am very pleased to announce that the PWSD #2 of Washington County will be receiving this loan. This funding will increase water availability for residents near Belgrade. I appreciate USDA Rural Development for identifying and approving projects like this in rural Southeast Missouri."
   The project will include completion of the 38 miles of 2" to 8" distribution line, standpipe and well to supply water to those in the Belgrade area. Currently, those households are served by individual wells. Approximately 230 users will benefit from this new system. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers water and wastewater loan and grant program to improve the quality of life and promote economic development in rural America.
