SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON 9/11 COMMISSION'S REPORT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) was back in Washington this week for Senate Armed Services Committee hearings on the 9/11 Commission's Report.  
 The committee heard testimony today from former top level Defense Department leaders on the implications of the commission's proposals. Sen. Talent, a member of the committee, issued the following statement:
   "We heard powerful testimony today about how we can better improve our intelligence capabilities, and that the issue before us is sufficiently complex that it should preclude our reaching hasty conclusions.
   "We discussed at length the idea for a new intelligence director to advise the President. We clearly need to empower our intelligence leadership to require sharing of information, but as the hearing today showed there is considerable risk that a new intelligence czar would be either too weak, in which case we would have only created another layer of bureaucracy, or too strong, in which case it might disrupt delivery of intelligence to troops in the field which could cost American lives.
   "The first step we must undertake is to repair the longstanding shortfalls in human intelligence gathering capabilities and to then improve the analysis of that intelligence. Accomplishing that, we must do a better job of sharing information across our intelligence agencies.
   "This was a productive hearing. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's panel of witnesses as we continue examining these issues."
