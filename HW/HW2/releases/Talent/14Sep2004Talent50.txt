SEN. TALENT'S AGRICULTURE DISASTER AMENDMENT APPROVED BY SENATE
  The Senate today approved an amendment offered by Sen.  
 Jim Talent (R-Mo.) allowing USDA to deploy agriculture disaster liaisons to federally declared disaster areas to help our producers recover. The disaster liaisons would help disaster victims by coordinating USDA assistance programs. Sen. Talent's amendment passed as part of the $32 billion federal homeland security appropriations bill for fiscal 2005.
   "Our amendment makes certain that disaster victims in the agriculture community will have a go-to person on the ground who understands the various assistance programs," said Talent. "In the event of a federal disaster, the liaison will network with state and federal agencies on behalf of our agriculture producers so they can get the assistance they need as quickly as possible."
   Sen. Talent's amendment authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to deploy disaster liaisons when requested by the Governor or appropriate state agency in a federally declared disaster area. 
   The disaster liaison will be deployed to coordinate USDA interagency programs in assistance to agriculture producers in the area. The individual will be responsible for facilitating the claims and applications of agriculture producers who are victims of the disaster and coordinate with the various state and federal emergency services.
   The Homeland Security Appropriations bill now goes to a conference committee. Sen. Talent said he would continue working to make certain his amendment remains in the legislation. U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) has passed a similar measure in the House.
