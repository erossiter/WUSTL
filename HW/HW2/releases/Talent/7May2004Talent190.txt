SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNOUNCEMENT OF 288,000 JOBS CREATED IN APRIL
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Labor's announcement that employers added 288,000 jobs to their payrolls as America's unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 percent: 
   "We had good news on the economic front. I'm sure we're all relieved to hear that 288,000 new jobs were created in April and that follows similar gains in March. This is another sign that President Bush's tax cuts continue to stimulate the economy. 
   "Since September, 1.1 million jobs were created, 867,000 this year alone. I believe we can now say that the recovery is fully underway. But it cannot lead us to stop our efforts for jobs and growth.
   "We must continue enacting a pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda in the Congress. We need a good highway bill, a comprehensive energy package and liability reform. All of these things are ways that the government can help the American people create jobs and we need to be certain we enact this agenda.
   "This good news should make the Congress even more vigilant to enact this agenda and I am optimistic we will do even more to help stimulate the economy and create jobs in Missouri and across the country."
