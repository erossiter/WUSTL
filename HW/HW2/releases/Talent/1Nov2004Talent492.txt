SENS. TALENT, BOND ANNOUNCE $25,703 FIRE GRANT FOR STOTTS CITY
  Sens. Jim Talent and Kit Bond today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $25,703 grant to the Stotts City Community Fire Protection Association.  
 The funds will be used to purchase SCVAs, fire protection suits, gloves and masks.
   "I am very pleased to announce that the Stotts City Community Fire Protection Association will be receiving this funding," said Sen. Talent. "This grant will allow the department to purchase new safety equipment to enhance service for the area in the event of a fire. I appreciate the Administration for providing resources for training and supplies for firefighters serving Lawrence County."
   "For firefighters all over the state, the new money for firefighting vehicles and safety will make a real difference in their ability to protect local citizens," said Sen. Kit Bond. "Our first responders are our first line of defense against any disaster, from fires to traffic accidents to oil spills to terrorism. It is important that we equip them with the resources they need to do their jobs."
   "All the equipment we have is several years old," said Carie Schnake, Treasurer of the Stotts City Community Fire Protection Association. "This grant will help keep our guys safe. And I am just really glad we got the grant. I know it'll help us quite a bit."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
