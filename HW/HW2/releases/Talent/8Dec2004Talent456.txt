SEN. TALENT ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF 9-11 LEGISLATION
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement on today's passage of S. 2845, the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004: 
   "Passage of the 9/11 bill is a significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform America's intelligence community. I am convinced that improving information-sharing among the various intelligence agencies will help make all of us safer. I am also pleased the bill protects our troops by making certain they continue to get the real-time intelligence they need to get the job done safely."
   The National Intelligence Reform Act creates the position of Director of National Intelligence who will report directly to the President. The bill also provides the DNI with authority over the national intelligence budget, including the authority to reprogram funds to meet rapidly changing intelligence requirements. In addition, the legislation establishes the National Counterterrorism Center, which will focus U.S. intelligence operations against terrorism.
