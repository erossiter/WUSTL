SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $1.77 MILLION FOR SOYBEAN RESEARCH
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) announces $1.77 million in funding for the University of Missouri-Columbia. The funding will be used for the National Center for Soybean Biotechnology and the University of Missouri Soybean Cyst Nematode (SCN) Research Team. Sen. Jim Talent's request on behalf of the University of Missouri was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  
   "The University of Missouri is a leader in agriculture science and technology and the research they conduct on soybeans is vital for the continued improvement of the crop and producers return on investment," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Getting this funding approved in committee was a critical step, and I will continue pushing for it when the bill comes to the floor of the Senate."
   The National Center for Soybean Biotechnology will receive $977,000 to be used in three program areas. The Soybean Genomics and Biotechnology program will focus on developing genomic maps to better understand genetic control of specific traits. The Soybean Breeding program will utilize molecular biology and genomic technologies to develop superior cultivars. The Soybean Informatics Resource program will develop a comprehensive national database that ranges from soybean genomics and biotechnology to soybean food and feed products. 
   Sen. Talent secured $794,000 for the SCN research team for two priority areas. The first priority will be to identify resistance genes in wild type soybean lines. The second goal of research will be to characterize the genetic variability of SCN to better understand its ability to adapt in different environments. 
   Funding for the University of Missouri was secured by Sen. Talent in the Agriculture spending bill. Before being signed into law, the bill must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
