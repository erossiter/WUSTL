SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $733,000 FOR DONALD DANFORTH PLANT SCIENCE CENTER
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) announces $733,000 in funding for the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis. Sen. Jim Talent's request was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The funding will be used for research to develop new crop plants and varieties at the Center.  
   "I am pleased to announce this funding for the Danforth Plant Science Center," said Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "The Danforth Center is known around the world for its success in improving human health and increasing agricultural production. The work they are doing in Missouri is generating economic growth and creating jobs for our workers. Getting this funding approved in committee was a critical step, and I will continue fighting for it when the bill comes to the floor of the Senate."
   The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center's vision to serve science, farmers and world-wide consumers attracts many of the world's leading scientists in plant biotechnology. The research project funded by the dollars announced today will focus on genetically enhanced plants with increased levels of micronutrients and initiate local studies, including research and the development of methods to enhance the value of biorenewable oils in plants, with a focus on corn and soybeans. 
   Sen. Talent secured the $733,000 for the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in the Agriculture spending bill. The spending bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee Thursday afternoon. Before being signed into law, the bill must be passed by the full Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill.
