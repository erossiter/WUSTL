SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $153,000 GRANT FOR NEW FIRE TRUCK FOR PIERCE CITY
  Sen. Jim Talent today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $153,000 grant to the Pierce City Rural Fire Association.  
 The funds will be used to purchase a new fire truck.
   "I am pleased to announce this Homeland Security grant for the firefighters protecting Pierce City and surrounding areas," Talent said. "I believe it is important that we provide Missouri's first responders with the resources they need to meet local priorities. This new fire truck will result in better protection for the citizens of Lawrence County in the event of a fire. I applaud the Administration for providing these grants to local fire departments across Missouri."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. For fiscal year 2004, $750 million in firefighter grants are to be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.
