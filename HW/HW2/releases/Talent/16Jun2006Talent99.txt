SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR MORGAN COUNTY FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, today announced the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded the Gravois Arm Sewer District with a $50,000 grant and an $80,000 loan to make improvements to the local water treatment system.  
   "Improving water quality in Missouri is a top priority," said Sen. Talent. "We need to make certain more people have access to a safe, abundant water supply and these improvements will help expand service to dozens of families. I am pleased with the progress we have made this year to help improve water quality in Missouri and I am optimistic we will do even more to provide for Missouri's water supply and infrastructure."
   "This new system will allow us to take a big step forward in cleaning up the water quality of the area and also preserve the water quality of the nearby Lake of the Ozarks," said Ray Metscher, Chairman of the Gravois Arm Sewer District. 
   The grant will help provide additional infrastructure to existing water and waste disposal systems. The project will include construction of a central collection system with a mechanical treatment package plant. The new service improvements will serve 168 residential users.
