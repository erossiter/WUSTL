SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES $1.1 MILLION FOR MARK TWAIN HOME AND MUSEUM
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced he secured $1.1 million for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum in the fiscal year 2007 Senate Interior Appropriations bill. Sen. Jim Talent was joined by museum officials for the announcement in downtown Hannibal.  
   "Mark Twain was one of Missouri's most accomplished citizens," said Sen. Talent. "His boyhood home in Hannibal is one of our state's most treasured historical sites and it draws tens of thousands of visitors each year. These funds will restore Mark Twain's home and museum properties in an effort to preserve its historical value and boost tourism in the area. Tourism is a top industry in our state, and I am hopeful this funding will generate economic growth in Northeast Missouri." 
   "We are very grateful to Senator Talent for his continued efforts to help the museum," says Megan Rapp, Manager of Marketing and Community Relations for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum. "We see this appropriation as a great benefit to Missouri. If passed, these funds will go towards the preservation of the historical buildings the museum maintains. These important buildings belong to the city, and the people of Hannibal. With Senator Talent's vision and leadership, the museum can ensure their preservation for future generations." 
   The Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum consists of eight buildings including six historically significant buildings and two museums. The funds will be used to continue improvements and renovations to the buildings. Last year, Sen. Talent secured $400,000 in the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill. 
   Sen. Talent's $1.1 million request for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum must now be passed by the full U.S. Senate and reconciled with the House of Representatives' bill before being signed into law.
