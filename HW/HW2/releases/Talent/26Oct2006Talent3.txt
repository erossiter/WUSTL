SEN. TALENT APPLAUDS NEW LAW TO CONSTRUCT BORDER FENCE
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the President has signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (H.R. 6061) into law. The bill authorizes construction of 700 miles of double-layered fencing along the southwest U.S. international border with Mexico. Sen. Jim Talent said that this bill is a necessary step in strengthening vulnerable areas along our borders.  
   "I share the concerns of many Missourians that the United States requires a border management system that protects us from terrorist attacks, illegal immigration, illegal drugs and other contraband," said Sen. Talent. "This new law authorizes a plan to construct hundreds of miles of double-layered fencing at strategic locations along the southwest border. This measure is long overdue and we can now move forward with a plan to increase America's border security." 
   Within the next 18 months, the Department of Homeland Security will provide at minimum two layers of reinforced fencing, the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors along select points of the Southwest border. The bill also adds physical security measures to prevent unlawful border entry and facilitate border activities by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which will add additional checkpoints and vehicle barriers. 
   Sen. Talent also supported a measure in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, now law, which provides $1.19 billion for border security fencing, infrastructure and technology.
