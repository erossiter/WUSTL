SEN. TALENT SEEKS TO EXTEND BIODIESEL TAX CREDIT
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, tomorrow will introduce legislation with Sen.  
 Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) to prevent the biodiesel tax credit from expiring next year. The Talent-Lincoln legislation would extend through 2010 the $1.00 per gallon tax credit designed to make soybean-based biodiesel fuels cost competitive with conventional diesel fuel. 
   "Here's what support for biodiesel means for Missouri: jobs, economic growth and energy independence," said Sen. Talent, co-chair of the Biofuels Caucus. "Biodiesel is a cleaner burning alternative to petroleum-based diesel fuels, and it is made primarily from soybeans which we grow in Missouri. We need to promote greater use of biodiesel on behalf of our producers, our economy and our environment."
   Under the Talent-Lincoln bill, farmers would continue receiving a $1.00 tax credit for every gallon of biodiesel they produce.
   Extending the tax credit would be particularly beneficial for Missouri where last month the Missouri Soybean Association and Mid-America Biofuels LLC, announced their plan to build a biodiesel plant in Mexico, Mo. The plant is expected to produce 30 million gallons of biodiesel each year.
   In addition to the economic benefits, fuel containing 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel can significantly reduce emissions.
   Without the Talent-Lincoln extension, the tax credit will expire in 2006. Companion legislation is expected to be introduced this week in the U.S. House by Congressman Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) and Congressman Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.).
