SEN. TALENT ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN FOR SCOTLAND COUNTY
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development, has approved a $190,000 loan to build a new community facility in Memphis. 
   Sen. Talent, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said, "I am very pleased to announce that the citizens in Scotland County will be receiving this project loan. Facilities such as this one are the foundation of our neighborhoods as they help initiate employment opportunities and improve the community as a whole. I appreciate USDA Rural Devolvement for recognizing the need for such a facility in Memphis."
   The building, funding by the Community Facility Direct Loan Program, will house the Head Start program and provide office space for the Northeast Missouri Community Action Agency (NMCAA) staff. Community Programs, a division of the Rural Housing Service, is part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development mission area. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas, such as schools and healthcare facilities.
