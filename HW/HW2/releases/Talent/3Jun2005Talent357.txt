SEN. TALENT APPLAUDS OPENING OF MAJOR ETHANOL PLANT IN MALTA BEND
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, today applauded the grand opening of Mid-Missouri Energy, a 40 million gallon corn processing ethanol plant in Malta Bend. Sen. Talent, a member of both the Senate Energy Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee, said boosting production of renewable fuels will help lower gas prices over the long term and will create jobs in Missouri. 
   "I am very pleased to join with the Missouri Corn Growers and Mid-Missouri Energy to announce Missouri's newest ethanol plant," said U.S. Sen. Jim Talent. "Renewable fuels are at the crux of economic growth and jobs in Missouri; at the crux of energy security; at the crux of consumer benefits; at the crux of environmental quality; and at the crux of value-added agriculture for our producers. Ethanol will also help lower prices at the pump over the long term. Currently, one gallon of ethanol is less expensive than one gallon of petroleum gasoline. I congratulate everyone for coming together to build another major ethanol plant in Missouri."
   Mid-Missouri Energy is a 100 percent farmer owned new generation with 729 members from 45 counties in Missouri investing in ethanol. The plant will process 15 million bushels of corn annually to produce 40 million gallon of ethanol. Nearly 1,800 additional Missouri jobs will be created and the effort will increase Missouri economic activity by over $169 million. 
   Sen. Talent successfully added an amendment to the Energy bill to establish an 8 billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard. The Talent amendment would establish the strongest Renewable Fuels Standard ever considered by Congress, creating a phase-in for renewable fuel volumes over 7 years, beginning with 4 billion gallons by 2006 and ending at 8 billion gallons in 2012.
