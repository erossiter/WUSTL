SEN. TALENT COMMENTS ON DEATH OF ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today made the following statement regarding the death of the most wanted terrorist in Iraq, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi:  
   "The killing of Al-Zarqawi is another success for U.S. and Iraqi forces in a very necessary fight. He was the most visible, most violent, and most radical of the foreign fighters in Iraq. 
   "Last night's attack was the culmination of many weeks of intelligence gathering by U.S. and Iraqi forces. The intelligence obtained from the strike on this safe house provided coalition forces with information leading to attacks on seventeen subsequent locations in the Baghdad area. 
   "It's important to understand that this success was the result of good intelligence gathering. We don't know the details on how that intelligence was gathered but we can speculate with a degree of certainty that Iraqi forces and Iraqi contacts were crucial to this important success. That shows the importance of having Iraq as an ally in the global war on terror. 
   "This close cooperation between U.S. and Iraqi forces, with Iraqi forces increasingly shouldering the burden, is how we will defeat the insurgents and allow our service men and women to come home as soon as possible." 
   In a closely related matter, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki announced yesterday the selection of a Sunni to serve as Minister of Defense and a Shiite to serve as Minister of the Interior. These actions complete the Prime Minister's cabinet and the formation of the first sovereign government under their new constitution.
