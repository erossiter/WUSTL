Resort Region today to address the growing Bark Beetle problem in Colorado   Representatives from Musgrave  Hefley  DeGette and Tancredo also participated in the meeting    Senators Allard  Salazar and Congressmen Beauprez  Udall and Salazar have introduced separate legislation to address the problem in Colorado and throughout the Rocky Mountain Region   At the meeting  the following action was taken    1  A working group consisting of representatives from the Colorado delegation  NWCCOG  CCI  and other Colorado local and regional stakeholders to be named would work together to see if a delegation bill can be crafted for introduction   2  NWCCOG  CCI and others would identify what actions can be taken at the federal agency administrative level to address bark beetle related needs   3  and the Colorado delegation would seek a meeting with USDA Secretary Johanns in Colorado and show him firsthand the magnitude of the bark beetle problem     We are in a position to take steps to help avert a potentially monumental disaster before it starts     said Senator Allard    I appreciate that both groups  NWCCOG and CCI  are willing to work together and have come to Washington D C  to meet with me and the rest of the Colorado delegation to discuss solutions that will lead to the passage of meaningful legislation to address this very serious problem        The fire hazard created by bark beetles will impact our communities soon  and for years to come   Appropriate funding for forest management is vital to prevent a disaster  but unfortunately Congress has short changed our forests    said Senator Salazar      The involvement of local organizations is critical as we look to fix this problem  I thank NWCCOG for coming to Washington  sharing their concerns and ideas and continuing to work with us for a solution   This was a very productive meeting and all offices pledged to work together to fight this problem       John Salazar and I have been pushing for legislation since last year   There is an urgent need to combat the bark beetle crisis in our national forests  and this crisis requires all of us to pull together and provide the tools and resources needed   said Udall    I appreciate the efforts of local communities to find solutions and I look forward to working with the Colorado delegation  the Forest Service  BLM  local communities  the private sector and the state to get these tools and resources where they are needed most to protect communities and Colorado s forests     The magnitude of the problem and the need for immediate action is indisputable   said Beauprez    I look forward to working with our Congressional Delegation  state and local governments  and the private sector to providing a quick solution to this crisis and take the steps necessary to protect our watershed  wildlife  mountain communities and tourism industry      Representative Salazar said    What we need are ways to manage the natural processes    bark beetle damage and fire danger    so that neither one becomes catastrophic  We need to focus on cutting the red tape that complicates efforts  And we need to include private industry  state  and local government in helping with the work  Creating healthy forests will take new ways of thinking and new partnerships  I stand ready to work together to protect our communities and secure this critical resource
