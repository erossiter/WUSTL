                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on Health Care Liability Reform          May 5th  2006   Mr  President  I  for one  am pleased we are moving forward this next week with the health care agenda in an attempt to hold down the costs of health care    My colleague who just spoke said  I don t think any Senators have ever experienced life without health insurance  Before I came to the Senate  I didn t have health insurance  So I come to the Senate today as a small businessman who has had to struggle with the costs of health insurance in my small business  I also had to struggle with my employees  making sure that they had appropriate health insurance to meet the immediate needs of their family    The fact that the majority leader has decided this next week to declare health care week to help put forth three pieces of legislation  Senate bills 22 and 23 which deal with liability reform is great  We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the fact that lawyers  some way or the other  do not contribute to the cost of health care  The fact is  the threat of lawsuits do add to the cost of health care    Finally  I am pleased one of the bills coming forward in the Senate is the bill allowing small businesses to form associations  Then  as a purchasing unit  they have more power in the marketplace and can negotiate cheaper health insurance policies as a general rule  It does not happen all the time  But at least it gives the small businessman one more tool in trying to hold down the costs of health care    As a small businessman  I had to struggle to maintain health coverage in my veterinarian practice and reached the point at one time where I said  I think what we finally need to do  as a small businessman I cannot afford health insurance  so we will work with each individual employee and give them extra pay so they can go out and shop for their own health insurance  So many times when you have small businesses  as I did  you become the first employer of many new employees entering into the workplace  With the idea they would be somewhat mobile and moving around from one employer to another for the next few years  we decided that was okay  and my wife and I decided to begin setting aside our own savings account to pay for health care costs in case  for some reason or another  I had an incident or she had an incident where we needed to go to the hospital and have some health care    Being a veterinarian and lifting heavy dogs on the exam table all the time and not expecting the dog owner to pick up the other half of a Great Dane  I ended up having back problems and had to have back surgery  I didn t have health insurance  I paid for it myself out of my own pocket  Fortunately  my wife and I had the foresight to set aside a savings plan so that if something such as this did happen  we could pay for it  But it set us back  We were able to survive that particular incident  It was kind of an interesting thing  They did not want us to go into the hospital  They would not let us in because we did not have health insurance  I said  I will pay for it  When we got in there  we had the surgery  and I did very well  and I am very active today  Consequently  they did a great job on the surgery  and when we checked out of the hospital  they said they would reduce our costs 20 percent because   we do not have to deal with the paperwork of dealing with the costs of having to process your claim      So much of the paperwork is driven by trying to protect themselves from frivolous lawsuits  That has been my personal experience    That is why I am in the Senate today talking in favor of Senate bill 22  called the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006  which is a comprehensive liability reform bill  and in support of Senate bill 23  which is called the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Health Care Act  and talking in favor of the association health plans bill that allow small businesses to come together and form associations so they can  as a bargaining unit  bargain down and get a more reasonable cost on their health insurance    What happens if we do nothing  Right now there are many smart young men and women across the country who are being literally driven away from the health care industry  We are attracting fewer and fewer high quality medical students than ever before  In some States and some specialties  practicing doctors are actually leaving their professions behind    A little later on I will give you the experiences of a doctor in a rural community who is actually preparing to leave his profession because of the high cost of health insurance  Most of it is because of the high liability insurance  and it is extremely prohibitive for young students and doctors to stay in a field they cannot afford because of the high liability insurance costs  This is creating a problem for patients in health care across the country but particularly in the rural areas  I will address that later on    Doctors are more reluctant to perform complex and high risk medical procedures such as those involving pediatric orthopedics and spine surgery  It is not an easy procedure having to repair the bone of a fractured infant or having to do spinal surgeries as I experienced  This puts patients  access to emergency and trauma care at risk  also  because this is another high risk area  Many times  you have to tailor the treatment plan to what is happening with the patient  There is not always a textbook approach  where you treat every patient exactly the same  Every patient is a little bit different    Doctors are moving to States with a more favorable medical liability climate  leaving some areas underserved  In the State of Colorado  which I proudly represent  about a decade ago we did a lot to try and hold down the costs of medical insurance  We dealt with a lot of aspects of medical liability reform  Many of those we have in this bill  but we actually went further than what is in the bill    The bottom line is  in Colorado  we were able to hold down the costs of medical insurance for medical doctors fairly significantly  One of the problems that happened in States such as Colorado  although we had done a lot of things to hold down the cost of health insurance  we found because health insurance companies pool their risks from States other than Colorado  we did not have the impact in some cases we expected to have because other States have not done that much in trying to hold down the cost of health insurance and liability problems that doctors incur when they are in their practices    We were disappointed in that regard  That is why I  as a Senator  feel we need to have a national approach to this problem    That is because there is a lot of variation out there between States  and those States that are not doing anything have an adverse impact on States such as Colorado that are willing to step forward and try to reduce the liability risk and to reduce frivolous lawsuits    Now  in Colorado  we are lucky enough today to already have had some liability reform for frivolous lawsuits  But across the Nation  States are experiencing extreme shortages in health care professionals because of the cost of liability insurance    Now  another thing that may happen if we do not do anything is that medical students that may eventually wish to settle in States such as Colorado  but cannot because they cannot get the training they need because they cannot afford the liability insurance in States where they have to go to do their residency  We have a medical school in Colorado  but lots of times medical students are encouraged  with their residency and whatnot  to go to other hospitals and other institutions because everybody has a little bit different view of how they are going to handle different types of cases  and this exposes them to different points of view  so they can make up their mind what best works for them  So they will lose that opportunity    Now  the bill  S  22  would create a graduated cap system similar to what was just put in place in Texas  If we look at the Texas model  we have seen some remarkable results  But the bill would provide for unlimited economic damages  So if the patient wins a lawsuit against a medical doctor to provide for a decent living for their family  then they can collect those economic damages  It provides a stacked cap model that would keep non economic damages at or below  750 000  They break it out this way  There would be up to  250 000 from a decision rendered against a health care provider and  250 000 from a decision rendered against a single health care institution and  250 000 from a decision rendered against more than one health care institution  not to exceed  500 000  It also provides punitive damages  but those are not to be any greater than twice the economic damage award or  250 000    This bill also guarantees that lawsuits are filed no later than 3 years after the injury and extends the statute of limitations for minors injured before age 6  Under the age of 6  not always does an incident emerge right away  So if you have too short of a statute of liability  then it does create a problem for the patient  So this bill also looks at what we can do to take care of legitimate lawsuits that patients might have  This is one of the aspects which is provided for in the bill we have before us    The language also intends to maximize patient recovery of payment by focusing on attorney payment regulations  It also establishes standards for expert witness rules  promotes fairness in the recovery of health benefits  and attempts to prevent double recovery    It keeps the focus on the patient by attempting to curtail frivolous lawsuits  which is the key    I mentioned Texas earlier in my comments  where there was legislation that was recently put into effect  Here is what happened in that State since September of 2003  They have added nearly 4 000 doctors in their State  Insurance premiums have declined  The number of lawsuits filed against doctors has been cut in half  Those are very significant events  It is similar to what we experienced in the State of Colorado when we passed a far ranging liability reform bill    Currently  we are at a crossroads on a very controversial issue    Now  in the interest of my constituents  I have cosponsored this particular piece of legislation  S  22  the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006  It still allows for individuals to file claims for compensation for all economic damages they have incurred and allows for a reasonable amount of punitive damages    Now  I have a few anecdotal situations I would like to talk about that affected Colorado  These are doctors who came and visited my office  and here is what they had to say  why they think we had to have medical liability reform    The first one is about a medical doctor in Ft  Morgan  It is a relatively small rural town in northeastern Colorado  He expressed his concern in having to stop accepting new patients  He was concerned that with the rising costs of liability insurance  he would no longer be able to afford to accept new patients with the amount he is reimbursed  Even more distressing for this doctor in rural Colorado was the fact that he was going to have to start turning away patients whom he had been serving for years  His final question was  if he could not afford to serve them  who would  This brings up anecdotal evidence of what I explained earlier  that because of the high cost of liability insurance  doctors are giving up patients in rural areas because they simply cannot afford to service them because of the liability incurred    Last week  a student with the American Osteopathic Association expressed his troubles finishing up his education  This applies to student experiences  This student is from rural Colorado  with plans to return to rural Colorado to practice  The problem is  he cannot afford the medical liability insurance in other States to get the pecialized training he needs to come and practice in rural Colorado    Now  doctors in small bordering towns of Colorado  such as Wray  Holyoke  and Burlington  cross the border into Nebraska to serve the rural areas of both States  Now  even if they are lucky enough to be able to afford the medical liability insurance in Colorado  it is nearly impossible for them to afford the additional liability insurance they would need to practice in the rural areas of the bordering State  which is probably closest and more accessible  This is another reason I think we need to have some national legislation    Doctors and specialists from Ft  Collins drive as far as Cheyenne to serve the patients of the frontier country in between those two destinations  Without their dedication  the constituents they serve would be left without health care  We are now faced with that reality because these dedicated doctors can no longer afford the medical liability insurance they are required to have to practice in rural areas    It was expressed in a meeting this week that eventually the need for liability reform legislation would be null and void  Why  Because large hospitals are beginning to pay on a salary so doctors can afford the rising cost of medical liability insurance without worrying about the rate of reimbursement  That may be a solution in urban areas where there is the opportunity for doctors to practice at a large hospital  But in rural areas  that is not an option  and the cost of medical liability insurance will force doctors out of rural areas where they are desperately needed  That is why I think it is so very important we move ahead with these pieces of legislation    I have shared with my colleagues some anecdotal evidence as far as the State of Colorado is concerned  Based on the Colorado experience and based on my personal experience  we cannot afford to continue to stick our head in the sand  We need to realize and recognize there is a problem out there with frivolous lawsuits against dedicated  hard working medical doctors  particularly those who are trying to make their practices operate in rural areas    So I  for one  ask my colleagues to join me because of the serious problem that is facing the medical community  I believe it is time for the Congress to act  and I am delighted that the Senate has decided to take up the bill this next week    I yield the floor  Mr  President                               May 2006 Press Releases
