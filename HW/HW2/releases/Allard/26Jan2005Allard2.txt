                                                                                                                                                                                                                   DoD  s Chemical Demilitarization Program          January 26th  2005   Mr  President  I rise today to discuss an issue of considerable importance to the people of Southeastern Colorado    For nearly 50 years the people of Southeastern Colorado have lived with the knowledge that within a few miles of their homes  schools  and places of business lies one of the largest stockpiles of chemical munitions in the world   The Pueblo Chemical Depot was built during World War II and continues to this day to serve as a ammunition and material storage facility   Since the mid 1990s  the primary mission of the depot has been to protect the 780 000 chemical weapons being stored there     As required by the Chemical Weapons Convention  the Department of Defense in 1997 launched on an aggressive program to dismantle the U S  chemical weapons stockpile   The program has since repeatedly stumbled and has not met the expectations of international community  Congress  and most importantly  the people who live near these stockpiles     The costs of the program have risen from  15 billion in 1997 to  24 billion in 2001  an increase of  9 billion in four years   Some have estimated that the program will cost as much as  30 billion by the time it is completed       The time schedule has experienced unconscionable delays   Last year  the clean up at Pueblo was expected to be completed by 2011   The Department  s latest budget decision has pushed date all the way back to 2021  nine years after the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty deadline     Numerous safety incidents have occurred at operational sites  shutting down one facility for nine months   Poor contracting has resulted in the shutting down of another facility  which is now costing the federal government  300 000 a day to keep operationally ready   It was hardly a surprise then when the President  s own management assessment last year labeled this program as being ineffective     On top of these numerous problems  the Department of Defense has failed to fully communicate its intentions to either Congress or the local community   Last week  for instance  Senator Salazar  my colleague from Colorado  and I met with two Department of Defense officials to discuss this program     At that meeting  we requested that the Defense Department answer some questions and were promised a written response from UnderSecretary of Defense Michael Wynne within three days    That meeting was held over a week ago and we have yet to receive a response     At least we in Congress can get a meeting   Members of the local community in Pueblo  Colorado have been trying to get an official from the Defense Department to meet with them to discuss the Pentagon  s plans for weeks   Despite the fact that the Defense Department is trying to unilaterally shut down the design work at Pueblo  the Pentagon has not taken the time to meet with the residents who  if the Pentagon gets its way  will be forced to live for another 15 years near an aging stockpile housing three quarters of a million chemical weapons   The latest and most frustrating Pentagon effort in this program is to study once again the possibility of transporting the 2 600 tons of mustard gas across the state of Colorado to an incineration site out of state   Nevermind that this option has been studied at least three times in the past decade    Nevermind that current law prohibits the transport of chemical munitions across state lines   And  nevermind that transporting these weapons out of state would violate the agreement the Defense Department made with people in Pueblo     This study is unnecessary and waste of taxpayers  hard earned dollars    I have already been told by Pentagon officials that the study is going to conclude that the transportation of chemical munitions across state lines is not practical   If that is the case  why do the study   Why waste  150 000 to study the feasibility of an option that is against the law and has already been determined by the Pentagon to be impractical   With the Department wasting money on meaningless studies  it  s no wonder that this program is over budget and behind schedule     I think it is time we took a stand against the Pentagon  s wasteful actions   Therefore  I am introducing legislation today that will stop this study and force the Department of Defense to recognize that the only option for destroying its chemical munitions is to build a disposal site in Pueblo      I am pleased to announce that my colleague from Colorado  Senator Ken Salazar  has agreed to cosponsor   The Senators from Kentucky  Senators Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning  are also original cosponsors   We should not forget that Senator McConnell  in particular  has been fighting the Department on this issue for over a decade   In many respects  Senator McConnell  s hard work has paved the way for the legislation I am introducing today    I urge my other colleagues to join us in putting the Department on notice that this kind of wasteful  meaningless efforts will not be tolerated     Mr  President  I believe it is time that the Pentagon took a good long look at its chemical demilitarization program    Our country cannot afford to throw away our scarce defense dollars into a program that continues to be so incredibly mis managed     Nor should our nation  s diplomats be put in the position of having to explain why we can  t meet our treaty obligations to the likes of China  Iran  or France    Most importantly  we cannot forget that thousands of innocent Americans continue to live near these sites   They bear the burden of the Pentagon  s mis management   It is not fair to them when all they have asked for is that these munitions to be cleaned up in a manner that is safe and does not harm the environment   Thank you  Mr  President   I yield the floor                                             January 2005 Press Releases
