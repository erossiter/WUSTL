                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ALLARD SECURES FUNDING FOR SOUTHERN COLORADO PROJECTS IN FINAL DOD APPROPRIATIONS BILL Pueblo Depot  Fort Carson  NORTHCOM and Air Force Academy Receive Funding         September 29th  2006   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Sen    R Colo   praised Senate passage of the final Department of Defense Appropriations Bill on Friday  Allard worked to secure funding for several southern Colorado projects in the bill through his work on the Senate Appropriations Committee     We did extremely well this year is getting funding for a number of high priority projects in Colorado     said Allard    The amount of funding Colorado receives in this bill reflects the importance of our military installations and the role that our state plays in our national security      Allard helped secure  219 million in research and development funding for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives program  Of this funding   87 million was allocated for the Pueblo Chemical Agent Destruction Pilot Plant and  85 million was allocated for the Blue Grass Chemical Agent Destruction Pilot Plant  This funding will help complete the design of the Pueblo chemical demilitarization facility  reduce risk and prepare the site for construction     Over the last year  the Defense Department has made every effort to try to get the project back on track     said Allard    It was time for Congress to step up to the plate and provide the necessary funding  I am very pleased we were able to keep this funding level from the Pueblo Depot in the bill      The bill provides  20 million for compatible use buffer zone projects like the one at Fort Carson  which is one of the largest and most successful projects in the country  The use of conservation easements and land leases enable military installations to guard against encroachment while protecting the environment and honoring property rights     The buffer zone project at Fort Carson has been a tremendous success  By utilizing conservation easements and land leases  we have stopped urban encroachment in its tracks     said Allard    This buffer zone will permit Fort Carson to continue its vital training missions uninterrupted and unimpeded while preserving open space for future generations      The Missile Defense Agency  s Joint National Integration Center  JNIC   based at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs  will receive more than  8 million in the bill  The JNIC is the Defense Department  s premier site for missile defense command and control  missile defense modeling and simulation functions     As evidenced by the recent North Korean ballistic missile tests  the threat of a missile attack to our country  our allies and our troops deployed overseas is very alive and very real     Allard said    The Colorado National Guard at the JNIC are on the front line defending our country against this form of attack every day      Allard also included  5 5 million for the Air Force Academy for a new four meter telescope and  500 000 for the Center for Space and Defense Studies at the Air Force Academy  which was created last year     Space is the future  and we need to make sure we have smart  qualified space professionals who understand the policy making process and can make decisions that are in the best interests of our nation     said Senator Allard    This new Center will be critical in that effort       In addition  Allard also provided  1 9 million for a joint partnership with the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs  UCCS  and USNORTHCOM to offer the nation  s first federally funded PhD program in Homeland Defense        This is an incredible opportunity for the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and their partners at U S  Northern Command     said Allard    The Department of Defense has an essential requirement for doctoral level Homeland Defense research and Congress has clearly recognized the need      Allard also secured  1 1 million for the Partnership in Innovative Preparation for Educators and Students  PIPES   The PIPES program provides joint student and teacher training in science  technology  engineering and mathematics  The Colorado Springs community  with its strong presence in the space industry and key military partners  will be the initial test bed for the PIPES program     There is a growing body of evidence that points to a shortage of scientists  engineers and workers in technology industries     stated Allard     It is clearly a crisis situation and I am glad that UCCS recognizes this need  especially with the demand the space industry places on these disciplines      The Defense Appropriations Bill conference report will now be sent to the president for his signature                              September 2006 Press Releases
