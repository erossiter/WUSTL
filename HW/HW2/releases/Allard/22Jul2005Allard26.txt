                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Op Ed  Colorado to Get a Bonus from CAFTA by  U S  Senator          July 22nd  2005   The U S  House of Representatives is poised to vote this week on the U S  Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade agreement  which the Senate approved June 30 by a vote of 55 to 45  Coloradoans should all be rooting for it to pass the House as well  In addition to being a great economic package for both the United States and the nations of Central America  it will be a boon to Colorado  s agriculture and high tech industries   How will CAFTA impact the Colorado economy  Immediately and on a significant scale  The minute the accord is signed  tariffs on 80 percent of U S  exports will disappear  all tariffs will be eliminated within 10 years  This includes the up to 15 percent tariffs on Colorado  s exports of machinery  manufactured products and transportation equipment  Our information technology producers will also gain from the elimination of distribution barriers and information technology tariffs  as well as the opening up of these new markets to key information technology services  including telecommunications  In addition  CAFTA will provide greater protections to intellectual property rights    For Colorado  s farmers and ranchers  CAFTA will eliminate tariffs on 50 percent of U S  exports immediately  Most remaining duties will disappear within 15 years   Beef and pork producers will see an immediate elimination of tariffs on their products  the amount of dairy products we will be allowed to export to these countries will increase to 10 000 tons in the first year of the accord  and tariffs on dairy exports that exceed the limit will be eliminated over a period of 20 years  Finally  corn  wheat and grain producers win with the immediate setting of zero of tariffs on wheat  barley  oats and rye  as well as on corn to Costa Rica and sorghum to the Dominican Republic and Guatemala  Any remaining tariffs on feed grains will be eliminated over 15 years   Clearly this agreement greatly benefits Colorado and the nation as a whole  The countries participating in CAFTA are among the developing countries that already enjoy duty free access to the U S  market for the majority of their exports  although they now maintain high tariff and non tariff barriers to U S  exports  and impose restrictions on U S  businesses  The agreement will liberalize trade and abolish those trade barriers that impede our exports  as well as address significant labor and environmental issues    Trade between the United States and the CAFTA countries totaled more than  33 billion last year alone  The United States exported almost  16 billion in goods to the five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic in 2004  more than all exports to Russia  India and Saudi Arabia combined   This agreement will create the second largest U S  export market in Latin America   16 billion   behind only Mexico  and the 14th largest U S  export market in the world  The market access and trade disciplines provided by CAFTA offer an opportunity to expand U S  exports to a region that is already seeing high export growth rates    CAFTA is just one component in the United States   drive to gain access to overseas markets  In 2002  the Bush administration completed free trade agreement negotiations with Chile and Singapore that had been started by the Clinton administration in 2000  These trade pacts entered into force on January 1  2004   In 2004  agreements with Australia and Morocco were signed and approved by Congress  and the Australia agreement came into force this January  These agreements have made a strong statement about this country  s commitment to international trade  and CAFTA continues the trend of reaching bilateral trade agreements in our own hemisphere   I have always said that even if we were to set aside all of the economic benefits for continuing liberalization of international trade  there are other convincing reasons for adopting CAFTA  most notably humanitarian reasons   History has shown that isolated  closed societies are the most brutal and repressive  International contact brought about by free trade serves to increase access to a higher standard of living and a better quality of life    Democracy has been and remains America  s number one export  While CAFTA will provide new economic opportunities for America  the agreement will serve also to nurture democracy in a region  right on our doorstep  which only a few short years ago was defined by tyranny and internal strife         is
