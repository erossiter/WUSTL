                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT  The importance of Renewable Engergy          March 8th  2006    Mr  ALLARD   Mr  President  I would like to take a few minutes to comment on the trip that President Bush recently made to my home state of Colorado    The President visited several sites that are involved with furthering renewable energy   One of those sites included the National Renewable Energy Laboratory  or NREL as it is often called  in Golden  Colorado   Due to previous commitments I was unable to join the President during his trip  but I want to thank him for visiting there  and than him for the commitments he has made to the lab  and to renewable energy   NREL is on the cutting edge in bringing renewable energy technologies out of the laboratory and into the mainstream of American business and society   Although America has rivals in many Asian and European nations in investing in the development of these technologies  NREL deserves credit for many wonderful accomplishments     In recognition of these accomplishments  I have  during my tenure in Congress  led a coalition to push for sufficient funding for both the Department of Energy  s renewables budget and NREL   Earmarks have created problems for our national laboratories throughout the United States   The President has addressed the problem  and I am working to prevent this in the future   The environmental benefits of renewable energy are well noted and widely praised   Not only are renewable sources of energy beneficial to our national security  but they reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease demands for other energy resources   Wind  solar  geothermal  biomass  photovoltaic and other renewable energies have few if any harmful by products   It is simply good policy to do all we can to effectively harness and utilize the natural  clean  re usable sources of energy that are abundant all around us   However we should also be looking at energy efficient technologies   There is a saying that energy saved is like extra energy made   I think that it is important that we continue investing in research and development of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies   Further developing these technologies is a win win solution in every sense   Jobs are created  taxpayer money is saved  our national security is enhanced and the environment is protected   For example  a hog farm near Lamar  Colorado  is seeing both economic and environmental benefits from converting to a renewable energy source that they have in abundance   The farm has built with an anaerobic digester  which is fueled by hog waste  and uses its methane as a fuel to supply power to the farm operations   An example of how increased efficiency saves money  comes from Harmony Library in Fort Collins  Colorado   The library is considered to be a showcase for state of the art  energy efficient technologies and building design  They are projected to use about 40 percent less energy than a comparable new building in Fort Collins   They estimate that this will save nearly  12 000 in annual operation costs   The library will be able to use these savings to increase stock and provide additional library services   Renewable and efficient technologies are an important part of a balanced domestic energy portfolio  and our energy future and national security will be enriched by the technologies being developed and perfected today   We must maintain our commitment to funding the research and development that will bring those technologies to the market   The future of our security and prosperity depends on the commitments we make today   I would also like to remind my colleagues of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus  within the Senate   The Caucus works to keep Members informed about issues important to the renewables and efficiency communities   We currently have 36 members  but we  d like to have more   I also want to thank the President again for his sincere interest in solar and biofuels   The visit to NREL by President Bush and his staff is appreciated by those of us who have been advocating a role in our energy policy for renewable energy   I will continue to work with the Administration and my colleagues on the issues facing renewable energy resources                              March 2006 Press Releases
