                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT  Confirmation of Jim Nussle to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget          September 4th  2007   Mr  President   I rise today to speak in support of Congressman Jim Nussle  the President  s nominee to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  OMB   I am pleased that the President chose someone with such an extensive knowledge of the federal budget process to succeed the very able Director Rob Portman   I had the pleasure of serving under Congressman Nussle  s leadership when he was Chairman of the House Budget Committee  There  I witnessed first hand his expertise in the budget process  As Chairman of the House Budget Committee  Congressman Nussle worked effectively with fellow House members  Senators  and the President to shape the federal budget  much like he will be required to do if confirmed as Director of OMB   Moreover  throughout his service in Congress  Congressman Nussle demonstrated a firm commitment to fiscal responsibility  Restoring and maintaining fiscal discipline  starting with this year  s appropriations process   is essential to keeping our economy strong and growing   The fact is  today  s economy is strong  More than eight million jobs have been created since August of 2003  unemployment is at historical lows  and paychecks are rising   One of the reasons we are enjoying a strong economy today is because the Republican Congress and the President created conditions for individuals and small businesses to thrive  These pro growth economic policies include reducing income tax rates  reducing capital gains and dividend tax rates  reducing the estate and gift tax  and increasing incentives for small business investment   The economic growth stimulated by these policies has not only led to more money in the pockets of the American people  it has led to increased federal revenue and reduced deficits  Since 2003  revenues have rebounded sharply following several years of decline  Last year  revenues were up almost 12 percent to  2 4 trillion  the highest in our Nation  s history  As a result  we cut the budget deficit in half several years ahead of schedule and put ourselves on a path toward balancing the budget   In addition to its well known budgetary function  the Office of Management and Budget is also charged with an equally important  albeit lesser known  management responsibility  President Bush  with initiatives like the President  s Management Agenda and the Program Assessment Rating Tool  PART   has given OMB and the Congress the management tools they need as overseers of a large  complex  and sometimes cumbersome bureaucracy    OMB  s management tools are critical to Congress  s ability to hold agencies and programs accountable and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely  Congressman Nussle has assured me that he will give due deference to the   M     which stands for management  in OMB   In conclusion  Congressman Nussle is a highly qualified nominee who is deserving of Senate confirmation  I am pleased that the Budget Committee favorably reported Congressman Nussle with broad  bipartisan support    I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of his confirmation today                              September 2007 Press Releases
