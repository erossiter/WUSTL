                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Judicial Confirmation Process and The Filibuster          April 22nd  2005   Mr  ALLARD   Mr  President  I rise this morning to clear up the apparent confusion and misinformation surrounding the confirmation of judicial nominations  I hope to shed some light on one of our most important obligations and express to the American people the truth about the partisan obstruction of our constitutional duties   Article II of the Constitution  known as the advice and consent clause  requires Senate approval of judicial nominations   This obligation is only fulfilled when the Senate allows an up or down vote on a nominee   The vote acts as an expression of the body s  advice and consent   but this expression cannot occur if it is blocked by a filibuster   I strongly believe that the use of a filibuster to block judicial nominations is not only unprecedented minority obstruction  but an attack on the Constitution itself     The decision to vote on a judicial nomination or to obstruct the nominee pits the Constitution against a mere tool of parliamentary procedure   the Constitution versus a Senate rule called the filibuster   I urge my colleagues to put our faith in the founding document  not a filibuster rule   To do otherwise degrades the Constitution and relegates it to the level of an arbitrary rule of procedure   Let me make it clear   I will not stand idly by as parliamentary maneuvers run rough shod over the Constitution and centuries of Senate practices    The Republican majority is not establishing new precedent   we are simply trying to restore the rights of the Constitution and the practices that this body has observed for over 200 years   If the Senate allows the filibusters of judicial nominations to continue  it will be acquiescing in a minority s   a minority s   unilateral change to Senate procedure and practices  requiring 60 votes for the confirmation of judges through the rules  undermining the Constitution s requirement for a 50 vote majority   The practical effect is an amendment to the constitution without the approval of the American people   My colleagues on the other side would have everyone believe that the filibuster is being eliminated  But that simply is not the case   They don t mention that the filibuster never existed on judicial nominations   In fact  it never existed until the Democrats broke with over 200 years of Senate procedure and unleashed the filibuster last Congress to block 10 judges   For the first time in the history of the Senate   Instead the Democrats want to have it both ways   they want to change the history of the United States Senate by blocking judges with the filibuster  rewrite the Constitution by using the filibuster to thwart the advice and consent clause  and then blame Republicans for simply saying   lets follow the Constitution and allow votes on judges  lets follow Senate tradition    They falsely portray our actions to preserve the advice and consent clause as something akin to minority persecution    But what they don t mention is that the filibuster is not a law  It is not in the Constitution   In fact  the founding fathers didn t even envision a filibuster weapon at all   Even more astonishing is the fact that several of the Democrats who are now ardent supporters of the judicial filibuster are the same ones who tried to eliminate the filibuster entirely just a few years ago   not only on judicial nominations but on everything   It is the Democrats who are altering history   It is the Democrats who are unleashing a weapon that threatens to alter the traditions and precedent of the Senate   It is the Democrats who are revising the history of our founding and undermining the three branches of our separate but equal system of government    For example  From 1789 until 1806 the Senate had a traditional  motion for the previous question  in its rules   there was no intention to create a Senate where a filibuster was prominent   The filibuster was not used in any significant way at all until the 1840 s  and it was never used for judicial nominations   The Senate s original cloture rule  in 1917  did not even apply to nominations because no Senator had ever used a filibuster to block a nomination  Let me repeat that   up until 1917 the Senate s original cloture rule didn t even apply to nominations because no Senator had ever used a filibuster to block a nomination  The rule did not apply   not because the Senate approved of such filibusters  but because Senators never contemplated them  A thorough examination of Senate history clearly demonstrates that there is no precedent for the Democrat s use of the filibuster to permanently block the confirmation of judicial nominations   Some Democrats claim that Republicans want to destroy the filibuster for all matters   This is simply not true   What is true is that the only sitting members of the Senate on record supporting the elimination of the filibuster are Democrats   In 1995  19 Senators   all Democrats  not one Republican   voted to eliminate the filibuster for all matters   Nine of the nineteen Democrats who voted for the Harkin Lieberman rule change remain in this body today   And all of those Senators now support the filibustering of judicial nominations   If it was ok to end the filibuster rule in 1995  why is it not ok today       Let me just share with you some of the comments made by those Democratic Senators in 1995   For too long  we have accepted the premise that the filibuster rule is immune   Yet  Mr  President  there is no constitutional basis for it   We impose it on ourselves   And if I may say so respectfully  it is  in its way  inconsistent with the Constitution  one might almost say an amendment of the Constitution by the rules of the U S  Senate    The Democrats also said     A  filibuster ought to be used to slow down  temper legislation  alert the public  change minds  but should not be used as a measure whereby a small minority can totally keep the majority from voting on the merits of a bill   Ten years later  evidently what s good for the goose can forget about the gander   Turning to the issue of Senate rules  the Democrats claim that changing the rules of the Senate is unprecedented  that using the Constitution to end the filibuster is tyranny   Again  let me point out another instance where the goose has left the gander   The constitutional option is grounded in Article I  Section 5 of the U S  Constitution that empowers the Senate to  determine the Rules of its Proceedings      The Senate has repeatedly exercised the constitutional option to define minority rights  as long ago as 1977  and it has done so in a Democratic led majority  The use of a simple majority vote to set precedents is as old as the Senate   In fact  the constitutional option has been exercised in 1977  1979  1980  and 1987   It was used in 1977 to end post cloture filibusters  in 1979 to limit amendments to appropriations bills  in 1980 to govern consideration of nominations  and  again in 1987 to govern voting procedures   In every instance  the Senate acted independently of the Senate rules in order to change Senate procedures in the face of obstruction or abuse by a minority of Senators   History clearly shows that it is the constitutional option that has been used before   it is the use of the filibuster that is an unprecedented expansion of minority obstruction    An exercise of the constitutional option under the current circumstances would return the Senate to the historic and constitutional confirmation standard of a simple majority for all judicial nominations  Employing the constitutional option here would have no effect on the legislative filibuster   Senators would still have the ability to filibuster any bill  any time     The Constitution calls upon the Senate collectively to determine whether or not a particular nominee is qualified to serve   This determination is made in one vote   the approval or disapproval of the nomination itself   Advice and consent does not mean avoiding a vote on a judicial nominee entirely by employing a filibuster   If a member of the Senate disapproves of a judge then let them vote against the nominee   But a filibuster should never be used to deprive the people of the choice selected by their elected representatives   It is the Senate s duty to collectively participate in a show of  advice and consent  to the President by voting   It is this act that exercises what James Madison referred to as the remote choice of the people    I sincerely hope we can work through the impasse on judicial nominations   I hope those opposed to the President s nominees will be given the opportunity to vote against them and that they will speak their mind about it   But I also hope that we will be allowed to provide the guidance we are required to provide under the Constitution    The basic decision the Senate must make is this  Either constitutional advice and consent prevails or the filibuster is allowed to change the Constitution   I believe in the Constitution   I believe we should vote on the nominations   As I have said so many times before   vote em up  or vote em down  but just vote                               April 2005 Press Releases
