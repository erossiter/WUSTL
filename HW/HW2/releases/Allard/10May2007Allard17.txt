          SENATORS ALLARD  BROWN AND JOHNSON INTRODUCE NEW ILC LEGISLATION          May 10th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators   R Colo    Sherrod Brown  D Ohio  and Tim Johnson  D S D    members of the Senate Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee  today unveiled the   which will restore the separation of banking and commerce by preventing additional commercial firms from acquiring or establishing industrial loan companies  ILC      I am pleased that we are moving forward with a bill to restore the firewall between commerce and banking  and I am hopeful that it will be quickly enacted     said Senator Allard    Congress has made it clear a number of times that we do not support the mixture of banking and commerce     said Allard    As a member of the Senate Banking Committee when the Gramm Leach Bliley bill was adopted  the committee had a spirited debate regarding banking and commerce  In the end  we determined that banking and commerce should not mix  which we spelled out by closing the unitary thrift loophole  Since that time  Congress has continued to deliver a loud message on this point     added Allard    When the financial regulators proposed to allow banks to engage in real estate management and brokerage  hundreds of members of Congress joined in support of bills to prevent the mixture of banking and commerce via real estate  I have been proud to lead the effort in the Senate   This prohibition has been enacted by Congress in appropriations bills each year since that time        One of the hallmarks of the American economy  particularly over the last three quarters of a century  has been the separation maintained between banking and commerce     Senator Brown said    Industrial loan company assets have skyrocketed over the last twenty years  and many more firms are poised to drive their trucks through the ILC loophole should the current moratorium on applications expire  Once again  it is time for Congress to act to restore the separation between banking and commerce  Once again we need to amend our laws to ensure that federal regulators have sufficient supervisory authority to ensure the safety and soundness of our banking system  And once again we must act to ensure that everyone abides by the same rules        I am pleased to join with my colleagues in the introduction of a bill which will finally bring the discussion of this critical issue to the Senate     Senator Johnson said    It is imperative that the Senate closely examines the overall supervisory and regulatory structure of industrial loan companies and the policy implications of commercial companies owning these charters   I recognized the importance of maintaining the separation between banking and commerce during the Gramm Leach Bliley debate  and Representatives Jim Leach  R IA  and Steve Largent  R OK  and I succeeded in passing an amendment to close the unitary thrift loophole  It is also my hope that the Senate Banking Committee will echo the efforts of Chairman Barney Frank  D MA  and Rep  Paul Gillmor  R OH  and hold hearings to generate a thorough and meaningful debate and address unresolved details   My colleagues in the House produced a bipartisan and non controversial bill  I expect our bill to generate similar interest and support in the Senate       Due to a special exemption in the Bank Holding Company Act  any type of company  including a commercial or retail firm  may own an ILC  More and more companies have been seeking to acquire or charter ILCs  and aggregate assets have grown from  4 billion to more than  150 billion over the past two decades  Several commercial firms are poised to take advantage of the ILC loophole  including Home Depot and Sears   A fundamental principle of the U S  banking system has been the separation of banking and commercial operations  ILCs represent a breach in the wall between commerce and banking  raising concerns among regulators and legislators that weakness in a commercial parent company could undermine an ILC subsidiary   Given the rapid growth in ILC assets and increasing commercial interest  the FDIC placed a 6 month moratorium on new ILC applications last July   FDIC Chair Sheila Bair extended the moratorium until January 31  2008 to permit time for both the FDIC to look at the issue and Congress to act   The Industrial Bank Holding Company Act  which is a companion bill to the Gillmor Frank legislation  H R 698   would prevent commercial firms from acquiring or establishing an ILC in the future  Existing ILCs would be grandfathered  but could not be acquired by a commercial firm  Under the legislation  all ILC holding companies would be subject to federal supervision and regulation   The Senators were joined today by Michael J  Wilson

in Franklin  West Virginia  and Thomas F  Wenning  Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the National Grocers Association  NAG                               May 2007 Press Releases
