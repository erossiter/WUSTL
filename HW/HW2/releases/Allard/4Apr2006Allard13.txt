                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on Allard s Terrorist Visa Amendment          April 4th  2006   Mr  President   I rise today to share with you and our colleagues six words that I believe will be as surprising to you as they were to me  They are     ADVOCACY OF TERRORISM NOT ALWAYS EXCLUSIONARY     I repeat     ADVOCACY OF TERRORISM NOT ALWAYS EXCLUSIONARY     Am I reading from a terrorist handbook    No   Am I reading from United States law passed by this Congress    Most certainly not   Am I reading from a how to book on exploiting loopholes in the U S  visa system    I may as well be   Colleagues  believe it or not  I am reading from our very own Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual  The same Foreign Affairs Manual issued to the Department  s 25 000 employees located in more than 250 posts or missions worldwide    Even more alarmingly  this is from the chapter that instructs our consular officers to whom visas should be issued  Visas are  of course  the ticket that foreigners  including terrorists  need to enter the United States   This instruction says to the consular officer deciding whether or not to issue a visa that they need not deny a visa to an individual who advocates terrorism  I  for one  cannot imagine a more pertinent ground for denial  If advocacy of terrorism is not grounds for exclusion  I don  t know what is   Not only am I concerned about the message this sends to our dedicated consular officers  I am just as concerned about the message this sends to terrorists  It says to them  feel free to lay the groundwork for an attack at home  apply for a visa  and come to America to finish the job  This is not the message that the United States should be conveying to terrorists   This Congress has already passed important legislation denying visas to terrorists  including in the PATRIOT and REAL ID Acts  The REAL ID Act  signed into law on May 11  2005  specifically states that one who   endorses or espouses terrorist activity    is inadmissible    The real REAL ID Act became public law on May 11 of last year  eight days after publication of this manual  Yet  today  more than ten months later  the State Department is still instructing its consular officers that advocacy of terrorism may not be a ground for exclusion   Clearly  the State Department needs to be sent a message that we  in Congress  are serious about securing our borders  And particularly serious about preventing known advocates of terrorism  people who are most likely to wish harm to our country  from entering into the United States    Admittance to the United States is a privilege  not a right  My amendment says  if you advocate terrorism  you lose the privilege of coming to the United States   Recognizing the special circumstances under which someone who meets these criteria may nonetheless need to be admitted  my amendment does nothing to change the authority of the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security  in consultation with Attorney General  to waive an individuals inadmissibility when they deem it in the interest of the United States   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this legislation that slams the door shut in the face of advocates of terrorism who seek to cross the borders into our country   I call for the yeas and nays                              April 2006 Press Releases
