Many years ago  immense tectonic forces shaped Rocky Mountain National Park  eventually creating one of the most beautiful places on earth   The Park  s diverse geography and wildlife have provided a

most precious resource  water  Our children  grandchildren and great grandchildren can now be assured that they will have the opportunity to discover one of our true national treasures      Senator Ken Salazar    Rocky Mountain National Park is one of Colorado  s signature places  from the grandeur of Long  s Peak to the crystal clear waters of the Big Thompson River it is a place where Coloradans and Americans can experience our state in its purest form   This bill represents what is best about Colorado  it is bipartisan  it protects the water rights we all hold dear and it ensures the Park remains unspoiled for future generations   I am proud to sponsor it      Congressman Mark Udall  CO 2    For 8 years  I have worked on legislation to designation Rocky Mountain National Park as wilderness   Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the nation s most visited parks and possesses some of the most pristine and striking alpine ecosystems and natural landscapes in the continental United States   This bill constitutes a fair and complete proposal that reflects the legitimate needs of the public   Protecting the existing wilderness values of Rocky Mountain National Park will be good for the park and good for Colorado s economy   It deserves support by the entire Colorado delegation and approval by Congress      Congressman Mark Udall is a member of the House Natural Resources Committee    Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave  CO 4    I ve always supported Wilderness designation as long as it went through a thorough process and all interested parties had a part in the discussion   Sen  Allard and I worked together last year to lay down a bench mark to protect farmers in Larimer and Weld counties that rely on the Grand Ditch   This was a top priority for me and I am pleased we found an agreement with Sen  Salazar and Rep  Udall in which both family farms and the park s backcountry could be protected   Compromise is about give and take  and our bill just shows what can be accomplished for Colorado when lawmakers work through their differences     According to Section 2 c  in the 1964 Wilderness Act  the definition of Wilderness is an    area of undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence  without permanent improvements or human habitation  which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions and which  1  generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature  with the imprint of man s work substantially unnoticeable   2  has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation   3  has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition  and  4  may also contain ecological  geological  or other features of scientific  educational  scenic  or historical value                                 May 2007 Press Releases
