          HEARING TESTIMONY on S  1106 A bill to provide a cost sharing requirement for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Couduit in the State of Colorado     Subcommittee on Water and Power  U S  Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources         September 21st  2006   WASHINGTON  D C      Madam Chairman  today Colorado is experiencing the fifth year of unprecedented drought  This drought is a strong reminder that water is indeed our most precious natural resource  This is true most especially in rural Colorado  In Southeastern Colorado  home of the Arkansas River  it is difficult to find clean  inexpensive water that can meet the ever increasing federal water standards     It is for this reason that I  along with my colleague Senator Salazar  introduced S  1106  Identical legislation has been introduced by Congresswoman Musgrave in the House of Representatives  S  1106 will ensure the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit  which is envisioned as a pipeline that will provide the small  financially strapped towns and water agencies along the lower Arkansas River with safe  clean  affordable water  By creating an 80 percent federal    20 percent local cost share formula to help offset the construction costs of the Conduit  this legislation will protect the future of Southeastern Colorado  s drinking water supplies  and prevent further economic hardship      It is extremely important to note that the Arkansas Valley Conduit was originally authorized by Congress in 1962  over forty years ago  as a part of the Fryingpan Arkansas Project  The original Fry Ark Project authorizing legislation grants the Secretary of the Interior the authority to construct the Arkansas Valley Conduit  Our legislation simply reauthorizes that authority and adds a cost share provision   Due to the authorizing statute  s lack of a cost share provision  and Southeastern Colorado s depressed economic status  the Conduit was never built  And  until recently  there was no urgent need for it   the region was fortunate to enjoy an economical and safe alternative to pipeline transportation of project water  the Arkansas River  Unfortunately  this is no longer the case  While the federal government has continued to strengthen its unfunded water quality standards  these communities have fallen further and further behind in attaining them  As far back as 1950  the Bureau of Reclamation determined that the quality of local drinking water supplies were  unacceptable   House Document Numbered 187  Eighty third Congress           In response to a number of water providers falling out of compliance with existing EPA water quality standards  the local communities formed a committee to evaluate alternative approaches to solving this problem  The committee ultimately hired an independent engineering firm to evaluate two competing options  constructing a series of treatment facilities and constructing the Arkansas Valley Conduit  That evaluation resulted in the recommendation to construct the Conduit     The engineers concluded that local communities are unable to fund either solution under existing circumstances  The long term costs of operating individual water treatment facilities  including potential new federal standards and the cost of disposal of treatment facility waste  remove treatment as a viable long term solution  The fixed long term costs of the Conduit contributed to the engineers recommending this solution  In other words  the communities may be too poor not to spend the millions of dollars they would have to spend  in partnership with the federal government  to build the Arkansas Valley Conduit   When you weigh the promise of the Conduit versus the fate of building new individual water treatment facilities  it is clear that the conduit is the best choice of action  S  1106 is essential if we are to bring local water providers into compliance with federal water quality standards and it will finally provide a long term solution to the region s water quality concerns     The Arkansas Valley Conduit will deliver fresh  clean water to dozens of valley communities and thousands of people along the river  To be exact  the Conduit will supply 16 cities and 25 water agencies in Bent  Crowley  Kiowa  Prowers  Pueblo and Otero counties with water when completed  The largest city served by the Conduit is La Junta  Colorado  population nearly 12 000   At this time  if the members would direct their attention to the maps  they will see exactly where the Conduit  s beneficiaries are situated  One of the most stunning facts that I would like to point out is that the Conduit will serve an area slightly larger than the state of New Hampshire      As I mentioned  the local sponsors of the project have completed an independently funded feasibility study of the Conduit  and have developed a coalition of support from water users in Southeastern Colorado  I am also pleased that the State of Colorado has contributed a great deal of funding for the study through the Colorado Water Conservation Board  These local stakeholders continue to explore options for financing their share of the costs  and are working hard to complete the final details surrounding the organization that will oversee the Conduit project      Now I would like to turn my attention to the Bureau of Reclamation and some of the questions they have raised pertaining to the legislation  I first want to make it clear that the purpose of the legislation is to provide an 80 percent federal    20 percent local cost share formula for the costs of construction  The local beneficiaries are to be 100 percent responsible for operation and maintenance  If the Bureau of Reclamation believes that the language of S  1106 does not reflect this commitment  I am prepared to make such changes as the Bureau believes are necessary to ensure local payment of O   M                 I also understand that the Bureau of Reclamation is concerned about the cost of the project in light of their current project back log  As a member of the United States Senate Appropriations Committee  you have my full commitment that  if the cost share language is approved  I will work tirelessly on behalf of this project to make sure that it does not impact other important Reclamation projects  This project was authorized 40 years ago  If the money is not spent now  it will be spent later as communities seek federal grants to fund their projects individually instead of using a system wide conduit approach     The Bureau of Reclamation is also concerned that the cost share legislation will create a new precedent and that it opposes changes to the Bureau  s standard 100 percent repayment policy  I realize that my legislation is a change to standard policy   indeed that is the very purpose of the legislation  However  there are a number of other authorized projects that legislatively change the standard repayment policy  Therefore  the Arkansas Valley Conduit cost share would not set a precedent   the precedent has already been made       With the help of my colleagues  the promise made by Congress forty years ago to the people of Southeastern Colorado  will finally become a reality       Madam Chairman  thank you for your leadership and for holding this hearing today
