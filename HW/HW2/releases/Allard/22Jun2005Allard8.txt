                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Floor Statement on the Energy Bill          June 22nd  2005   Mr  President  I rise today to speak about the energy bill which we are considering on the floor today   I am grateful to the Majority and Minority Leader  and to the leaders of the Energy Committee  for bringing this legislation to the floor   I want to especially commend Senator Domenici  Chairman of the Energy Committee  for his leadership on this bill   He has worked tirelessly on this important legislation and our nation owes him a great deal of appreciation for his persistence   Ongoing events    here in the US and around the world   are daily reminders of how desperately our country needs a sound energy policy   One only has to pick up a newspaper or listen to the nightly news to know that our national security is one of the most important issues we are currently facing   And one only has to receive their monthly electric bill or drive past a gas station to know that our energy markets are in need of certainty and stability   This is the third Congress during which we have tried to pass an energy bill  and I say it  s time to get it done   I would like to first speak about oil shale  a promising fuel source found in abundance in the Rocky Mountains   The oil shale in this region produces a very light crude  suitable to fill needs for jet fuel and other very pure fuels   During the last several years a handful of companies have worked to develop technologies that will allow for economically and environmentally feasible development of this resource   Some of the oil shale resource lies under private lands  but much of it   certainly the richest deposit   is under federal lands   This area  now under the purview of BLM  was formerly known as the Naval Oil Shale Reserve   I would remind my colleagues that  when my former colleague Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado  authored the legislation to transfer the Naval Oil Shale lands into the keeping of BLM  the legislation specified that the resource remain available for development   Congress recognized that BLM was in a better position to manage publicly owned lands than was the Department of Energy  but we never intended to place the development of the resources in this area off limits   The energy legislation we are considering here allows for small scale demonstration projects    But I am also working with my colleagues Senator Hatch and Senator Bennett on provisions that will help lead to commercialization after the demonstration projects have proven themselves   It is bad business practice to pour millions of dollars into research and development projects with no hint of assurance those projects will lead to commercialization   I believe it is important to give companies that are investing tens of millions of dollars into these research projects a proverbial   light at the end of the tunnel        As a founder and co chairman of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus I am also supportive of incentives that are included in the legislation to continue moving the country  s use of renewable resources forward   Technological advancements in solar  wind  geothermal  biomass  fuel cells and hydro have made great strides   And increases in technology have led to decreases in price   Government has played an important role in the research that will help us reach our renewable technology goals  and we should continue to further those goals   The input and investments of the federal government have been vital in furthering industry and private sector involvement in the renewable field   The National Renewable Energy Laboratory  often called NREL  in Colorado has made an incredible contribution  and has played a very important part in current technological advancements   The technologies being developed at NREL   whether providing alternative fuels and power  or making our homes and vehicles more energy efficient   are vital to our nation  s energy progress   We must continue to provide incentives for the implementation of renewables use and for the infrastructure necessary to support these renewable sources   These technologies are a necessary step in balancing our domestic energy portfolio  increasing our nation  s energy security and advancing our country  s technological excellence  and I believe this bill takes an important step in that direction   It is my hope that Congress passes an energy bill this year   I think that we will be making a huge step in that direction when the Senate passes this bill   In closing I would like to extend my thanks and admiration to Senators Domenici and Bingaman  and their staff  for the long hours and extreme dedication that they have given to this matter   I must say that I believe that this is the best energy bill we have produced in a number of years  and I know that there are many throughout the country    and even on the other side of the Hill    that agree with me   The President is ready to sign an energy bill and I am hopeful that we are able to give him one in the very near future                              June 2005 Press Releases
