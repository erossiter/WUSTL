                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on Troop Withdrawal          June 21st  2006   Mr  President  I rise today to offer to discuss the situation in Iraq and to ask several questions about the withdrawal proposals being offered by the other side      Why would we risk all that success by a premature withdrawal   Why would we risk handing over Iraq to the terrorists when they are on the run   Why would we send a message to the families who have had loved ones die fighting for freedom that it was all in vain   Why would we pass legislation that calls for the withdrawal of our troops that undermines everything we have achieved     These same questions are being asked by many of my constituents in Colorado   According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel  a key newspaper in Colorado  s Western Slope    President Bush and Congress are right not to set a date certain for moving all of the troops out of Iraq   That would signal terrorists they only need to hide out until the Americans leave  then reignite their attacks        And it would tell others that our commitment to freedom in the Middle East is limited      I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel be inserted into the record     The comments from this editorial have been echoed to me during my recent town meeting tour of Colorado  by family members who have lost love ones  and by the hundreds of troops at Fort Carson I met with recently from the 3rd ACR     Over the last three years  our nation has been locked in a terrible struggle against Saddam loyalists and foreign terrorists in Iraq   This fight is one that we did not anticipate    We have experienced significant challenges  particularly with regard to the threat by improvised explosive devices and car bombings   We have fought a terrible enemy that has no regard for human life and resorts to the most brutal of tactics including beheadings and mass killings of innocent civilians   The torture of prisoners at Abu Gahrib prison and alleged killing of Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha have also shown us that we must remain vigilant in protecting the human rights of all people       Yet  despite our challenges in Iraq  we have seen tremendous progress   President Bush  s strategy for winning the war in Iraq is working   His strategy rests on these pillars   political progress  economic growth  and improved security   In each of these areas  we have seen significant improvements  including the recent killing of Abu Zarqawi and the formation of an Iraqi government of national unity   Indeed  the killing of Zarqawi is a testament to the growing support our forces in Iraq are receiving from Iraqis   It was only because of tips we received from Iraqis that we were able to locate Zarqawi  s hideout and take him out     In fact  the level of cooperation and support that Coalition forces are receiving from the Iraqi people continues to have grown substantially in recent months    Three weeks ago  I meet with soldiers from the 3rd Armored Cavalry regiment  which had just returned from a second tour in Iraq   These soldiers told me that during their first tour in Iraq they received little if any support from the Iraqi people   In their second tour  these soldiers said that the situation had completely changed for the better      These soldiers spoke highly of the level of cooperation they received and the relationships that they were able to build with local Iraqi government officials   Relationships between the 3rd Armored Cavalry and the local community were so strong that the Iraqi Mayor of the City of Tall Afar actually traveled to Colorado Springs to present these soldiers with a proclamation from the city   I ask unanimous consent that the full copy of the proclamation be submitted for the record     Let me read a portion of the proclamation as written by the Najim Abdullah Al Jibouri  Iraqi Mayor of Tall Afar     To the Courageous Men and Women of the 3rd Armored Cavalry regiment  who have changed the city of Tall   Afar from a ghost town  in which terrorists spread death and destruction  to a secure city flourishing with life       Our city was the main base of operations for Abu Mousab Zarqawi   The city was completely held hostage in the hands of his henchman       Their savagery reached such a level that they stuffed the corpses of children with explosives and tossed them in to the streets in order to kill grieving parents      this was the situation of our city until God prepared and delivered unto them the courageous soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment  who liberated this city  ridding it of Zarqawi  s followers after harsh fighting      I had the opportunity to meet with Mayor Najim Abdullah Al Jibouri while he was in Colorado Springs  and he again conveyed to me his appreciation to our nation and to the soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment for freeing his city from the terrorists and for sacrificing so much so that his people might experience freedom                Mr  President  the Mayor of the City of Tall Afar was not the only one who thanked soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry for their service in Iraq   The Commander of Iraq  s 3rd Army Infantry Division  Major General Khorsheed Al Dosekey  wrote the following in a letter to our soldiers       Your abilities to plan  the excellent coordination  the overall supervising and the right decisive decisions along with your great leadership have helped us build up the individual soldier and increase his abilities   Your leadership and devotion to duty have helped form an army from the gathered people   Your behavior and your actions have built strong friendships that will last a life time       I ask unanimous consent that Major General Al Dosekey  s letter be included for the record     Mr  President  I commend the soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment for their service to the people of Iraq and for their willingness to return to that country for a second tour   I am proud of the men and women of our armed forces who continue to believe in their mission and are committed to achieving victory in Iraq     I know most if not all of the Members of this body share in their appreciation for the valiant service of our men and women in uniform   I was pleased when last night this body commended our soldiers by passing my Sense of the Congress amendment   This amendment commends the members of our armed forces for their outstanding service to our nation in Iraq and for their commitment to the highest ideals and values of our nation   It also honors the families of our service members who have given so much in the fight against terror    Our soldiers deserve our support and our trust    Mr  President  it is my firm belief that we need to stay the course in Iraq and in Afghanistan   We cannot give up the fight now   We cannot afford to surrender Iraq to the terrorists   As September 11th proved  the oceans cannot keep our country safe    And  we will not win the war against terrorism by surrendering  no matter how gradually  the field of battle   Rather  as President Bush stated in 2005    we do not create terrorism by fighting the terrorists   We invite terrorism by ignoring them        Our nation has a long history of persevering through adversity   We have a long history of triumphing over those who threaten our nation   We are a strong people that care about the values of freedom  justice  and the rule of law   We are on the side that will prevail in this fight but we must be strong   We cannot turn away from the threat of terrorism for there is no place to hide     The terrorists have attacked our nation before  and they will try again in the future if we do not stop them first   It is in our nation  s best interest to fight in Iraq because if we don  t  we will soon find ourselves fighting the war against terror here at home   I urge my colleagues to also not ignore the progress we have made in Iraq   I ask my colleagues to allow our military commanders and the Iraqi government to determine when it is the best time for our troops to come home   Let us not set arbitrary  politically driven deadlines for the withdrawal of American troops   Let us not become beholden to new requirements for phased withdrawals   Let us recognize that the withdrawal can only take place when our military objectives for providing security in Iraq have been met     Most importantly  let us not micro manage from Washington  and instead  allow our troops to go out and do their jobs     We must have confidence in our soldiers   We must have confidence in the Iraqi people       We should not forfeit our progress in Iraq to meet arbitrary deadlines whether they are in the short or in the long term   We should not think about giving up when our men and women in uniform have achieved so much   Such defeatism encourages the terrorists  undermines our efforts to persuade other nations to join us  and opens the door to attacks here at home   We must stand firm   We must stand strong     Thank you Mr  President for the opportunity to speak on this important issue   I yield the floor                                  June 2006 Press Releases
