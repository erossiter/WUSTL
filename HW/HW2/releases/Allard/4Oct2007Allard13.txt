          TESTIMONY   Hearing on Reauthorization on McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Programs House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity         October 4th  2007   First  I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member Capito for inviting me to testify at this hearing of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity concerning Reauthorization of the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act   Homeless people are our country  s most at risk population  and reauthorization of McKinney Vento is critical in addressing their needs   I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank my colleague from Rhode Island  Senator Jack Reed   I was privileged to share leadership of the Senate Subcommittee on Housing and Mass Transit with him for a number of years   The bill we are here today to discuss  the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act  is but one example of the common ground we found   I have always appreciated Senator Reed  s openness to working towards a thoughtful  bipartisan compromise on many issues   In 1987  Congress passed the Stewart B  McKinney Homeless Assistance Act  now known as the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance programs   The Act was the first comprehensive law addressing the diverse needs of the homeless  including programs at the Department of Health and Human Services  the Department of Education  the Department of Labor  the Department of Agriculture  and the Department of Housing and Urban Development   Until enactment of this law  the problems confronted by the homeless were mainly addressed at the state and local level   The McKinney Act represented a consensus that had developed where a major federal commitment was required in order to end homelessness   It also brought a comprehensive focus to homelessness  beyond that of simply providing shelter   Currently  the federal government devotes significant resources to the homeless   Yet despite the enormous federal resources directed towards homelessness  the problem persists   We need to bring more accountability to homeless assistance  increasing funding for successful programs and initiatives and replacing those that are ineffective   There seems to be consensus that the McKinney Vento Act has been an important tool to help some of society  s most vulnerable members  and that the first step should be reauthorization of the Act   I appreciate that you are holding this hearing to explore this issue   There also seems to be increasing consensus that the second step should be consolidation of the existing programs   I originally introduced consolidation legislation in 2000  and Senator Reed offered a proposal in 2002   HUD has also advocated for a consolidated program for several years now     While we differed in some of the details  including the funding distribution mechanism for a new program  these legislative proposals offered consensus on the important starting points of reauthorization and consolidation   We worked together to find the best elements of both bills  and after extensive discussions and outreach  Senator Reed and I introduced S 1518  the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act   Our bill will consolidate the existing programs at HUD into the new Community Homeless Assistance Program   Why is this consolidation so important   Our colleague and former HUD Secretary Mel Martinez described it very well during the Banking Committee  s markup of the bill   He described how as HUD Secretary he had grantees confused by the various programs  not sure how to apply and for which programs they were even eligible   It was under his leadership that HUD also began to advocate for a consolidation of the programs   Quite simply  consolidation will reduce administrative burdens and maximize flexibility   Rather than dealing with conflicting eligibility requirements  conflicting eligible uses  multiple applications  and different match requirements  applicants will have to deal with only one flexible program   The streamlined approach will combine the efficiencies of a block grant with the accountability of a competitive system   Localities will submit applications outlining the priority projects for their area based on outcomes and results   This will also reduce the administrative burden for HUD in running multiple programs and reviewing thousands of applications   I am especially supportive of approaches  such as those in the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act  that focus on results rather than processes   Communities that demonstrate results in preventing and ending homelessness will be rewarded    When using scarce taxpayer dollars we must always stay focused on what is being achieved with the money   While the existing McKinney Vento programs have been rated Effective under the Administration  s PART assessment  I believe that we can make them do even better   I also believe that the bill makes an appropriate distinction between rural areas and large metropolitan cities   While both areas experience homelessness  the problem manifests itself in very different ways  and thus the solutions will be different     I would also like to highlight the strong rural component in the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act   When we think of homelessness  we generally picture someone sleeping on a park bench or under an overpass  that is to say we think of homelessness in an urban context   Although it may be less visible  our rural areas also deal with the problem of homelessness   The demographics and causes of homelessness can also vary between rural and urban areas  thus the homeless assistance systems in rural areas function much differently than those in urban areas     The Reed Allard bill would give rural applicants the option of applying for a specially designed rural program that focuses much more on prevention and is easier to integrate with existing systems   It also significantly simplifies the application process for rural programs   I believe that we all share the goal of wanting to prevent and end homelessness in America   There are many different people with many different and laudable ideas of how to accomplish this goal   The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act strikes a balance between these many viewpoints   This balance is demonstrated by the unanimous support the bill received in the Senate Banking Committee  Republicans and Democrats  urban areas like New York and rural areas like Wyoming  everyone came together to say that they believed the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act would help us prevent and end homelessness   Senator Reed and I  along with our other colleagues  look forward to working with you to enact legislation to accomplish this goal   Thank you for allowing us to be here today to testify before the subcommittee                              October 2007
