                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Opening Statement of Senator   Hearing on Continued Examination of Implementation of the Exon Florio Amendment  Focus on Dubai Ports World  s Acquisition of P         March 2nd  2006   Like many of my colleagues  I have been extremely concerned with what I have been hearing regarding the decision to transfer port operations to a company owned by a foreign government   I appreciate this opportunity to more closely examine not only the ports decision  but to use this as a poster child of the shortcomings of the underlying CFIUS process   I oppose the decision to permit a company owned by the government of Dubai to take over operations of six major U S  ports without additional information and review   My primary concern about this plan is national security   While I am a strong advocate for economic growth and business opportunities  it must not come at the expense of our national security     Having served on the Armed Services Committee  and on the Intelligence Committee  also under the able leadership of Chairman Shelby  I am keenly aware of the primacy of national security   The only room for error in the arena of national security is to err on the side of caution   We can  t be casual about the safety and security of our country   The Administration has argued  as they no doubt will today  that Dubai Ports World will only conduct terminal operations  and that the company will have no involvement in port or terminal security   They couldn  t be more wrong   Security is an integral part of operations     To draw a parallel  ground maintenance crews and the crews that clean and prepare planes are not directly responsible for airport security   However  it is not difficult to imagine ways in which they could have a deleterious effect on air security   Similarly  while terminal operators might not have primary responsibility for security  their actions directly affect the ability of Customs and the Coast Guard to perform their security functions   I am pleased that the Administration has finally agreed to conduct a review of this matter    However  I am disappointed that it took a massive public outcry  Congressional pressure  and a request from the Dubai Ports World company itself for the Administration to agree to conduct what unquestionably should have been done in the first place   I would strongly advise that they consult carefully with Congress during this process  as we have a critical role to play in national security decisions     I would also admonish the Administration to ensure that they conduct a thorough  vigorous investigation during this 45 day period   Key Administration officials have already made comments that could easily lead one to believe that this will be little more that a perfunctory investigation   or one designed to support a pre determined outcome   That is absolutely unacceptable   Congress and the American people expect a legitimate  objective  substantive investigation  and I intend to continue demanding nothing less   Only when a thorough  objective investigation has been completed and Congress has had an opportunity to review the findings will I even consider allowing this takeover to proceed     While much of the public attention has been focused specifically on the matter of port operations  this one situation simply underscores the much broader concern of how we even got to this point  and the answer lies in a flawed CFIUS process   Again  the ports deal only typifies the lack of transparency and congressional notification in the current process   The fact that the Administration fails to acknowledge any weaknesses in this system only makes me more concerned   For some time now  Chairman Shelby has indicated his concern with the CFIUS process  and I appreciate his leadership   I intend to work closely with him and other committee members to continue examining what reforms may be necessary for the underlying CFIUS process    Without reforms to the flawed structure that supported the decision to let a foreign government take control of U S  port operations without even conducting an investigation  we will continue to face potential risks to other sectors vital to our national security   Thank you  Mr  Chairman                              March 2006 Press Releases
