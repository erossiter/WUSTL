                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Iraqi Referendum          October 19th  2005   Mr  President  I rise today to congratulate the people of Iraq on writing another chapter in the history of their nation   After the coalition forces toppled Saddam  s oppressive regime  many believed it would take years until the Iraqis would be in control of their government apparatus   They were wrong   On June 28  2004  the transfer of power took place  and Iraqis became the rulers of their nation   On January 20  2005  millions of people  including women  risked their lives to choose the members of a temporary parliament responsible for drafting the new constitution   And just last weekend  millions of Iraqis lined up to cast their ballots in more than 6 000 polling places across Iraq   The Iraqi people  s vision of a free and stable Iraq led them to an important milestone    voting on a democratic  Iraqi written constitution   Last weekend  through will and determination  more than 60 percent of the eligible voters in Iraq chose to speak up against tyranny and oppression  a higher percentage of voter turnout than in the 2004 U S  Presidential election     What we saw in Iraq on October 15  2005 proved that even those oppressed for decades will peacefully choose their own future when given a chance to participate in a fair  open electoral process   There had been much speculation that a majority of Sunnis would boycott the referendum   However  until the last few days before the vote  leaders of the Shia and the Kurds worked relentlessly to convince their Sunni countrymen and women to vote either for or against the constitution   Their work came to fruition when millions of Sunnis lined up to cast their ballots and decide the future of their country   While many Sunnis voted against the proposed constitution  the referendum sent a clear message that all Iraqis are willing to invest in the democratic process   Mr  President  by casting their ballots  millions of Iraqis also sent a strong message against terrorism   The ideology of hate has no place in the world  no place in Islam and  most certainly  no place in Iraq   Terrorists   tactics of striking innocent men  women and children are despicable and cowardly   Terror has not derailed the political process nor the establishment of the rule of law   Despite fears of retaliation by al Qaeda and other terrorists  millions of Iraqis chose to participate in the process that will decide the future of their nation   The Iraqi security forces have also started to make a significant difference   According to our military leaders and officials on the ground  the Iraqi security forces were clearly in the lead in securing polling sites around the country   Backed by the coalition forces  the Iraqi military presence was increased by 35 percent since January   Press reports indicate that scattered incidents of violence were quickly suppressed by the Iraqis   Mr  President  this accomplishment indicates the willingness of the Iraqi security forces to stand up to insurgents and protect their fellow countrymen   With each Iraqi soldier trained and equipped to carry out the mission  Iraq draws closer to being able to stand on its own and protect Iraq  s freedom    Just as they have learned the power of the ballot box  Iraqis will soon be experiencing the strength of the rule of law during the trial of Saddam Hussein   Only a couple years ago  thousands of Iraqis  including women and children  were killed  tortured  and wrongfully imprisoned   Nevertheless  the current Iraqi government fully understands the importance of a fair trial and precedents it will establish   As a result of these advancements in Iraq  the country  s most brutal dictator will face trial by the jury of his peers    a trial that thousands of Saddam  s victims never received   The world will pay close attention as the Iraqi judicial system moves forward with this challenge   I am confident that the Iraqis will adhere to the highest standard of the rule of law to reach a proper conclusion   Mr  President  today  the successful referendum in Iraq would not have been possible without our brave men and women in uniform  who were called by our nation  s leaders to perform a noble but difficult task   Their commitment and dedication to peace and prosperity around the globe has never been more evident   Nearly 150 000 soldiers  sailors  airmen  and marines are deployed in Iraq  doing their duty with pride  patriotism  and perseverance   Our success in Iraq and Afghanistan has not come without cost   Those who have fallen have served a cause greater than themselves and deserve special honor   My heart goes out to the families whose sons and daughters have made the ultimate sacrifice   Mr  President  the people of Iraq have clearly spoken of their desire for a free and democratic Iraq   The terrorists understand that their only chance is to break the will of the American people and force us to retreat      We will not waiver in our support of the Iraqi people      We will not waiver in our support of the democratic process and the rule of law      And we will not waiver in our cause for freedom in a land that has known nothing but oppression    The lessons learned in previous world conflicts have proven that when the stakes are so high  we must remain firm  resist the enemy  and fight until the war is won   Thank you  Mr  President   I yield the floor                               October 2005 Press Releases
