                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on Rocky Flats Retirement Benefits          November 4th  2005   I rise today to discuss the incredible achievements of the workers at the Department of Energy  s Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site and to offer an amendment on the behalf of these workers   Rocky Flats is located just a few miles northwest of Denver  Colorado  and for over four decades  this facility was the Department of Energy  s dedicated site for manufacturing plutonium pits for the U S  nuclear weapons stockpile   This highly classified production facility was run by over 8 000 Coloradoans who worked day and night for most of the Cold War and used some of the most dangerous substances known to man  including plutonium  beryllium  and uranium   The workers at Rocky Flats were devoted to their job and believed in their mission   They risked their lives on a daily basis  but did so with the knowledge that their efforts were contributing to the security of our nation      When plutonium pit production ended in 1991  it was unclear what role these workers would play in the clean up of Rocky Flats    They could have walked away from the job   Yet  the workers at Rocky Flats were not ready to quit   They saw a new challenge in front of them    the clean up of Rocky Flats          Their task was anything but simple   Five large plutonium processing facilities  encompassing over a million square feet  were highly contaminated with dangerous radioactive material   The contamination was so severe that these buildings were ranked among the top ten most contaminated facilities in the Department of Energy nuclear weapons complex    I  however  had faith in the workers at Rocky Flats    Mr  President  I am pleased that the workers at Rocky Flats have not disappointed us    The clean up at Rocky Flats was declared completed on October 12 of this year  a full year and three months ahead of schedule     We must keep in mind that most of these workers had to literally develop an entire new skill set    They went from manufacturing plutonium pits to dismantling over         1 400 highly radioactive gloveboxes     They tore down buildings while wearing stiff environmental protection suits    They cleaned up rooms that were so contaminated that they were forced to use the highest level of respiratory protection available   Listen to some of the Rocky Flats workers   accomplishments        All weapons grade plutonium was removed in 2003       More than 1 400 contaminated glove boxes and hundreds of process tanks have been removed        More than 400 000 cubic meters of low level radioactive waste has been removed        All 802 facilities have been demolished        All four uranium production facilities have been demolished        All five plutonium production facilities have been demolished       All 360 sites of soil contamination have been remediated        The last shipment of transuranic waste was shipped this past April        Completion of the clean up    one year and three months ahead of schedule  Just as important  these workers were extraordinarily productive even though they knew they were essentially working themselves out of a job    With the completion of the clean up and the closure of Rocky Flats  they knew they would have to find employment elsewhere    There was no guarantee for a new job     Despite knowing they were going to lose their jobs  the workers at Rocky Flats remained highly motivated and totally committed to their clean up mission     Given the sacrifice and dedication demonstrated by these workers  you would think assisting those workers who lose their retirement benefits because of the early completion of the clean up would be a top priority for the Department of Energy    After all  these workers saved the Department billions upon billions in clean up costs   Last year  however  it became clear that the clean up at Rocky Flats would be completed much earlier than anyone expected   The workers were supportive of early closure  but were concerned that some of their colleagues would lose retirement benefits because of early closure       I shared their concern and requested in last year  s defense authorization bill that the Department of Energy provide Congress with a report on the number of workers who would not receive retirement benefits and the cost of providing these benefits   After a lengthy delay  the Department of Energy reported that about 29 workers at three clean up sites would not receive pension and or life time medical benefits because of early closure   The cost of providing benefits to these workers according to DOE  s report was just over  12 million     To my dismay  the Department of Energy  s report was woefully incomplete   I was informed later on that at least another fifty workers would have qualified for retirement benefits had the Department of Energy bothered to include those workers who had already been laid off because of the accelerated closure schedule    Mr  President  this means as many as 75 workers at Rocky Flats will lose their pension  medical benefits  or in some cases  both because they worked faster  less inexpensively  and achieved more than they were suppose to   They not only worked themselves out of a job  but they also worked themselves out of retirement benefits and medical care   Workers like Doug Woodard and Leo Chavez now find themselves with either severely reduced benefits or no benefits at all   Doug started work at Rocky Flats all the way in 1982 and was responsible for monitoring radiation contamination at the site   He missed qualifying for medical benefits by less than two months   For Leo Chavez  who worked at Rocky Flats for 17 years  DOE  s treatment was even worse    The Department of Energy thanked him for his service and showed him to the door six  6  working days before he qualified for lifetime medical benefits    Let me repeat that    just six  6  days before he was qualified for medical benefits                 Sadly  the Department of Energy has failed to step up to the plate and help out those workers who did so much to save the American people so much money   Instead  the Department of Energy has played the numbers game with these workers     The Department argues that the contract signed with the workers already provided sufficient incentives and that these individuals already received an additional year of service time     Yet  the Department won  t bring up the numbers that matter most    Here are a couple of examples         35 billion     the amount of money Department of Energy in 1995 thought would be needed to clean up Rocky Flats        28 billion    the amount of money the American people saved when the employees at Rocky Flats agreed in 1999 to accelerate the clean up at Rocky Flats  or        600 million     the amount of money the American taxpayer saved on top of the  28 billion because the workers at Rocky Flats exceeded even the accelerated clean up schedule by over a year  And  the Department of Energy does not talk about the hundreds of millions the American people will save when workers at the Savannah River  Hanford  and Idaho clean up sites see that they will not be punished for accelerating their clean up activities          Many of the workers at Rocky Flats have served our nation for over two decades   They have risked their lives day in and day out  first by building nuclear weapon components and then by cleaning up some of the most contaminated buildings in the world    All they have asked for in return is to be treated with fairness and respect     To the disappointment of the workers at Rocky Flats  the Department of Energy has no intention of keeping its end of the bargain       These workers would have received their retirement benefits had the clean up continued to 2035 as originally predicted   More importantly  these workers would have received their retirement benefits had the clean up continued to December 15  2006 as the site clean up contract specified     But by accelerating the clean up by over a year and saving the American taxpayer over  600 million  many of these workers will be left without the medical  health  and life insurance benefits they deserve and have earned                    Mr  President  the Department  s refusal to provide these benefits has ramifications far beyond Rocky Flats   Because Rocky Flats is the first major DOE clean site  workers at other sites around the country are watching to see how the Department of Energy treats the workers at Rocky Flats    Unfortunately  they have seen how the Department of Energy has failed to step up and provide retirement benefits to those who have earned it    The workers at other sites now have no incentive to accelerate clean up   And  Mr  President  why should they   The Department of Energy hasn  t lifted a finger to help the workers at Rocky Flats   It would be foolish for workers at other sites like at Hanford or Savannah River to think the Department of Energy would act fairly with them    To me  the Department  s decision is a penny wise and a pound foolish   By refusing to provide these benefits  the Department saves money in the short term   Yet  by discouraging the workers from supporting acceleration  the Department is going to cost the American taxpayer billions in additional funding in the long run     To correct this mistake  I offer today an amendment that will provide some of the benefits to those workers who will have lost them because of early closure   I am pleased that my colleague from Colorado  Senator Salazar has agreed to cosponsor this important amendment     This amendment is limited and narrowly focused   It provides health  medical  and life insurance benefits to those workers who would have qualified had the site remained open until December 15  2006  the date of site clean up contract   This amendment does not add to the budget   In fact  all it does is direct that a very small portion of the money already provided in this bill for Rocky Flats is used for to help these workers     To be clear  these benefits are not an additional bonus for a job well done   Nor is it a going away present for two decades of service   The health  medical  and life insurance benefits are what these workers have already earned    nothing more  nothing else    Some might suggest that these workers have already received bonuses and a year  s worth of servicetime as part of their contract   Yet  by closing a year early  the Department of Energy is taking many of these bonuses away from the workers  including the year of service time that was promised to them     The workers at Rocky Flats are ordinary people who achieved some extraordinary goals   They have made the impossible  possible  and we in this body  have an obligation to correct the injustice being perpetrated by the Department of Energy       It is time for this body to correct this mistake       Mr  President  I yield the floor                                  November 2005 Press Releases
