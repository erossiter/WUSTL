                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Nomination of Priscilla Owen          May 23rd  2005   Mr  ALLARD   Mr  President  I rise to join my colleagues in support of the nomination of Priscilla Owen   Texas Supreme Court Justice Owen was first nominated to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in May of 2001  by President Bush   I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation and allow an up or down vote on her nomination   I sincerely hope that fairness prevails and that we do indeed proceed with a vote on her nomination   I have had the opportunity to meet with Priscilla Owen personally   I don  t know how many of my colleagues who oppose her have accepted her offer to visit with them  but I certainly hope they will at least have the courtesy to meet her in person before deciding to refuse to offer her a fair up or down vote   If they do  they will quickly learn that she is a person of integrity  humility and possesses a keen understanding of the law     On a personal note  she is a wonderful human being   I was particularly impressed when she told me that  growing up  she hoped to be a Veterinarian   As a Veterinarian myself  you can understand why I was impressed   She spoke of growing up and participating in a family cattle raising enterprise  helping her parents and grandparents during calving season  nursing and branding     There is something special about a person who has been kicked by a cow and been swatted across the face with a dirty cow tail   It makes a person more real  more understanding of life and hard work   This is exactly the type of judge we need on the bench    one who understands real life  honest living and hard working people   Instead of demonizing her  I wish my colleagues would get to know her well enough to recognize the legal skill and value she would bring to the United States as a member of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals   Priscilla Owen will uphold the law  not make the law   Some find this to be a problem  I find this to be a blessing         Priscilla Owen has served the law with distinction   A justice of the Texas Supreme Court since 1995  she received overwhelming approval from the people of Texas  84 percent of who voted to retain her service on the bench   Unlike many members of the United States Senate  including myself  when it came time for the voters to decide whether or not she should remain on the bench  Ms  Owen received the endorsement of every major newspaper in the State of Texas   Does that sound like an extremist to you  Mr  President     Priscilla Owen  s life has not been limited to the law    she is a decent human being and dedicated community servant   She has worked to educate parents about the effect that divorce has on children and worked to lessen the adversarial nature of legal proceedings when a marriage is dissolved  She works with the hearing impaired and organizations dedicated to service animals for those with disabilities   She teaches Sunday School and is committed to the poor and underprivileged    It is clear that Priscilla Owen is qualified to serve on the 5th Circuit Court   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Justice Owen   Well Qualified     its highest possible rating  She has the support of former Democrat justices on the Texas Supreme Court and 15 past presidents of the Texas State Bar Association  To say that she is not qualified is utterly ridiculous   Because her credentials are so outstanding  the other side must rely on hyperbole and rhetoric  accusing her of being   extreme    in order to smear her nomination   So the question then is whether she is extreme or qualified   The great thing about the constitution is that it provides us with a mechanism to make this type of   advice and consent    determination    an up or down vote    An up or down vote is a simple matter of fairness   Every judicial nominee that makes it out of the Judiciary Committee should receive an up or down vote   The filibuster is not in the constitution   It is merely a parliamentary delay tactic that was relatively unused until modern times   In 214 years  never has a nominee with a majority of support of the U S  Senate been denied a vote   Throughout the history of the United States  a nominee who clearly held the majority support of the Senate has never been defeated by the use of a filibuster  Until now   I appeal to my colleagues    restore the fairness that this body and the American people deserve   Throughout this debate  I have consistently stated that we must reach a compromise that allows an up or down vote on all nominees  while affording everyone an opportunity to be heard  This is not a partisan issue or flippant suggestion    it is simply a matter of fairness   If a nominee reaches the floor  then they should receive a vote  Up or down   I don  t believe there is anything wrong with providing a nominee an up or down vote  Some in this body act as if the filibuster has been used before to kill a judicial nominee  This is untrue    every nominee with a majority of support has received an up or down vote  Every nominee for over 200 years   I do not take the confirmation of judicial nominations lightly nor do my colleagues  But we must not twist the confirmation process into a partisan platform     Our fundamental duty to confirm the President  s nominees is not an easy task   It carries with it the weight and responsibility of generations    a lifetime appointment to a position that requires a deep and mature understanding of the law   We were elected to the United States Senate by people who believed we would accomplish our fundamental duties    as representatives of the people to say yes or no to the President  s nominees   I believe members have a right to express their opinions   But I also believe that members have a right to a vote and that it is wrong to deny others the opportunity to vote on judicial nominations     This debate is not about numbers   It is not about percentages    how many judges that Republicans confirmed or how many judges Democrats have confirmed  To frame this debate as a numbers fight is not being fair to the American people   We were not sent to Congress to focus on a numerical count  but instead to carry out our constitutional obligations  in this instance the advice and consent clause    Some Senators have come to the floor to argue that the advice and consent clause does not mean that we actually vote on nominees   They argue that a vote is only needed to confirm the appointment but that other tactics can be used to disapprove of the nominee   Unfortunately  these   other tactics    to kill a nominee have resulted in a smear campaign and obstruction of our constitutional duties     To help address this point  I would like to turn to a recent article that was published in National Review  which discussed the meaning of the advice and consent clause through the eyes of our country  s founders    The article notes that the Appointment Clause is listed as an explicit power vested in the executive   The advice and consent obligation follows this clause  but it is in the article addressing executive powers   It is not listed in the article addressing legislative powers  The author believes that this is instructive because it helps us understand that the founders intended the President to play the main role in the nomination process  not the legislature   Had the founders intended the legislature to be the fulcrum  they would have listed the advice and consent clause as a fundamental duty in the Article addressing legislative powers  I ask for unanimous consent to place the article into the record   Had the founders intended a 60 vote supermajority  they would have included the requirement in the Constitution the way they did on the treaty power clause   The clause on the treaty power  after mentioning   advice and consent     requires concurrence by   two thirds of the Senators present     The clause on the appointment of ambassadors and others  including Supreme Court justices    by contrast    does not      The author then pointed out several other provisions in the Constitution where a   supermajority    vote is required  In Article I  section 3  two thirds  of members present  are required for Senate conviction for impeachment  In Article I  section 5  two thirds are required to expel a member of either House  Article I  section 7 requires two thirds for overriding a presidential veto  The fact that the Constitution explicitly requires two thirds in some contexts indicates that the Senate  s consent in Article II  section 2 is by majority vote when no supermajority vote is required   The general rule is that majorities govern in a legislative body  unless another rule is expressly provided   The article also cited a Supreme Court case  noting that more than a century ago  in United States v  Ballin  that   the general rule of all parliamentary bodies is that  when a quorum is present  the act of a majority of the quorum is the act of the body  This has been the rule for all time  except so far as in any given case the terms of the organic act under which the body is assembled have prescribed specific limitations       No such limitation is found in the federal constitution  and therefore the general law of such bodies obtains       And in the author  s own words    Third  the particular process in the Appointments Clause    of presidential nomination and Senate   consent    by a majority    was carefully considered by the Constitutional Convention  A number of alternative processes for appointments were thoroughly considered    and rejected    by the Constitutional Convention  And this consideration took place over several months   The Constitutional Convention considered at least three alternative options to the final Appointments Clause   1  placing the power in the president alone   2  in the legislature alone   3  in the legislature with the president  s advice and consent   On June 13  1787  it was originally proposed that judges be   appointed by the national Legislature     and that was rejected  Madison objected and made the alternative motion that appointments be made by the Senate  and that was at first approved  Madison specifically proposed that a   supermajority    be required for judicial appointments but this was rejected  On July 18  Nathaniel Ghorum made the alternative motion   that the Judges be appointed by the Executive with the advice   consent of the 2d branch      following on the practice in Massachusetts at that time   Finally  on Friday  September 7  1787  the Convention approved the final Appointments Clause  making the president primary and the Senate  alone  secondary  with a role of   advice and consent      Now  I  m no lawyer  but to me  if a document consistently states when a supermajority vote is required  and silent where it is not  that they meant to write it that way and it was not a mere oversight  Clearly  a supermajority was never intended  But what was intended was an up or down vote   A fair  non partisan up or down vote    If a member of the Senate disapproves of a judge then let them vote against the nominee   I encourage them to express their dissatisfaction and vote no on the nominee  But do not deprive those of us in the Senate who support a nominee of our right to a vote   Do not deny an up or down vote entirely   Let  s decide whether the members of this body approve or disapprove of the nominees    let  s vote   Let  s vote to show whether this body believes the nominees are unfit for service or out of the mainstream   I believe they have majority support    majority support from the elected representatives of the people   But let  s vote and find out       It is our vote   the right of each member to collectively participate in a show of   advice and consent    to the President   that exercises the remote choice of the people who sent us to Congress   Our three branch system of government cannot function without an equally strong Judiciary   It is through the Courts that justice is served  rights protected  and that law breakers are sentenced for their crimes   Unfortunately  1 out of 4 of President Bush  s Circuit Court nominees have been subject to the filibuster    the worst confirmation rate of appellate court judges since the Roosevelt Administration   The minority cannot willingly refuse to provide an up or down vote on judicial nominees without acknowledging that irreparable harm may be done to an equal branch of government   The decision to vote up or down on a nominee or to deny the vote entirely pits the Constitution against parliamentary procedure    the constitution versus the filibuster   I urge my colleagues to put their faith in the founding document  not a filibuster   To do anything else dishonors the Constitution and relegates it to a mere rule of procedure   Mr  President  I hope we can reach a common ground and recognize our duties as members of this body   I ask my colleagues for fairness  to put partisan politics aside and instead fulfill our advice and consent obligation   Lets vote    up or down    and end this debate with honor    Thank you  Mr  President                                May 2005 Press Releases
