                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT   Allard Opposes Spending Increases in Senate Budget          May 17th  2007   Mr  ALLARD   Mr  President  first of all  I thank the chairman for his leadership on the Budget Committee and willingness to work with Republicans  to a certain degree  and I do appreciate his leadership   We have a difference of opinion   I think these are reflected in the budget   I also recognize the ranking Republican  Judd Gregg   I think he has it just right   I would like to associate myself with many of the comments he made on the Senate floor because I agree with him     If you have been listening to this debate and what the Democrats on the other side of the aisle have been saying  you may be getting as confused as I am   You know  I listened to this debate  and it seems as though they want the argument all ways    at least four ways     They want to argue that they are not increasing taxes but yet are increasing taxes   They want to argue that they are holding down spending  but yet they want to take credit for all of this spending they put in the budget   So I think that is confusing     I think we are missing an opportunity to do more for future generations than what is reflected in this budget   In fact  I think this is a budget that is a disaster in the making for future generations   It took the majority Democrats only 4 months and 15 days to figure out how to raise taxes   Now  they say they are not raising taxes   But taxes are going to go up because of inaction on their part  because they make the rules and the procedures around here in the Senate so complicated that there is not going to be an opportunity for those of us who want to see taxes held down to make that effort without these very high hurdles    They want to ignore the fact that the U S  economy has done well  it has grown and prospered over the past several years with the creation of 7 9 million new jobs and tax revenues that have outpaced projections by  300 billion     The economy has experienced smooth sailing  frankly   Now Democrats are about to pass a huge  bloated budget that will act as a heavy anchor weighing down our economy     The Democrats do not want to recognize the fact that after we reduced taxes the economy grew   We have had this argument over the years in the Budget Committee  and with the now majority leader on the Budget Committee who does not want to recognize that when you are reducing taxes you actually have an opportunity to increase revenues  particularly when we start with a high tax rate     If we look at what has happened with taxes before  the President came through with his economic growth packages  he had two growth packages  our economy was struggling  and we just finished  in 2001  what we call    the high tech bubble had burst  the economy was regressing  and we had the 9 11 catastrophe   We had the war on terrorism   We moved into a time when we had a record hurricane year     But despite all of those negative impacts  the economy did well   I can recall during the last part of the 1970s when we had high energy prices and we had a struggling economy   Remember  we got into double digit inflation  double digit unemployment   We referred to all of this as the misery index because our economy wasn t doing too well     Most of that was attributed to the fact that energy prices were so high   But look at today and look where energy prices are and look at how the economy continues to grow  which I think speaks to the strength of the economic package that the President has put in place with the help of a Republican Congress     What we did was reduce taxes in those areas where we thought we could really focus  particularly targeting the small business sector of our economy   That is where innovation occurs   That is where you can expect the greatest economic growth when you have right tax policy  One of the things we did that really targeted the small businesses was we increased the amount of expenditures that they could write off so that small businesses make investments in their business  maybe it was computers  maybe it was    if they were in construction maybe it was a Bobcat  But it impacted all segments of small business     The economy responded  and it is still responding   But this particular plan we have before us    and that is what this budget is  it is a plan   It is a plan that is put together by the House and the Senate   It is not anything that is signed by the President   It is an agreement    So  now  in 4 months and 15 days  they have had this plan that lays out a pact to increase taxes  It increases discretionary spending at least  205 billion over the President  s request over 5 years   The debt increases  2 5 trillion over 5 years  and we don t do anything on mandatory spending   We had several hearings in the Budget Committee about the problem with entitlements  which is mandatory spending    Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid    and how we needed to control future obligations in those programs because they are getting ready to bankrupt the country   We had testimony in front of the Budget Committee that said the way those programs are currently designed is unsustainable   It is completely ignored in this 5 year plan that has been put out on how they are going to grow the economy   I think it is headed in the wrong direction   It is going to be a disaster for future generations    The Democratic budget contemplates a huge tax increase   The argument was made from the other side  as always  if you want to increase taxes  you blame the rich because they are making too much money   But everybody ignores the fact that the top 20 percent of taxpayers are paying 85 percent of the taxes   The bottom 40 percent is actually getting a refund  a handout from the Government   It is easy to point to the wealthy and say   They are not paying enough   But in reality  they are already paying a lot   If we allow the Republican tax plan to expire without taking any future action  the result is going to be a negative impact on our economy   I believe that     This budget spends  23 billion over what the President suggested as far as discretionary spending for 2008  totaling about  82 billion over 2007     The budget spends  205 billion over the President s discretionary spending over 5 years   Entitlement spending grows unchecked by  416 billion over 5 years   It creates reserve funds   We did create a few reserve funds  but we didn t create 23 reserve funds  which is an opportunity to build a shield of smoke and mirrors  which allows spending to go on unchecked   I am concerned about the opportunity we are giving various committees to spend     If we do this right  we can do a lot of things that will restrain spending  will hold down taxes  and actually provide for future generations of Americans   I am disappointed we haven t done more in those areas   In fact  we haven t done anything but move in the wrong direction     I had an amendment I offered in the committee and on the floor that said   Let s look at the ineffective programs   This President  to his credit  has put together what they call the PART Program   PART goes into the various agencies and evaluates their programs   Then they rate them   Was it effective   Was it moderately effective   Is it ineffective  or have they made no effort at all   You can easily look into these programs where they didn t make an effort at all to try and establish a process where there is accountability in the way they spend tax dollars  or they can go into a program that was rated ineffective   I said   You know  if we go ahead and reduce spending by 25 percent on some of those ineffective programs  in the first year of this budget we could save about  4 billion  which is minimal  when you think about it  out of a total budget of  2 9 trillion   Over 5 years  that would amount to about a  17 billion reduction in debt  a relatively easy thing we could have done   We ignored that opportunity  as we ignored the opportunity to do something about entitlement spending   We talked about it and talked about it   This could have been a budget that actually called for some action   We have ignored all the recommendations of the hearings and gone ahead with business as usual    increasing taxes  increasing spending     The Democratic budget literally ignored the entitlement crisis   They have done some manipulation so they can talk four ways about how they are not increasing taxes but in reality they are  about how they are holding down spending but in reality they are increasing spending much more than what Republicans are supporting   It would have been interesting to have seen how they would have created a budget during those 3 years the chairman of the Budget Committee criticized Republicans  when we had 9 11  we had the Internet bubble break  and we had record hurricanes   We had a lot of pressure on our budget   As Republicans  we did a good job   Those were tough times   This budget and these economic times are much better   This was an opportunity for us to do something to hold down spending   We could have done something to hold down the taxes so we could sustain our phenomenal economic growth     Let me talk about one other issue   If you notice  when the Democrats talked about spending  they talked about it as a percent of gross domestic product   That is an easy argument to make   This economy has done so well that the gross domestic product is growing at a phenomenal rate   So you can increase spending at a phenomenal rate  and your figures can still look good   When you talk about spending as a percentage of gross domestic product  you are not talking about what is happening in the budget   You need to talk about it in terms of real figures from year to year and within the 5 year window of this budget   When you do  we have a tax increase of  736 billion   You have increased discretionary spending by  205 billion  debt by  2 5 trillion  and done nothing as far as entitlement spending is concerned    I will not vote for this budget   I encourage my colleagues to join me   We can do better   This budget forgets about future generations  and we should do better on their behalf   That is the reason I came to the Congress  because I believed it was important that we eliminate deficit spending     By the way  he talks about eliminating deficit spending by 2012   If we worked on it  I think we could have gotten rid of deficit spending in 2 years  with the current rate of growth and current incoming revenue  if we had only made the effort   But this budget ignores that effort   We continue to spend and tax as usual     I am disappointed in this particular budget   We could have done much better   I think it is a disaster for future young Americans   Hopefully  this budget will not pass  and we can have another budget that deals more seriously with the future of this country and the future of America                                May 2007 Press Releases
