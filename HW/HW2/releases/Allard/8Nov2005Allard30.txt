                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Iraqi Referendum          November 8th  2005   Mr  President    We are now less than a month removed from the successful Iraqi referendum that was approved by more than 75 percent of Iraqis   This vote marked a new dawn in the Arab world    a democratically created constitution written by Iraqis and approved by the general electorate made up of Sunnis  Shiites  and Kurds   This is quite a change from the decades in which a militant dictator ruled over Iraq with the threat of death hanging over the people for any harsh word directed towards the central government   It truly is a new day in Iraq   Of course  some would rather ignore the strides that the Iraqi people have taken   They would rather focus on grim milestones that neither reflect the true sacrifice that has been made  nor give a clear indication of how far the Iraqis have come to independence   The men and women of our Armed Forces have created an environment in Iraq that has given Iraqis a chance for democracy   This chance is born from the blood  sweat  and tears of our servicemen and women   They deserve our gratitude and honor   Friday marks Veterans Day and it is fitting that every year we take time to pause and reflect on those who have served in the military to protect our way of life and advance freedom around the globe   While we celebrate this year  we do so with heavy hearts knowing that there are many future war veterans who are currently serving in the theater abroad   As they have done in the past  our armed forces have taken up the challenge yet again to defend our freedoms from violent extremists to ensure that future generations of Americans can continue to prosper    Many of these war veterans have already served previous tours in Iraq  and my thoughts and prayers go out for another safe return home      Many thousands of troops who are engaged in Iraq are Coloradoans   For example  the 10th Combat Support Hospital that left Fort Carson for Iraq in October   This medical unit is being deployed not only to treat our injured servicemen and women  but also any civilian that is brought in to their trauma unit regardless of affiliation   I want to take a minute to pause and reflect on that   Our trained medical doctors and technicians will be using their skills to save the lives of not only Coalition Forces  but anyone who is brought in  including insurgents   They might be saving the very lives of those that would do great harm to our soldiers   These are the types of actions that show what kind of men and women serve in the armed forces   These are the types of actions that show what freedom and democracy can bring to a region long devoid of it     The individuals in our armed forces continue to shine throughout the country with remarkable levels of service   Individuals like Colonel James West of Palisade  Colorado   Colonel West recently received a Bronze Star after distinguishing himself during two consecutive tours of duty in Iraq    He served as a Senior Program Manager in the Project and Contracting Office in Baghdad  Iraq from December 2004 to September of this year   Because of the critical nature of his position and need to maintain the lines of communication and trust he developed with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and the primary Iraqi owned operating companies  Colonel West volunteered himself for two consecutive tours of duty   During this time  his leadership in the field provided the foundation necessary to achieve the goal of rebuilding the Iraqi Oil production capacity to pre war levels   The Department of Defense and the Air Force believe that his professionalism and devotion to duty merit special recognition   I honor him for his service to our country and congratulate him on his well deserved Bronze Star   More than just being engaged in fighting the radical insurgents who have polluted the country  our men and women like Col  West are risking their lives to reach out to the Iraqi people to show them the heart that is behind the uniform   From the Army engineers throughout the country helping to rebuild the infrastructure  to ordinance disposal units helping to cleanse farmland from explosives left from decades of neglect  our troops continue to make a positive difference in the lives of Iraqis     It is important to put our military  s efforts into the proper perspective   The enormous progress that has been made in Iraq is the real story      It was only two and a half years ago that the Hussein regime was in power terrorizing large portions of the Iraqi population   And now just nine months after they elected their own leaders for the first time  the Iraqi people have approved a historical referendum by an overwhelming majority   These are the milestones we should be celebrating  the ones that could only be achieved through the sacrifices our soldiers  sailors  airmen  and marines   This Friday marks Veterans Day   Let us not forget our future war veterans who are gallantly serving the cause of freedom abroad   And let us remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to help bring democracy to Iraq   I yield the floor
