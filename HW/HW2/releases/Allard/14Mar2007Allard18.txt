                                                                                                                                                                                                                   OPENING STATEMENT   Committee on the Budget FY 2008 Budget Resolution         March 14th  2007   Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg  I commend you for your efforts to lead this Committee through a series of useful hearings and bring us to this point in the budget process    In February  the President launched this year  s Budget process when he sent to the Congress a responsible budget that provides for the needs of the country while maintaining fiscal discipline and not increasing taxes  Although my Republican colleagues and I have not yet seen Chairman Conrad  s budget proposal  I remain hopeful that it will do the same   What we do know is that this economy is strong  More than seven million jobs have been created since August of 2003  unemployment is at historical lows  paychecks are rising  and since 2003 our economy has grown by  2 2 trillion  or the size of the entire Chinese economy   One of the reasons we are enjoying a strong economy today is because the Republican Congress and the President created conditions for individuals and small businesses to thrive  These pro growth economic policies include reducing income tax rates  reducing capital gains and dividend tax rates  reducing the estate and gift tax  and increasing incentives for small business investment    These policies  combined with the hard work and ingenuity of American workers and entrepreneurs  have resulted in consecutive years of robust economic growth  Particularly remarkable is the fact that this growth came on the heels of the burst of the Internet bubble  corporate scandals  the terrorist attacks of 9 11  and the devastation of Hurricane Katrina  Like the American people  our economy weathered the storm   To stay on course  it is imperative that we make the tax cuts permanent  Make no mistake about it  a failure to extend the tax cuts is a tax increase  Anybody who tells you otherwise has been in Washington  DC too long  Likewise for anyone who says the government knows how to spend your money better than you do  Yet by voting for tax increases or skewing the rules against tax cuts  taking money out of your pocket and putting it in theirs  that is what every Member who does so is saying   The economic growth stimulated by the tax cuts has not only led to more money in the pockets of the American people  it has led to increased federal revenue and reduced deficits  Since 2003  revenues have rebounded sharply following several years of decline  Last year  revenues were up almost 12 percent to  2 4 trillion  the highest in our Nation  s history    As a result  we cut the budget deficit in half several years ahead of schedule and put the country on a path toward balancing the budget with relative ease by 2012  What is noteworthy about the President  s budget is not so much that it balances the budget in 5 years  but that it does so without increasing taxes  I hope that the Chairman  s mark will take the President  s cue   Although our robust economy is causing us to move in the right direction on the revenue side of the budget equation  looming on the horizon is the potential for a crisis on the spending side of the equation  While I am concerned about unchecked growth in discretionary spending  in terms of the crisis  I am talking primarily about long term entitlement spending    If the rate of growth is left unchecked  spending on just three entitlement programs    Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid    will exceed the historical amount of all federal spending as a percentage of GDP by 2030  In other words  those three programs will cost as much as the entire federal government has historically cost the American people  including things like national defense and education  This level of growth is unsustainable and threatens the economic well being of not only our generation  but also our children and grandchildren    It is our responsibility as a Congress to ensure the solvency of these programs for future generations  Solving this impending crisis will require each of us to make tough decisions  While there is no easy answer  as we have heard from countless witnesses before this Committee  now is the time to act  I eagerly anticipate the Chairman  s solutions to this and other issues  such as reducing the Federal debt  that he has identified as pressing problems throughout the course of hearings both this Congress and last   In addition to responsibly limiting the growth rate of all spending  we need to ensure that existing taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely  A logical first place to start is with a reduction in spending on ineffective programs and the elimination of waste  fraud  and abuse  I commend the President for taking the first step and courageously recommending reductions in or eliminations of programs to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely   As architects of the blueprint for all federal revenues and spending  vested in us as members of this Committee is a great deal of responsibility  It is my hope that we can work together to craft a budget that reflects our Nation  s priorities  which include  protecting the homeland and fighting terrorism  keeping the economy strong with low taxes  ensuring the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations  responsibly controlling spending  ensuring that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely  and making Federal programs more effective    I look forward to working with each of you toward that end                              March 2007 Press Releases
