          FLOOR STATEMENT  Iraq Supplemental          April 24th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    Mr s  President  it wasn  t very many months ago that the Senate unanimously approved General Petraeus to head our efforts in Iraq   Many members have extolled the virtues of the General  his education  his leadership  his commitment to his soldiers   Unfortunately  we are still confronted with the reality that some want to tie General Petraeus   hands   Confusingly enough  they want to reject the strategy General Petraeus has proposed in Iraq  even before he has been given the full opportunity to perform his mission   I ask again  why would we support him and recognize his stellar career with a unanimous nomination vote  but not give him the means to get the job done   For what reason did my colleagues agree to send him to Iraq as the commander of our forces   His strategy in Iraq was made very clear  both publicly and privately  and yet we are not willing to support it   It  s vexing  Mr  President      We need to avoid micromanaging the war from the floor of the Senate  let our commander in chief perform his duties  and let our military leaders do their jobs   If we don  t support them fully in the Supplemental bill  then I must continue to vote against any legislation that sets arbitrary deadlines and thresholds in Iraq   and plead with my colleagues to do the same   We cannot afford to set a deadline and walk away from Iraq   The cost of failure is too great to our future long term national security   It  s in America  s security interests to have an Iraq that can sustain  govern and defend itself   Too much is at stake to simply abandon Iraq at this point  the price of failure is too great    Let me remind our colleagues that we have seen terrible results from political motives being placed above military necessities  the attempt at rescuing the American Embassy hostages from Tehran  or Beirut in the 1980  s and Somalia in the 1990  s   And leaving Iraq in the current situation would be like the ending of our efforts in those areas as well  our withdrawal from these countries emboldened the terrorists   Bin Laden himself is on record after these withdrawals criticizing our lack of will and questioning our commitment to fighting these zealots   We have to learn from our mistakes in the past     How have we gotten to this point  Mr  President   Well  many of my colleagues in the Senate continue to beat the drum of the Iraqi Study Group report   They continue to state that their withdraw proposal follows the report  s recommendations     I would like to point something out to my colleagues   Unlike the Supplemental Bill that will soon be voted on  or what I  d like to call our   surrender document     the Iraqi Study Group report doesn  t call for us to walk away from our mission   In fact  the Iraqi Study Group Co Chair James Baker recently had this to say about artificial deadlines  and I quote     The  Iraq Study Group  report does not set timetables or deadlines for the removal of troops  as contemplated by the supplemental spending bills the House and Senate passed  In fact  the report specifically opposes that approach  As many military and political leaders told us  an arbitrary deadline would allow the enemy to wait us out and would strengthen the positions of extremists over moderates       So  here we are Mr  President   A must past bill that flies in the face of what the Iraq Study Group has recommended     But the Democrat majority is also well aware of what effect slowing down passage of the supplemental means to the Department of Defense as a whole   Particularly  the House of Representatives has dragged their feet in appointing conferees to the bill knowing full well that the President intends to veto this legislation   In fact  just yesterday President Bush stated he would strongly object to any deadline stating that     An artificial timetable of withdrawal would say to an enemy    Just wait them out    It would say to the Iraqis    Don  t do hard things necessary to achieve our objectives    And it would be discouraging for our troops       He also stated that he does not want    Washington politicians trying to tell those who wear the uniform how to do their job      And I agree with the President wholeheartedly   By placing the President in the precarious position of vetoing this bill  even in the dire financial straits it places the Department of Defense  the other side of the aisle has chosen to play politics rather than fund a clean bill that gives our soldiers in the field the resources they need   The question remains  if the other side truly believes the war is lost  then why not cut off funding for the war entirely   The power of the purse is in our constitutional authority as a Congress   If the majority party wants to dictate Iraq policy to the President  rather than put limitations on our military in Iraq  which would be a disaster  they should attempt to no longer fund our efforts   But I doubt that will happen  because they know they don  t have the votes or the support for such a precipitous withdrawal   Instead  the   slow bleed strategy    will continue from our colleagues here in the Senate and the House that will in my opinion leave our troops dejected and less safe than before  This ill advised strategy will clearly hand Al Jazeera its propaganda message   There is no doubt that we face extremely difficult challenges in Iraq and we have not made enough progress  The citizens of Iraq must be willing to fight for their own freedom   The President recognizes this and his new plan is the result of increased commitments from the Iraqi Prime Minister   The President has developed a new plan with new leadership   We should not jerk the rug out from under those who we have put in charge in Iraq   I ask my colleagues to reject this bill  and let us craft a   clean    funding bill that will meet the priorities and needs of our men and women in Iraq                              April 2007 Press Releases
