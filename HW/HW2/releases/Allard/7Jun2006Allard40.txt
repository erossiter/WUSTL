                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Support of Marriage          June 7th  2006   I would like to begin by thanking the Majority Leader and the 32 cosponsors of S J  Resolution 1  the Marriage Protection Amendment  Thank you for your leadership  courage  and for standing with me in support of marriage   We  as Senators  are called to duty to debate this issue here today out of respect for the democratic process  The voice of the people has been heard loud and clear  marriage is the union of a man and a woman    It has been heard in the 20 states with Constitutional amendments passed by an average of 70 percent of voters  It has been heard in the 26 states with statutes protecting traditional marriage  It has been heard in 45 states and in this Congress   Unfortunately  dissatisfied with the outcome of the democratic process  a handful of activists have launched a carefully coordinated campaign to circumvent the democratic process and redefine marriage through the courts    As a result  I introduced S  J  Resolution 1  an amendment to the Constitution that simply defines marriage as the   union of a man and a woman     while leaving all other issues of civil unions or domestic partnerships to the states   I am pleased that the issue has this week been debated in a democratically elected and deliberative body  where it belongs  Throughout the course of the past two days  I have heard countless arguments in favor of marriage  from both sides of the   aisle  Surprisingly  many of the same people making those arguments will not vote for my amendment to protect marriage    Equally as surprising  notwithstanding their opposition  I heard few arguments opposing my amendment on the merits  Instead  most of those opposed to my amendment hurriedly shifted the debate to issues other than the pending business  I suspect that these shifts were meant to divert attention away from their intent to vote differently than an average of 70 percent of their constituents do when they vote on the issue of same sex marriage at home   While other issues are without a doubt very important  the Senate has and continues to devote considerable time  and will likely devote even more time  to debate on these important issues this year  With the overwhelming support that was voiced on this floor for the institution of marriage  one would think that addressing the nationwide attack on marriage that is underway would warrant at least one full day of debate on the issue   The one tack taken by those opposed to my amendment most closely resembling an argument on the merits came in the form of states   rights  While well meaning  this argument is unfounded    First  my amendment actually protects states   rights  Same sex advocates have  through the courts  systematically and successfully trampled on laws democratically enacted in the states   My amendment takes the issue out of the hands of a handful of activist judges and puts it squarely back in the hands of the states   Secondly  the process to amend the Constitution is the most democratic  federalist process in all our government  It is neither an exclusively federal nor an exclusively state action  It is a shared responsibility of both  Once passed by the Congress  legislatures in all 50 states will have the opportunity to debate and decide this issue for themselves   Finally  under my amendment  states remain free to address the issue of civil unions and domestic partnerships  Citizens  acting through their state legislatures  can bestow whatever benefits to same sex couples that they choose   The real danger to states   rights would be to do nothing and to acquiesce in the recognition of un enumerated constitutional rights in which the states have had no participation   The truth is  the Constitution will be amended whether we pass this bill or not  The only question is whether it will be amended through the amendment process  or by unaccountable  activist judges  If we fail to define marriage  the courts will not hesitate to do it for us   I  for one  believe that the institution of marriage and the principles of democracy are too precious to surrender to the whims of a handful of unelected  activist judges    I urge my colleagues to join me in my stand for democracy and marriage by voting YES on S J  Resolution 1  the Marriage Protection Amendment                              June 2006 Press Releases
