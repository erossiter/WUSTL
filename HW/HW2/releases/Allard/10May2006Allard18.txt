                                                                                                                                                                                                                   OP ED   Making Health Care More Accessible to Small Business Owners and Their Employees by U S  Senator          May 10th  2006   The United States Senate this week is focusing on a health care agenda in an attempt to hold down the costs of medical care  This issue is important  We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the cost of health care and those who can no longer afford health insurance   I personally understand the need for health care reform  I am considering this issue as a small businessman who had to struggle with the costs of healthcare and who had to struggle on behalf of his employees  making sure that they had appropriate means to meet the healthcare needs of their families   Before I came to Congress  when I ran my veterinary hospital in Loveland  Colorado  I did not have health insurance   I found that small business employee health insurance rates were such that I simply could not afford health insurance and stay in business  So I decided to stop trying to find non existent   affordable    insurance and instead offer my employees increased pay  with the increase being designated for them to buy their own healthcare coverage  Individual plans would be better tailored to their health needs and would be more portable  And my wife and I decided to begin setting aside our own savings account to pay for healthcare costs in case  for some reason or another  one of us had an incident where we needed to go to the hospital   Being a veterinarian and having  for instance  to lift heavy dogs on and off the exam table  I lifted one too many Great Danes  ended up with back problems  and had to have back surgery  Because I didn t have health insurance  I paid for it myself out of my own pocket  from the savings account we had set up for this type of situation  It set us back  but we were able to survive that particular incident   It was interesting  the hospital did not at first want to let us in because we did not have health insurance  When we checked out of the hospital  they said they would reduce our costs 20 percent because they did not have to deal with the paperwork or costs of having to process my claim    So I understand the need  and I have been eager to address this situation   Two bills that would have lowered health insurance costs by limiting liability were blocked earlier this week in the U S  Senate   I believe the facts have shown that curbing frivolous lawsuits helps the public by increasing the availability of care and lowering its costs  Unfortunately for you and me  capping liability harms trial lawyers and they had their way on the issue   I am pleased that another bill coming forward in the Senate this week is Senate Bill 1955  the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act  This legislation allows small businesses to form associations  Then  because they will have more purchasing power in the marketplace  they can negotiate cheaper health insurance policies  It may not be a perfect solution  but at least it will give small businesses one more tool to use in trying to hold down the costs of health care and provide health insurance to many who are currently uninsured   I think we need to focus this debate on at least giving small businesses the opportunity to make a choice on providing healthcare for themselves and for their employees   Currently  because of the prohibitive cost of health care coverage for their employees  many small business employers don  t even have the option of offering coverage     It is important to note at this point that a small business owner who buys healthcare coverage is also naturally subject to the same healthcare coverage that he provides his employees   It is not logical that they would pay money for a plan that does not provide them with medical coverage        I support this legislation because I support giving small businesses a choice  I support giving small businesses the opportunity for healthcare coverage that they currently do not receive  I support giving diabetics the opportunity to obtain healthcare coverage  instead of leaving them completely without services and supplies  I support giving small business employees the opportunity for cancer screenings and preventive care instead of leaving them with nothing and no opportunity to provide healthcare for themselves and their families   I personally know what small businesses go through to provide health benefits for their employees  That is why I am supporting S  1955  the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act  I believe this bill will give small businesses the opportunity to access healthcare for themselves and their employees                              May 2006 Press Releases
