                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Nomination of Judge John G  Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States          September 28th  2005   Mr  President   I rise today in support of President Bush  s nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve as Chief Justice of the United States   President Bush could not have nominated an individual more qualified to be confirmed as the next Chief Justice of the United States  If one were to prescribe the ideal training regimen for a future Chief Justice  Judge Roberts   career may well serve as the model   Judge Roberts has interacted with the Supreme Court in nearly every conceivable capacity  After law school  he held a prestigious position at the Supreme Court as a clerk to Justice William Rehnquist  He then went on to argue 39 cases before the Supreme Court  representing both public and private litigants  He currently serves as a judge on the U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  often referred to as the second highest court in the land    In short  he has worked at the Supreme Court  represented dozens of clients before the Supreme Court  and served as a judge on the court that many consider a stepping stone to the Supreme Court  I cannot imagine someone more qualified to now serve as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court   After spending considerable time with Judge Roberts the nominee  I came to be equally impressed with John Roberts the man  He is humble  unassuming  polite  and respectful  In that respect  he shares the values of many of my fellow Coloradans    The humility he exudes is reflected in his view on the role of judges and the courts  Judge Roberts says     A  certain humility should characterize the judicial role  Judges and Justices are servants of the law  not the other way around       He describes himself as a   modest judge     which is evidenced in his   appreciation that the role of the judge is limited  that judges are to decide the cases before them  they  re not to legislate  they  re not to execute the laws      This judicial philosophy is imperative to preserving the sanctity of the Constitution that is under attack by a handful of activist judges  activist judges who proclaim the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional and attempt to redefine the institution of marriage  Unlike these activist judges  Judge Roberts will be on the side of Constitution   As a Senator representing Colorado  I also appreciate the uniqueness of the issues important to Colorado and the West  The departure of Justice O  Connor  and now Chief Justice Rehnquist  marks the loss of a Western presence on the Supreme Court   Earlier this year  I asked President Bush to nominate a judge with an understanding of issues important to Colorado and the West  such as water and resource law   I asked Judge Roberts about his understanding of Western resource and water law  Judge Roberts acknowledged the loss of the Western presence on the Court and assured me that he understands the uniqueness to the West of such issues as water  the environment  and public lands   He shared his experience working on several cases in the State of Alaska  encompassing issues on rivers  Indian law  and natural resources  He also described his practice of traveling to the site of cases when he believes it is beneficial to his understanding of the facts  This practice is demonstrative of his commitment to fully understanding cases from the perspective of both sides   I was pleasantly surprised to learn that he currently has a law clerk from New Mexico  Law clerks sit at a judge  s right hand and are integral in the judge  s decision making process  I am hopeful that Judge Roberts will continue to surround himself with individuals who have a Western perspective   The Senate Judiciary Committee has reviewed Judge Roberts   record more extensively than any previous Supreme Court nominee  The Administration produced more than 76 000 pages of documents related to Judge Roberts   distinguished career in public service  Judge Roberts testified for more than 20 hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee    During the extensive review process  the country learned a great deal about Judge Roberts   fitness to serve on the Supreme Court   We learned about his judicial philosophy  one which is firmly rooted in the rule of law and unwavering in its reverence for the Constitution  I believe his most telling statement was this     I come before the Committee with no agenda  I have no platform  Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain things in exchange for votes  I have no agenda  but I do have a commitment  If I am confirmed  I will confront every case with an open mind  I will fully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented  I will be open to the considered views of my colleagues on the bench  and I will decide every case based on the record  according to the rule of law  without fear or favor  to the best of my ability  and I will remember that it  s my job to call balls and strikes  and not to pitch or bat      We learned that Judge Roberts subscribes to   the bedrock principle of treating people on the basis of merit without regard to race or sex     His belief in these principles is echoed in praise from several women  s and minority groups    The Minority Business Round Table says   his appointment to the U S  Supreme Court would certainly uphold our core American values of freedom  equality and fairness       The Independent Women  s Forum applauds Judge Roberts as a   very well qualified candidate with a reputation of being a strict interpreter of the law rather than someone who legislates from the bench      We learned that Judge Roberts recognizes the limitations on the government  s taking of private property and the role of the legislature in drawing lines that the Court should not  The Court in Kelo permitted the transfer of property from one private party to another private party to satisfy the Constitution  s   public use    requirement  essentially erasing this fundamental protection from its text  Judge Roberts says the Kelo decision   leaves the ball in the court of the legislature         Congress  and legislative bodies in the States are protectors of the people  s rights as well         Y ou can protect them in situations where the Court has determined  as it did 5 4 in Kelo  that they are not going to draw that line      We learned that Judge Roberts will rely on domestic precedent to interpret the U S  Constitution  not foreign law  Judge Roberts said    as a general matter       a couple of things       cause concern on my part about the use of foreign law as precedent         The first has to do with democratic theory      If we  re relying on a decision from a German judge about what our Constitution means  no President accountable to the people appointed that judge  and no Senate accountable to the people confirmed that judge  and yet he  s playing a role in shaping a law that binds the people in this country      Given his keen intellect  impartiality  temperament  sound legal judgment  and integrity  it is not surprising that Judge Roberts enjoyed bipartisan support by the Senate Judiciary Committee  I expect that he will enjoy similar bipartisan support in his confirmation vote tomorrow morning   I want to commend President Bush on the unprecedented level of bipartisan consultation he engaged in with the Senate prior to this nomination  The Constitution grants the power to the President to nominate and the Senate to provide advice and consent  Although Senators can provide input  the Senate does not co nominate  When the President sends forth highly qualified candidates  this body has an obligation to the American people to provide a timely up or down vote   I want to commend my colleagues on the respectful hearings and expeditious process  The Ginsburg Standard applied to Judge Roberts  fair  respectful hearings  no pre judging of cases likely to come before the court  and a timely  up or down vote   With consultations on the next nominee already well under way  and an announcement imminent  I am hopeful that my colleagues will apply the same standards    Judges are not politicians  The Senate debate should reflect that the job of a judge is to review cases impartially  not to advocate issues  Judges should be evaluated on their qualifications  judicial philosophy  and respect for the rule of law   I am confident that President Bush will send forth a highly qualified nominee to replace Justice O  Connor  and I am hopeful that my colleagues will continue to build on the spirit of bipartisanship witnessed during this confirmation process   In conclusion  I cannot imagine a better qualified candidate than Judge Roberts to lead this nation  s highest Court into the 21st century    On behalf of the citizens of Colorado  I want to thank Judge Roberts for his willingness to serve our country  I am hopeful that the fair and respectful hearings accorded to him by this body will serve to inspire the best and the brightest of future generations to make similar sacrifices in the name of public service    Mr  President  I strongly urge my colleagues to cast a vote in favor of Judge John G  Roberts   confirmation as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States
