                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Senator Allard s Statement on Judicial Nominations          April 12th  2005   MR  ALLARD   Mr  President  I rise this morning to address one of the most important obligations that we  as members of the United States Senate  are bound to fulfill   the approval or disapproval of the President  s judicial nominations    Perhaps no other constitutional duty vests as much responsibility in the executive or the Senate than Article II  articulating the President  s power of nomination   A power that is only realized when the constitution works as it was intended to   when the Senate fulfills its obligations as laid out in the clause requiring advice and consent   This fundamental duty carries with it the weight and responsibility of generations   a lifetime appointment to a position that requires a deep and mature understanding of legal thought  and a solemn oath to uphold the law   This debate is not about numbers   It is not about percentages   how many Judges that Republicans confirmed or how many Judges Democrats confirmed   To frame the debate as nothing but a statistical argument is to betray the American people   We were not sent to Congress to focus on a numerical count  but instead to make sure that limited government allows for opportunity and promise without stifling individual freedom and liberty   We were sent here to build a stronger Union and to uphold our obligations under the Constitution   The founding fathers referred to judges as   the guardians    of the Constitution and gave to the President the responsibility to appoint them   Alexander Hamilton once wrote that  in order to maintain the health of the three branches of government  all possible care is requisite to enable the judiciary to defend itself   It is frightening to think that a minority in the Senate are eroding the foundation of the third branch by perpetuating obstruction and endangering the citadels of justice    No where does the Constitution give Congress the ability to ignore the appointment process   By refusing to give judicial nominations an up or down vote  it is nothing more than a Congressional veto with a fancy name   James Madison characterized the appointment of judges as the remote choice of the people   Failure to provide an up or down vote deprives the people of the United States the choice selected by their representatives  denying choice to the very same people that elected us to office and the same people who live under the Constitution that we have sworn to protect   The legal prowess of a nominee is obviously an important factor to consider when confirming a judge   The Constitution calls upon the Senate collectively to determine whether or not a particular nominee is qualified to serve   This determination is made in one gesture   the approval or disapproval of the nomination itself   In 2003 and 2004  a series of votes were held on various nominees   Some were approved  while others were denied a vote altogether  even though they were clearly supported by a majority of Senators   Procedural processes do not fulfill the advice and consent requirement   Advice and consent does not mean avoiding the question on a judicial nominee entirely by employing a filibuster   If a member of the Senate disapproves of a judge then let them vote against the nominee   But do not deprive the people of the right to support a nominee through their elected representative   It is our vote   the right of each member to collectively participate in a show of   advice and consent    to the President   that exercises the remote choice of the people       The burden of obstruction is borne by the American people  Empty seats on our highest courts delays the recourse and justice guaranteed by the Constitution   As so many of my colleagues have stated before me  such justice delayed is justice denied       In the shadow of September 11th  2001  we now recognize the efforts being made by the enemies of the United States to destroy the liberties and freedom of our great nation   The most basic of our country  s values and traditions are under attack   Congress responded by enacting new laws and by providing financial assistance to businesses  families and defense  we acted swiftly to suffocate terrorists and destroy the hateful organizations that work to undermine our society   Through strong and courageous leadership  the President has stood firm against terrorist and terrorist regimes   But our government cannot function without an equally strong Judiciary   the third branch of government   It is through the judiciary that justice is served  rights protected  and that law breakers are sentenced for their crimes   The Senate cannot willingly refuse to provide an up or down vote on judicial nominees without acknowledging that irreparable harm may be done to an equal branch of government    Judges must take an oath to uphold the law  regardless of their personal views   Time after time  a nomination has been blocked by a minority of Senators because they feel that they are better judges of a nominee  s ability to fulfill that oath than a majority of the Senate   The result of this obstruction is a broken nomination process   Mr  President  I sincerely hope we can work through the impasse the judicial nomination process   I hope those opposed to the President  s nominees will vote against them and speak their mind about it   But I also hope that we will be allowed to provide the guidance we are required to provide under the Constitution   As I have said so many times before    vote   em up  or vote   em down  but just vote      Thank you Mr  President                               April 2005 Press Releases
