                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT   Allard Opposes Employee Free Choice Act          June 25th  2007   Mr  ALLARD  Mr  President  I rise today to also voice my opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act  It is a House bill which has been sent over to the Senate  H R  800  It is commonly referred to as the card check legislation  I am not concerned about the rights or about unions  I am not particularly concerned how the members of a union or how employees decide they want to organize  I am not concerned about corporations or businesses or how those businesses may decide they want to organize themselves  But what I am concerned about is the individual  and I am concerned about whether this is the best way to move forward in a democratic process where the individual is so very important  If we talk about a democratic process  we simply talk about free elections  which assure us the privacy of the ballot box     My home State of Colorado continues to maintain a low unemployment rate  far below the national average  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  only 3 5 percent of Coloradans are currently unemployed  This is significant when compared to the national average of 4 5 percent  This is something about which Colorado should be proud to boast  This is the type of information businesses review when they mull over starting up or expanding in the great State of Colorado  This low unemployment rate is the result of Colorado s strong economy and highly productive workforce    So when we consider the so called and wildly misnamed Employee Free Choice Act  I know it threatens to turn the clock back on progress we have made  In fact  this is an issue which Colorado has already rejected  This year  our newly elected Democratic Governor vetoed an attempt to enact a similar measure into State law  That vetoed bill would have repealed the Colorado law requiring that once a company s employees approve a union  they have a second secret ballot vote on how dues will be assessed with a 75 percent supermajority required for approval    Governor Ritter s vote put a stop to the rushed efforts by Democrats in the State legislature who tried to ram the bill through  not unlike those here today  Governor Ritter s efforts protected the 92 percent of Colorado workers who are not members of unions    Union leaders responded to Governor Ritter s actions with threats to move the Democratic convention from Denver if they don t get their way  If unions are able to make such threats on State governments and State legislatures and State Governors  I question what keeps them from intimidating workers who choose not to join their labor organizations    Similar rushed efforts are being made at the Federal level  hiding under the deceptive name of the Employee Free Choice Act  It is advertised as an effort to restore economic opportunity for working families  In fact  this legislation threatens the fundamental right of workers to hold democratic elections in the workplace  Private ballot elections would be replaced with publicly signed card check elections  This would invite coercion from both employers and union activists    Secret ballots guarantee the confidentiality of an employee s wishes without fear of exploitation  ostracism  or retribution  Common sense tells us that if corporate intimidation was a problem  private elections would do more to protect the true wishes of the employee    History recognizes this democratic system as suitable for electing America s leaders  including every Member of Congress who serves today  Workers deserve the same rights at work as they do when they cast their ballot on election day  Only private ballot elections ensure democracy in the workplace  Ask yourself  Do publicly signed cards reliably reveal a worker s true intentions  Workers should be able to express their true desire about joining a union without pressure or fear of reprisal  Just as undue employer pressure is unacceptable on an employee  so is union pressure   We speak of big business  but most union elections over the past several years involve employers with less than 30 eligible employees  Compare that to the massive organization labor has built to advance its agenda    What we are really talking about is big labor versus small business  Secret ballot elections  in my view  must be preserved  not eliminated  So I am asking my colleagues to join me and others in opposing the Employee Free Choice Act because  in my view  it is not about unions  It is not about corporations or big business  This is about the democratic process  It is about free elections and the privacy of the ballot box                               June 2007 Press Releases
