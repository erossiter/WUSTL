                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act           May 10th  2006   Mr  ALLARD  Mr  President  I am going to speak under morning business on Senate bill 1955  the small business health plans legislation that is going to be before us shortly for formal debate  I come to the floor to talk about a piece of legislation that is important to my Colorado constituents  I would like to talk about the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act  sometimes known as HIMMA    This legislation  which is also known as the small business health plans bill  would allow for small businesses to come together to form a group which could then use their combined purchasing power to influence insurance companies for affordable health plans    It has been suggested that those who serve in the Senate have no understanding of what small business folks are going through and that most of us have never been faced with the reality of having no health insurance and therefore don t understand the plight of the small businessman  I come to dispel that rumor  I am a former small businessman who couldn t afford the cost of health insurance for myself or for my employees    My wife and I discussed options for ourselves and for our employees  Similar to many other small business owners across the country  we decided it would be better to raise our employees  rate of pay and allow them to purchase their own individual plans  My wife and I decided to begin setting aside our own savings account to pay for health care costs in case  for some reason or another  I had an incident or she had an incident where we needed to go to the hospital and thus needed health care coverage    Being a veterinarian and lifting heavy dogs onto the exam table all the time  and not expecting the dog owner to pick up the other half of a giant breed such as a Great Dane  I ended up having back problems and had to have back surgery  I didn t have health insurance  but I paid for it myself out of my own pocket  Fortunately  my wife and I had the foresight to set aside a savings plan so that if something such as this did happen  we could pay for it  But it did set us back     We were able to survive that particular incident  It was kind of an interesting thing  what happened to me when I went to go to the hospital  The administrators didn t want me to go into the hospital  The hospital would not let us in because we did not have health insurance  I said  Well  I will pay for it  When we got in there  I had the surgery  and I did very well  and I am very active today  The doctors did a great job on surgery  When we checked out of the hospital  the administrator said that they would reduce our costs by 20 percent because they did not have to deal with the paperwork and with the cost of having to process my claim  So much of the paperwork is driven by trying to protect the hospital  the doctors  and the administrators from frivolous lawsuits  That has been my personal experience    I must admit I was disappointed when  earlier in the week  Members of the Senate chose to side with trial lawyers instead of women and children  And I was disappointed that Members of the Senate decided to support turning the medical profession into a cash cow for the legal profession instead of allowing for legitimate compensation    Again  in a matter of minutes  we will be debating the small business health plans bill and another attempt to bring down the high cost of health care  specifically for working class families who are employed by small businesses that  similar to my own situation  cannot afford to provide health insurance for their employees    I think it is important for us to focus this debate on at least giving small businesses the opportunity to make a choice on providing health care for themselves and for their employees  Currently  because of the prohibitive cost of health care coverage for their employees  many small business employers don t even have the option of offering coverage    Some of my constituents have brought to my attention over the past few weeks their worries that because of the lack of insurance benefit mandates  they could lose important benefits such as diabetes services and supplies  and coverage of preventive services such as colorectal screenings and mammograms  These worries are unfounded  Today there are over 1 800 different State mandates for health care coverage  including different coverage mandates in different States for the same preventive care  services  and supplies  This huge variation in mandates has made it nearly impossible to provide standardized coverage on a national basis    Additionally  the Government Accountability Office  which is an agency which helps to watch our dollars  has also found that the cost of mandates to a typical plan results in an increase between 5 and 22 percent  The Congressional Budget Office  another dollar watching agency  estimates that for every 1 percent increase in insurance costs  a minimum of 200 000 Americans are left uninsured    Facts suggest that things such as diabetes services and supplies and preventive services such as mammograms and colorectal screenings are usually covered by health plans  regardless of the State mandates  For example  the five most populous States require that diabetes care be covered  According to the American Diabetic Association and the GAO  only 4 out of 50 States do not require diabetic coverage    The General Accounting Office also studied States that are not subject to mandated coverages of diabetic services and supplies  Despite not being subject to mandated requirements for coverage  several of the largest plans and many of the largest Fortune 500 companies provide comprehensive coverage for diabetes care    This factual evidence also applies to preventive services such as cancer screening  The Government Accountability Office found that the majority of States that do not have mandates continue to provide coverage in a majority of their employer plans for cancer screening    The bottom line is that the small business health plan bill makes logical sense  It will give small business owners what they want and what they need  and they will offer insurance coverage for their employees  It makes logical sense that plans covering preventive care will be offered because preventive care costs less in the long run  It makes logical sense that small business owners who currently cannot provide their employees with health care would purchase coverage because it is more affordable    It is important to note at this point that a small business owner who buys health care coverage is also naturally subject to the same health care coverage that he provides his employees  Small business owners are pushing for health insurance coverage for themselves and their employees  which they otherwise could not afford  It is not logical that they would pay money for a plan that does not provide them with medical coverage  Also  the point of small business health plans is so that small businesses can join together to use joint collaboration to get their health care needs met    I support the legislation because I support giving small businesses a choice  I support giving small businesses the opportunity for health care coverage that they currently do not receive  I support giving diabetics the opportunity for health care coverage  instead of leaving them completely without services and supplies  I support giving small business employees the opportunity for cancer screening and preventive care  instead of leaving them with nothing and no opportunity to provide health care for themselves and their families    I urge my colleagues to support the small business health plans legislation  and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senate bill 1955  the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act  I urge my fellow Senators to give small businesses the opportunity to access health care for themselves and their employees    Mr  President  I yield the floor  and I suggest the absence of a quorum
