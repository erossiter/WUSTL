                                                                                                                                                                                                                   OP ED Ethics Reform Requires An Independent  Bipartisan Commission by U S  Senator          February 6th  2006   American democracy cannot function without public trust and confidence in government  Unfortunately  it appears that some members of Congress have violated the trust of their constituents  While it is clear that our system of oversight brought these alleged crimes to light  it also is apparent that Congress can and should do more to demonstrate to the American people that we are conducting the public  s business in a manner that is above reproach     The public deserves nothing less than a comprehensive review of the policies and procedures that govern our dealings with lobbyists    a review that is completely separate from the political process     To that end  I am co sponsoring a bipartisan bill  along with Senator Norm Coleman  R Minnesota  and Senator Ben Nelson  D Nebraska  to create the Commission to Strengthen Confidence in Congress  CSCC   a bipartisan  independent commission which would recommend reforms to strengthen Congressional ethics  disclosure and transparency requirements that govern the relationship between members of Congress and lobbyists   I believe the creation of an independent commission  made up of respected individuals who are beholden to no one but the American people  is the best way to approach ethics reform   Specifically  the bill proposes the CSCC be composed of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats who will be chosen by both the House and Senate leadership of both parties  That panel will be charged with issuing its first report containing findings  conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures on July 1  2006  with annual reports thereafter  The Commission will also be given the authority to hold hearings in order to carry out its duties  as well as subpoena authority  to ensure that its findings result in the best possible recommendations   I have been thinking about and working on Congressional reform for more than a decade   In 1992 I served on the Joint Committee on Congressional Reform  formed in the wake of the House banking scandal  which recommended many of the reforms that were incorporated into the Contract with America  I believe now  as I did then  that we can always do a better job of protecting our constituents   interests  Establishing a Congressional ethics reform commission apart from the one upmanship currently rampant on Capitol Hill would be a healthy  and long overdue  step for the legislative branch of our government     These are complicated issues  and we need to seriously consider how these changes would affect the public  s access here on Capitol Hill  For instance  if someone sends me  unsolicited  a book they have written because they want to share their insights into a particular issue  should I be required to return that book because it violates an absolute ban on gifts to members of Congress  Would that kind of ban violate the freedom of speech rights of the person who wanted to give me the book  not to mention an individual citizen  s right to communicate with his elected representatives  These are the kinds of questions this commission would have to ponder   Reform proposals that are distanced from current elected officials and proposed by neutral arbiters can help to restore the public  s trust in the rules and procedures under which Congress governs its self    We should explore any potential changes judiciously so that we are not impeded from doing the job we were elected to do  We cannot be insular while serving the American people  Lobbying on behalf of constituents and special interests is entirely legal and a legitimate part of any debate in a democracy such as ours  A bunker mentality in the Senate and House of Representatives will not somehow make us perform our duties better  I believe it would only shield us from those who want their voices to be heard     I know that there is a pressing need to restore the public  s confidence in our legislative process  The most crucial reform we could enact would be to increase the disclosure and transparency requirements for members of Congress as they go about their task of making laws   I long have advocated for full disclosure  in any number of reform proposals  and the situation today is no different  We must continue to enforce the rules and laws that already apply in these areas  and look at new ways to make this information more readily available to the public  Sunshine is and will continue to be the best disinfectant for business on Capitol Hill    is the senior senator from Colorado                              February 2006 Press Releases
