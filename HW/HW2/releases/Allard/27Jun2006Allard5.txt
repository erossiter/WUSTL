                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Flag Protection Amendment          June 27th  2006   Mr  President  I rise today  the 27th day of June  2006  between Flag Day and Independence Day  to speak on behalf of the American Flag    The American flag is a symbol  a physical embodiment of the freedom and liberty that we as Americans are blessed to claim   More than a mere banner of red  white  and blue  our flag characterizes the fundamental essence of what it means to be an American  liberty  justice  and equality     Whether flown at a high school football game  in an Olympic arena  or over this very building that we stand in today  the American flag is an image that commands world wide respect  while at the time symbolizing the triumph of representative government over the inequities of tyrannical rule     To allow for the physical desecration of such a symbol of opportunity and liberty is not quite tantamount to condoning an assault on the very foundation of our individual freedoms  but so close as to have damaging effects   Strength in symbolism can oftentimes rely upon the extent to which an image is protected by the society it represents  which is why this is not an issue pertaining to freedom of expression  but rather an issue of patriotic reverence and national identity     The American flag has done more than wave as a symbol of freedom  it has served as an inspiration  a guiding light to our men and women in uniform throughout our nation  s history    On New Year  s Eve  1776  just seven months before the signing of our Declaration of Independence  George Washington and the Continental Army were laying siege to the British occupied Boston   In the midst of battle  Washington recognized the need to present a unifying symbol to his own troops  as well as the need to commemorate the birth of our truly unique sense of American pride  Inspired with the fortitude of his continental troops  Washington ordered the hoisting of the Grand Union flag   This was one of the first instances where our flag became more than a symbol of independence  but the physical representation of an ideal stemming from the innate human desire for freedom    On June 14  1777  almost a year and a half after George Washington raised the Grand Union flag over Prospect Hill  the Continental Congress passed an act that officially gave America a flag   Though the intricacies of the design have changed several times in our nation  s history  the principles that it represents have never faded    Patrick Henry aptly summed up this uniquely American commitment to personal liberty by stating    I know not what course others may take but as for me  give me liberty or give me death      President Calvin Coolidge once commented    We do honor to the stars and stripes as the emblem of our country and the symbol of all that our patriotism means      Henry and Coolidge spoke of a liberty that was fought for  and won by the sacrifice of thousands of our American sons and daughters  As it stands today  the American flag is a monument to their heroic effort  and a testament to the price those serving our country are willing to pay for our freedom        With the 230th birthday of our nation fast approaching  we will undoubtedly see even more American flags on display in front yards  on top of skyscrapers  and in the hands of people celebrating the birth of our nation  While many of these patriotic displays will coincide with the festivities of this national holiday weekend  the unifying message behind every one of these flags is that we as Americans understand the power behind our national symbol    It is time that we  as the nation  s legislature  restored the ability of the American people to protect the flag as the symbol of our country  This ability has been eroded over the years by judicial decisions that have stripped away the people  s right to protect the American flag and all that it stands to represent    This sentiment has garnered wide support across the nation  as is evidenced by all 50 states passing resolutions calling upon Congress to enact some constitutional protections for the flag  In each of the past five Congresses  the House has passed a constitutional amendment designed to protect the flag from all forms of desecration  with the latest measure passing almost a year ago by a vote of 286 to 130  Here in the Senate  we came up only 4 votes short of the required two thirds majority in 2000    Today  we stand closer than ever to passing this vital constitutional provision  Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns regarding the potential First Amendment ramifications of passing this initiative  First of all  this amendment does not ban anything  It simply restores the authority of Congress  the representatives of the American people  to pass a flag desecration statute if it chooses    Second  even if such a statute were subsequently passed  it would not place a restriction on the content of the speech  only on the means by which the speaker wishes to communicate  Someone seeking to burn the flag would still retain their right to express any political viewpoint they wish to advance  They would  however  not have the ability to desecrate the flag as a substitute for other forms of expressive conduct     This is why the resolution was reported out of the Judiciary Committee with broad support originating from both sides of the aisle  This bipartisan support is evidence that this issue transcends all political ideology  and to me  this unity could not have come at a more critical moment in history    Internationally  our enemies have consistently used the desecration and burning of our flag to symbolize plight of international democracy at the hands of Islamist tyranny  Domestically  Americans are daily assaulted with media images of home grown extremists groups burning the American flag in an attempt to speak out against the actions of their government  The irony  however  is not lost on the American people when they see these political ideologues desecrate the very symbol that gives them the right to speak in the first place    This tendency to overshadow our flag  s positive symbolism with negative contextual imagery is the reason why the majority of Americans support this amendment  We understand the power of this national symbol  we believe in the principles that our flag represents  and we know that past generations have fought and died to ensure that those principles resonate well into the future    I ask the Senate to stand in unity with the American people and the 50 states  and ask them to not let this opportunity pass us by without acting to protect this still vibrant national symbol
