                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dr  Condoleezza Rice Nomination          January 25th  2005   Mr  President   I rise today in strong support of President Bush  s nominee for Secretary of State  Dr  Condoleezza Rice   I would also ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in approving this nominee so that she can assist President Bush in making his vision of a more secure  democratic  and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community a reality   As many already know  Dr  Rice was born and raised in Alabama   In 1969 her father moved their family to Colorado to take an academic position at the University of Denver   Dr  Rice soon enrolled in Denver  s St  Mary s Academy  an independent Catholic school and the first integrated school she attended    After high school  she earned her bachelor s degree in political science  cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa  from the University of Denver in 1974 and returned a few years later to get her Ph D  from the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver in 1981   Dr  Rice may have only spent a few years in the Colorado  but we in Colorado are certainly proud of what she has accomplished and like to consider her a daughter of the Centennial State   Clearly  Condoleezza Rice is eminently qualified for the post of Secretary of State   I know many of my colleagues are aware of her years at Stanford University  including her service as Provost   In addition  she served on the National Security Council during George H W  Bush  s administration as Director of Soviet and Eastern European Affairs   which witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall   She has come full circle since then and again served on the National Security Council  but this time as the National Security Advisor to our current President  and has done a magnificent job during very turbulent times      Since then  Dr  Rice has consistently provided the President with sound advice on national security and foreign policies  She has been balanced  fair  and determined to ensure that President Bush received the best possible advice   Some have questioned Dr  Rice  s role as National Security Advisor  and how she shaped the Bush Administration  s policy since the tragedy of September 11th  2001  specifically our action against the Saddam Hussein regime   I believe she was instrumental in encouraging the President to utilize every diplomatic approach possible   We should not forget that President Bush went to the United Nations  secured a Security Council Resolution demanding disarmament  and worked with our closest allies to ensure Saddam Hussein complied with his obligations   The President also sought authorization from this Congress  which over three quarters of this body supported   Unfortunately  Saddam Hussein would not keep his end of the bargain and we were left with no choice but military action   I am thankful during this turbulent period that Dr  Rice ensured the President received advice from multiple view points  so that he could make the bold decisions necessary for our security   The Hussein regime is now out of power   The former dictator and killer of thousands is sitting in prison  and the first democratic elections in Iraq are about to take place   Our Nation is more secure because a dangerous regime with a history of aggression and links to terrorist organizations is no longer in power   Today  America has demonstrated its resolve in the Global War on Terror  American troops and their Coalition allies have achieved this historic effort thanks to their sacrifice  As democracy in Iraq succeeds  a message will be sent forth that freedom can be the future of every nation  and that freedom improves the peace and security of the United States   I am certain Dr  Rice will present this powerful message abroad with skill and determination   Just as importantly  Dr  Rice understands that successfully fighting the war on terror is not solely a military task   Dr  Rice will seek to use our powerful diplomatic leverage to better protect our nation   She will also guide our nation  s diplomatic efforts to solve regional and civil conflicts   in the Middle East  between Israel and its Arab neighbors  in Sudan  Congo  and Liberia  in the Balkans  in Cyprus  in Haiti  in Northern Ireland and elsewhere  Her leadership in the important multilateral discussions with the North Koreans on their pursuit for weapons of mass destruction will be pivotal     There are also other challenges which Dr  Rice must tackle with our social and economic development programs that the State Department manages   The promotion of free trade and investment worldwide  the fight against HIV AIDS  and the implementation of the Millennium Challenge Account are but a few ways that we can seek to provide our friends and allies around the globe with much needed stability and vitality   When the President announced his intent to nominate Dr  Rice to be Secretary of State  he spoke of relying on her counsel  benefitting from her experience  and appreciating her sound and steady judgement   I am pleased that President Bush has sought to replace our current Secretary of State  Colin Powell  with another so well equipped for the challenges that lie ahead   And I would be remiss if I did not thank Secretary Powell for his service to our great nation   He has given so much of himself while serving during his long and distinguished military career before finally leading the Department of State   These two Americans are two of our best   We are privileged that while Secretary Powell steps down to pursue new challenges  the United States has someone of Dr  Rice  s credentials to continue to carry the torch of liberty abroad   I urge my colleagues to confirm Condoleezza Rice as our 66th Secretary of State     Mr  President  I yield the floor                              January 2005 Press Releases
