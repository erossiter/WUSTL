                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Budget Point of Order Against the Immigration Bill          May 24th  2006   Mr  President   I have grave concerns with the effects of this bill on the future of this country  not the least of which is its potential fiscal impact   At the conclusion of my remarks  I will be raising the point of order that this bill violates Section 407 of the Budget Resolution   Section 407 reads    it shall not be in order to consider any bill  joint resolution  amendment  motion  or conference report that would cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of  5 billion in any of the four 10 year periods beginning in 2016 through 2055      The Congressional Budget Office issued a May 16  2006 cost estimate explicitly stating   enacting S  2611 would cause an increase in direct spending greater than  5 billion in each of the 10 year periods between 2016 and 2055      Mr  President  the fiscal impact of this bill can be summed up in two words  BUDGET BUSTER   The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimates that this legislation would increase direct spending by  54 billion over the next ten years  While it is estimated to increase only  13 billion over the first five years  during the course of the second five years  it is expected to skyrocket up another  41 billion as the amnesty provisions begin to kick in   Conveniently for the authors of the bill  CBO  s cost estimate stops there  See  under the bill  illegal immigrants have a six year waiting period from enactment to establish legal permanent resident status  Then  after another five years they can become citizens  Thus  in the 11th year  conveniently just out of reach of CBO  s analysis  millions of people who entered this country illegally will be granted citizenship    Where the CBO leaves off  the Heritage Foundation picks up  They estimate that the additional cost to the federal government of providing benefits to the individuals granted amnesty under this bill is around  16 billion annually   On top of that  when an individual is granted citizenship  he is entitled to bring his spouse  minor children  and parents into the country  Once in the country  these individuals would be eligible to receive social services and government funded medical care  Then  after five years  they could become citizens whereupon they could be eligible for Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid  at an average cost of  18 000 per person per year    The Heritage Foundation study provides this example  if only ten percent of the parents of those receiving amnesty under this bill became citizens and enrolled in the aforementioned government programs  the extra costs to government would be over  30 billion per year   Obviously  we cannot predict how many spouses  children  and parents of those granted amnesty will come into the country  One thing is for certain  the pool is enormous and the potential long term effects staggering   All of this takes place against the existing backdrop of runaway federal spending  Entitlement spending alone is on pace to exceed total government revenues before the end of this century    With the looming retirement of the baby boomers  we are grappling with how to pay for existing entitlement programs  The last thing we need to do is grow federal spending by potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to provide benefits to millions of people who entered our country illegally    This stands in contravention to the rule of law and is unfair to the American taxpayer   As a member of the Senate Budget Committee  I feel that it is my duty to bring to the attention of my colleagues  as well as the American people  the staggering impact this piece of legislation will have on the fiscal health of this country  This issue has not been thoughtfully considered in the Senate and I bring it to your attention today in hopes that we will do so   It would be irresponsible of me  not to mention a violation of my personal duty to the American taxpayer  to stand idly by while my colleagues enact a bill that drives a dagger in the heart of this country  s fiscal health    Therefore  Mr  President  I raise a point of order that the pending bill violates section 407 b  of H  Con  Res  95  the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006                              May 2006 Press Releases
