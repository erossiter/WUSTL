          OP ED  Bark Beele Danger Must Be Dealt with Immediately by U S  Senator          October 25th  2005   Coloradans are sitting on top of a tinder box  and it  s not because Congress and the U S  Forest Service haven  t been paying attention  Right now  7 4 million trees on 1 5 million acres of National Forest system lands in Colorado have been destroyed by bark beetles  according to Forest Service researchers  This enormous addition of beetle infected dead trees literally adds fuel to the fire  given the thousands of other hazardous fuel acres in Colorado  This spells trouble if we do not deal with it quickly   The Colorado counties hardest hit by the beetle infestation include Jackson  Routt and Larimer in the north  Grand  Pitkin  Summit  Park and Chaffee in the west  and Gunnison  Saguache  Huerfano  Archuleta  San Miguel  Montrose and Ouray in the south and southwest   Many of us who experienced the Mountain Pine beetle epidemic in the 1980s in the Front Range foothills remember the severe devastation of Ponderosa pine  Today  several conditions exist that combine to create a potentially dangerous situation not just on the Front Range  but across broad areas of our state  We have experienced a lengthy drought  there are thousands of acres of hazardous fuels in Colorado forests  and the number of additional homes built in the mountains over the past 25 years is astronomical  We can only expect an increase in the forest land devastated in 2005 while the current epidemic of bark beetle infestation continues    The most obvious hazards caused by this situation are its potential for devastating wildfires and or flooding  If such a fire occurred adjacent to mountain communities surrounded by beetle killed trees  the result would be deadly as well as very damaging to property  Colorado Water District managers are concerned about potential disruption of much of the state  s drinking water supply by erosion  flooding and excessive sedimentation such as that following the Hayman fire in 2002  Much of the beetle affected area encompasses the Western Slope watershed   Stressed trees are more vulnerable to these pests  and drought and overcrowded stands have combined to cause conditions ideal to sustain epidemic levels of the beetle for some time to come   To make matters worse  there are few viable options for dealing with the current bark beetle infestation  Spraying has never been feasible for large scale use  although it may be used for treating individual trees on private property  Beetles will fly to greener pastures  or woods in this case  when their food source is no longer available  i e  once they  ve eaten all the trees    Dealing quickly with the large amount of existing dead wood in our forests is imperative  How  then  do we dispose of what has to be removed  Removal of dead trees by prescribed fire  the harvest of timber for firewood  sawing the large scale logs and the processing of small diameter forest products such as fence poles are our best bets   I am very concerned about the current situation in Colorado  In 2002  I co sponsored and pushed strongly for passage of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act   This legislation has empowered the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service to utilize an alternative  streamlined process for reducing the amount of dangerous fuels that the beetles feast on so destructively   Unfortunately  the streamlined procedures passed by Congress were recently struck down by a Federal District Court in California  even though several similar lawsuits by the same litigant resulted in failure  I intend to support my colleagues who are already crafting responses to this short sighted ruling  which is hamstringing the Forest Service and preventing it from acting to resolve this serious problem confronting our state  Should those efforts fail  I intend to offer legislation to correct the unnecessary bureaucratic burden imposed by the California decision   More recently  I worked as a member of the Interior Appropriations Committee to secure  2 59 billion for the National Fire Plan  This funding specifically targets wildfire protection measures  Also  I supported the Energy Bill passed last summer  which authorizes grants for producing energy from biomass fuels that are removed from forests to reduce wildfire risks     Any long term solution needs to be developed and embraced by all affected federal and state agencies  local governments  industries and residents of the affected communities   And there is one more barrier to a speedy resolution of this risky situation  We also need to look at ways to encourage industry to make investments in Colorado to process the wood that needs to be removed for safety  s sake  Many former milling operators and product plants have abandoned Colorado for lack of timber  the result of previous  failed federal land management policies  I support providing economic incentives to small operators because they are a vital part of the larger solution to restoring a market for forest products in Colorado    I will continue to work with local elected officials  the federal agencies involved  such as the Forest Service  and citizens to find additional solutions to combat the beetle epidemic  We have no choice but to protect our communities now  We cannot continue to wring our hands and perform studies  We know what the problem is  and we know what the possibilities are for dealing with it  We need to continue to provide the BLM and Forest Service with the tools necessary to effectively manage our forests     is Colorado  s senior senator  and lives in Loveland                              October 2005 Press Releases
