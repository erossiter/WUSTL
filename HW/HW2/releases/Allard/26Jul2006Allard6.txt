                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act          July 26th  2006   Mr  President  I rise in support of S  3711  which is the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  I am heartened by the fact that this is a bipartisan effort  agreed to by those Senators who represent our Gulf States  It is an important step in continuing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and we need to increase our supply of domestic oil and gas  Certainly  this is a step in the right direction    My approach to the energy needs of this country has always been that we need to have a broad based approach  I was pleased with the Energy bill we passed in the last session of Congress which provided for a broad approach to meet our energy needs in this country    I think we understood as a body that in order to meet the short term needs of this country s energy needs  we need to continue to rely on fossil fuels  We need to continue to expand exploration for oil and gas  We need to continue to rely on coal  But in addition  we also need to be looking at additional sources of energy  particularly the renewable energy area  which is wind  solar  geothermal  and biofuels  as well as looking at sources such as hydroelectric and nuclear power     As I look back on the effects of that bill we passed last session  I am already beginning to see positive effects from that legislation  and I am heartened by that  I can see those energy developments occurring in my own State  which involves new technologies  such as looking at oil shale as a source of a high grade fuel that requires little refinement    Our current energy prices clearly still indicate that all is not well with supply  and the demand is still greater than supply  We need to also look at conservation  But right now with this bill  we are concerning ourselves with supply    While the price of natural gas is well below what it was this time last year  these prices are still well above what we were paying several years ago  and  as my colleague from Missouri mentioned  it is having an adverse impact throughout our economy  not the least of which it is having a serious adverse impact on our agricultural sector    I believe the fact that prices have decreased at all is directly due to the fact that we passed the Energy Policy Act last year  We have all seen the figures  27 new ethanol plants have broken ground  401 E 85 fueling pumps have been installed  These are pumps that provide an ethanol gasoline mixture  And the number of hybrid vehicles has increased  Between now and the year 2020  the 15 new efficiency standards included in the bill will save 50 000 megawatts of energy  and the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources has increased dramatically  But we need to do more to encourage domestic production of oil and gas    It is argued  and I think argued well  that we should be reducing our energy consumption and increasing the amounts of energy we get from renewable and alternative sources  I agree  But the reality is that reducing consumption and increasing alternative resources does not happen overnight  I cannot ask my constituents to park the car and turn off the lights until we get there    The estimates of the resources that will be made available under this proposal are 1 26 billion barrels of oil and 5 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas  These are not insignificant amounts  These resources will provide a strong source of domestic energy for our country    I believe that the compromise struck by this bill is a good one  The fact that almost every Member who represents a coastal State that is affected cosponsored this bill strikes me as significant  I strongly believe in local control  and as part of that  I often defer to Members who represent a State if a bill will directly affect that State  I use the example of wilderness designation  If a bill designating wilderness in a certain State is sponsored and supported by both Members of that State  I see no reason not to support it  The same is true here  If the Members from the coastal States are supportive of this bill  I support them    I was hopeful that we would have the chance to address an amendment I wanted to offer on funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program  This particular program is extremely important to States  such as Colorado  that have a high percentage of federally owned land  Many people are unaware of the fact that 35 percent of Colorado is owned by the Federal Government  Federal ownership of these lands can be beneficial  but there is an unseen cost to local communities  to local governments  The Federal Government does not pay property taxes  and this translates into reduced revenue for local governments while there are some costs that they are burdened with in trying to meet the needs of the Federal agencies that are in that county or local community    For Colorado  it means  129 million each year in lost property tax revenue  This is funding that could be used for education  law enforcement efforts or road building  Unfortunately  PILT  or payment in lieu of taxes  is chronically underfunded  and the amendment I planned on offering would have helped to overcome this annual shortfall    Regardless of the fact that my amendment will not be considered  I am pleased that we are moving on this bill  I am hopeful that we can continue to put in place policies that will allow us to increase domestic production of all energy sources which will  in turn  reduce our reliance on foreign sources
