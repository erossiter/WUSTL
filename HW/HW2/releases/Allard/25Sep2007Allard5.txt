                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT   Designating September 25  2007 as National First Responder Appreciation Day          September 25th  2007   Mr  President   I rise today to recognize our nation  s first responders  I  along with Senators McCain and Casey  introduced Senate Resolution 215  recognizing today  September 25th  2007 as National First Responder Appreciation Day  The Senate acted quickly and passed this resolution by unanimous consent with a total of 33 cosponsors   The contributions that our nation  s 1 1 million firefighters  670 000 police officers and over 890 000 emergency medical professionals make in our communities are familiar to us all   We see the results of their efforts every night on our TV screens and read about them everyday in the paper   From recent tornados in the Southeast and wildfires in the West in 2007 and the Christmas blizzard in Colorado in 2006  to the tragic events at Virginia Tech  Columbine High School  Platte Canyon High School  and the wrath of Hurricane Katrina  our   first responders    regularly risk their lives to protect property  uphold the law and save the lives of others   Nationwide  many of our first responders take the call on a daily basis and are exposed to life threatening situations  While performing their jobs many first responders have made the ultimate sacrifice     According to Craig Floyd  Chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund  a total of 1 649 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty during the past 10 years  an average of 1 death every 53 hours or 165 per year  and 145 law enforcement officers were killed in 2006   In addition  according to the United States Fire Administration  from 1996 through 2005 over 1500 firefighters were killed in the line of duty  and tens of thousands were injured   It is also important to note that 4 in 5 medics are injured on the job  more than 1 in 2  52 percent  have been assaulted by a patient and 1 in 2  50 percent  have been exposed to an infectious disease  and emergency medical service personnel in the United States have an estimated fatality rate of 12 7 per 100 000 workers  more than twice the national average  and most emergency medical service personnel deaths in the line of duty occur in ambulance accidents    Yet to recognize our first responders only for their sacrifices would be to ignore the everyday contributions that they make in communities throughout America   In addition to battling fires  firefighters perform important fire prevention and public education duties  like teaching our children how to be   fire safe      Police officers don  t simply arrest criminals    they actively prevent crime and make our neighborhoods safer and more livable   And if we or our loved ones experience a medical emergency  EMTs are there at a moments notice to provide life saving care   Last Saturday  I hosted a First Responder Appreciation Day in Northern Colorado  and was overwhelmed by the support shown to our first responders by the public  Farmers  ranchers  small business owners and members of the community alike  thanked their firefighters  paramedics  sheriff deputies and police officers for being there at a moments notice to lend a hand while putting their own safety at risk  As a practicing veterinarian in rural Colorado  I can attest to the numerous times I called on first responders to help me get through a situation   In many ways  our first responders embody the very best of the American spirit   With charity and compassion  these brave men and women regularly put the well being of others before their own  often times at great personal risk   Through their actions they have become heroes to many   Through their example they are role models to all of us   To all of our first responders    Thank you for your service   I ask my colleagues to please join me today in recognizing September 25th as National First Responder Appreciation Day as we honor first responders for their contributions  sacrifices and dedication to public service                              September 2007 Press Releases
