                                                                                                                                                                                                                   STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD  Commemorating the 1997 Spring Creek Flood in Fort Collins By U S  Senator          July 26th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    Mr  President  I rise in commemoration of the Spring Creek Flood in Fort Collins  Colorado which occurred 10 years ago this weekend  As the rains began to fall on the evening of July 27  1997 it would have been hard for anyone to believe that this seemingly typical summer afternoon storm would wreak havoc on the city      All told  14 5 inches fell on Fort Collins within a 31 hour period of time  Composite rainfall patterns indicated that over 10 inches of rain blanketed a 30 square mile area of northern Colorado  This flood took the lives of five Fort Collins residents and forced over 400 to be rescued from the rising waters  severely damaged or destroyed approximately 2 000 homes and businesses across the city  caused over  200 million in damage  including the near destruction of Colorado State University  s library  The storm derailed a train and caused buildings to explode  This was not something this college town was used to experiencing  Those residents who were fortunate enough to be unaffected by the flood that night awoke to the sounds of helicopters  massive road closures  and local schools converted into Red Cross shelters  For a place that occasionally made national news by appearing on lists for   best place to live    and   most restaurants per capita     this sudden and shocking destruction was not the reason why the people of Fort Collins ever imagined their town would be the top story on all the news networks    As quickly as the rains came that night  and continued through most of the following day  it was all over  Sadly  like the pictures we all vividly remember of recent natural disasters in the United States  many wondered aloud in Fort Collins 10 years ago how this could have happened here  As the small creeks that flowed peacefully along the sides of bike trails and through the parks and baseball fields of the city suddenly swelled and transformed into violent streams of water that engulfed so much  it seemed probable that this city of about 110 000 residents would  be permanently affected by this storm for a long time to come  For a community that had experienced tremendous expansion and job growth through the 1990  s  due considerably to the rise of the tech boom   it appeared the good times had come to an end  With so much infrastructures in disrepair  it seemed unlikely that companies would continue to expand to Fort Collins in the manner they had been doing over the years preceding the flood     What had long been  and continues to be  the heart of Fort Collins  Colorado State University  received the brunt of the damage  Just five weeks prior to the start of classes  a 7 foot wall of water that had concentrated its strength through the run off of many smaller floods tore through the main campus  36 buildings sustained significant damage  most especially the newly remodeled Morgan Library and the Lory Student Center  Rain water  sewage and debris rushed through the library and destroyed about 425 000 books and journals  about one quarter of the library  s inventory  As school began that year  the students and professors adapted to more nomadic life  but worked together  as they all faced the same obstacles    As time moved on  CSU began to recover from the flood  the Morgan Library was rebuilt and CSU took the opportunity to update its electronic resources  making them state of the art  The drainage systems were updated and replaced  with walls and landscaping put in place to counter a flood six inches greater than what was experienced in 1997  As CSU recovered  the city did as well  Beautification and clean up efforts took place on a massive scale  stronger bridges were built  and creeks were redesigned to more evenly disperse water should this 500 year flood ever occur again  The community at large pitched in to clean up the parks and neighborhoods that were littered by debris  Local businesses  the school district  and CSU all continued to work together and leaned on each other to bring Fort Collins back    As the Colorado summer faded into fall and the days began getting shorter  the mounds of ruined furniture and rows of unusable refrigerators that lined the neighborhood sidewalks for so long slowly began disappearing from the city  s landscape and life started to get back to normal  Fort Collins has continued to grow over the last 10 years and so has CSU  Still  there are many reminders today of the storm  from the occasional open spaces that were simply wiped out by the flood and never rebuilt  to new buildings  roads and bridges that were built following the storm  to the glaring markers that line the Spring Creek Trail showing the water levels on that day 10 years ago    Sadly  Fort Collins   experience with flooding and tragedy is shared by many communities across the nation  most especially along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Mississippi  as many continue to struggle to find some semblance of normalcy almost two years after Katrina and Rita  Recently  we have seen massive floods throughout Texas and in the Midwest as well  particularly in Kansas and Missouri  While all these events are all uniquely tragic  it is my hope that the devastation experienced in Fort Collins  Colorado 10 years ago can serve as an example to the many other communities across the country that are not as far removed from their storms  that there is a light at the end of the tunnel  and as insurmountable as a natural disaster may seem  life will and does go on                               July 2007 Press Releases
