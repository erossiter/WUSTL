  As we start the 110th Congress and embark on a two year journey to submit  consider  debate  improve and eventually pass legislation on behalf of the greater good of our constituents and the American people  I am introducing a package of legislative proposals that I believe will benefit Colorado and the country     said Allard    This is just the first phase of my legislative agenda  but

issuing his famous challenge to Soviet tyranny to be painted into the Capitol  alongside other significant scenes of our Nation  s past      I look forward to working with my colleagues on getting these bills through the legislative process and being able to show Coloradans that we in Washington are engaged on their behalf     said Allard    As the 110th Congress progresses  I will continue to work in a bipartisan manner on issues important to Colorado and the country                                 January 2007 Press Releases
