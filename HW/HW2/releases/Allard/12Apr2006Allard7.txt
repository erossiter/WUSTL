                                                                                                                                                                                                                   SENATOR ALLARD TROUBLED AFTER DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ANNOUNCES  IT WILL NOT MEET TREATY DEADLINE FOR PUEBLO  OTHER CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROJECTS          April 12th  2006   WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator   R Colorado  said Wednesday that the Department of Defense has officially notified Congress that the demilitarization of chemical weapons stored at the Pueblo Depot and other sites around the country will not be completed in time to comply with either the 2007 deadline or the five year extension provided under the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty     I am very disappointed because  if the work at Pueblo had continued uninterrupted over the past two years  it might have been possible for at least the Pueblo Depot site to have been completed in time for the 2012 extended treaty deadline  although work might have remained unfinished at the other sites    Senator Allard said      As it stands now  the Department of Defense is reporting that only 66 percent of the U S  stockpile of chemical weapons will have been destroyed by the extended treaty deadline     Senator Allard said        Under the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention  a signatory must notify the governing body of the Convention  the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  of its inability to comply with the 2007 treaty deadline one year in advance         The Department of State is expected to do so in the next two weeks     The Chemical Weapons Convention provides for a one time five year extension for those states unable to comply with the 2007 treaty deadline     The notification sent by the Department of Defense to Congress yesterday indicates that the Department will not be able to comply with either the 2007 or the 2012 extended deadline                        Under Section 1521 of Title 50 of the U S  code  50 USC 1521   the Department of Defense is required by law to notify Congress if the treaty deadline is not going to be met     Unfortunately  the Department did not provide any clear indication of a schedule for completion of the Pueblo project  in particular  and all the other demilitarization sites in general     Senator Allard said    I  ll be working to make sure that the Department of Defense isn  t using the treaty as a way to back out of its commitments to Pueblo or the other sites                 Since our obligations under the CWC Treaty will no longer be motivating the Department  we will need to step up our efforts to ensure the Department does not lose sight of the importance of the chem demil program     said Senator Allard        The last thing we want is for Department to think it can allow these projects to drag on forever       On a positive note  President Bush  s fiscal year 2007 budget request for the two Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives  ACWA  programs under development  one at the Pueblo Depot in Colorado and the other at the Blue Grass Depot in Kentucky  totaled  350 million     On the one hand  this year  s budget request was a significant step forward      But  as always  the proof is in the pudding     The DoD  s future funding request is the place where we are really short and where the greatest fight will surely take place     said Senator Allard        If the department comes through with a substantial future funding request this summer  then I will feel a lot better about this project and the department  s commitment to it                   Last year Senator Allard and Senator Mitch McConnell  R Kentucky  added a provision to the fiscal year 2005 Supplemental Appropriations Act that ensured that the  372 3 million in funding budgeted in earlier years would not be transferred from Pueblo or Blue Grass to other sites  In addition  it directed the Department of Defense to send at least  100 million to the ACWA sites within four months of the bill  s enactment  and prohibited the Department from conducting a study on the transportation of chemical weapons across state lines  That direction was fulfilled in September of 2005 when the Department of Defense provided  96 million for Pueblo and  4 million for Blue Grass                              April 2006 Press Releases
