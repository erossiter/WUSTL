                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on Recent Victories in the War on Terror          June 9th  2006   Mr  President    I would like to take time and discuss some recent events that are positive steps in the War on Terror for the United States and our allies abroad   The first is the announcement that U S  and foreign counterterrorism officials have worked together to make a series of arrests that appear to be linked to a web of Islamic extremists in Canada  the U S  and Europe   The recent death of Iraqi insurgent leader and Al Qaida member Abu Musab al Zarqawi is another   These are significant victories against those who wish our country harm    Last week  Canadian officials arrested 17 people for allegedly plotting to carry out a campaign of bombings  kidnappings and other terrorist acts in Ottawa and Toronto  The arrests were made possible by the monitoring of Internet chat rooms and email accounts tied to suspected Islamic extremists   The arrests came after three tons of ammonium nitrate  a common garden fertilizer that s easily transformed into an explosive  was allegedly purchased from undercover officers   Two of 17 suspected terrorists were caught trying to smuggle guns and ammunition from the United States into Canada via the Peace Bridge last summer   These individuals were allegedly using the Internet to communicate with terrorist facilitators abroad  such as a 22 year old website operator with direct links to al Qaeda who was arrested by British police last October on charges of financing and supporting terrorist activities   Authorities believe the website operator was in contact with the individuals in the Canadian arrests  as well as two men in the U S   sharing surveillance videos and other information for potential terrorist attacks   Included in the surveillance videos were many Washington  DC landmarks   Also  just last Tuesday British police arrested an American student in London as he prepared to board a flight to Pakistan   He was wanted in New York for allegedly providing military equipment to people who took it to members of Osama bin Laden s terrorist organization in Pakistan  Authorities have not ruled out a connection to the Canadian arrests    Here in the U S   the New York and Atlanta Joint Terrorism Task Forces recently arrested two men in connection with an alleged terrorist plot  The plot included discussions about blowing up oil refineries and disabling navigational aids on airplanes  The investigation began when California police arrested two men for a gas station robbery  A subsequent search of their home turned up documents listing the addresses of U S  military recruiting stations  the Israeli Consulate  and synagogues in the Los Angeles area  The investigation eventually revealed the existence of a terrorist cell that had been spawned by a small radical group operating in Folsom Prison who considered themselves the   al Qaeda of California      American counterterrorism officials are joining forces with their colleagues around the world to unravel intricate webs of terrorist organizations that would do us great harm if not for the efforts of these counter terror experts   I commend them for their efforts to discover terrorist plots and bring them to a stop before they are carried out   Much further from home  but still close to our hearts are the brave men and women of our armed forces deployed in the Middle East and Afghanistan   I thank our servicemen and servicewomen in the U S  armed forces for their on going service to their country  their commitment to American ideals  and their determination to win the Global War on Terror   We need to continually express our gratitude to the families of the U S  military personnel  especially those families who have lost loved ones during our most recent deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan     Most importantly  our armed forces continue to seek out terrorists to disrupt their plans both in the Middle East and abroad   They also continue to provide support and guidance to the Iraqi and Afghani people in their newborn democracies   With their steadfast courage  our citizens in uniform have taken the battle to the enemy and achieved success    Their most recent victory was the elimination of insurgent leader and Al Qaeda member Abu Musab al Zarqawi   His death is an enormous blow to those who continue to terrorize the Iraqi people   Zarqawi  whom Osama Bin Laden has heaped praise upon  has lead a horrific campaign against our troops in Iraq and against the Iraqi people   I am thankful to say that this mass murderer will no longer be able to carry on attempts at undermining the Iraqi national government and the Coalition     Of note in his demise is the international cooperation that spearheaded the operation   After receiving tips and intelligence of his location from Jordanian sources  Coalition forces killed Zarqawi and many of his lieutenants yesterday in an air strike   It was this exchange of intelligence information between the United States and Jordan that helped to permanently end Zarqawi  s operations    I should also note that the Iraqi police were first on the scene after the air strike to help identify our success     Also  perhaps lost among this news yesterday was another announcement made by Prime Minister Al Maliki of Iraq that candidates have been named for important cabinet posts in the Iraqi government   After much negotiation  consensus picks were made to fill the Defense and Interior Ministries  both key to a more secure and stable Iraq   Much of our success depends on the men and women forming the Iraqi government  and these are important steps to meeting the security challenges   The recent announcements in Iraq and our international counterterrorism efforts  while significant  are only small victories in the overall Global War on Terror   There are more extremists who will line up to preach against democracy and freedom   There are still those that will attack the free people of this world and want to do us much harm     After news of Zarqawi  s death  the forces of al Qaida in Iraq vowed publicly to continue their so called   holy war    on innocent civilians   They have stated  and I quote     The death of our leaders is life for us  It will only increase our persistence in continuing holy war so that the word of God will be supreme      In fact  only two hours after the Zarqawi announcement a bomb blew up in Baghdad killing at least nineteen people   It is clear that our success in Iraq against this enemy depends greatly on our continual cooperation with the Iraqi Government and the new ministers in charge of security there     The Global War on Terror has been a great challenge for our nation   Yet while the cost has been high  the cost of doing nothing would be even greater   And we cannot do this alone   Only with help of our neighbors  countrymen  and allies throughout the world can we assure that our democratic ideals defeat those of the terrorist extremists                              June 2006 Press Releases
