                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on Iraq          December 14th  2005   Last week I had the privilege of meeting privately with numerous soldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 2nd Infantry Division  which is stationed at Fort Carson  Colorado   These soldiers had just returned from their first tour in Iraq where they helped maintain the peace near the former terrorist hot bed of Fallujah    I spent over an hour talking with them about their experiences  asking them about their challenges  and hearing their thoughts about whether we should stay the course in Iraq     These soldiers spent the last year fighting the Iraqi terrorists  in some cases house to house   They helped train several Iraqi security units and participated in numerous reconstruction projects throughout central Iraq   Sadly  they lost 68 of their own while in Iraq   Yet  while they deeply mourn the loss of their comrades  they have no regrets about their time in Iraq       Indeed  if there was one thing I took away from my meeting with the soldiers of 2nd Brigade Combat Team  it was that each and every one of these soldiers was proud of their accomplishments in Iraq    They completed their mission well and helped thousands of Iraqis better understand the value of freedom and prosperity     And why shouldn  t these soldiers be proud of what they achieved   The progress we have made in Iraq is breath taking  and these soldiers have been a part of it         Mr  President  those who believe that the war in Iraq has become a quagmire certainly haven  t been paying attention    The President  s strategy is working and we are making progress     The reconstruction accomplishments in Iraq are staggering        Over 3 000 schools have been renovated and refurbished       133 000 primary school teachers    a third of Iraq  s educators    have received additional training and technical assistance       Primary school enrollment is up 19 percent from pre war levels       Nearly 250 health care centers have been renovated and another 563 have received new equipment           Over 2 500 primary health care workers have received training to better meet the Iraq  s health care needs        In 2005 alone  98 percent of Iraqi children between 1 and 5 years old have been immunized against measles  mumps  and rubella       More than 3 million Iraqis now have clean water  which was not adequately supplied before the war       More than 4 5 million Iraqis benefit from sewage disposal projects the United States has funded    Sewage in many areas of Iraq used to literally run down the streets          30 000 new businesses have registered with the Iraqi government in the past year alone       Iraqis are buying televisions  air conditioners  microwave ovens  and cell phones    all goods that were nearly impossible to buy unless you were one of Saddam  s cronies      The generation of electricity is significantly higher than prewar level  though this area remains a challenge because of the power consuming goods the Iraqis are buying    The training of Iraqi security forces is continuing at a brisk pace   Over 200 000 soldiers and policemen have been trained so far   As the soldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team at Fort Carson will tell you  some Iraqi units are highly competent and very capable   Other Iraqi units have a long way to go   Yet  progress is being made     Just in the last two weeks  Iraqi security forces conducted nearly 100 company level combat operations on their own without U S  assistance       Mr  President  on the political front  the progress in Iraq has been nothing short of amazing     As President Bush pointed out in his speech two days ago  Iraq was in the iron grip of a cruel dictator who murdered his own people  attacked his neighbors  and continued his decade long defiance of the United Nations just two and half years ago      Since then  the Iraqi people have assumed sovereignty of their own country  held free elections  put together a new constitution  and approved that constitution in a nation wide referendum     Tomorrow  Iraqis will again return to the voters booth for the third time in the last year    They will be choosing a new government under a new constitution  and they will be choosing democracy over tyranny     Hundreds of political parties representing every element of Iraqi society  including Sunni  Shittes  and Kurds  are participating in this highly competitive  completely unprecedented electoral race      Despite the constant danger of terror attacks  Iraq is buzzing in a campaign like atmosphere   Baghdad  Najaf  and Mosul are full of signs and posters   The television and radio are filled with political ads and commentary     Political rallies for candidates are being held around the country    Nothing the terrorists can do or say has stopped this march toward freedom and democracy   Like Shittes and Kurds  Sunni politicians are now coming under attack by the Iraqi terrorists   But the Sunnis now know that terror will never overcome the political momentum that has been gaining speed in Iraq    They know that an agenda of fear and tyranny will only lead to more death and destruction     And  they see that the future of Iraq lies not in the hateful ideology of extremism  but in freedom  prosperity and hope   Mr  President  the elections in Iraq are a sign of tremendous of political progress  but they are not the only sign    The development of the rule of law and building of new political institutions is just as important    if not more so     The United States is helping build an independent  impartial judiciary system capable of protecting all Iraqis  and is helping Iraqi lawmakers develop a body of law that will sustain Iraq through the challenges of the future      In particular  the trial of Saddam Hussein has shown all Iraqis that even the most despicable criminals deserve due process and an opportunity to prove their innocence under the law       Some have questioned whether the war in Iraq is really a part of the war against terror   Mr  President  the terrorists have made it abundantly clear that Iraq is central in their war against the civilized world     They have also made it clear that they will not stop with Iraq   They will strike Iraq  s neighbors as they did last month in Jordan   They will strike Europe as they did in the Madrid bombings   And  they will not hesitate to strike America again as they did on September 11th   The soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 2nd Infantry at Fort Carson understand the stakes of the war in Iraq   They know that if we run away  all of their work will go for naught   They know that if we give up  the lives of millions of Iraqis will be put at risk   And  they know that if we surrender  the fight the terrorists will be emboldened to hit us where it hurts the most    here in the United States   I applaud the soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team for their service to our nation and to the people of Iraq   They have every right to be proud of their achievements  as does every U S  soldier  sailor  airman  and marine who has helped bring freedom to Iraq   We owe the men and women in our armed forces a debt of gratitude    their courage and bravery has inspired me and should inspire every American                           Thank you  Mr  President for the opportunity to discuss this important issue  and I yield the floor                                              December 2005 Press Releases
