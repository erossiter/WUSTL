          SPEECH   Unmanned Aerial Vechicle Technology          March 19th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    Good morning   It is a pleasure to be here   I thank all of the sponsors and especially the Technology Training Corporation for hosting this important symposium and for giving me an opportunity to speak to you today     As a member of the Senate Appropriations and Budget Committees  as well as being a former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  I have had considerable interest in and have followed closely the development and continued integration of unmanned aerial vehicles into today  s military and civilian realm   In fact  I am proud to say that today within my home state of Colorado the Research and Engineering Center for Unmanned Vehicles at the University of Colorado is currently developing future UAV technology  Their research is driving them to integrate telecommunications  networks  robotics  and security  along with the traditional aerospace engineering disciplines of aerodynamics  structures  navigation  control  and vehicle design  Private manufacturing companies throughout the state are also rapidly developing UAV technology    While groundbreaking research is taking place in both the public and private sectors  current UAV technology is being applied just down the highway at Shriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs   The airmen of the 50th Space Wing are being trained about the importance of satellite communications and precision navigation through UAVs  I was even able to visit Shriever Air Force Base when CU students were testing their products with the help of Air Force engineers  These are just two examples of how UAV technology comes full circle in Colorado   Although first conceptualized during World War I  when the Navy worked to develop a pilot less seaplane  UAVs were often regarded as unreliable and viewed as a far fetched  futuristic technology  A proper appreciation for UAV  s potential was not truly recognized until the 1990s when the U S  began using UAVs extensively throughout Operation Desert Storm   Even though UAVs also played a significant role in NATO  s air campaigns through the Balkans  UAV  s contributions still flew  literally and figuratively  under the radar    With the aid of micro technology  the industry has taken off as UAV usage has increased with the advent of the Global War on Terrorism  The industry as a whole has seen tremendous growth not just in the United States but also worldwide  We are witnessing UAVs being implemented in ways thought unimaginable just a few years ago  From a Congressional perspective  it has been fascinating to watch the industry grow  as UAVs are no longer solely a DOD venture  and are quickly becoming commonplace in homeland security and transportation agencies across the United States    Just as the military use of UAVs has increased  so have their civilian applications  Law enforcement  border security  commercial aviation and agricultural agencies have all made use of UAVs  This is a technology that is changing and challenging the conventional perceptions of air capability    In October 2006  NASA and the U S  Forest Service flew the Altair UAV twice over forest fires in California  which marked the first time a civil UAV was approved by the FAA for a mission in the national airspace   Altair  as requested by Governor Schwarzenegger  s office  tracked the Espereanza fire  which had just claimed the lives of five firefighters  The next day the UAV flew a 40 mile diameter circle over the fire  pinpointing hot spots with an infrared scanner   Firefighters commented that the images were useful and provided them with situational awareness in nearly real time     The Los Angeles Sheriff  s Department announced last summer that it planned to begin integrating UAVs in order to help search for criminals and missing persons  Los Angles is just one of several police jurisdictions exploring the law enforcement capabilities of UAVS  Worldwide  Israeli police forces have also begun testing UAVs     As I mentioned earlier  the expansion and general integration of UAVs into other non defense sectors has been evidenced in Congress as well   Last fall  the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing about the impact of UAVs on national aerospace  and ultimately advocated for the government to expand testing of UAVs as potential watchdogs of U S  fisheries  On the other side of the Capitol  the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing last year as well about the increased integration of UAVs into the national airspace system  The fact that Congressional committees are discussing such topics at all in such detail is in stark contrast to the past  when discussions of UAVs  if mentioned at all  never left the rooms of the defense committees    Of course the most commonly perceived civilian use of UAVs is through border security  Congress passed the Secure Fence Act last year  which included language for increased systematic surveillance by more effectively implementing UAVs  The Customs and Border Protection agency currently uses a Predator for surveillance on the southern border  The Department of Homeland Security also recently announced plans to begin regular UAV flights over the US Canadian border as well by the end of September     Obviously there are many civilian uses for UAVs and they certainly possess a tremendous upside  At this point however  Congress   primary concerns are still based on the UAVs impact on the battlefield    Defense funding for UAVs has steadily increased over the years and they are now a common request in the President  s budget and extremely sought after by individual services  The UAV is transforming the battlefield  This is due in large degree to the advancement of navigation and communication technologies that simply were not available or applicable a few years ago  The credit for that goes to all of you  the engineers    As the development of UAVs has accelerated  so have their uses and applications  While traditionally UAVs have been used for intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance missions  their flexibility and adaptability has been tested on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan  Military operations in the Global War on Terrorism have introduced UAVs to numerous combat situations   It was well publicized when Predator UAVs were first fitted with Hellfire missiles in 2002   Now the majority of Predator A  s are equipped with missiles and the MQ 9 Reaper is described as the Air Force  s first   hunter killer    UAV  both of these systems are dominating strike platforms for our military     Additionally  further evolving missions include electronic attack through jamming or intercepting signals and psychological operations such as dropping leaflets  The Army  s Shadow UAV has even been used to deliver critical medical supplies    The conceptual advantages of UAVs are obvious  they have the ability to save human lives and cost less money for their capabilities than satellites and fixed wing aircraft   However  as always  the debates about cost inevitably garner the most attention in Congress and are also the most contentious   For better or worse  funding levels are often times Congress   most quantifiable indication of success and validation      Congress has supported and increased investments for funding UAV programs at astonishing rates  To put this growth in perspective  Congress budgeted DOD only  667 million total for UAVs in FY 2001  while the FY 2008 President  s budget requested nearly  13 billion for Air Force UAVs alone   This is an increase of 1 900 percent    While Congress has exhibited tremendous support for UAVs as a whole  there are several recurring questions Congress has debated concerning DOD  s UAV programs  Most consistently  debates have focused on the implications of UAVs rapid growth  Since the start of the Global War on Terrorism  and thus the increase in UAV production  development and implementation  Congress has expressed both concern and encouragement    A 2004 GAO report expressed great apprehension for the Global Hawk  s seemingly hurried production schedule  and even suggested a temporary halt in production in order to ensure the quality and efficiency of the program  While expressing some caution about growth rate  Congress has nonetheless fueled the demand for UAVs  and overwhelmingly supported the DOD  s requests for procurement and research and development  Defense and Appropriations Committee report language has consistently expressed the importance of further advancing UAV technologies    Additionally  in the last two budget cycles  Congress has become increasingly wary of duplication of technology development  acquisition protocol  and mission focus between the individual services  Such concerns were not an issue just a few years ago  but as the UAV has become a greater contributor to the war effort  questions of increased oversight have also accompanied them    Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert England was questioned a few weeks ago by the Senate Appropriations Committee about duplication issues  where he acknowledged it was a major concern for the Pentagon  Again  just last Wednesday  Army Chief of Staff  General Peter Schoomaker  defended the mission of the Army  s Warrior UAV system as several Senators questioned whether its mission of high altitude ISR duplicate those being conducted by the Air Force  s Predator  All services should be expecting this line of questing from Congress         While UAVs are projected to consume only three percent of aircraft spending through 2011  their success and significance in the Global War on Terrorism cannot be challenged  Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne testified before the House Appropriations Committee last month and stated    about the only thing that outstrips our supply today is our demand  We cannot satisfy all of CENTCOM  s demands on these Predators       Further  Commandant James T  Conway of the Marine Corps testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last month saying that Marine UAV squadrons are flying at ten times their programmed rate   The White House has even touted its request to increase the Predator force to 170 aircraft that will eventually support 21 simultaneous orbits  an increase from 12 orbits in 2006  As the role of UAVs continues to increase  so will Congress   role in overseeing their development  In addition to performance  I anticipate that questions regarding cost to weigh heavily in the near future  Questions such as    1  Determining the best way to quantify costs  2  What is the most effective balance in spending between UAVs and manned aircrafts  3  and determining what missions best maximize UAV capabilities and investment   However  I believe that the most pressing issues in the immediate future concerns the organizational structure for the Pentagon  s various UAV programs  Will there be consolidation of UAV programs or not  If so  what will it look like and how will it strengthen our military      To put it simply  UAVs have changed the way we fight wars  Our enemies have altered the way they conduct business out of fear of Predator attacks because the UAV has successfully manipulated the battlespace  That said  our military needs to adapt as well and take full advantage of the leverage UAVs provide the warfighter  2007 is a much different world for the UAV than it was in Kosovo or Desert Storm  and the UAV is playing a major role in combat and intelligence  surveillance  reconnaissance operations    In fact  UAV flying hours have increased from less than 20 000 in 2001 to more than 160 000 in 2006 and the Pentagon  s total UAV inventory has grown from 217 aircrafts to over 3 428 in the last four years  At any one time  the Pentagon estimates that there are at least 1 000 UAVs in flight at any given time in Iraq  A great deal of growth is attributed to the rise in demand for smaller UAVs  of which we now have 32 times more aircraft than we did in operation in 2002    Certainly there are a number of obvious problems that persist from an overcrowded air space  Most immediately  warfighters are affected through the risk of collisions and jamming of signals   There are several solutions  including sense and avoid technology on UAVs that could help to reduce problems  but these remedies would only be temporary and would not be permanent solutions    Obviously the influence of UAVs has increased substantially  and if you believe budget numbers  this influence continues to gain momentum   Much like when our nation decided that the prevalence of automobile traffic was so great that it warranted the creation of a national highway system to regulate and better facilitate the nation  s transportation needs  DOD  s usage of UAVs might inevitably need to be centralized as well     I believe a policy of integration and interdependence is something that needs to be put forth in the near future in order to         Improve distribution of UAV  s intelligence across all theaters and components      Avoid duplication of service acquisitions efforts by centralizing procurement of equipment      Decrease cost in developing new technologies       Standardize operations and training      Expand and integrate international partners and international technology       Control rapidly expanding UAV bandwidth in order to ensure proper intelligence distribution      If the military does not feel that some centralizing and consolidating efforts are necessary at this point  then it seems to me that they are only delaying the inevitable  The Air Force  Army  Navy  Marine Corps and Coast Guard all effectively incorporate UAVs extensively  and there is no reason for their operations to cease  Additionally  the great work provided by the Joint Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence  as well as many industry partners should in no way discontinue  It seems that DOD and Congress are all in agreement that UAVs are here to stay  but have not addressed any meaningful way of consolidating resources    I am intrigued by the idea proposed most recently by Air Force Chief of Staff  General Michael Moseley  of assigning the Air Force as the executive agency for medium and high altitude UAVs   This is not a new idea  the Air Force first proposed it in 2005  This proposal generated some friction with the other services and was certainly not embraced by DOD either  In 2005 DOD preferred splitting UAVs into two segments comprised of large and small  Nonetheless  neither proposal was enacted    These concerns are reasonable  particularly from the Army  In fact the largest increases in UAVs use have come from the Army  In 2006  the Army logged 80 000 UAV flight hours compared to just 60 000 in the Air Force   clearly the Army has a tremendous stake in any potential consolidation decision    However  the designation of executive agent would not prevent the Army  Navy or Marine Corps from continuing to use UAVs  In this case it would  perhaps  effect their acquisition authorities  Depending on the specifics of the declaration of executive agent  the changes in acquisition authorities would vary  That means the true implications of a declaration to the other services depend on what programs are determined to be Air Force functions  large and small UAVs  high and low orbit UAVs  or all UAVs     Specifically  a designation of an executive agency means that the Secretary of Defense issues a directive that assigns specific responsibilities  functions  and authorities to provide specific levels of support for operational or administrative missions  For example  the Air Force has been declared DOD  s executive agent for space  and the Navy for the U S  Port Security program  both of which have been successful    In my estimation  the Air Force seems to be the most suited to take on this command for medium and high altitude UAVs as the Air Force is organized  trained and equipped for such missions  Clearly this is a difficult and complicated decision that must be made by DOD  but from my perspective it appears to be the most complete and permanent solution available that consolidates UAV resources in an effective manner    Regardless of service preference  we in Congress  as well as those in the White House and Pentagon  need to keep the big picture in mind  As Americans we can  t afford not to maximize the effectiveness of this technology for the benefit of our warfighters  With that in mind  I credit the Air Force and Army for agreeing last month to combine efforts in order to bring together the Predator and the Army  s Extend Range Multi Purpose unmanned aircraft programs  This focus on our total national security picture gives me great confidence in the success of future UAV programs     Speaking in terms of the big picture   the continued development of UAVs are also crucial because of the tremendous influence of American ingenuity and investment in this technology  It is estimated that in the next 10 years  the US will account for 77 percent of the worldwide research  development  test and evaluation spending on all UAV technology  This technology benefits America and deserves economic encouragement  As all of you know  this is a technology Americans have build from the ground up   There is a tremendous future for both military and civilian UAVs and it is an industry that continues to flourish  The commercial market for UAVs is predicted to be worth an estimated  16 billion over the next 10 years  and this is something that is truly remarkable  and demonstrates how far the industry has come and you all have played a monumental role it its success    Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today  and I encourage you to continue your good work                               March 2007 Press Releases
