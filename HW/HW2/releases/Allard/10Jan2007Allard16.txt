                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT in support of the  Second Look at Wasteful Spending  Amendment to the  Legislative Transparency Act of 2007           January 10th  2007   Mr  President   I rise today in support of the Second Look at Wasteful Spending amendment offered by Senator Gregg to the pending Legislative Transparency Act of 2007   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment  as I was to be a cosponsor of the Stop Over Spending Act of 2006  which contained a similar provision   Spending is out of control and it is time that Congress put its money where its mouth is when it comes to reigning in spending  In addition to being a good first step  this amendment is symbolic because it is the first opportunity of this new Congress to do so    I hope the new majority party will use this opportunity to live up to its promise of fiscal responsibility and support this amendment   The amendment is simple  In a nutshell  it allows the President to identify individual items of wasteful spending that  for one reason or another  slipped through Congress and send them back for closer scrutiny   Once under the microscope for Congress and all of America to see  both houses of Congress will have the opportunity to give the individual proposal an up or down vote   If both Houses deem the spending appropriate  the President must release the funds  On the other hand  if it does not survive the scrutiny of both Houses  the spending is rescinded   Importantly  any savings resulting from rescinded items of spending goes to reduce the federal deficit  With record revenues streaming into the Treasury as a result of the Republican pro growth tax cuts  we have made significant strides toward cutting the deficit  This amendment provides an opportunity to chip away at the deficit from the spending side of the equation   Some of you may recall the Line Item Veto Authority that a Republican Congress gave to President Clinton in 1996 and wonder how this differs  This legislation  although similar in purpose  is not nearly as far reaching as the authority given to President Clinton   Under that authority  presidential cancellations went into effect automatically  without Congressional action  Unlike that law  the Second Look at Wasteful Spending legislation requires that Congress take affirmative steps to affirm or deny any rescission package proposed by the President  In other words  Congress has the final say on the President  s rescission request   Today  s legislation contains several other important limitations on the President  s authority  First  the President is limited to the submission of four rescission packages per year  Second  the President  s rescission requests are limited to discretionary or mandatory spending or tax bills introduced on or after the legislation  s enactment  Third  the authority sunsets in four years to allow Congress to re evaluate it after two Presidents have each used it for two years   I am pleased that Senator Gregg chose to address this issue during the pending lobbying reform legislation  Both pieces of legislation share the goal of bringing greater transparency to the federal spending process   While I do not pretend that it will solve all of the long term fiscal problems    such as long term entitlement spending    I do believe that it is an important and symbolic first step   Even if the authority is never used by the President  its mere existence will have a chilling effect on wasteful discretionary spending  Individual Members of Congress will give second thought to promoting wasteful items of spending that they know will receive a second look   Similarly  it will provide an additional check on new items of mandatory spending  each of which has the potential to exacerbate the crisis that is the unsustainable growth in long term entitlement spending  I say crisis because  if left unchecked  in under 30 years spending on just three entitlement programs    Medicare  Medicaid and Social Security    will exceed  as a share of GDP  the amount of spending that the entire U S  Government consumes today   To further put the issue in perspective  outstanding 75 year government promises  including Medicare  Medicaid  and Social Security  exceed the total amount of taxes collected in U S  history by  26 trillion   Again  this amendment is only the first step in reducing spending  something that the American taxpayers demand and deserve   Mr  President  I am hopeful that the new majority party will take the opportunity to support its promises of fiscal responsibility and join me in supporting this amendment    It will bring more accountability and transparency to the legislative process so that Americans will know what is happening and can hold Members of Congress more accountable                              January 2007 Press Releases
