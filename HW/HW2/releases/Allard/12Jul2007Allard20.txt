          ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK WILDERNESS BILL SPONSORS SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF CONSENSUS BILL AT FIRST HEARING          July 12th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    Today  S  1380  the consensus Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness legislation received its first hearing in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks   Senator Ken Salazar  who sits on the committee  Senator   Congressman Mark Udall  CO 2  and Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave  CO 4  all testified in support of their legislation to designate nearly 250 000 acres of Rocky Mountain National Park as wilderness     The sponsors of the bill also thanked Judy Burke  Mayor of the Town of Grand Lake  and Dennis Harmon  from the Water Supply and Storage Company in Fort Collins  Colorado  for testifying in support of the legislation   The bill enjoys very broad support ranging from the Park  s surrounding communities  elected officials  businesses  residents and Colorado  s environmental community   Senator     Today  s hearing is a significant milestone in our effort to designate Rocky Mountain National Park as a wilderness area   This carefully crafted bipartisan legislation will protect the Grand Ditch while ensuring one of America  s national treasures is preserved for the enjoyment of future generations      Energy and Natural Resources Committee member  Senator Ken Salazar    Congress   job of protecting the wild character of Rocky Mountain National Park is not complete until we designate the 249 339 acres within the Park outlined in our bill as wilderness   Our bill does not affect private land owners  existing development  or water rights   And our bill provides consistency for the Grand Ditch that runs through the park to operate and provide our farmers  ranchers and communities on the Eastern Plains the water they need   I appreciate my colleagues   appearance before the Committee today and for speaking with one voice in support of the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act and am hopeful we can pass it soon to protect the legacy and majesty of Rocky Mountain National Park       Congressman Udall  CO 2       Protecting the park has been a consistent goal of mine since I first introduced wilderness legislation in 1999   Why is this so important  Because nearby land development has accelerated in recent years  and the pristine nature of the park  s backcountry has become an increasingly rare feature of Colorado  s landscape   The park  s popularity demands definitive and permanent protection for wild areas against possible pressures for development within the park   While only about one tenth the size of Yellowstone National Park  Rocky Mountain sees nearly the same number of visitors and that is expected to grow even more  Designating carefully selected portions of Rocky Mountain National Park as wilderness will also make other areas  now restricted under interim wilderness protection management  available for overdue improvements to park roads and visitor facilities      Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave  CO 4       I proudly support this legislation because this Wilderness designation has gone through a thorough process and all interested parties have been brought to the table to be a part of the discussion and negotiation     said Musgrave     This bill is a compromise that Senator Allard  Senator Salazar  Congressman Udall and I have worked closely to craft   It is a bill that will preserve Rocky Mountain National Park and family farms in Larimer and Weld County      A brief recap of S  1380       Designates 249 339 acres in RMNP as wilderness        Guarantees that the backcountry of RMNP will be managed so that future generations will experience the park as we know it today       Allows for the National Park Service to continue bark beetle and fire mitigation efforts as well as emergency response actions        Ensures wilderness designation will not affect water rights connected to the Colorado Big Thompson Project or the Grand River Ditch  and       Allows possible construction of a bike trail near Grand Lake    The full text of the bill is available by  and a map showing the RMNP lands that are proposed for wilderness designation is available by   Today  s hearing is a first step for the bill  the bill will next have a   mark up   hearing in the full Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee   According to Section 2 c  in the 1964 Wilderness Act  the definition of Wilderness is an    area of undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence  without permanent improvements or human habitation  which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions and which  1  generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature  with the imprint of man s work substantially unnoticeable   2  has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation   3  has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition  and  4  may also contain ecological  geological  or other features of scientific  educational  scenic  or historical value                                 July 2007 Press Releases
