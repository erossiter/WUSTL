          U S  SEN  WAYNE ALLARD JOINS INTERIOR SECRETARY DIRK KEMPTHORNE AT CEREMONY TO CREATE SAND CREEK MASSACRE NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE New Historic Site is the Nation  s 391st National Park Unit          April 23rd  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Sen    R Colo   joined Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne today to complete a process begun over a decade earlier  as Kempthorne signed the paperwork to formally create Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site  The site  located in Kiowa County  Colo  memorializes the massacre of nearly 160 Cheyenne and Arapaho on November 29  1864  Allard joined National Park Service Director Mary Bomar and Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Carl Artman      It is with great reverence and honor that I have signed the papers to create the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site  so that  as a country  we might never forget the events that took place along the banks of Sand Creek     Kempthorne said    We owe it to the men  women  and children who lost their lives that day  to their families  and to all Americans that we learn from this terrible tragedy         This is the right thing to do     said Allard    It is fitting that we commemorate the Native American tribal members who were killed at Sand Creek in a dispute with the U S  Army in 1864  I am proud to have helped complete Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell  s great work on this bill  Congresswoman Musgrave successfully championed this legislation through the U S  House of Representatives and I was pleased to have pushed it through the Senate         The history of this great nation is not complete without an understanding and respect for the tragedies that affect our national consciousness     NPS Director Mary A  Bomar said   We hope that when people visit this important national park site  they will learn about and remember the Northern and Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho victims of Sand Creek    At dawn on November 29  1864  a force of some 700 volunteers in a Colorado regiment attacked a peaceful village of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians camped along Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado Territory  Prior to attack  detachments captured Indian pony herds and moved into battle position  Within moments  a barrage of small arms fire and howitzer bombardment was leveled against the Indians  Throughout the day  soldiers  many in small unorganized groups  continued to hunt and pursue Indians up Sand Creek and across the adjacent plains  By evening  about 160 Cheyenne and Arapaho lay dead    many of the victims women  children  and elderly    Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site  situated on over 12 000 acres in southeast Colorado  will recognize the significance of the massacre in American history  and its ongoing significance to the Northern and Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes    The site will be open to the public for the dedication ceremony on Saturday  April 28th  2007  becoming the 391st National Park Unit and the first created under Secretary Kempthorne   In addition to being a formal government dedication  the event has deep  spiritual meaning for the descendents of the four sovereign Tribes whose ancestors were killed there      It is for exactly this purpose that the National Park Service was created     Kempthorne said     Our National Parks preserve and protect those pieces of America so uniquely a part of our history and our character  both the good and the bad  That is why President Bush has taken the extraordinary step of proposing up to  3 billion for our national parks as part of his National Park Centennial Initiative  The President  s Centennial Initiative will improve and expand national park conservation in preparation for the National Park Service  s 100th birthday  so that our national parks can continue to serve as eye openers and awe inspirers to another 100 years of visitors       Under President Bush  s Centennial Initiative the National Park Service will receive an additional  100 million a year for the next ten years for conservation  preservation  and visitor service projects at the 391 parks across the country  In addition  the President  s Centennial Challenge would make available up to  100 million annually in mandatory funds over 10 years to match at least  100 million in private contributions for signature projects and programs in national parks  This Challenge will leverage significant increases in the level of private donations to parks    Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave  R Fort Morgan  introduced companion legislation in the House    Photos of the signing will be available at www doi gov    For more information on the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site dedication ceremony  please contact Karen Breslin  Chief of
