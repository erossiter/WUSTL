                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on the Marriage Protection Amendment          June 5th  2006   Mr  President  I rise today to start what I hope will be a constructive debate on my amendment  S J  Resolution 1  the Marriage Protection Amendment    It reads     Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman     Neither this Constitution  nor the constitution of any State  shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman      Before making my formal comments  I  d also like to express my sincere gratitude to my colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment   It has taken countless hours of study and discussion to get to this point and each of our 31 cosponsors has shown courage and commitment to protecting marriage     I  d also like to express my appreciation to the Majority Leader for his commitment and leadership   Without the support of Senate leadership  the public may never have had an opportunity to address this vitally important issue in a democratic body    SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE  Marriage  the union between a man and a woman  has been the foundation of every civilization in human history   The definition of marriage crosses all bounds of race  religion  culture  political party  ideology and ethnicity   Marriage is embraced and intuitively understood to be what it is   Marriage is a union between a man and a woman   As an expression of this cultural value  the definition of marriage is incorporated into the very fabric of civic policy   It is the root from which families and communities are grown   Marriage is the one bond on which all other bonds are built     Marriage is not some controversial ideology being forced upon an unwilling populace by the government  it is in fact the opposite   Marriage is the ideal held by the people and the government has long reflected this   The broadly embraced union of a woman and a man is understood to be the ideal union from which people live and children best blossom and thrive     As we have heard in hours of testimony  in 8 hearings  in numerous Senate committees over the last several years  marriage is a pretty good thing   A good marriage facilitates a more stable community  allows kids to grow up with fewer difficulties  increases the lifespan and quality of life of those involved  reduces the likelihood of incidences of chemical abuse and violent crime  and contributes to the overall health of the family   It is no wonder so many single adults long to be married  to raise kids  and to have families   Today there are numerous efforts to redefine marriage to be something that it isn  t   When it comes to same gender couples there is a problem of definition    Two women or two men simply do not meet the criteria for marriage as it has been defined for thousands of years   Marriage is  as it always has been  a union between a man and a woman   I believe the framers of the Constitution felt that this would never be an issue   and if they had it would have been included in the U S  Constitution   Like the vast majority of Americans  it would have never occurred to me that the definition of marriage  or marriage itself  would be the source of controversy   Not too long ago it would have been wholly inconceivable that this definition   this institution that is marriage   would be challenged  redefined or attacked   But we are here today because it is    ASSAULT ON MARRIAGE  Make no mistake about it  traditional marriage is under assault   I say assault because the move to redefine marriage is taking place not through democratic processes  such as state legislatures  the Congress  or ballot initiatives around the nation   This assault is taking place in our courts  and often in direct conflict with the will of the people  state statute  federal statute  and even state constitutions   Activists and lawyers have devised a strategy to use the courts to redefine marriage   This strategy is a clear effort to override public opinion and the long standing composition of traditional marriage and to force same sex marriage on society    Over the course of the last 15 years  traditional marriage laws have been challenged in courts across the nation   Alaska  Arizona  California  Connecticut  Florida  Hawaii  Indiana  Iowa  Maryland  Massachusetts  Montana  Nebraska  New Jersey  New Mexico  New York  North Carolina  Oklahoma  Oregon  Vermont  Washington and West Virginia have all seen traditional marriage challenged in court    As we speak  nine states face lawsuits challenging traditional marriage laws  California  Connecticut  Iowa  Maryland  Nebraska  New Jersey  New York  Oklahoma  and Washington  Marriage is under attack all across the country  If it hasn  t already  an attack on marriage is coming to a state near you   The first success in the activists   coordinated legal strategy was in Vermont in 1999   The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that all the rights and benefits of civil marriage must be extended to same sex couples  Under threat of court imposed same sex marriage  the Vermont legislature created same sex   civil unions      The second  and to date the most widely covered success in the effort to destroy traditional marriage  came more recently in the state of Massachusetts where four judges ruled in the Goodridge case that marriage itself must be redefined to include same sex couples  and that traditional marriage laws were a   stain    on the state constitution that must be   eradicated     This edict came despite the fact that the populace of Massachusetts opposed this redefinition of marriage and despite the fact that no law had ever been democratically passed to authorize such a radical shift in public policy     Proponents of same sex marriage have shopped carefully for the right venues  exploited the legal system  and today stand ready to overturn any and all democratically crafted federal or state statute that would stand between them and a new definition of humanity  s oldest institution       The question of process is very important in this debate   it is in fact the very heart of this debate   While recent court decisions handed down by activist judges may not respect the traditional definition of marriage  these decisions also highlight a lack of respect for the democratic process   No state legislature has passed legislation to redefine the institution of marriage   Not one   Any redefinition of marriage has been driven entirely by the body of government that remains unaccountable and unelected   the courts   Some of my colleagues do not feel we should be talking about marriage in the Senate   I say we must   Our government is a three branch government   The Congress is the branch that represents the people most directly   We have a duty to  at the very least  discuss the state of marriage in America   If we do not take this up  we abdicate our responsibility   We will allow the courts sole dominion on the state and future of marriage   This Senate  the world  s most deliberative body  must provide a democratic response to the courts   Legislatures across the country have joined the Congress in recent years in affirming a 1996 law called the Defense of Marriage Act  or DOMA   DOMA is a limited law designed to address two distinct issues  1   forced interstate recognition  and 2   the definition of marriage for the purposes of federal law  This bipartisan legislation passed with the support of more than three quarters of the House of Representatives and with the support of eighty five Senators before being signed into law by then President Bill Clinton     To date  45 states have also passed laws to protect traditional marriage  including 19 states who have constitutional amendments protecting traditional marriage as solely between a man and a woman  Voters in seven states  Alabama  Idaho  South Carolina  South Dakota  Tennessee  Virginia  and Wisconsin  will vote on constitutional amendments this year  Another five state legislatures  Colorado  Indiana  Iowa  Massachusetts  and Pennslvania  are considering sending constitutional amendments to voters in 2006 or 2008  and ballot initiatives are currently underway in Arizona  Florida  and Illinois   These state DOMAs and constitutional amendments  combined with Federal DOMA  should have settled the question as to the democratic expression of the will of the American public   However  federal and state DOMAs  as well as state constitutional amendments  all reflecting the will of the people  are being challenged in the courts   The federal DOMA is itself under attack  Activists have challenged DOMA  s interstate recognition provision in the Ninth Circuit  The second part of DOMA  the part defining marriage for federal purposes  was also challenged in the Ninth Circuit  as well as in federal cases pending in Oklahoma and Washington State  Plaintiffs in each case argue that the U S  Constitution  s equal protection and due process clauses require the recognition of same sex marriages  and that efforts to limit marriage to the union of a man and a woman for purposes of federal law are unconstitutional    Because DOMA only clarifies that the Constitution  s Full Faith and Credit clause should not be read to require interstate recognition  DOMA will not prevent an activist judge from finding that the equal protection or due process clauses require it  In other words  DOMA does not prevent any court from recognizing out of state marriages  it merely removes one of several rationales that a court could use to do so  DOMA is not  nor was it designed to be  a comprehensive solution to judicial activism on same sex marriage   Likewise  state constitutional amendments are under attack in federal court  For example  in Nebraska  a federal district court in 2005 found unconstitutional a state constitutional amendment passed by 70 percent of Nebraska voters  While this cases is on appeal to the 8th Circuit  and we hope the decision will be correctly overturned   I find it chilling that the will of an entire state  expressed democratically  may be undone by a federal judge in an unelected position and tenured for life   State constitutional amendments are also under attack in state court  Just last month  a Georgia judge found unconstitutional a state constitutional marriage amendment that was approved by 76 percent of the voters  Immediately after it was passed by an overwhelming majority of voters in 2004  activists launched an attack in the courts  The result  the amendment being thrown out on procedural grounds  is yet another success for the handful of activists seeking to suppress the will of the people through the courts   The national effort to redefine marriage has also been buoyed by decisions made by the U S  Supreme Court   In June 2003  the Court inferred that a right to same sex marriage could be found in the U S  Constitution in Lawrence v  Texas   A variety of experts  including Justice Scalia and Harvard Professor Lawrence Tribe  forecast that this decision points to the end of traditional marriage laws   including federal and state DOMAs   The Massachusetts court relied heavily on the Lawrence decision to strike down that state  s traditional marriage law in the Goodridge case   When Goodridge took effect in May of 2004  same sex couples became entitled to Massachusetts marriage licenses   In anticipation of Goodridge  a handful of local officials in New York  California  and Oregon began issuing licenses to same sex couples in February and March   To date  through the combined efforts of lawless local officials and those licenses issued in Massachusetts  couples from at least 46 states have received licenses in those jurisdictions and returned to their home states   These 46 plus states are state and federal DOMA challenges just waiting to happen   More of these cases are expected and we will be left with an unworkable patchwork of marriage laws  crafted by judges and forced on to one state from another  outside the democratic process  regardless of the will of the voters   WHAT THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT DO  As a result of this coordinated campaign to redefine marriage through the courts  we stand here today  compelled by respect for the democratic process  to publicly debate an amendment to the U S  Constitution  Again  this amendment simply reads   Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman     Neither this Constitution  nor the constitution of any State  shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman   The first sentence is straightforward  it defines marriage as an institution solely between one man and one woman  just as it has been defined for thousands of years in hundreds of cultures around the world     The second sentence simply ensures that the people or their elected representatives  not judges  can decide whether to confer the legal incidents of marriage on people  Citizens remain free to act through their legislatures to bestow whatever benefits to same sex couples that they choose  It is aimed squarely at the problem of judicial activism   Just as important as what it does do  is what it does not do  I have said it time and time again and I say here again today for the record   the amendment does not seek to prohibit  in any way  the lawful  democratic creation of civil unions or domestic partnerships   It does not prohibit private employers from offering benefits to same sex couples  It denies no existing rights     What our amendment does is to define and protect traditional marriage at the highest level   the U S  Constitution   Importantly  the consideration of this amendment in the Senate represents the discussion of marriage in America in a democratic body of elected officials  I am not willing to surrender this issue to the courts   STATES   RIGHTS  I also feel it is important to make clear that on the question of federalism and states   rights I stand where I always have   While an indisputable definition of marriage will be a part of our Constitution  all other questions will be left to the states     Gregory Coleman  former Solicitor General of the State of Texas  testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and made the following statement on this matter     Some have objected to a proposed constitutional amendment on federalism grounds   These concerns are misplaced   The relationship between the states and the federal government is defined by the Constitution and  a fortiori  a constitutional amendment cannot violate principles of federalism and states   rights   A federal constitutional amendment is perhaps the most democratic of all processes   because it requires ratification by three fourths of the states   and simply does not raise federalism concerns   The real danger to states   rights comes from the recognition of un enumerated constitutional rights in which the states have had no participation      I share those sentiments and cannot express them any more clearly   We stand today at the threshold of the most democratic  most federalist process in all our government  As designed by the framers of the U S  Constitution  the amendment process is neither an exclusively federal nor an exclusively state action  It is a shared responsibility of both    Contrary to assertions of those who believe my amendment infringes on the rights of the states  my amendment actually protects states   rights  45 states have spoken with laws or Constitutional amendments designed to protect traditional marriage  Unfortunately  same sex advocates have  through the courts  systematically and successfully trampled on laws democratically enacted in the states   My amendment takes the issue out of the hands of a handful of activist judges and puts it squarely back in the hands of the states   Now is the time for Congress to fulfill its responsibility and send a Constitutional amendment to the states   CONCLUSION  Marriage  the union between a man and a woman  has been the foundation of every civilization in human history   This definition of marriage crosses all bounds of race  religion  culture  political party  ideology and ethnicity   It is not about politics or discrimination  it is about marriage and democracy   Unfortunately  the U S  Constitution is being amended to reflect a new definition of marriage    not by democratically elected members of Congress  but by unaccountable and unelected judges  If we fail to define marriage  the courts will not hesitate to do it for us    I  for one  believe that the institution of marriage and the principles of democracy are too precious to surrender to the whims of a handful of unelected  activist judges    I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Marriage Protection Amendment                               June 2006 Press Releases
