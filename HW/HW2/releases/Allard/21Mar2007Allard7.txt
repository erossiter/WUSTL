                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT   Senator Allard s PART Amendment to S  Con  Res 21  the FY2008 Budget Resolution          March 21st  2007   Mr  President   I rise today in support of my amendment  491 to S  Con  Res  21  the FY2008 Budget Resolution   The purpose of the amendment is to pay down the federal debt and eliminate government waste by reducing spending on programs rated   ineffective    by the Office of Management and Budget  s Program Assessment Rating Tool  PART    PART is a government wide assessment of the performance of almost 1 000 programs  representing 96  of total program funding  Assessments represent the combined wisdom of career officials at agencies and OMB and are based on evidence   Programs assessed with PART receive an overall rating  from best to worst  of  Effective  Moderately Effective  Adequate  Results Not Demonstrated  or Ineffective     While a program  s overall rating should not be the sole determinant of its funding  Congress should prioritize funding programs that perform well   Ineffective programs  in particular  should be scrutinized to determine if the resources they use could be better spent elsewhere and if their goals could be achieved through another means     Ineffective    means that a program has not met the goals established by Congress or the Executive Branch  or that the program is duplicative of another program    How does a program earn a rating of   ineffective     If the statistics are any indication  very carefully  I say that because  of the nearly 1000 federal programs that have been evaluated  only 3  have been deemed ineffective    What my amendment does is to propose a reduction in spending on programs rated   ineffective    by PART   I introduced this amendment because the Democrat budget does not reduce funding for programs rated   ineffective    as recommended by the President  OMB  and the agencies   In fact  it spends at least  17 billion a year on these programs  Worse yet  it contemplates raising taxes to do so   The budget proposes to spend  80 billion on   ineffective    programs over 5 years  It raises taxes by over  900 billion to do so   Instead of raising taxes to pay for ineffective programs  my amendment reduces discretionary budget authority by  4 3 billion in each year 2008 2012  reducing by 25 percent the  17 billion annual funding level for programs rated   ineffective    by PART   The effect is an  18 billion savings in discretionary spending over 5 years   Where does the savings go  To pay down the Federal debt to the tune of  18 billion   When independent evaluations show that a program doesn  t get results  Congress should act and return those dollars to the taxpayers   If we cannot trim  4 billion out of a  2 9 trillion budget on   ineffective    programs  we cannot tell taxpayers we are serious about fiscal responsibility   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment                              March 2007 Press Releases
