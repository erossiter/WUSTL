                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on FY07 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION          June 9th  2006   Thank you  Mr  President   I rise today to discuss several noteworthy provisions in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization and provide an overview of a couple of amendments that I plan to offer     First  let me begin by commending the managers of the bill  Senators John Warner and Carl Levin  for the work that they have put into this legislation   It is comprehensive and addresses many of the issues important to our armed forces   Indeed  many of the provisions in this bill are essential to the health and well being of our soldiers and are needed in order to defeat terrorism and defend our nation from future attacks   In the missile defense arena  for example  the Senate Armed Services Committee took several steps to encourage the Department of Defense to focus on near term missile defense systems over longer term next generation systems   I support this direction and agree that MDA is not investing enough time and money in those systems that may be able to provide limited defense capability in the near term    I personally believe we need to be conducting more tests within the missile defense mid course intercept program   Although the Missile Defense Agency will be conducting two flight intercepts later this year  the agency only requested funding for one intercept in Fiscal Year 2007    This test plan is insufficient in my eyes  and should be greatly expanded     I believe we need to conduct many more flight intercepts  much more often   We need to be challenging the system with our tests and working on the areas we need improve upon   I do not expect perfection   In fact  I expect some failures   But  in the context of several missile defense intercepts tests per year  one or two failures only means that we are pushing to find out the real capabilities of the system   They do not mean missile defense is not possible   The bottom line here is that I do expect for the Missile Defense Agency to try   We all know that hit to kill technology works   We have used it successfully in the Patriot and Aegis programs   We now need to further develop the mid course system and introduce greater capability to that system        Let me turn to another provision in the Senate version of the Defense Authorization bill that I thought was appropriate and deserved mention   That provision pertained to the Department  s request for  127 million for the development and procurement of Trident conventional submarine launched ballistic missiles   Under the Pentagon  s proposal  the Navy would equip several of its Ohio class ballistic missile submarines with Trident missiles tipped with conventional warheads      These missiles are intended to give the President a real option for a responsive  global strike capability in the short term   I support the concept of developing a conventional ballistic missile capable of reaching almost any target in world in under an hour   In an era when targets of opportunity shift rapidly  there is a real need for systems that can reach these targets within narrow time frames   A conventional ballistic missile is perhaps the best option for this purpose in the near term    That being said  this is still a very new concept  and the Department of Defense has yet to work out all the details    Of particular concern is the fact that the Department is still developing a variety of transparency  confidence building  and operational measures to ensure there is no confusion about our intentions    The last thing we want is for Russia or China to think we are launching a nuclear strike when we use one of these submarine launched conventional missiles   To address this concern  the Senate Armed Services Committee included a provision in this bill that prohibits the expenditure of this funding until the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State submit a joint report that discussed potential alternatives  describe the discrimination capabilities of other nations  and state how the United States would work with other nations to prevent an inadvertent nuclear strike by another country     I believe this provision is a reasonable approach to this issue and still allows the Department of Defense to go forward with the development and procurement of this system   I think there might be other less challenging global strike options available  such as land based conventional ballistic missiles in California or Guam  so I look forward to the Department  s discussion about possible alternatives     I next wish to address the Senate Armed Services Committee  s decision to increase by  30 million the Department of Defense  s buffer zone conservation projects account   These projects help military bases around the country address the growing problem of encroachment from residential and industrial development    At Fort Carson  Colorado  we have seen the fruits of conservation projects like those funded under this account      Fort Carson  s southeastern and southern borders are now protected with money from this account   I believe that as more conservation projects come on line  competition for the funding in this account will grow exponentially   We needed extra money to meet this demand  and the funding provided by this bill is a step in the right direction   Let me now turn to another provision in the bill that I think should be highlighted    Section 372 provides the Secretary of Defense with authority to include incentivized clauses in contracts for the destruction of chemical weapons within the U S  stockpile     To my extreme disappointment  the Department of Defense announced last April that it most likely would not be able to comply with our treaty obligations under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention   I was displeased by this announcement because the way the Department had managed its chemical demilitarization program virtually assured our nation  s non compliance     Nevertheless  I still believe that if we use the incentivized contracts that this section provides we might be able to complete the destruction of our chemical weapons stockpile earlier than what is currently expected   Those contractors who can meet a more aggressive schedule should be awarded for their effort   At the same time  I believe that the penalties for safety or environmental violations should also be increased     At Rocky Flats  a former Department of Energy plutonium pit production facility located outside of Denver  we have seen the value of these contracts   This facility was initially expected to cost as much as  70 billion to clean up and take over 30 years to clean up   The Department of Energy was able to find a contractor who was willing to accelerate the contract in return for a huge incentive   I am pleased to tell you today that the contractor safely completed the clean up at Rocky Flats last December  over a year ahead of schedule and several hundred million dollars under budget     This incentive provision puts the Department of Defense in position to use similar contracts to encourage contractors to finish earlier and cheaper than expected while protecting the environment and ensuring safety   I strongly support it and commend the managers of the bill for including it in the bill before us    The last provision I would like to address is section 911   This provision creates an office for the management and acquisition of operationally responsive space capabilities   I support this provision because the Department of Defense has not done enough to investigate the value of operationally responsive space     One of the reasons why this has occurred is because of the absence of a dedicated office to manage our operationally responsive space  ORS  efforts   The GAO recently reported that the absence of a strategic direction within the Department on ORS activities was hindering the program   This provision solves that problem and should encourage the Department to move forward with ORS type of systems   Over the next couple of days  I plan to offer several amendments  which I hope will be accepted by the managers of this bill   Most of these amendments should be non controversial but are important to the global war against terror and to helping the families of our service members    I look forward to working with Chairman Warner and Senator Levin so that we can get these amendments cleared as quickly as possible     Thank you  Mr  President   I yield the floor                                  June 2006
