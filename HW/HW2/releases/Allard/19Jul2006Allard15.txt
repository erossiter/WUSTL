                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FLOOR STATEMENT on Israel and Hezbollah          July 19th  2006   Mr  President   I rise today deeply disturbed after watching the situation in Israel continue to escalate over the last few days     Israel over the last three years has acted in a responsible manner and has done everything possible to reach out to those who desire peace   Unfortunately  there remain those who continue to disregard the Israeli state  and refuse to recognize its legitimacy      Sadly  these terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah remain committed to their ideology of hatred towards the Jewish people and appear determined to try and bring an end to the state of Israel   As such  I strongly support Israel  s response to the unprovoked kidnapping of three Israeli soldiers and the unprecedented rocket bombardment of northern Israel     The current Israeli action is justified  Action is necessary to stop those who are responsible for these despicable acts of terror   The attempts to defend Israel and rescue its captured soldiers with airstrikes and incursions by Israeli forces are not only appropriate  but are absolutely necessary to protect Israeli citizens from future terrorist attacks    Ultimately  I believe outside actors  such as Syria and Iran  which continue to support terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah   are the main culprits   These nations have done nothing to promote peace in the region    I believe the United States and the community of nations should put these nations on notice that their support for terrorism is unacceptable and will not be tolerated   President Bush has likewise called out Syria and Iran for their support of Hezbollah by stating    the one way to help heal the Middle East is to address the root causes of the problems there  and the root cause of the problem is Hezbollah and Syria and the Iranian connection    No one doubts that with the support these nations provide to Hezbollah that they could bring an end to the hostilities in the region   Instead  they would rather Hezbollah continue to use innocent civilians as shields while the terrorist organization conducts attacks against a sovereign nation   They need to abide by the already passed United Nations Resolutions and end support for Hezbollah   That is why  Mr  President  I rise in support of Senate Resolution 534 condemning Hezbollah and their sponsors   I also ask to be added as a co sponsor   Our ally Israel is entitled to the defense of its land   We as a body should again recognize this fact and support Israel  s right to self defense  while calling for the Syrians and the Iranians to take responsibility for these open hostilities   They must help immediately to withdraw all terrorist forces from Lebanon and end their support for Hezbollah  s actions against our allies     We also must ensure that the UN Security Council enforces the full implementation of U N  Security Council Resolution 1559  which in 2004 called for disarming Hezbollah and the removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon   We must use all of the tools at our disposal to discontinue the financial  military  and political support that Hezbollah and Hamas receive from these state sponsors of terror     Of course  during this crisis I would be remiss if I did not mention my grave concern about the loss of innocent life in Israel  Lebanon  and Gaza    During the past week  Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets and mortars into civilian areas killing multiple Israelis  among others   Much as I believe it is imperative that the United States stand behind Israel in its time of need  we also must provide assistance to those who have been hurt because of this conflict   It is my strong belief that the United States should do everything in its power to assure Israel  s right to exist and right to protect its borders   Israel must be allowed to live without fear within those borders  and it is my hope that this conflict will be resolved peacefully in the coming days     The people of Israel have not asked for more than that  and I believe they certainly deserve as much   Thank you  Mr  President  I yield the floor                              July 2006 Press Releases
