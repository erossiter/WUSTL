          OP ED   President s Critics Attempt to Rewrite History on Iraq          November 5th  2005   Critics of the Bush Administration have recently gone out of their way to try to convince the American people that the President misled our nation about Iraq   Some are arguing most vociferously that President Bush purposely withheld intelligence information from Congress   Others accuse the President of deliberately fashioning U S  intelligence to fit his own agenda   A few even suggest that the President had some kind of personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and was willing to do whatever it took to remove him from power   I can accept criticism leveled at our intelligence agencies for providing inaccurate intelligence   I can accept criticism lodged against the Department of Defense for not sufficiently preparing for an Iraqi insurgency   I can even accept criticism that the Bush Administration did not appropriately prepare the American people for the cost of the war in Iraq    What I cannot accept  what I feel is so irresponsible  and what is so damaging to our nation  are accusations that suggest that President Bush deliberately lied to the American people about either the intelligence or about his reasons for going to war     I was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee when the President requested Congressional authorization for the use of force against Iraq in 2002   I participated in numerous open and classified  bipartisan hearings and briefings on our intelligence regarding Iraq  s weapons of mass destruction   The conclusions that I reached  that President Bush reached  and that many Democrats reached  were the same     We all agreed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction   We all agreed that he had used such weapons in the past against Iran and Iraq  s Kurdish populations   And  we all agreed that he would not hesitate to use them against the United States in the future   The U S  Congress and President Bush were not alone in this assessment   The intelligence agencies of Britain  Germany  Russia  China  and even France all believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction   The entire international community watched as Saddam used these weapons to murder thousands of his own people   Even the Chief United Nations weapons inspector Han Blix thought the chemical weapons he discovered prior to the war in Iraq were the   tip of a submerged iceberg         The fact is that the debate in Congress over whether to authorize the use of force was never about Iraq  s weapons of mass destruction   Everyone thought Saddam Hussein had them   In fact  even those who voted against the use of force in Congress never questioned the veracity of our intelligence information   And  this is not because the Bush Administration manipulated the intelligence that was presented to Congress  as some have alleged    Indeed  a number of independent commissions since the war began have investigated this issue and found the Bush Administration did not distort intelligence information   The best known investigation was the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  which stated unequivocally in its report that    the Committee did not find any evidence that Administration officials attempted to coerce  influence or pressure analysts to change their judgments related to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction capabilities        Therefore  if we agree that the President did not lie about our intelligence on Iraq  s WMD programs  then the critics can only argue that the President Bush  s rationale for going to war at the time of the Congressional debate was somehow flawed and unjustifiable   Here I would again disagree         During the debate  I joined with a large majority of the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who voted to authorize force   We did so because of two important facts    the same two facts offered by the President     First  Saddam Hussein was in breach of more than a dozen United Nations Security Council resolutions   He continued to refuse to cooperate with U N  weapons inspectors even after a decade of sanctions   He rejected proposal after proposal to conduct fair and transparent inspections     When he finally allowed inspections  Saddam did everything he could to undermine  cajole  and otherwise manipulate the inspections process   He gave every appearance of hiding large stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction   Second  a large bipartisan majority of Members of Congress  including nearly 30 Senate Democrats and 81 House Democrats  voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq because  after September 11th  it was clear that America could no longer afford to allow imminent threats to our nation go unhindered and unopposed   In most minds  Iraq represented a highly dangerous nexus between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction   In the context of Saddam  s decade long defiance  it was a nexus that Members of both sides of the aisle in both the Senate and the House was no longer willing to ignore    When critics try to cover up their vote in support of the use of force against Iraq  they damage the credibility of our government overseas and send a disheartening message to our soldiers  sailors  airmen  and marines who are bravely defending freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan      When they falsely accuse the President of misleading the American people  they encourage the enemy who believes America will throw in the towel and give up when the fighting gets tough     It is time for the President  s critics in Congress to remember why they voted to authorize force against Iraq in 2002    It is time for them to acknowledge the progress our soldiers are making now in Iraq and Afghanistan   It is time for them to recognize the success we have had against global networks of terror      And most of all  it is time for these critics to lay aside their own political ambitions and do what is right for America   It is time for them join our Commander in Chief in the fight against those who wish to destroy our nation      An agenda of disunity and surrender will never lead to victory   We need to unite behind our Commander in Chief if we are to defeat this enemy   It is my hope that the President  s critics will see this imperative and finally do what is best for our nation         is Colorado
