          COLORADO DELEGATION INTRODUCES BARK BEETLE LEGISLATION          July 17th  2007   WASHINGTON  D C    Today  the entire Colorado Congressional delegation introduced a bill  in both the House and the Senate  to improve the ability of the federal  state  and local governments to deal with problems caused by the beetle infestation in Colorado  s forest lands     The bill    includes a variety of provisions intended to further facilitate both the development and implementation of community wildfire protection plans and to enable the Forest Service and Interior Department  in cooperation with state and local authorities and other partners  to do more to reduce the threat of very severe wildfires   It also includes provisions to support research aimed at improving the long term health of our forests as well as provisions to make it easier for Coloradans    including both small businesses and individual property owners    to assist the federal  state  and local agencies in working toward the reduction of fire risks and improvement of forest health   Last year several members of the delegation introduced separate bills on this subject   The delegation later agreed to work together to try to develop a consensus approach   This bill is the result of that collaboration      R CO       The bark beetle problem we are facing in Colorado could lead to   Katrina like   disaster     said Senator Allard    Already portions of Colorado are burning and the dead trees left in the wake of the Bark Beetle epidemic present a ticking time bomb waiting for a spark or a lightening strike  I  ve been pushing for a solution to this problem for years and this bipartisan legislation will provide much needed relief and forest management tools to help combat this growing threat       Ken Salazar  D CO       The incidence of bark beetle infestation  coupled with a looming drought and a hot summer season makes the threat of wildfire all the more real     said Senator Salazar     We have an obligation to act as stewards of our natural environment so that future generations can continue to enjoy Colorado  s natural wonders in the future   This bill  sponsored by every member of the Congressional delegation  fulfills this obligation by providing a bi partisan solution to what is a very serious problem for communities throughout the state of Colorado and our Nation as a whole       Congressman Mark Udall  CO 2       I have put a priority on reducing the wildfire risks to our communities since I was elected to Congress     said Rep  Udall    The risks have been made greater by drought and past management policies   And now there is an additional factor    increasingly widespread infestations of bark beetles that turn whole mountainsides and valleys rust red with dead and dying trees   More and more of our mountain communities find themselves in uncomfortable proximity to these infested areas  which has added to their concerns about the danger of catastrophic wildfires   This legislation takes an important step toward addressing that problem      Congresswoman Diana DeGette  CO 1       This bill reflects a truly bipartisan compromise that will get resources on the ground to help deal with insect infestation     said Rep  DeGette     Sound forest management should focus on reducing fuels in areas where people live  lowering the cost of treatment  and protecting our most sensitive wilderness areas       Congressman Tom Tancredo  CO 6       Passage of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act a few years ago achieved landmark procedural reforms that were long overdue     said Rep  Tancredo    That legislation helped free land managers from what had previously been an unworkable administrative thicket of red tape and bureaucracy  giving them new tools to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire  protect community watersheds and improve forest health   This bi partisan legislation will build on that important foundation      Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave  CO 4       Once a fire starts  there are enormous costs and widespread damage     said Rep  Musgrave     Managing the forests before the sparks fly is critical to minimizing potential damage  As the State of Colorado faces yet another high risk season  I am pleased lawmakers from both parties can come together to help reduce fire hazards and protect state watersheds from damage that could result from bark beetle infestations   Colorado is particularly sensitive to these harmful beetles because it is home to four regional watersheds that supply water to 19 western states   The forests and rivers in Colorado are among our most precious resources      Congressman John Salazar  CO 3      This summer in Colorado has been dry as dirt     said Rep  Salazar     Add hot temperatures to the number of beetle infested trees spreading throughout Colorado s forests and that equals trouble   In the last two months on the Western Slope  fires blazed through more than 2 000 acres and another fire struck the Durango area earlier this week  This legislation and more fire prevention funding are badly needed   This is the first step of many that Colorado s congressional leaders will have to take to lower the currently high fire risk that threatens portions of Colorado s mountains and the entire Rocky Mountain West    Congressman Ed Perlmutter  CO 7       Managing the impact of bark beetle and other insect infestations is critical to maintaining healthy forests here in Colorado     said Rep  Perlmutter     Already we  ve seen more than 450 wildfires this summer  and to mitigate against other dangerous  serious and expensive consequences  we must provide assistance to these at risk communities   I  m proud to work with my colleagues in Colorado on this important measure that can serve as a model to other states in maintaining healthy forests      Congressman Doug Lamborn  CO 5      Combating forest fires and protecting our Colorado communities is a top priority for both myself and our entire delegation   said Rep  Doug Lamborn    This legislation is the result of a bipartisan effort to ensure that the necessary tools are present to reduce the threat of forest fires   This bill also enables individuals and communities to proactively address the beetle infestation problems that contribute to this very real problem   We will continue to work together to fight this problem putting Colorado s forest health at the top of our agenda                               July 2007 Press Releases
