                                                                                                                                                                                                                   OPENING STATEMENT   Committee on Energy and Natural Resources   National Parks Subcommittee Hearing on Willing Seller Act         April 26th  2007   Thank you  Chairman Akaka and Ranking Member Thomas  for allowing me the opportunity to appear before you today  and for the committee  s consideration of the National Trails System Willing Seller Act     Many members of this committee are strong supporters of our National Trail System  trails like the Continental Divide Trail in Colorado which some of you may have had an opportunity to travel on horseback or to hike     I commend all of you for your efforts as you work on public land management and strive to find the proper balance between public and private land ownership      The Willing Seller act is not new to this committee   Starting in the 103rd Congress  and in every subsequent congress  some form of this legislation has been introduced     In the 108th Congress this committee approved similar legislation and the Senate unanimously approved the bill  unfortunately the House of Representatives failed to act on this bill before the session ended     I look forward to working with my colleagues  and those who have put so much time into this effort  as we work to finally pass this bill into law   On October 2  1968  the National Trails System Act  which authorized the National Trails System  became law   The intent of the act was to create a system of trails that provide recreation opportunities and that promotes the preservation of access to the outdoor and historic resources of the nation     Historically trails have served as routes for the commerce and migration that expanded our nation and connected our geographically diverse populace     Today  these same trails serve as a proud link to our past heritage and scenic beauty  connecting the path  s of our nation with the present generation of Americans    Congress authorized 9 national scenic and historic trails between 1978 and 1986   However  unlike the other trails within the system  these trails did not have the authority to purchase land to complete the trails from willing sellers     In other words  even if a land owner wants to furnish land that would fill the gaps in trail ownership  he or she can not do so   That is why I have introduced this legislation    The Willing Seller Act restores the ability of the federal agencies to carry out their responsibility to protect nationally significant components of our nation  s cultural  natural and recreational heritage     Completion of these trails is important to me and my state  and I hope you will support the Willing Seller bill     The authorization granted in S 169 only authorizes land acquisition from willing sellers     With this willing seller authority  sections of these trails now located on roads can be moved to overland routes that will provide safer and better conditions for hikers and other trail users     Under the Willing Seller Act  no contract is valid unless the landowner agrees to sell and receives compensation for his land  In addition the federal government specifically denies its power to condemn land for the trail    Congress enacted the National Trails System Act in 1968   to provide the means to provide for the ever increasing outdoor recreation needs of an expanding population and in order to promote the preservation of  public access to  travel within  and enjoyment and appreciation of the open air  outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation        The Willing Seller Act restores consistency to the National Trails System Act by providing the means to complete the National Trails System     S  169 provides the authority for federal administering agencies to help protect the sites and segments critical to preserving the integrity and continuity of nearly half of the National Trails System    Mr  Chairman  it is my hope that we can reach an agreement on this bill so that we will be able to preserve private property rights while serving the intent of the National Trails System Act     Thank you for your time and consideration                              April 2007 Press Releases
