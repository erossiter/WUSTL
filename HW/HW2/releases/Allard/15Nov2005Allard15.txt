          HEARING TESTIMONY on Rocky Flats          November 15th  2005   Thank you Mr  Chairman   I am pleased to testify before this committee and discuss with you one of the Department of Energy  s greatest achievements    the clean up of Rocky Flats    As you know  Rocky Flats is located just a few miles northwest of Denver  Colorado   For over four decades  this facility was the Department of Energy  s dedicated site for manufacturing plutonium pits for the U S  nuclear weapons stockpile   This highly classified production facility was run by over 8 000 Coloradoans who worked day and night for most of the Cold War   These Coloradoans were Cold War heroes who kept America  s nuclear deterrent strong and helped protect our country    When plutonium pit production ended in 1991  the clean up of Rocky Flats was uncertain at best   No one knew quite how to proceed    The clean up of a site this contaminated had never been considered before   Tons of weapons grade plutonium  plutonium compounds  uranium  and other radioactive metallic residues remained   Significant volumes of hazardous and radioactive waste generated during the decades of production would need to be removed   Building 771  in particular  was so contaminated that it was dubbed by the national media as the   Most Dangerous building in America      In 1995  the expected clean up of Rocky Flats was estimated to cost approximately  35 billion and take over 70 years to complete    Few believed that they would be alive when the site was finally cleaned up    Yet  five years after the date the clean up agreement was signed  the contractor  Kaiser Hill has done something few of us believed possible   On October 13th of this year  Kaiser Hill declared the clean up of Rocky Flats complete     Mr  Chairman  as you see in these photos  you won  t find any buildings or structures at Rocky Flats   You won  t find any radioactive materials that exceeds natural background levels   Even the roads have been torn up and removed   The site has been returned to the way it was before plutonium production at Rocky Flats began   It is now beautiful open space that we all can enjoy        Although much has been achieved over the last five years  it was not easy and a number of challenges had to be overcome    Let me share a couple lessons learned  which  from my perspective  were key to the successful clean up of Rocky Flats     First  we discovered what we should have always known   We discovered that those who are appropriately incentivized can and will achieve incredibly difficult goals   Kaisar Hill  the Rocky Flats clean up prime contractor  agreed to a tough clean up time table for the clean up of the site without fully knowing the extent of the contamination or the level of clean up that would be required   It was a risk on the company  s part  but the incentives for success made the risk worthwhile     I applaud the Department of Energy for its creativity in negotiating the Rocky Flats clean up contract  and I commend Nancy Tour  Bob Card  Jesse Roberson and the many others who worked hard for Kaiser Hill to meet and exceed the goals of the clean up contract   Second  we learned the value of state and local support   We were fortunate at Rocky Flats to have a number of local city and county governments who embraced accelerated clean up and did everything they could to support it   The Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments  in particular  played a pivotal role in ensuring the clean up was done right the first time     The State of Colorado also deserves tremendous credit for agreeing to an accelerated clean up plan that allowed the Department of Energy to move forward without a formal Record of Decision prior to clean up activities   In an unusual partnership  the State of Colorado joined with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy in an effort to work together to verify and monitor proposed clean up remedies   This collaboration allowed these parties to solve problems and deal with issues before they got out of hand    Community organizations like the Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board and the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center also played an important role   These organizations demanded that the Department of Energy live up to its clean up commitments and refused to allow the Department to take short cuts     The third lesson that I took away from the Rocky Flats clean up is that the workers must buy into the clean up   The workers can make or break the clean up   If they work hard  as they did at Rocky Flats  then I believe even the most difficult clean up becomes possible   However  if the workers are not appropriately incentivized or if the workers see their jobs as life time employment  then the project can quickly fall behind schedule and experience enormous cost growth   The workers at Rocky Flats believed in the clean up and did everything they could to meet the goals set for them    They learned new jobs   They wore extremely uncomfortable respiratory gear   They removed some of the most dangerous radioactive waste known to man   And  they did this knowing that their job was going to come to an end     I cannot fully express the respect and admiration I have for the workers at Rocky Flats   They made the impossible possible  and deserve the lions share of the credit for completing the Rocky Flats clean up a year and three months ahead of schedule   Their actions saved the American people over  500 million in Fiscal Year 2007 alone     Lastly  Mr  Chairman  I would be remiss if I did not express my gratitude and thanks to you  ranking member Bingman  and the other members of this committee for the support you have provided for the accelerated clean up of Rocky Flats    Your leadership  Mr  Chairman  in particular was key to ensuring we had the necessary funding and political support to get this project done ahead of schedule and under cost      As the Department of Energy turns its focus on other clean up sites  it is my hope that the lessons learned at Rocky Flats will not be forgotten    Accelerated clean ups are possible  and the savings to the American taxpayer are significant    We need to do everything we can to encourage accelerated clean ups  and you can count on my continued support in that effort    Mr  Chairman  I encourage you and the other members of this Committee to tour Rocky Flats when you are in Colorado next    I guarantee that you will be impressed by how we have turned a highly contaminated nuclear weapons production facility into a natural wildlife refuge        Mr  Chairman  this concludes my testimony   Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with Committee
