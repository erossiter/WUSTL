January 10  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the President  s Speech on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Based on the President  s speech tonight  I cannot support his proposed escalation of the war in Iraq           The President  s Iraq policy has been marred by incompetence and arrogance as his Administration has refused to recognize the military and political reality on the ground   American troops continue to serve and sacrifice in Iraq  performing magnificently and bravely  But as our commanders have said repeatedly  Iraq requires a political solution  not a purely military one  and we did not hear such a proposed solution tonight          The President simply has not gotten the message sent loudly and clearly by the American people  that we desperately need a new course   The President has not offered a new direction  instead he will continue to take us down the wrong road    only faster  The President  s speech failed to adequately address the political situation in Iraq  rising sectarian violence  mounting strain on our military  growing Iranian influence  and festering divides over how to distribute oil revenues           As I have said  as the American people have demanded  and as the facts on the ground require  we need a new course and an end to the current failed policy  I continue to urge a strategy that places pressure on the Iraqi government to resolve the political crisis through phased redeployment of U S  troops  establishes an Iraqi Oil Trust to end the stalemate over oil  and pursues an aggressive diplomatic strategy including an international conference of the regional parties to further the task of Iraq  s stability          Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
