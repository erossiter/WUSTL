                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Seeks Clarification on Details of the  25 million Announced by the Administration Last Month                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton met today with Admiral John O  Agwunobi Assistant Secretary for Health  United States Department of Health and Human Services to discuss the details of the Administration s recent commitment of  25 million for 9 11 healthcare           Last month  the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  indicated that they would make  25 million available in the President s Budget for Fiscal Year 2008  At the meeting today  the Senator presented Admiral Agwunobi with a letter detailing her concerns and questions about the funding which she still sees as insufficient to take care of the significant health needs that 9 11 workers  responders  residents  volunteers  students and others are facing           It was a pleasure to meet with Dr  Agwunobi today and to talk through the critical details of this funding  I was pleased when the Administration made the commitment to include  25 million in the FY 2008 Budget but I remain fundamentally convinced that it is simply not enough to take care of those who need it  I also think the devil is in the details and I want to work with Dr  Agwunobi to ensure that this funding goes exactly where it is needed in a timely way and without taking funds from other critical programs   Senator Clinton said        A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below       John O  Agwunobi  M D   Assistant Secretary for Health  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20201      Dear Dr  Agwunobi       I was very pleased to hear from Office of Management and Budget Director Portman last month that future funding has been promised  and I am pleased that we can meet to discuss this today          My central aim is to ensure that this is not a hollow promise            The  25 million is an important first step  however  it is not enough to meet the growing need   As Mayor Bloomberg pointed out yesterday  it will require far more to help provide the full assistance the responders and workers require  and we need to figure out a plan for the populations not currently eligible for the federally funded programs   residents  office workers and students            Further to my concerns that this funding is simply not enough  I have a number of questions which I would like answered about the nature of the funding itself and how it will be administered  which I think are also critical to the goal of providing the funds where they are most needed           In the President s FY 2008 Budget request  the  25 million was allocated to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund of the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   Can you confirm whether this amount will be directed through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH    The purpose of the money was to make sure the current programs are still able to treat their patients  so I want to make sure that it will not be administered through another structure to avoid any unnecessary delays in the funds being delivered          If currently existing programs need additional funds before the FY08 cycle  there was a commitment made by the Administration to provide it   Can you clarify where this money would come from   I want to ensure that it is not taken from what is left of the  90 million in medical monitoring money that I and others worked to secure            I understand that HHS is expected to come out with a report on 9 11 health issues in the near future   What do you hope to achieve by the report  and what is its current status          Finally  I will be holding a hearing through the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  HELP  on March 21st  and will be asking for HHS to testify   Mayor Bloomberg has already agreed to testify and I hope that HHS will as well          The Mayor s WTC Health Panel makes a strong case for why long term  sustained assistance is needed from the federal government   The report makes some critical recommendations on what should be done to help take care of those who are suffering devastating health effects as a result of 9 11  and I look forward to working with you on their implementation            The federal government has a responsibility to our 9 11 heroes to make sure there is adequate funding to meet the growing need   Just as we are beginning to fully realize the extent of the damage that was done to the health of those at Ground Zero  the very program that is treating their conditions faces an uncertain future   We cannot allow these critical healthcare services to cease operating due to lack of support   These brave  selfless men and women need our help and we must continue to uphold our commitment to them          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton        Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the health effects of 9 11
