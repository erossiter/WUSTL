October 24  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the U S  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  I opposed the nomination of Leslie Southwick to serve a lifetime appointment on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit   His tenure as a judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals reveals a record that fails to honor the principles of equality and justice and demonstrates a disregard for civil rights      The American people deserve federal judges  regardless of who nominates them  who are dedicated to an evenhanded and just application of our laws   In case after case  Judge Southwick has demonstrated a lack of respect and understanding for the civil rights of all Americans  and particular indifference towards the real and enduring evils of discrimination against African Americans and gay and lesbian Americans    After reviewing his judicial opinions and examining his qualifications  I have concluded that Judge Southwicks regressive civil rights record should disqualify him from serving a lifetime appointment on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit   I urge the President to select judicial nominees who embrace the principle that all are equal under the law
