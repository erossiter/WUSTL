March 27  2007 Senator Clinton s Opening Statement at Senate HELP Committee Hearing on Ensuring Safe Medicines and Medical Devices for Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Senator Dodd has such a long history of being on the forefront of all of the efforts we ve made in the Congress over a number of years now on behalf of children and families  and it s a real pleasure to be here with both he and Senator Alexander   I m pleased to be Senator Dodd s co sponsor on the Pediatric Medical Devices Safety and Improvement Act  when that is finally offered  because it will improve the number and types of medical devices designed for pediatric populations              And I particularly want to thank the witnesses today  who are going to give us the guidance that Senator Alexander said that we need to have   And I welcome back Susan Belfiore and her family because she s been an advocate on behalf of these issues along with her family for a number of years now            The type of drugs and the number of drugs that are available for children has been an issue for me for many years   Back during the Clinton Administration  I first worked with the Food and Drug Administration and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and other patient groups to establish the Pediatric Rule which requires that drug manufactures ensure medications marketed for pediatric use are safe and effective for our children   And then when this regulation was challenged in court  I worked with my colleagues in the Senate  Senator Dodd and Senator DeWine to get the Pediatric Rule enacted into law   And this landmark law  the Pediatric Research Equity Act was a real step forward   We can look at the changes and realize how much has occurred and yet still know we still have a long way to go            As of the early 1990s  only about 20 percent of drugs contained specific pediatric dosing information  but we know that children are not just little adults  and a drug that reacts one way in an adult s body can have serious consequences in a child  And as Senator Alexander said  we sometimes tragically discover this            We ve put pediatricians in the past into a guessing game  trying to determine if a drug appropriate for an adult would have the same pharmacological effects on a child   But thanks to combined efforts the Pediatric Research Equity Act and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  we re now able to use the best evidence to make better healthcare decisions for children   We re now requiring submission of pediatric clinical trial data for new drug applications so that we can be better assured that drugs marketed for children are safe and effective          Indeed  more than a thousand new and supplemental drug applications have fallen under the scope of the Pediatric Rule and the Pediatric Research Equity Act   The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act have managed to increase our understanding of the way drugs work in a pediatric population            For example  we ve learned that a drug commonly prescribed for migraines in adults is not effective in pediatric populations and may actually cause serious adverse consequences     We ve learned that methylphenidate  a drug prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  is processed more by adolescents than other age groups  therefore requires different dosages           We ve been able to collect data on drugs commonly used in children   like azithromycin  an antibiotic used to treat bronchitis  pneumonia  and respiratory infections  as well as drugs that are not so commonly used  but that help keep children alive  like emtriva one of the newer drugs we have to treat AIDS            But  both of these Acts are scheduled to expire in September if they re not reauthorized  So  that s why this hearing is so timely and important            And I ll be introducing the Pediatric Research Improvement Act legislation that would reauthorize the Pediatric Research Equity Act and make permanent the FDA s authority to require submission of pediatric clinical trial data for drugs designed for children            I just want to emphasize this one point   When both of these bills were passed they had what are called sunsets  which means that you have to go back and reauthorize them   I think that there is general agreement that the Best Pharmaceuticals Act probably is one that a sunset is important for to make sure that the incentives that Senator Dodd designed are working the way they should   But  it seems a little strange that we would have to reauthorize the Pediatric Rule   We don t have sunsets on getting adult clinical data to determine what happens with drugs in adults   We shouldn t have any kind of sunset on getting the same data for children            I think we should make this Pediatric Rule permanent and I will be introducing legislation to do that   It will also approve the ability of the FDA to require testing on already marketed drugs when drug companies refuse to carry out that testing on their own and better coordinate the incentives in these important laws   So  I m very pleased to be here and continue to work with my colleagues led by Senator Dodd to get this done               Senator Clinton Announces Bill to Reauthorize Pediatric Rule
