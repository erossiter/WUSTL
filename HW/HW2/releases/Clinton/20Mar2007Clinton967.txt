                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today questioned Air Force Secretary Michael W  Wynne and Air Force Chief of Staff General T  Michael Moseley about the Air Force s approach to the contract award for a new Combat Search and Rescue Helicopter  the CSAR X program   In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  the Senator noted that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  recently ruled in favor of a bid protest regarding the Air Force s new Combat Search and Rescue Aircraft  the CSAR X and then expressed her concerns about some of the public statements that the Air Force made in the aftermath of the decision   Lockheed Martin Owego was one of the bidders for the CSAR X contract and now that the bidding has been reopened  Senator Clinton is working to make sure that the bidding process is fair and transparent   In response to her questioning  Secretary Wynne indicated that the Air Force would indeed take a broader approach to the evaluation of the proposals            In February  Senator Clinton wrote Air Force Secretary Michael W  Wynne  expressing her similar concern about reports that the Air Force would take a  narrow  approach to the GAO s decision upholding the bid protest on the CSAR X contract and urged the Air Force to develop a set of requirements that truly reflect the rescue crew s needs in a combat search and rescue aircraft        Click here for a copy of Senator Clinton s letter       Below is a transcript of Senator Clinton s exchange with Secretary Wynne and General Moseley at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing today       Senate Armed Services Committee  March 20  2007   Senator Clinton  Thank you very much Mr  Chairman and Secretary Wynne  General Moseley  Thank you both for your service and I appreciate greatly that you each have visited Air Force installations in New York  I want to thank General Moseley for honoring my invitation to join me at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station last year and Secretary Wynne  thank you for accepting my suggestion that you visit the Air Force Research Lab in Rome  They do obviously  in my opinion  remarkable work in support of our men and women in uniform          I have several questions about different items in the Air Force s Budget request for Fiscal Year 2008 and I have a series of questions about the CSAR X           As you know  the GAO recently ruled in favor of a bid protest regarding the Air Force s new Combat Search and Rescue aircraft  the CSAR X  and I m concerned about some of the public statements that the Air Force made in the aftermath of that decision  And as you know  I recently wrote a letter to you expressing my concerns and Mr  Chairman  I request that my letter to Secretary Wynne be made part of the record           In late February  Mr  Secretary  you testified to the House Armed Services Committee that it was your view the GAO decision should be interpreted narrowly  and both Reuters and Dow Jones reported that after your appearance before the committee  you stated that the Air Force prefers to  and I quote      to stay with what we got and get this product going as soon as possible    Could you please explain those statements for us        Secretary Wynne  Yes  ma am  As usual they tend to leave off the last part of your quotation  but I would say I always try to add that I would like to stay with the current system  but I have to satisfy the GAO and I have to satisfy the other competitors to make sure that they believe we have done this in a transparent and open method  We are actually partnering as best we can with the General Accounting Office  have asked them to reconsider to make sure that we have a better read on all of the protested items  not just for Lockheed  but also for Sikorsky  so that when we do resolicit   we have an intention to resolicit   it will be against the findings that the GAO has alerted us to and ma am  I am agnostic as to which helicopter ultimately comes out  but frankly I would like to support the procurement system that we have and so therefore would like to get on with providing this equipment       Senator Clinton  I really appreciate that very much Mr  Secretary  And there are a number of specific issues with respect to the GAO decision  recommending that revised proposals should be solicited  and I appreciate your commitment to resolicitation  and I think it s important given the GAO faulting the process followed by the prior source selection team  I d like to ask  do you plan to put new personnel in place to ensure the perception as well as the reality of transparency and fairness in the reevaluation process       Secretary Wynne  Ma am  what I intend to do is be very clear with the vendors as to what we have  if you will  what we have miscommunicated with them before  I intend to have that process be open to them so they can see how it affected the evaluation and I intend to debrief them on it  I do not see that we were unfair  I do believe that there were some mistakes made and we will provide additional oversight for that        Senator Clinton  Another matter of concern to me with respect to this solicitation was Secretary Ken Krieg s recent statement that  again reported in the media  that  schedule  was the most important selection criterion  and that does not appear to be consistent with the RFP that says schedule is the fifth of six priorities  And the reason I m asking these questions is because obviously the combat search and rescue capacity of the Air Force is critical for our men and women in uniform  And General Moseley  I am not aware of any military in the world that uses the CH47 for dedicated CSAR are you       General Moseley  Ma am  first thanks for recognizing that combat search and rescue is core competency  We do that  not just for ourselves  It s a solemn relationship between a guy that flies and the PJ that comes to pick you up  But we do this with a joint team too  whether it s Navy or whether it s Marine or Army  we have to go fairly deep at range and pick people up  And remember when we send people to do this  somebody shot somebody down  so it s a hostile place before you show up  And they re normally still milling around back there so to get the PJ there to pick the person up is a core competency for us   Ma am  I m not aware that anyone uses the 47 in a combat rescue role  but I would also tell you that my Army brothers and my Special Operations brothers use that airframe in some very difficult places  Today they re flying those airplanes into some bad places in Afghanistan and Iraq  It is not combat search and rescue  but it is a hostile place that they operate those airplanes       Senator Clinton  I appreciate that General  because I share your strong commitment to making sure we get this right and I m just wondering General  whether the Air Force completed an analysis of alternatives for this CSAR  X program  Were any heavy lift helicopters like the H53 or the H47 considered viable alternatives for the CSAR mission  And if not  could you explain why not        General Moseley  Ma am  an analysis of alternatives was conducted out of the JROC and it was forwarded through the joint system  We asked for medium lift helicopters as a nomenclature  but as the RFI went out we got no reply back from anyone with any big helicopters  When the RFP went out though  the 47 was competed and it met the timelines  And so  what you re asking is an interesting twist of the process  There was a JROC conducted  there was an analysis of alternatives  there was an RFI and then an RFP and all along the way I would tell you that the process worked  The contractor just submitted the airplane that met those requirements in the RFP        Senator Clinton  Well General  I understand very well how important this is to all of us but I believe that certain key performance parameters related to the terminal area were not listed as special interest items by the source selection team and I think that it might be appropriate  at least  to reconsider whether that would be something to include going forward         General Moseley  Ma am  can I one more time thank you for the recognition that this is a big deal for us  That s why the two of us have made this the number two procurement priority for the Air Force  This is a big deal for the joint team  it s a big deal for everything that we do  and it s a moral and ethical imperative that we pick our people up        Senator Clinton  Well obviously we want to get it right  and I m worried about the weight and the maneuverability and some of the issues that have now been pushed into the public arena because we do have to get it right  And Mr  Chairman  I have several other questions I would ask unanimous consent to be submitted to the record for response by our witnesses
