March 8  2005 Clinton Calls on Senate Budget Committee to Prevent Drastic Cuts to Water Infrastructure Funds for New York Cities and Towns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     New York State could lose millions of dollars in vital funding for sewage and wastewater treatment upgrades if funding not restored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Senate Budget Committee to reject the Bush Administration s proposed cuts to the EPA s Clean Water State Revolving Fund  SRF   a vital funding program that helps cities and towns upgrade their water and wastewater systems  Estimating that the cuts could cost New York s towns and cities up to  40 million next year  Senator Clinton signed a bipartisan letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  urging that the funding be restored     The President s proposed  361 million cut to water treatment funding is unacceptable   said Senator Clinton    With a growing population and an aging wastewater infrastructure in many of our cities and towns  the President s decision is incredibly short sighted     The Clean Water SRF is the primary source of federal funding for clean water infrastructure   The funds are allocated to states which use them to capitalize revolving loan funds  making low or no interest loans to towns  cities and counties for sewage treatment plants and wastewater systems   For the current fiscal year  EPA is providing  1 091 billion nationwide  over  120 million of which goes to the New York Clean Water SRF   The President s budget for the next fiscal year would cut the nationwide total by  361 million to  730 million  and New York s SRF would stand to lose  40 million of that funding next year   This cut would reduce the number of projects that the New York SRF could finance next year and into the future        Examples of projects recently funded out of the New York Clean Water SRF include            1 5 million for sewage treatment facilities in the Town of Leray          1 5 million for sewer extension on the Westside of the Village of Clayton          2 8 million for sewage treatment projects in Westchester County   800 000 for sewage treatment plant modifications to reduce phosphorus in the City of Ithaca          234 803 for a new wastewater treatment facility in the Town of DeKalb          1 75 million for the Red Creek Area Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant in Wayne County     Descriptions of these and other recently financed projects can be found at  http   www nysefc org pressrelease htm    A copy of the Senators  letter is attached      March 3  2005   The Honorable Judd Gregg      Chairman      Committee on the Budget      United States Senate     Washington  DC 20510   The Honorable Kent Conrad    Ranking Member   Committee on the Budget    United States Senate      Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad    As you prepare the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution  we urge you to restore funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds  SRF  to at least the fiscal year 2004 level of  1 35 billion  The proposed cuts would have a devastating impact on the ability of our states and communities to continue upgrading their wastewater infrastructure and meeting Clean Water Act requirements  the attached table shows the state by state impacts   We urge you to support the President s request for  850 million for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds  which help communities ensure safe drinking water    Despite important progress over the last three decades  EPA reports that 40 percent of our nation s waters are still too impaired for fishing or swimming   Discharges from aging and failing sewerage systems  urban storm water and other sources continue to pose serious threats to our nation s lakes  rivers and estuaries  endangering not only public health but fishing and recreation industries  Population growth and development are placing additional stress on the nation s water infrastructure and its ability to sustain hard won water quality gains       The President s budget proposes to cut the Clean Water SRF by more than 33 percent  which will exacerbate the current spending gap to address water infrastructure  In May 2002  the Congressional Budget Office released a report that estimated the spending gap for Clean Water needs between  132 billion and  388 billion over 20 years and the spending gap for drinking water needs at between  70 billion and  362 billion over 20 years  In September 2002  the EPA released a Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Gap Analysis  which found that there will be a  535 billion gap between current spending and projected needs for water and wastewater infrastructure by 2019 if additional investments are not made   In fiscal years 2004 and 2005  the Senate Budget Resolution supported  3 2 billion for the Clean Water SRF and  2 billion for the Drinking Water SRF in order to address this financial need for infrastructure projects    The federal government must sustain a strong partnership with states and local governments to avert this massive projected funding gap and share in the burden of maintaining and improving the nation s water infrastructure  We urge you to restore funding for the Clean Water SRF to  1 35 billion and maintain funding for the Drinking Water SRF at  850 million as an absolute minimum level for protecting the safety of our water         Sincerely
