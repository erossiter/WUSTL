May 23  2007 Clinton  Domenici Reintroduce Bill to Improve Response to Mental Health Consequences of Major Disasters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Pete Domenici  R NM  today announced the reintroduction of legislation to help prepare first responders and health care professionals to effectively address mental health consequences in the wake of public health emergencies  like those created after the September 11th attacks and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007 would establish the National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness to coordinate the development and delivery of mental health services in collaboration with federal  state and local entities when our nation is confronted with public health catastrophes            September 11th and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita showed clearly that our emergency response must include a coordinated approach to helping victims and survivors cope with the mental health effects of tragedy   Yet years after these disasters  we still don t have the resources needed or the coordinated plan in place to meet mental health needs in a time of emergency   We cannot wait until another disaster strikes before we take action  When disaster strikes we must be ready to immediately mobilize and deploy necessary resources at a federal  state and local level to provide the response those affected need and deserve   said Senator Clinton           Few communities in the United States are prepared to handle the mental health needs of the victims of disasters  terrorist events or public health emergencies    In a time of crisis  the key to responding efficiently and effectively is organizing and delivering services both individually and as part of a network  In the event of public health emergencies  federal  state and local disaster plans must include coordinated protocols for the management of mental health response and delivery   It is my hope that this bill will help provide the resources necessary to improve our response to the mental health care needs of our citizens and help us to avoid the shortfalls we all witnessed in the aftermath of events like 9 11 and Hurricane Katrina   said Senator Domenici  a longtime mental health advocate          The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007 would create the National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness and charge it with five functions to address mental health problems and coordinate the development and delivery of mental health services in conjunction with existing federal  state and local entities in the event of a public health emergency           Under the bill  the National Center would work to establish and disseminate up to date and effective training curricula to help emergency health professionals at the state and local levels  including mental health professionals  public health and healthcare professionals  emergency services personnel  county emergency managers  school personnel  spiritual care professionals  and state and local government officials responsible for emergency preparedness           The legislation will also establish the National Center as a clearinghouse of educational materials  guidelines  and research on public mental health emergency preparedness and service delivery  Technical assistance would be provided to help users access those resources most effective for their communities           In addition  the bill will task the National Center with creating an annual national forum for emergency health professionals  researchers  other experts and federal  state and local government officials to identify and address gaps in science  practice  policy and education related to public mental health emergency preparedness and service delivery           The National Center will also work with the National Disaster Medical System and the Emergency Management Assistance Compact to ensure that licensed mental health professionals are included in the deployment of disaster medical assistance teams   Deployment of licensed mental health professionals will increase the effectiveness of medical teams by providing psychological assistance and crisis counseling to survivors and to the other team members   Further  the National Center will work with the National Disaster Medical System to ensure that licensed mental health professionals are included in its leadership to provide appropriate support for behavioral programs and personnel within disaster medical assistance teams          Finally  the Public Mental Health Preparedness Act of 2007 will require annual evaluations of both the National Center s efforts and those across the federal government in building our nation s public mental health emergency preparedness and service delivery capacity   Based on these evaluations  recommendations would be made to improve mental health strategies and resources            The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007 aims to fill in a critical gap that exists in the nation s preparedness for any disaster  ranging from pandemic flu to hurricanes   said Georges C  Benjamin  MD  FACP  FACEP  Emeritus   executive director of the American Public Health Association  APHA    As we ve seen in past disasters  including the hurricanes of the Gulf Coast and the Asian tsunami  the health effects of a disaster are not solely limited to physical ailments  there are mental and emotional consequences as well  APHA is pleased that this bill takes vital steps to integrate the mental health needs of those affected by a public health emergency into current efforts to prepare  including the National Response Plan and the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan            Both human made and natural disasters can have significant mental health consequences for many who are affected   The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007 would take important steps to enhance our preparedness and response efforts to address the mental health needs of the population  including some of our most vulnerable subgroups  in the aftermath of catastrophic events   said Gwendolyn Puryear Keita  Ph D   Executive Director of the Public Interest Directorate  American Psychological Association          The Clinton Domenici bill is supported by the American Psychological Association  American Public Health Association  the National Association of Social Workers and the American Academy of Child   Adolescent Psychiatry   Senator Clinton first introduced the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act during the 109th Congress
