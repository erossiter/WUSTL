October 27  2005 Senate Unanimously Approves Clinton Measure to Prepare For Avian Flu Outbreak                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    The Senate today unanimously approved a proposal  co sponsored by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  to increase funds available to fight seasonal flu and help our nation prepare for a pandemic or avian flu outbreak   The measure  offered as an amendment to the Labor HHS Education appropriations bill  provides nearly  8 billion in funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  for response to avian flu and seasonal flu outbreaks   In announcing passage of the amendment  Senator Clinton underscored that  while providing needed funding is an important step  we also need to make fundamental fixes to our seasonal flu vaccine production and distribution system to ensure we have the infrastructure needed to respond to a crisis            This increased funding to help CDC be prepared for an avian flu outbreak or pandemic is an important step forward  but more work remains to be done   We must work to immediately fix our broken flu vaccine production and delivery system before we can be prepared to respond adequately to the seasonal flu epidemic  let alone the crisis situation we will face when avian flu reaches our shores   I have introduced legislation that will make these needed fixes to our flu vaccine production and delivery infrastructure and I will continue to fight to get my legislation passed             The amendment approved today by the Senate increases funding for stockpiling vaccines and antiviral drugs and for improvements to our domestic capacity to produce them   It also will enable needed upgrades in our public health infrastructure by providing additional funding for improving hospital surge capacity and grants to help state and local health departments prepare for public health emergencies like vaccine shortages and pandemic outbreaks   It will also provide funding to allow us to increase our global and domestic surveillance around pandemic and seasonal flu  including improvements to our health information technology infrastructure            Senator Clinton has introduced legislation with Senator Pat Roberts that would provide the additional necessary authority to HHS to strengthen our flu vaccine production and delivery infrastructure so that we are able to respond to a crisis  including many of the needed improvements funded by the amendment passed by the Senate today   The Clinton Roberts bill  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  addresses the causes of previous influenza vaccine shortages by bringing increased stability to our nation  s seasonal flu vaccine market  The bill provides a framework through which our public health officials can track vaccines to ensure we have an adequate supply and to make sure high priority populations are vaccinated  The bill also provides technical assistance to companies that wish to produce vaccine domestically  and it will increase education about the importance of obtaining seasonal flu vaccines  The legislation will also strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza
