                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Strong Investment in Nutrition Title Needed to Ensure Funding to Combat Growing Problem of Food Insecurity Across the Country                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined several of her colleagues in urging the leadership of the Senate Agriculture and Finance Committees to support a strong investment in the Nutrition Title for the 2007 Reauthorization of the Farm Bill  In a letter  the bipartisan coalition of senators stressed the need to provide at least as much funding for federal food assistance activities as is provided in the House passed Farm Bill to better address the nutritional needs of working families and to reduce hunger in the United States    Every day throughout New York State and across the country  hard working people face rising costs as they struggle to provide healthy  nutritious food to their families  said Senator Clinton  Ending hunger and food insecurity must be above politics and partisanship   With the upcoming Farm Bill  we can begin to close the gap and address the hunger problem in this country    The nutrition provisions in H R  2419  The Farm  and Bioenergy Act of 2007  include more than  4 billion over five years in improvements for numerous food assistance programs oversight  reauthorization  and technical provisions  USDA Census Bureau survey data shows that there are more than 35 million people in the United States who live in households facing hunger  While Food Stamp benefits continue to be eroded by inflation  increasing numbers of people are either ineligible for food stamps or can not make their food stamp benefits last through the entire month  forcing them to seek help from food banks  pantries  and local emergency feeding organizations throughout the country  The support of a strong nutrition title in the upcoming Farm Bill will help move the nation closer to a hunger free America     Senator Clinton has worked to promote initiatives that increase the availability and affordability of healthy and fresh foods to working families  and has been a supporter of strengthening the Food Stamp program  A strong Nutrition title in the new Farm Bill would provide funding for legislation that was proposed earlier this year by Senator Clinton  which would help deliver fresh food from farms to underserved communities  The Food Outreach and Opportunity Development  FOOD  for a Healthy America Act would increase the supply and availability of locally produced foods by providing innovative financing for small and midsized family farmers and ranchers  See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 274531      The full text of the letter follows    October 3  2007   The

Building  Washington  DC 20510   The Honorable Chuck Grassley  135 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Senators    We write to urge your support for a strong investment in the Nutrition Title for the 2007 reauthorization of the Farm Bill      The nutrition provisions in H R  2419  The Farm  Nutrition  and Bioenergy Act of 2007  include more than  4 billion over five years in improvements for numerous food assistance programs oversight  reauthorization  and technical provisions  We encourage you to provide at least as much funding for federal food assistance activities as the House passed Farm Bill to better address the nutritional needs of low income families and to reduce hunger in the United States    In recent years  we have seen a rise in hunger and food insecurity as our fellow Americans struggle to make ends meet   USDA Census Bureau survey data show that there are more than 35 million people in the United States who live in households facing hunger   Rising food  housing  medical  and fuel costs have made it difficult for many families in our nation to afford a healthy and nutritious diet    The nutrition title of the new Farm Bill is critical to alleviating hunger in our nation    The value of Food Stamp benefits has eroded with inflation  and outdated eligibility criteria have made it difficult for many low income families to qualify for much needed food  Moreover  growing numbers of people ineligible for food stamps  or unable to make their food stamp benefits last throughout the month  are seeking help from food banks  pantries  and thousands of local emergency feeding organizations across the country  Boosting investment in federal food assistance programs and important local hunger relief activities will go a long way toward reducing hunger in cities and towns across the nation     The Nutrition title of this Farm Bill will touch every community in America and can do much to reinvigorate our bi partisan commitment to reducing hunger in our great nation  Hunger is not a partisan issue  and we now have the opportunity to repair the holes in our nations nutrition safety net  We strongly urge you to move our nation closer to a hunger free America and support a strong Nutrition title in the upcoming Farm bill     Respectfully
