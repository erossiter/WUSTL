March 22  2007 Senator Clinton Joins Bipartisan Group of Senators in Calling for UN Security Council Action Against Sudan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter to President Bush calling for action by the UN Security Council against Sudan  The letter addresses the need for the Security Council to enact a new resolution  imposing multilateral economic sanctions on the Sudanese government and targeted sanctions on individuals named by the UN Commission of inquiry as being responsible for crimes against humanity            The United States  like all nations who stand for freedom and respect for human rights  has the moral responsibility to condemn  in the strongest manner possible  the actions of the Sudanese government against its own people   said Senator Clinton   As earlier efforts have failed to produce an end to the violence  this letter sends a strong message that it is time for the Security Council to enact additional  multilateral sanctions           The letter to the President outlines the need for continued pressure on the Sudanese government to comply with current Security Council resolutions and urges the use of multilateral sanctions  especially those aimed at the Sudanese oil industry  The letter also reiterates the need for continued peacekeeping efforts in Darfur and the use of all resources to stop the violence           For over two years  Senator Clinton has called repeatedly for action in Darfur  Most recently  Senator Clinton applauded the decision of the African Union to decline to appoint Sudan as its chair           The full text of the letter to President Bush follows           Mr  George W  Bush  The President  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President        We write to you as Members of Congress who are deeply concerned about the ongoing genocide in Darfur and equally frustrated by the inability or unwillingness of the international community to put a halt to it  Last August  the United Nations Security Council passed UNSC Resolution 1706 which expanded the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Sudan to include Darfur and stated that over 20 000 military and civilian police personnel were to be deployed as peacekeepers in the region  Over six months have passed and fewer than 200 UN personnel have been deployed because of the Sudanese government s refusal to comply with what the Security Council has authorized           History demonstrates that Sudan s leadership does not respond to this type of request  We believe that it is time for the Security Council to enact a new resolution  imposing multilateral economic sanctions on the Sudanese government and targeted sanctions on individuals named by the UN Commission of inquiry as being responsible for crimes against humanity          We recognize that previous U S  led efforts to move stronger resolutions at the Security Council have been deterred by the threat of a veto by one or more of the Permanent Members  We frankly urge you to introduce and push for a vote on a resolution imposing multilateral sanctions regardless  Let a country stand before the community of nations and announce that it is vetoing the best effort we can muster to build the leverage necessary to end ongoing mass murder           There are political risks to advancing this strategy  but we urge you to weigh those risks against the verdict of history if we fail to try  If the Security Council does not act  the United States should engage with our allies to create a coalition that will impose economic penalties on the Sudanese government  The United States has already implemented a number of unilateral sanctions  and we understand that you are considering still more  a development that we would applaud  However  the real key to changing Khartoum s behavior most likely lies in multilateral sanctions  especially those aimed at the Sudanese oil industry          We encourage you to put this matter before the United Nations Security Council as soon as possible  A threatened veto should not silence us  We know that you share our commitment to this issue and we commend your courage in recognizing this genocide for what it is  We look forward to continuing our efforts until a timely solution to the crisis in Darfur is found           Sincerely
