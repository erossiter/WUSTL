               Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval by the full Senate of the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill  which includes  8 million for Western New York  including  2 million for Nanodynamics Energy  Inc s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Fuel Cell Power Source   2 million for Carwell Products U S  Marine Corps Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program   2 million for Carwell Products U S  Army Reserve Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program  and  2 million for Carwell Products U S  Army National Guard Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    The bill will now proceed to a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between their versions  Following conference  the bill will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which it will be sent to the President for his signature    This Senate approval is wonderful news for Western New York and a vital step in the appropriations process  said Schumer  These critical funds will help us ensure that in defending our nation  we are equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our nations defense forces and the Western New York economy  And it demonstrates what I have always said  upstate New York has some of the best educated  highly skilled workers anywhere  I will continue to aggressively push this bill through the appropriations process    Approval of this bill by the Senate is wonderful news for Western New York  and it is the next step in ensuring that these key projects receive this important funding  As these local companies and institutions continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  This is an important investment in Western New York for many reasons  not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said   Nanodynamics Energy  Inc   Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Fuel Cell Power Source    2 Million Funding will develop a flight weight 300 Watt solid oxide fuel cell system suitable to demonstrate the viability of providing sufficient power for propulsion  sensor  and communication systems for small tactical unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs  with a solid oxide fuel cell   The demonstration system will be fueled with propane and the development issues associated with a JP 8 version will be identified   Carwell Products  U S  Marine Corps Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    2 Million The Marine Corps currently has a requirement of  36 8 million in its corrosion control program   Of the  36 8 million requirement   15 1 million is required to expand the Marine Corps mobile corrosion efforts  Without additional funding to meet corrosion control requirements  future costs to repair corrosion damaged equipment could be enormous  This  funding is needed to establish and continue the operation of Mobile Corrosion Service Teams  CST  at  each of the three Marine Expeditionary Forces  MEF  and Support Commands located at  Camp Lejeune  NC  Camp Pendleton  CA  Camp Kinser  Okinawa  Japan  Camp Smith  Kaneohe  HI  Blount Island  FL  and Albany  Ga   Carwell Products  U S  Army Reserve Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    2 Million Over the last few years Congress has provided funding to help establish a corrosion control program for the Army and the Marines  The US Army Reserve  USAR  would like to establish a similar program  The USAR has a critical need for corrosion control in that the Reserves vehicles and equipment is older  they have fewer Controlled Humidity Units  CHU   and they are currently manned at 62 percent of their required force   This adversely impacts the USARs ability to support a proper vehicle maintenance program   Carwell Products  U S  Army National Guard Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    2 million Over the last few years Congress has provided funding to help establish a corrosion control program for the Army and the Marines  The Army National Guard  ARNG  would like to establish a similar program  The ARNG has a critical need for corrosion control  in that  the Guards vehicles and equipment is older  they have a large number of unprotected assets and manning levels are not sufficient to provide extensive maintenance support for corrosion abatement   This adversely impacts the Guards ability to support a proper vehicle maintenance program
