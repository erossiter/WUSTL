                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senator calls on USDA to provide immediate help with damage assessments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Following last week  s torrential rainfall across the Northeast  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on both the State and Federal Governments to assist Long Island winegrape and vegetable growers  In letters this week  Senator Clinton called on U S  Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to work with the local Farm Service Agency to survey the storm damage and urged Governor Pataki to request agricultural disaster assistance for Long Island farmers from the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA           The recent rains were devastating for so many grape and vegetable growers on Long Island     Senator Clinton said    Some growers are even facing the loss of almost their entire harvest  which will be a terrible blow  While weather disasters cannot be prevented  financial devastation can  I hope that once all the data has been collected we can secure a disaster declaration from the USDA that will help these growers as soon as possible           Since the unprecedented rains and flooding  Senator Clinton  s office has been working with the Long Island Farm Bureau and the New York Wine and Grape Foundation to help assess and mitigate the damage caused        More than twelve inches of rain fell in some areas and news reports have shown that vineyards across Long Island  s wine region may have lost over a third of their crop  In some cases  the rains were so severe that the vast majority of the year  s grape crop  nearing the very end of the growing season  may have been spoiled  Of particular concern are Long Island  s prized merlot grapes  With their thin skins  these grapes were likely severely damaged and made to wither or burst        A disaster declaration from the USDA would provide Long Island farmers and vineyard owners access to important and vital emergency aid such as noninsured loans as well as conservation and crop disaster assistance programs         Copies of Senator Clinton  s letters are attached        October 20  2005       The Honorable George E  Pataki  Governor  State of New York  State Capitol  Albany  NY  12224       Dear Governor Pataki        As you are aware  many parts of eastern Long Island experienced disastrous weather conditions and flooding last week   Some of the initial reports indicate more than 12 inches of rain in an eight day span  uncharacteristic levels for the region      Among those hardest hit was the farm community in Suffolk County  particularly the region  s popular vineyards and vegetable growers   Over the past 30 years  Long Island wineries have established themselves as some of the countries finest wine producers   Regrettably  this rain occurred at the end of the growing season  perhaps the most significant stage in the growing process  and caused significant damage in what was supposed to be a banner year for Long Island wineries        I understand that the Long Island Farm Bureau is currently conducting a survey of damage in the areas impacted by the storm   I hope that you will seek federal assistance from the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  should their assessment warrant such action   This would provide farmers and vineyard owners with access to USDA emergency programs      I urge you to give this request your full consideration   Please do not hesitate to contact my staff member Sean Conway at  202  224 4451 with any questions you may have   Thank you in advance for your assistance in this important matter                 Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton                 October 20  2005       The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary  United States Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20250       Dear Mr  Secretary        As you are aware  many

FSA  office to conduct a survey of damage in the areas impacted by the storm   If it is clear that federal assistance will be needed in order to deal with the damage left in the wake of this flooding  aid must be expedited to ensure recovery as the growing season comes to a conclusion          I urge you to give this request your full consideration   Please do not hesitate to contact my staff member Sean Conway at  202  224 6500 with any questions you may have   Thank you in advance for your assistance in this important matter        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
