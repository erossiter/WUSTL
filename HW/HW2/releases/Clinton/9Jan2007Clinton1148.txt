January 9  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on 9 11 Commission Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC      I am pleased that the House today has taken steps toward finally implementing the remaining recommendations of the bipartisan 9 11 Commission   This action is long overdue   For several years now  I have advocated for the full implementation of the Commission  s recommendations   Enacting the Commission  s remaining recommendations is a critically needed and too long neglected step toward meeting the challenges facing New York and the nation in the post 9 11 world            While I applaud the House for taking up this urgent bill  there are areas in which it falls short that I hope we can address in the Senate   For example  I do not believe the bill goes far enough when it comes to homeland security funding   The 9 11 Commission recommended    and I have repeatedly urged    that all homeland security funds be distributed according to the threats we face and not politically motivated formulas that divert critical homeland security funds   As Mayor Bloomberg emphasized today  New York City and other areas facing the highest risk of terrorist attack still do not have adequate funding to meet our unique security challenges   We need threat based funding  and I will continue to press for its implementation            I will also take steps to ensure that New York City and other high threat areas are not excluded from participating in the interoperable communications grant program to improve and to upgrade its emergency communications system   I have been a vocal advocate of the need to ensure that our emergency communications are interoperable  a key recommendation of the 9 11 Commission and I join Mayor Bloomberg s call to ensure that New York is not unfairly penalized as they seek to achieve this
