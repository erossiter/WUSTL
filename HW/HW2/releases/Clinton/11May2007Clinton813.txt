May 11  2007 Clinton Calls for Action in Senate to Address Honeybee Decline                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Asks Senate Committee on Agriculture and Senate Appropriations Committee to Address the Rapid Decline in Honeybee Colonies   Colony Collapse Disorder Threatening New York s Honeybee  Apple and Other Agricultural Industries                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on her colleagues on the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition   Forestry and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Committee Agriculture  Rural Development and Related Agencies to address the rapid decline in honeybee colonies in New York State and nationwide in the upcoming Farm Bill and Agricultural Appropriations Bill  In letters to both Committees  Senator Clinton pointed out that Colony Collapse Disorder that is decimating bee populations  has the potential to impact honey producers and fruit growers across the state and the nation           This is an unexplained crisis that threatens our honey producers and has already led to massive losses of bees and bee colonies  Not only will this impact the honey industry  it also has the potential to impact our fruit growers who need bees for pollination  I hope that we can address this issue in the upcoming Farm and Agricultural Appropriations Bills and take whatever action is needed to help our honey producers and prevent this situation from becoming even worse   Senator Clinton said          Last month Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in a letter to U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Mike Johanns  asking the Secretary to provide answers on how the USDA is planning to address the increasingly threatening  colony collapse disorder   which has decimated bee colonies throughout the United States          Copies of Senator Clinton s letters are below            May 11  2007      The Honorable Tom Harkin                                        Chairman                                Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  R 328A                                                  United States Senate    Washington  D C   20510      The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  R 337  United States Senate  Washington  D C   20510      Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss       As you consider the upcoming Farm Bill I would like to bring an issue to your attention that is of considerable concern to farmers in New York and across the nation           As you are no doubt aware  a new and unexplained condition known as Colony Collapse Disorder  CCD  is decimating bee colonies throughout the United States  CCD is causing some beekeepers to lose upwards of 90 percent of their bee colonies  and is causing serious reductions in the supplies of bees for essential commercial pollination   These severe losses are in addition to other problems such as higher production costs  mite infestations and unfairly traded imports that have been making it very difficult for beekeepers to operate profitably   If these alarming trends are allowed to continue  they will place at risk in excess of  14 billion in annual United States farm output that depends on bee pollination   Ultimately  the shortage of pollination services could impact the supply of healthful and affordable food for U S  consumers          America s beekeepers and their bees are an indispensable pillar of U S  agriculture   Our nation s beekeepers provide essential pollination services for over 90 different food  seed and fiber crops  contributing over  14 billion of added agricultural value as documented by a Cornell University study in 2000   Crops that depend upon or benefit from honey bee pollination include alfalfa  almonds  apples  avocados  blueberries  cantaloupes  carrots  cherries  citrus  cotton  cranberries  kiwis  plums  pumpkins  seed crops  soybeans  squash  sunflowers and watermelons          The effects of CCD are as prevalent in the state of New York as they are throughout the nation   According to local producers  there have been reports of severe losses in colonies  with many losses being reported of close to fifty percent  and some beekeepers reporting losses of nearly eighty percent   Critical to New York s apple production  there are concerns that the loss of bee colonies here in New York will not be able to be remediated in time for apple pollination  Some estimates have shown that nearly all the major beekeepers in the state of New York have lost more than 30 percent of their colonies to CCD          I believe that reports of this disorder demand a swift response to identify the causes of the problem that threatens to not only impact our bee and honey growers but our fruit growers as well   We must determine the appropriate response to restore the health of our beekeeping industry   We must act quickly to preserve and promote our beekeeping industry          I look forward to working with you to address this important issue in the Farm Bill          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton          May 11  2007      The Honorable Herb Kohl                                          Chairman                                                               Subcommittee
