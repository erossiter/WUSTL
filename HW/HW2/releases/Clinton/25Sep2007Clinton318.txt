September 25  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for Long Overdue Implementation of Country of Origin Labeling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined several of her colleagues in urging Senate leadership to take steps to help ensure the long awaited implementation of mandatory Country of Origin Labeling  COOL   In a letter  the lawmakers urged Senator Tom Harkin  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry Committee  to include companion language within the chairmans mark  which reflects the COOL compromise reached during consideration of the House passed farm bill    With the recent scares related to imported food and feed products  it is more important than ever to move ahead with plans to implement Country of Origin Labeling  said Senator Clinton  We need to protect consumers by putting information in their hands about where their produce and food is coming from  Country of Origin Labeling is also a great way for our local farmers and businesses to stand out from the crowd and promote their home grown products  Congress mandated this action five years ago with good reason  and if the USDA cant create a workable common sense rule  then Congress needs to step in    Funding for the full implementation of COOL has been delayed multiple times in recent Republican Congresses  despite its capacity to ensure greater consumer confidence and increase food safety protocol in America  The 2002 Farm Bill mandated a Country of Origin labeling effort but to date  the program has only been put in place for seafood  Consideration of the 2007 Farm Bill is set to take place in Congress soon    Senator Clinton also recently outlined her priorities for the 2007 Farm Bill and called for action to force the USDA to properly implement COOL  The Senator also called for oversight hearings to ensure that the true letter of the law is expressed in its final implementation    Following the recent food and feed product import scares  Senator Clinton urged the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to account for their apparent failures to test  track and monitor food and feed materials coming from overseas and called on them to develop and implement a national food safety strategy  In a letter to the heads of the FDA and the USDA  Senator Clinton called for a comprehensive and integrated monitoring and regulation plan to ensure the safety of the nations food supply    Senator Clinton has also joined with Senator Frank R  Lautenberg to call for creation of a multi agency food safety task force to report to Congress what changes in law and regulations are needed to ensure the safety of our food supply     The letter to Senator Harkin is attached     September 25  2007     Senator Tom Harkin  Chairman  Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  Forestry  Room SR 328A   Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510 6000   Dear Chairman Harkin    As long time supporters of mandatory Country of Origin Labeling  COOL   we write to urge you to include companion language within your chairmans mark that reflects the COOL compromise reached during consideration of the House passed farm bill    Because of USDAs inability over the past five years to create a workable and common sense rule  now is the time for congressional intervention to ensure the long awaited implementation of mandatory COOL   The consensus reached by strong COOL proponents and COOL opponents represents a reasonable compromise and finally clears the way to timely and reasonable implementation   The problems and concerns created by USDA among producers  packers and retailers are alleviated by this compromise language    Failure of the Senate to include identical language to solidify this agreement from the onset of our farm bill debate creates an unnecessary opportunity for some to generate obstacles at a time when great momentum forward has been achieved    Numerous consumer polls have consistently shown widespread support for COOL   In July 2007  Consumers Union conducted a poll that found 92 percent of respondents believed imported food products should be labeled with their country of origin   Zogby International conducted a consumer poll in August 2007 and found 95 percent believe consumers have a right to know the country of origin of the foods they purchase   These two latest polls are just further verifications of information we have known for years  consumers want to know where their food comes from and including the House farm bill language within your mark will allow a step in the right direction toward finally making that desire a reality    We appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to finally witnessing the benefits to American consumers and producers upon the long awaited and successful implementation of mandatory COOL    Sincerely
