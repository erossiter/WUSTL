July 18  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Homeland Security and Radio Interoperability Funding for New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator Welcomes  34 8 Million for New York City for Interoperable Communications but Says Feds Have Shortchanged New York Region Overall   Only  134 Million Coming to New York City Area in High Threat Funding for 2007                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today reacted with mixed sentiments about two announcements from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Commerce  Earlier today  the departments of Homeland Security and Commerce announced that they will distribute nearly  1 billion  including nearly  61 million for New York State and  34 8 million for New York City  to fix communications problems that still plague police and fire departments six years after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  In contrast  the Department of Homeland Security also announced only  134 million in Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  Grants for the New York City region  The funding for the New York City region is only a 7 7 percent increase from last years allocation of  124 million    Todays grant announcements for interoperable communications represent a down payment for our first responder communications needs  As we learned from 9 11 and from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  effective and interoperable emergency communications between firefighters  police  rescue workers and emergency call dispatchers can mean the difference between life and death and it is clear that going forward there must be a dependable stream of funding to provide the resources for the equipment  training and coordination for all of our first responders and emergency communications professionals   Moreover  it is critical that we ensure that there is effective federal coordination and leadership to assist our states and cities in overcoming the technological and logistical hurdles in achieving emergency communications interoperability  I will continue working with all the agencies involved on a local and federal level to ensure that we resolve all the interoperability issues that our first responders are facing  Senator Clinton said    While the interoperability funding is an important step for our first responders communication needs  I am disappointed that the Department of Homeland Security continues to underestimate the overall homeland security needs of the New York City region  Despite a recent intelligence report indicating that the nation faces a heightened threat of terrorism from a regenerated Al Qaeda  the Urban Area Security Initiative funding announced today shows that the Administration has again failed to take into account the threats facing the New York City region and has not learned from its past mistakes on this critical issue  The funding announced today is certainly an improvement over last year  but it does not go far enough in addressing the homeland security needs of the New York City region  especially in the current climate  Senator Clinton said    In anticipation of their decision on the UASI funds  Senator Clinton wrote to and met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  calling on the Secretary to explain the Departments reasoning behind the continual short changing of the New York City region when it comes to national homeland security funding
