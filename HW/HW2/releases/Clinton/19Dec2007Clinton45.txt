December 19  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Decision Requiring Allstate to Renew Policyholder Contracts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This is a victory for the Allstate policyholders in Westchester  Long Island and New York City who were all facing the threat of having their insurance canceled  I am glad to see that Allstate has taken my concerns  and the concerns of their customers in New York seriously by allowing them the opportunity to renew their contracts  Many cities throughout Downstate New York experienced severe flooding this year  and homeowners who played by the rules and took out disaster insurance should not be penalized or left without future coverage  While it has taken several months  I am happy to see that Allstate is stepping up to do the right thing for the policyholders of New York State  It is clear that a long term solution to the problem of the availability and cost of catastrophe insurance is necessary   I have introduced legislation to provide that long term solution  and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that we continue pursuing workable resolutions to this problem    The decision is a victory for coastal residents who were improperly dropped by Allstate in part because they did not choose to carry the company s car or life insurance policies will be given a chance to renew their contracts  The announcement came from state Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo  which follows his ruling in August that the practice of linking a customer s eligibility for homeowners insurance to his choice of carrier on other policies is illegal   In November  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Nelson introduced the Homeowners Defense Act of 2007  an innovative proposal to pool and diversify catastrophe risk to make disaster insurance for hurricanes  floods  fires and other natural disasters more available and affordable for American homeowners  Earlier this year  as policyholders were being denied  Senator Clinton reiterated her concerns to Allstates CEO  calling for a detailed explanation for the companys actions  and urging the company to resume writing homeowners insurance policies for residents in Westchester  Long Island  and New York City    Allstates action was part of their efforts begun by the company in 2006 to lower its hurricane risks along the countrys eastern coast  However  this practice has been criticized as other insurers who provide coverage in the same areas and who are exposed to the same risks  have not taken similarly drastic measures  This action by Allstate would have also left their policyholders in a bind as would have been forced search for new insurance carriers and may have faced the possibility of higher premiums
