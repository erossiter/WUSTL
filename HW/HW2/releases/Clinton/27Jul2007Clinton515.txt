              Funding for Key Projects Included in Water Resources Development Act Approved by House Senate Conferees Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that a House Senate Conference Committee has agreed on a final version of the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  which includes  18 2 million for Orchard Beach and  10 million for Hudson River Park  The bill also includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility  and authorizes a number of studies      The Water Resources Development Act  which was approved by the House Senate Conferees today  authorizes Corps of Engineers civil works projects  including navigation  ecosystem restoration and shoreline protection projects  Under the authorizations  the Corps partners with local sponsors to conduct the project  A project authorization in WRDA is a necessary first step towards securing funding in an appropriations bill at a later date  The bill now goes to the full House and Senate for final approval before heading to the President for his signature     From its bustling harbors to its sprawling beaches  New York s waterways have historically been the lifeblood of New York  said Senator Schumer  Not only are they vital to our city s commerce and transportation  they also offer New Yorkers enjoyment through exploring its beaches and ecosystems  This bill would make funding available to keep our waterways up and running while preserving their pristine beauty     Maintaining the waterways of New York are essential to the life of the city and after hundreds of years of use  they need our help  This bill will ensure that the Corps of Engineers have the resources to keep the New York harbor operating efficiently  said Senator Clinton  Providing vital funds to help with the restoration of Jamaica Bay and Orchard Beach  this bill aims to protect some of the City s most treasured areas  securing their continued preservation for future generations     The Senators announced that the bill passed by the Committee included the following authorizations    Orchard Beach  The bill modifies an existing authorization for Orchard Beach in the Bronx  New York  to increase the authorization to  18 2 million  Orchard Beach is visited by more than two million people each year  but the beach is suffering from severe erosion and the sand needs to be replenished  The purpose of this project is to restore and stabilize this heavily utilized public recreational beach The Water Resources Development Acts of 1992 and 1996 authorized a total of  5 6 million for the study and execution of an Orchard Beach shoreline protection project  The current WRDA would increase that authorization to  18 2 million     New York Harbor Dredged Material Management Facility  The bill includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility  The disposal of sediments dredged from New York Harbor has become increasingly more costly over the past decade due to the Environmental Protection Agency s promulgation of more stringent rules governing the disposal of these materials at sea  This has led to efforts in both New York and New Jersey to find beneficial uses for dredged materials  Most of these efforts to date have focused on using dredged materials that have been processed with additives such as Portland Cement or incinerator ash to create a stable  construction material that have been successfully used as a grading material at landfills and brownfields  Development of the facility will enable more flexibility in matching the timing of the availability of dredge material with the needs of end users  which will encourage competition and reduce the costs of upland dredge material disposal  The facility would accept dredged material from both federal channels and private berthing facilities    Hudson River Park  The bill includes a  10 million authorization to allow the Army Corps to participate with the State of New York  New York City  and the Hudson River Park Trust in carrying out activities to restore critical marine habitat  improve safety  and protect and rehabilitate critical infrastructure    Studies  The bill also authorizes a feasibility study of ecosystem restoration improvements on Newtown Creek  Brooklyn and Queens  New York  and a feasibility study of shoreline protection at the confluence of the Narrows and Gravesend Bay  Upper New York Bay  Shore Parkway Greenway  Brooklyn  NY
