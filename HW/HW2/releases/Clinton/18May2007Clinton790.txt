 Chairman  Federal Reserve Board  20th Street and Constitution Avenues  N  W   Washington  D C  20551      Dear Chairman Bernanke       Earlier this year  I wrote to you and other members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council  FFIEC  regarding stricter regulations for subprime mortgage lending    In that letter I encouraged you and the other members of the FFIEC to take steps to make certain that Federal lending standards protect borrowers in order to ensure that lower and moderate income families continue to have access to home ownership opportunities through responsible mortgages products           In light of your recent comments that you do not expect a significant disruption to other sectors of our economy stemming from the problems in the subprime housing market  I urge you to remain vigilant in ensuring that swift action is taken to curb the abusive  deceptive and irresponsible lending practices that culminated in the current troubles we are seeing in this housing sector           Indeed  your optimistic forecast about the effect of the current housing market struggles should be encouraging   Nevertheless  it remains clear that reasonable measures that will restore stability to the entire housing market and strengthen the American people s confidence in what is oftentimes their most significant investment are still necessary           I have already proposed several steps to address the current crisis   For example  I have called for face to face financial counseling to be made available to more borrowers before they take out mortgages  and to homeowners at risk of foreclosure   Second  I proposed limiting the length of time for which prepayment penalties apply  and prohibiting prepayment penalties on mortgages with rates above a certain level            Third  I proposed strengthening the Truth in Lending Act and existing federal regulations to ensure that there is plain talk  no fine print disclosure   Too often lenders and mortgage originators are not upfront about the actual costs of a mortgage   I have also reintroduced the 21st Century Housing Act to strengthen the Federal Housing Administration s  FHA  mortgage insurance program   FHA loans should be available to more Americans  especially those who are drawn to the subprime market  as they are responsible and stable alternative           Finally  with nearly 2 million subprime adjustable rate mortgages due to reset in the next two years  I believe it is necessary to create incentives for lenders to identify worthy borrowers with troubled mortgages and to work out solutions with them to avoid foreclosure   Your perspective on what steps can be taken now to prevent a rising tide of foreclosures would be invaluable as policymakers discuss these issues going forward           Thank you for your attention to these concerns          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
