                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Calls on President Bush to Provide Sufficient Funding to Protect New York  s Ports     Commits to Working with the Port Authority on Next Steps for Stewart Airport Lease Takeover                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today met with Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Chairman Anthony R  Coscia and Executive Director Anthony Shorris to discuss a number of issues of importance to New York          Following the meeting  Senator Clinton sent a letter to the President  calling on him to include enough funding in his upcoming Fiscal Year 2008 Budget to secure New York and the nation  s ports  Last year  Senator Clinton supported an increase of  1 billion in the budget for port security funding  The Senator also recommended that the President heed the recommendations of the Port Security Task Force established by the Port Authority in order to increase port security            The Security and Accountability for Every Port Act that Congress passed last year included a number of important security programs which are designed to better protect our ports  But funding these programs costs money and we are now looking to the President to provide the funding that will allow these programs to be effective     Senator Clinton said    With insufficient screening of the cargo coming through and so much commerce dependent on safe and secure ports  we must have the resources in place to improve our port security             The Senator also said following the meeting that she would work with the Port Authority to help in any way she could to facilitate their anticipated takeover of the lease of Stewart Airport            I was very pleased when the Port Authority announced that it would be taking over the lease of Stewart Airport  I told the Port Authority executives that I hoped there would be a high speed rail link component to their ongoing plans and that their takeover of the lease would help ease congestion in the airspace over New York  I believe Stewart really has the potential to take pressure off our existing airports and bring more business to the Hudson Valley  so I will do what I can and work with the Port Authority to ensure that this next phase is a successful one     Senator Clinton said            A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter to the President is below          The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President        This afternoon I met with Board Chairman Anthony R  Coscia of the Port Authority of New York   New Jersey   During our conversation  we discussed the ongoing challenge of securing our ports from terrorist attack and the efforts that have been undertaken toward that end   It is clear that while strides have been made toward this goal  there remains much more to be done          As you know  the United States has more than 1 000 harbor channels and 25 000 miles of inland  intra coastal  and coastal waterways that serve over 360 ports   This means that located at these ports are over 3 700 terminals that are used to process passengers and cargo   Estimates indicate that marine transportation moves more than 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight  imports 3 3 billion tons of oil  and services 134 million passengers by ferry with more than 6 million cruise ship passengers moving in and out as well   Nearly 12  of the overall volume of cargo coming into the United States is handled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey   The cargo in our port is valued at over  132 billion and serves approximately 80 million individuals according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey            While last year  s enactment of the Security and Accountability for Every  SAFE  Port Act was an important step in the process of safeguarding our ports of entry more must be done   The legislation codified several security programs that will certainly assist those charged with the responsibility of protecting our ports   However  the legislation does not in and of itself complete the difficult job at hand   Even if appropriations were made to the full authorized level of  400 million  this is still far short of the resources needed to accomplish this important work   Last year  the Senate supported an increase of  1 billion in the budget for port security funding   I urge you and the Department of Homeland Security to realize Congressional support of an increase in port security funding and provide such levels in your Fiscal Year 2008 budget          Additionally  I recommend to you a report conducted by the Port Security Task Force established by Chairman Coscia which outlines some important recommendations in the area of port security   The Task Force makes several recommendations including  increasing minimum mandatory cargo security standards and new technology investments to increase our 5  cargo inspection rate to 100  without shutting down commerce  the need for a National Port and Cargo Security Director  development of emergency response and recovery plans since the cargo industry is complex and requires massive coordination among federal  state  and local entities  implementation of risk management plans  and improvements to security at our ports including the development of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential  TWIC  Program   These are just some of the critical issues that the Task Force addressed  and I encourage you to give their recommendations serious consideration          We must be absolutely vigilant in protecting the security of our ports and that means dedicating the resources necessary to get the job done   We must target these funds toward existing vulnerabilities and underscore that the status quo is unacceptable   For too long the Administration has shortchanged port security   I encourage you to correct this misstep by dedicating the resources needed to securing our ports          Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
