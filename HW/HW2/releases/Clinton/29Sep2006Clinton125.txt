September 29  2006 Senator Clinton  Congress Set to Approve Legislation to Address Payroll and Billing Problems for Wounded Soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Clinton Amendment Included in FY 07 Department of Defense Authorization Conference Report   Prompted by Reports of Wounded Soldiers Being Charged for Medical Treatment and Being Wrongly Charged for Services  Clinton Amendment Would Require Army Audit of Existing Problems   Senate and House Expected to Approve Final Bill which will then go to President for Signature            Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the FY 2007 Department of Defense Authorization Conference Report filed today includes an amendment that she authored to address the financial problems experienced by our wounded troops          In a continuing effort to ensure that those who have given so much are not further burdened with resolving pay account issues  Senator Clinton  s amendment requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers   pay accounts and report back to Congress in 120 days            Senator Clinton  s bill was prompted by continuing reports of soldiers who have been withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues and have subsequently experienced payroll problems or have been wrongly charged for certain services or equipment   Both the Senate and House of Representatives are expected to approve the Conference Report before Congress adjourns this week  after which it will head to the President for his signature            Ever since I first heard reports of sick and wounded soldiers returning from combat and being wrongly charged for certain services and equipment  I have tried to get to the bottom of the problem so we can make sure it never happens again  It is simply unacceptable that we should be billing our soldiers for debts wrongly incurred or exacerbated by bureaucratic pay and personnel systems     Senator Clinton said            Specifically  Senator Clinton  s amendment would require  in a manner that protects the privacy of servicemembers  the audit of the pay accounts of wounded soldiers and mandates that the Department of the Army then report            any underpayments of pay  allowances or other monetary benefit to which the wounded servicemember was entitled           any disbursements made to correct underpayments           any debts to the United States collected or pending collection from wounded servicemembers           any reimbursements or debt relief to a servicemember for such debts  and          any referral of servicemembers to a collection or credit agency            We must do everything in our power to avoid placing wounded soldiers in the position of having to resolve payroll problems or to request debt forgiveness  These warriors are recovering from the injuries they sustained while they were fighting for our country and they should not have to deal with this kind of additional burden  This amendment will go a long way to ensuring that the Army is held accountable for these situations and hopefully we can ensure that these situations never arise again     Senator Clinton said          As recently as April 26  2006  a Government Accountability Office report found that nearly 1 300 battle injured soldiers and soldiers killed in combat in the first 4 years of the Global War on Terror had incurred a total of  1 5 million in debt   Press reports have also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness   totaling more than  600 000   on the basis that the debt was wrongly charged           This is just the latest in a series of actions taken by Senator Clinton on this significant issue as the treatment of wounded soldiers remains one of her top priorities   In the past  she has called on Congress to hold hearings  written to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army to investigate specific cases  and called for reviews of broader problems with the pay process  particularly as it applies to those wounded in a combat zone
