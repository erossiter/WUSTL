December 22  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Path Tunnel Vulnerability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Today  s reports about known vulnerabilities within the PATH tunnel system echoes what many of us have been warning about for years  more security is needed to protect our critical transportation infrastructure   It is my hope that Congress will pass significant transportation security legislation next year   I have supported a significant investment in the six Amtrak tunnels as well as other tunnels and infrastructure that are not yet fully secure   I intend to continue that fight into next year by pushing for the enactment of the Transportation Security Improvement Act  a bill that I co sponsored to authorize several hundred million dollars for necessary security upgrades   We must make smart investments in our transit systems where we know terrorists intend to do us harm
