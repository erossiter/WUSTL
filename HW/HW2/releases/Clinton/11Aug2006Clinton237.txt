                      Program will coordinate forage resources across the state to provide needed feed and forage to flood affected farmers in New York State      Program includes website of locally available forage resources and the NYFB Foundation  s Feed and Forage Transportation Fund                                                                                                                                    New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Cornell Cooperative Extension and the New York Farm Bureau Foundation for Agricultural Education  Inc  in launching an Emergency Forage Exchange and a Feed and Forage Transportation Fund to provide feed and cash assistance for farmers in New York State who have been severely impacted by the recent flooding          As part of the Emergency Forage Exchange  Senator Clinton s office worked in coordination with Cornell Cooperative Extension and the New York Farm Bureau Foundation for Agricultural Education  Inc   the   Foundation     to establish an Emergency Response Forage Exchange  http   emergencyresponse cce cornell edu   which includes an online database of forage resources available to farmers in New York State areas affected by the recent flooding   The Cornell Emergency Forage website will be maintained and updated by Cornell Cooperative Extension personnel and will help match regional forage availability with forage needs   It is not intended for merchandising and it is not intended for direct producer access or input   The website will be active through December 2006 at which point continuation will be reconsidered based on need   Farmers who wish to donate or sell forage and farmers who are in need of forage should call their local county Cornell Cooperative Extension office   Visit the Cornell Cooperative Extension website  http   www cce cornell edu in_your_community php  or call the state Cornell Cooperative Extension Administration Office at 607 255 2237 to find the Cornell Cooperative Extension office in your county            In addition to promoting the website  the Foundation has also created the Feed and Forage Transportation Fund to collect tax deductible donations to assist farmers who have lost feed and forage necessary to feed their livestock  Fund monies will be used to assist in underwriting the transportation costs of replacement feed and forage for eligible farmers   Farmers in need of assistance and those wishing to contribute to the fund should call the Foundation Office at  800  342 4143  Applications for assistance will be available on the Foundation website  www nyfbfoundation org   the New York Farm Bureau website  www nyfb org   or can be obtained from the Foundation Office  The deadline for applications is September 30  2006           In emergency situations such as the flooding that occurred in June  the Cornell Cooperative Extension system provides an important link that enables us to deliver resources of the land grant university to the people of New York   We are pleased to be working in collaboration with Senator Clinton s office and the New York Farm Bureau Foundation for Agricultural Education in this Emergency Response Forage Exchange effort   said Dr  Helene R  Dillard  Director of Cornell Cooperative Extension          Judi Whittaker  Chair of the Foundation Board said    As our farm is located in the flood region  I have seen the damage and devastation of the floods firsthand from day one   The cooperative efforts to provide help to those farmers who lost crops that would feed their herds are heartening to me   I applaud those who have provided donations thus far  and encourage others to provide what help they can to the Feed and Forage Transportation Fund               We are in a dire situation  with many of our farmers in the flood region losing a significant portion of their hay and corn for the year     said John Lincoln  president of New York Farm Bureau  board member of the Foundation  and a dairy farmer from Bloomfield  N Y     We are grateful to Senator Clinton and Cornell Cooperative Extension for recognizing the critical circumstances our farmers are facing   With the high costs of transportation  we expect that our Foundation  s  Feed and Forage Transportation Fund will be utilized to help offset the costs of trucking feed to the farmers who are most in need              Many farmers have suffered devastating losses from the recent flooding and this program will help them obtain critical resources to make it through the rest of this growing season   We need to continue to work together to help those that have suffered to get back on their feet   In New York State we are so fortunate to have such a strong agricultural community  the leadership of Cornell and the Farm Bureau  and the incredible willingness of farmers to help other farmers in this time of need   Senator Clinton said           Farms in Central and Eastern New York are continuing to experience the negative effects of a devastating growing season   In some areas  excessive spring rains delayed or prevented planting   Record setting heavy rains at the end of June and the severe flooding that followed resulted in severe crop losses  farmland damage and property damage to farmers in Central New York  the Mohawk Valley  the Western Catskills and the Southern Tier   Most recent estimates from the Farm Service Agency include severe crop losses in 20 counties on more than 290 000 acres at a value of over  40 2 million dollars            While all crop producers have suffered devastating losses  livestock and dairy farmers were especially hard hit  as corn and hay  which are critical for providing animal feed  accounted for over 90 percent of crop losses   Many farms have lost not only their planted crops  but stored and standing crops used for current feed supply as well   There is little doubt that many producers will face a major shortage of forages to feed their herds over the coming months   These farms face seemingly insurmountable challenges unless there is response and support from others          Farmers in the counties that have received disaster declarations by the Secretary of Agriculture   Broome  Chenango  Cortland  Delaware  Fulton  Greene  Hamilton  Herkimer  Madison  Montgomery  Oneida  Orange  Otsego  Rensselaer  Schenectady  Schoharie  Sullivan  Tioga  Tompkins  and Ulster   will be eligible to receive forage and or cash assistance   Farmers from any county can donate or offer to provide forage resources or cash donations through this program   Both donating and recipient farmers should contact their local Cornell Cooperative Extension Office or the Foundation for more information about the program            In addition to helping establish the Emergency Forage Exchange  last month Senator Clinton called on the USDA to provide for disaster assistance for flood affected farmers   Senator Clinton urged USDA to make adequate funding available for existing programs that are critical for helping farmers and communities recover from disaster events  such as the Emergency Watershed Protection Program  the Emergency Conservation Program and the Crop Disaster Program   She also called for consideration of a crop indemnity program similar to the one provided for farmers who suffered losses during Hurricane Katrina
