September 29  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate  s Failure to Pass Major Emergency Agricultural Disaster Assistance for New York Farmers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    I am extremely disappointed that the U S  Senate failed today to pass The Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2006  comprehensive emergency agricultural disaster assistance legislation  which would have provided critical relief for New York State farmers that have been affected by flooding  frost and other natural disasters in 2005 and 2006   New York farmers have suffered millions of dollars of losses over the past few years due to the extremes of Mother Nature   This bipartisan package would have provided the badly needed resources to help farmers and rural communities rebuild  recover  and stay viable   We cannot afford to wait to act  our farmers need our help now   I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to get this done before the end of the year              Senator Clinton is an original cosponsor of The Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2006  a bipartisan agricultural disaster assistance package that was recently introduced by Senators Conrad and Nelson   The sponsors of the bill attempted today to have the bill passed by Unanimous Consent  but political maneuvering prevented the bill from even coming to a vote            The Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2006 includes assistance funding for programs that would help New York State farmers recover from recent frost and flooding events  and would allocate funding for programs that provide production loss assistance to farmers for insured and uninsurable crops  Specifically  the bill establishes a Livestock Compensation Program  which helps cover increased feed expenses for livestock producers and provides livestock indemnity payments for livestock losses  and provides  70 million for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program and an additional  30 million funding for the Emergency Conservation Program  A coalition of more than 30 farm and allied organizations including the American Farm Bureau Federation  the National Farmers Union  and the Farm Credit Council and others have all expressed their support for the package           From June flooding events alone  the New York Farm Service Agency estimates that 28 250 acres of crops were damaged or lost at a value that exceeds  40 million dollars  in addition to  30 million in watershed damage   In response to the flooding  the USDA announced that 21 New York counties have been designated as primary natural disaster counties  and 20 counties as contiguous disaster areas           Senator Clinton will continue to work with her Senate colleagues to get this legislation passed before the end of the year
