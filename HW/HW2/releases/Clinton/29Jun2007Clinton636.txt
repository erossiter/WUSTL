   Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies FY08 Appropriations Bill which includes  200 000 for Rochester Institute of Technology and  500 000 for the Monroe County Department of Public Safety Regional Crime Lab   The Appropriations Committee also approved the Energy and Water Development FY08 Appropriations Bill which includes  400 000 for the University of Rochester for biosensor and fuel cell research and  10 000 for the Rochester Harbor   The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process   Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this years spending bill    This is great news for Rochester  said Schumer   Federal money will be used to fund crucial programs that keep Rochester residents safe and encourage innovative research   The funding for the Monroe County Regional Crime Lab will be used to improve the tools used to fight and catch criminals by reducing the current DNA backlog    This funding will also support the research programs at U of R and RIT whose invaluable research keeps them at the forefront of the scientific community    This is great news for the Greater Rochester Region  These funds for RITs Sensing Systems Testbed will further boost their development of sensory systems in the event of a disaster or attack  I am very pleased that the funds for Rochester Harbor will allow the Army Corps to move forward with its plans to bring Ontario Beach back to life for locals and visitors alike  The funds for the University of Rochester will be a boost to their already cutting edge fuel cell research and development efforts  Senator Clinton said  I am especially pleased that we could secure approval for the funds for the Monroe County Crime Lab  We have to help Monroe County reduce its DNA backlog and these funds will go a long way to helping upgrade the facilities and streamline the process  Local and county police need the DNA log to be kept current so I am glad the Appropriations Committee was able to see the virtue of expanding this crucial facility    The Rochester Institute of Technologys Integrated Sensing Systems Testbed  ISST  will receive  200 000 in federal dollars to help establish a new Integrated Sensing Systems Testbed to develop  demonstrate  and validate advanced techniques that will help emergency personnel respond to large scale incidents such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks  This initiative features the ability to rapidly configure and deploy integrated sensing and decision support systems to help first responders react effectively to such large scale events    The Monroe County Regional Crime Lab will use  500 000 for the new state of the art Crime Lab that will eliminate the backlog in cases of evidence analysis to support the criminal justice system  The Crime Lab will have additional equipment and qualified staff to more effectively process DNA evidence and support the criminal justice process through the national Combined DNA Indexing System  CODIS    Funds will assist Monroe County to meet the objectives of the Debbie Smith Act and reduce all DNA Analysis backlog and remain current   Monroe County currently services all criminal justice agencies  federal  state and local  agencies throughout Monroe and eight surrounding counties of Genesee  Livingston  Ontario  Seneca  Wayne  Wyoming  Yates  and Orleans      The University of Rochester will use  400 000 in federal funds for the Laboratory for Laser Energetics Research in Inertial Fusion for biosensor and fuel cell research    Inertial confinement fusion  ICF  programs and high energy density physics programs  HEDP  are key elements in the Department of Energy  DOE  National Ignition Program  NIC  and Stockpile Stewardship Program  SSP  to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons  PL 103 360   The OMEGA laser facility at the University of Rochesters Laboratory for Laser Energetics  LLE  is the critical laser research facility for the University and the three National weapons laboratories  Los Alamos  Sandia  and Livermore  for ICF and HEDP experiments at this time  LLE is the only facility that also trains graduate students in inertial fusion  The OMEGA facility includes a high power ultraviolet fusion laser and  with the completion of OMEGA EP  Extended Performance   a high intensity high energy short pulse laser that can be operated jointly or independently for NIC and SSP activities for the DOE    The Rochester Harbor will get  10 000 in federal funds for public visitation tracking to monitor and track the number of recreational visitors to the west pier    Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee  it will be sent to the Senate floor  Following approval by the Senate  the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature
