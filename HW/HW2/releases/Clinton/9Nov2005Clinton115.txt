November 9  2005 Sweeney  Clinton  McHugh Support Two Week Derived Fuel Test                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   In a bi partisan show of support  Rep  John Sweeney  Clifton Park   Senator Hillary Clinton and Rep  John M  McHugh  Pierrepont Manor  issued the following statements urging the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC  to approve International Paper s  IP  pending application to conduct a two week trial of Tire Derived Fuel  TDF  in the mill s power boiler             I m pleased to join my colleagues in support of International Paper and I urge DEC to approve this short term test to properly establish the necessary data to determine if the proper balance can be achieved between an important local economic engine and our environment   Sweeney said    It s critical that we explore all reasonable cost saving options to ensure the mill stays competitive and continues to thrive in Ticonderoga            I support IP s proposal to conduct a limited  well monitored test  Given sky high oil prices  it is important to explore cost effective fuel alternatives for the mill  At the same time  community concerns about the environmental impacts of this process deserve to be addressed  The proposed test can achieve both of these objectives   Senator Clinton said            For 80 years  Ticonderoga s IP mill has been a staple in the community  and it is critical that we explore any and all options that would ensure it remains a viable operation   McHugh said    This is simply a two week trial that will establish whether this process would  in fact  be an environmentally friendly method of cost savings  and it is imperative that DEC approve this fuel test           The Ticonderoga IP mill employs more than 700 workers  making it one of the North Country s largest employers  and one of the most important factors in the upstate economy  This test burn is vital to determine whether this is a viable cost saving option to ensure the mill continues to thrive in Ticonderoga
