December 13  2007 Clinton and Harkin Introduce Bill to Require Release of Poor Performing Nursing Homes List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  Today  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Tom Harkin  D IA  introduced the Nursing Home Quality and Transparency Act to require the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  to disclose the names of all nursing homes that receive the special focus facilities designation for poor performance   As of October 2007  there were 128 special focus facilities identified by CMS   These nursing homes were identified because they are among the poorest five to 10 percent in each state   Despite the value of disclosing this information to families  CMS released the names of only 52 of the 128 poor performing nursing homes    While I am pleased that CMS has undertaken this initiative to help improve quality in nursing homes  our seniors need full and accurate information   Choosing a nursing home or long term care facility is one of the most important decisions seniors and their families make  and they deserve to know everything that CMS knows   The Nursing Home Quality and Transparency Act will ensure families have the information they need and deserve  said Senator Clinton      As new generations of Iowans deal with the emotional challenges of finding a safe place to care for their elderly parents  they deserve complete information about the quality of their area care centers  said Harkin  It is unacceptable for any agency to withhold this information and our consumer protection measure will help Americans make proper choices    Designation as a special focus facility by CMS results in twice as many inspections and monthly documentation of all complaints for nursing homes on the list   CMS data indicate that about 50 percent of the nursing homes identified as special focus facilities improve their quality within 24 30 months  while about 16 percent are terminated from Medicare and Medicaid    Currently approximately 10 million Americans have long term care needs  Conservative estimates indicate that the number of those needing care will double by 2050   Nearly three million Americans depend on approximately 16 000 nursing homes nationwide at some point during each year to provide them with care that is critical to their health and well being
