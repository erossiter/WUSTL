October 6  2005 Senator Clinton Secures Commitment From Secretary of the Air Force Nominee to Visit Rome Labs and Support Providing Resources for Retraining of 107th at Niagara Falls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today secured a commitment from the Nominee for Secretary of the Air Force  Michael Wynne  to visit the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome  NY and provide full support for the BRAC Commission  s recommendations regarding the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Base   Mr  Wynne pledged that the 107th Aerial Refueling Wing Guard members will receive training to support the C 130 airlift mission as part of Air Force Reserve Air National Guard Associate Wing  Wynne is currently Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition  Technology and Logistics   Senator Clinton  who met with Acting Under Secretary Wynne privately yesterday  questioned him at his nomination hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee today            A transcript of Senator Clinton  s conversation with Michael Wynne is attached          Senate Committee on Armed Services  Nomination Hearing for Honorable Michael W  Wynne to be Secretary of the Air Force and Dr  Donald C  Winter to be Secretary of the Navy       Senator Clinton      I want to thank you  Mr  Wynne  for visiting with me and going over a number of issues I was concerned about  And as we discussed yesterday  the Air Force laboratory in Rome  NY is a world leader in development in revolutionary cyber technologies  I think cyber security will be one of the most important issues we face in the years to come  I think you pick up a newspaper  just hackers can get in and shut down cell phone networks  How we  re going to have inter operable communications and how we  re going to have those communications between first responders and war fighters is one of the biggest challenges we confront           And I  d like to renew my invitation  as I did to your predecessor  to come up to the Air Force lab and  Dr  Winter  we  d love to have to have you as well  to review the work that is being done           Mr  Wynne do you have any ideas at this point as to the investments the Air Force should be making in science   technology to develop new cyber security capabilities and the coordination that will need to occur between homeland security and national defense as we pursue that cyber security agenda           Mr  Wynne  Senator  I will tell you it is one of my major concerns as we become more and more of a net center cooperation that we put an emphasis on cyber security because perhaps it is a point of vulnerability  I haven  t looked into it to ascertain that  in fact one of the things I intend if confirmed is to go up to Rome  NY  where I understand there are some great people up there who are very concerned about this and invite them to alert me to how can we make it better           As to the responsiveness between the first responder and the military  perhaps Air National Guard  I think there  s an issue that we need to come by  that is somehow we have to make sure that as we arrive at the cusp of a disaster or arrive at a partnership of even of a test  we need to make sure we can communicate with each other  I think it was vital to the final resurgence after Rita  and after Katrina that the first responders could talk to the military providers as to where to go  where to drop food  where to drop a thing  rather than just showing up and starting to ask questions           Senator Clinton  Well I look forward to hosting you at Rome Labs and I think you will be both impressed and provoked to look into this further           I understand that others before me have discussed some of the problems that we  re expressed by members of the BRAC commission as well as members of Congress about the treatment of the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserves by the Defense Department in their BRAC Commission recommendations  And I think the changes that were made by the BRAC Commission reflect some very serious analysis about how better to balance our Air Guard  Reserve and Active Duty air assets  And I know there is a limitation on what you can address at this point not having either been confirmed and knowing there is ongoing litigation in some of the states           But in particular  one of the recommendations that was made by the BRAC commission was specifically directed at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve station which survived the recommendation of closure because of the extraordinary service that the 914th Air Lift Wing and the 107th Aerial Refueling Wing have provided and in particular provided with respect to our actions in Iraq            I recently invited Gen  Moseley to visit Niagara Falls and I  d like to extend that same invitation to you as well  in fact when the BRAC commissioners visited Niagara Falls  I think they publicly said    as well in private conversations    made clear that actually seeing the strategic location of Niagara Falls was instrumental in their determination that it should remain open and reverse the closure recommendation            The commission recommended the establishment of a continuous enclave for the 107th sufficient to support operation of that unit  including flight operations  And that Guard personnel will be provided the training necessary to support the Air Lift mission  If confirmed  Mr  Wynne  will you support the BRAC commission recommendations and ensure that adequate resources are provided to create an Air National Guard  Air Force Reserve wing with the 914th Airlift wing and that the training necessary will be provided to guard personnel           Mr  Wynne  I know that the DOD recommendations were in fact carefully considered by the commission  the commission ruled  and the president certified  and approved that and it sits here with congress and it is my intention to implement the BRAC commission recommendations as they are written  And I hope to extract the  if you will  maximum mission efficiency from the Air National Guard  We have a whole force    that I think encompasses the active  the reserve  and the guard and they will be a part of us for a very long time and we look forward to their bravery and their service
