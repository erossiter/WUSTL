October 9  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Reports of a Nuclear Test by North Korea                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is extremely serious  the fact that North Korea apparently detonated a nuclear device  obviously the precursor to a nuclear weapon is a terribly dangerous precedent that has to be met with the strongest possible action from the entire international community   There will be an effort in the United Nations today to bring the world together against this rogue nation with its unaccountable dictator who has been seeking to destabilize           Some of the reasons we are facing this dangerous situation is because of the failed policies of the Bush Administration   I regret deeply their failure to deal with the threat posed by North Korea   And I hope that the Administration will now adopt a much more effective response than what they have up until now          Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Columbus Day Parade  Monday Oct 9  2006  New York City
