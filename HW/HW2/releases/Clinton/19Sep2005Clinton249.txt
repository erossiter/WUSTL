September 19  2005 Senator Clinton Underscores Need to Keep Open Manhattan and Brooklyn VA Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New York  NY    Echoing her long standing opposition to closing either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA hospitals  Senator Clinton today stressed the need to keep open both facilities in testimony to the Local Advisory Panel of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  project   Senator Clinton in her testimony emphasized that each hospital plays a unique role in their respective communities and the closure of either facility would change dramatically the way medical care is delivered to veterans in the New York City metropolitan area             At this time in our nation  s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation     Senator Clinton underscored in her testimony     Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care             Senator Clinton made clear that any proposed plan to consolidate delivery of VA healthcare services must take into account the unique relationship between the New York University School of Medicine and the Manhattan VA hospital  The partnership between the institutions has made the Manhattan VA hospital a model of high quality care  with six tertiary care specialties designated by the VA as centers of excellence  Closure of the Manhattan VA would imperil this relationship at the expense of New York s veterans           Likewise  Senator Clinton noted the Brooklyn VA has multiple bed services and provides specialized cancer care   Describing the affiliation it maintains with the SUNY Downstate Medical School  Senator Clinton emphasized that  just as the relationship between the Manhattan VA and the New York University School of Medicine would be imperiled by closure of the Manhattan VA  closure of the Brooklyn VA would threaten the existing SUNY relationship with the VA to the detriment of New York  s veterans          Senator Clinton also reinforced that the CARES process must take into account the practical matter of transportation in its deliberations  The high quality services at the Manhattan VA hospital attract veterans from the City of New York as well as surrounding areas and other states  One of the main reasons that the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located in the heart of Manhattan at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere in the world  Similarly  Senator Clinton noted that a number of SUNY Downstate department chairs have pointed out that the Brooklyn VA is accessible to motor vehicles by virtue of its proximity in Brooklyn to the Belt Parkway and the Verrazano Bridge          In addition  Senator Clinton underscored the critical importance of ensuring that VA s planning process for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals is fully transparent  New York s veterans must be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process           Senator Clinton has fought for New York s veterans throughout the CARES process  Senator Clinton met with VA Secretary Nicholson in April to reiterate her serious concerns regarding the VA CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study yet more changes in New York s VA facilities  Secretary Nicholson agreed to consider the points she raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VAs           Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York s veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care and to keep New York VA hospitals open                     Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Before the Local Advisory Panel of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project        As Prepared for Delivery         September 19  2005      Good afternoon  distinguished members of the Panel  Let me thank you for allowing me to present testimony on the impact that consolidating the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA campuses would have on the veterans of New York and the people who serve their needs at these institutions   As I will explain more fully below  I strongly oppose closing either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA hospitals   Closure would have disastrous consequences for many New York veterans   Closure of either facility would diminish health care quality for veterans who rely on these facilities          At this time in our nation  s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation  Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care          As a starting point  our bottom line goal should be the delivery of high quality health care services to our veterans  delivered as efficiently as possible  Veterans   health care is too important an issue to require an adherence to artificial deadlines and hasty recommendations   With literally the lives of veterans at stake  the panel should not engage in a rush to judgment over closing VA facilities and should not elevate financial considerations over the needs of our veterans          On April 19th  I met with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson and handed him a letter in which I reiterated my serious concerns regarding the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study further changes in New York  s VA facilities   He agreed to consider each of the points I raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s          I must underline at the outset how absolutely essential it is that the VA s planning process for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process  It is the veterans who must remain at the center of this process          As PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  and your Panel proceed with their work  please keep in mind that legislation was included as part of the Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004 requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify Congress before implementing a major mission change at the Manhattan VA and other facilities  The notice to Congress must include an assessment of the effect of the mission change on the population of veterans served by the facility  a description of the availability and quality of health care  including long term care  mental health care  and substance abuse programs  available in the area served by the facility  an assessment of the effect of the mission change on the economy of the community in which the facility is located  and an analysis of any alternatives to the mission change proposed by the community in which the facility is located  by specified other groups  or by the Department of Veterans Affairs          There have been several stages to the CARES process  which in my view has been a rushed process that did not adequately heed the voices of New York  s veterans   The CARES Draft National Plan originally recommended developing   a plan to consider the feasibility of consolidating inpatient care at Brooklyn      The VA  s CARES Commission found that a feasibility study should precede any proposal to consolidate the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses          Former VA Secretary Anthony Principi  s CARES Decision Document  Decision Document  issued in May 2004  directed VA to   undertake a thorough feasibility study of the potential to consolidate the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses                   The Decision Document also states that   the facilities are in close proximity to one another and both have significant vacant and underused space  Through consolidation  VA has the potential to improve use of sophisticated major medical equipment  reduce costly vacant and underused space  and enhance services through development of a comprehensive tertiary medical center that can act as a hub and provide the full continuum of care for Manhattan and Brooklyn area veterans             On May 3  2005 this Local Advisory Panel held a public meeting in Brooklyn   I presented my strong stand against closure of either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA  s          PwC has now presented 9 options related to the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals  including  the   Baseline    option    without any changes to facilities or programs     consolidation at Brooklyn  consolidation at Manhattan  incremental changes at both facilities  and even the closure of both facilities in favor of a facility elsewhere          The closure of either the Manhattan VA or the Brooklyn VA would be ill conceived   Each plays a unique role in their respective communities   The closure of either would result in a dramatic change in the way that medical care is dispensed to veterans in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond   Such a break with current practice would eliminate the possibility of more gradual changes that would consolidate specialty care to meet a changing veterans   population  while refining the specialties of each hospital          Any feasibility study must recognize that the closure of the Manhattan VA will seriously impact the relationship between the New York University School of Medicine  NYUSM  and the Manhattan VA   The Manhattan VA contains six tertiary care specialties that the VA has designated as centers of excellence   These specialties are in Cardiac Surgery  Neurosurgery  Cardiac Vascular Surgery  Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services  HIV AIDS Care  and Dialysis   According to NYUSM  these are the only VA Centers of Excellence in these specialties within 100 miles of the Manhattan VA   The Manhattan facility also houses a designated clinical care unit and research center for AIDS and HIV infection   The Manhattan VA is the VISN 3 referral center for Cardiac Surgery  Neurosurgery  and Interventional Cardiology          The NYUSM  together with its affiliates  the Manhattan VA  Bellevue Hospital  Tisch Hospital  and the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine  supports an Amputee Center and Rehabilitation Medicine Service   The VISN Footwear Center is also found at the Manhattan VA   The Prosthetic and Orthotic Laboratory has a unique role in the area in producing artificial limbs          There is also a substantial Research and Development Service   NYUSM estimates that NYUSM and the Manhattan VA are engaged in approximately  10 million in joint research  with a substantial amount of the funding provided by the National Institutes of Health   However  according to the NYUSM  these endeavors are in jeopardy if the Manhattan campus is closed          The special relationship between the NYUSM and the Manhattan VA has many unique features   That should come as no surprise given the fact that the relationship between NYUSM and the Manhattan VA stretches back almost fifty years   That relationship between NYUSM and the Manhattan VA has made possible much of the excellent health care available at the Manhattan VA          The NYU Manhattan VA relationship  and the high quality of care for veterans it produces  would be imperiled by the closure of the Manhattan VA   Closure of the Manhattan VA could damage the relationship between NYUSM and the New York Harbor Health Care System and cause a reduction in the quality of veterans   health care in the New York metropolitan area   The NYUSM residency program is fully integrated with the Manhattan VA  NYUSM reports that there are typically 125 NYUSM residents at the Manhattan VA            In addition  the New York University College of Dentistry  NYU College of Dentistry    provided over 13 000 visits last year at the Manhattan VA    and thousands at the Brooklyn VA as well          Closure of the Manhattan VA could result in a weakening or termination of the affiliation of the NYUSM residency program with the VA  It is possible that NYUSM will need to establish a partnership with a new entity or reduce the residency program in order to absorb it into their existing facilities          The closure of the Manhattan VA would also likely result in the departure of physicians affiliated with NYU Medical Center from the VA  s New York Harbor Health Care System   As noted previously  the Manhattan VA is the VISN 3 referral center for Cardiac Surgery  Neurosurgery  and Interventional Cardiology   According to NYUSM  the cardiac surgery program at the Manhattan VA   was evaluated by the VA as having the best outcomes in their national system     It is an open question at best whether NYUSM physicians would choose whether to follow the specialty services elsewhere or leave the VA healthcare system altogether          Further  the Manhattan VA can serve to provide vital surge capacity in the event of an emergency in Manhattan   For example  NYUSM is organizing a Consortium on Preparedness in order to prepare an integrated response to a crisis like the tragedy that struck this city on 9 11    The Manhattan VA forms a part of the consortium  s plans  and if the Manhattan VA were closed the consortium would lose resources critical to its plans for assisting with the response to a future public health emergency          The practical matter of transportation is essential to your deliberations   The high quality of services at the Manhattan VA attract veterans from the City of New York  as well as surrounding areas and other states  According to figures for Fiscal Year 2004 provided to my office by NYUSM  nearly 800 veterans from the Bronx and Queens received inpatient treatment at the Manhattan VA  on top of more than 1 000 veterans from Manhattan   So did more than 300 veterans from the Hudson Valley  Westchester and Long Island   One of the main reasons the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located  as it is  in the heart of Manhattan  at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere else in the nation           In short  the potential loss of the benefits of the NYU    Manhattan VA relationship as well as the Manhattan VA  s central location make the proposals that would close the Manhattan VA ill advised            Proposals to close the Brooklyn VA are just as ill advised   A number of SUNY Downstate department chairs have pointed out that it is accessible to motor vehicles by virtue of its proximity in Brooklyn to a significant artery    the Belt Parkway    as well as a major bridge    the Verrazano Bridge    and because the facility maintains plenty of parking   They also note the support the Brooklyn VA provides to the Department of Defense at Ft  Hamilton          The Brooklyn VA has multiple bed services    in surgery  psychiatry  residential substance abuse  and acute medicine  and provides specialized cancer care  According to NYHHS  a Fisher House for oncology patients and their families is expected to be placed at the medical center   The Brooklyn VA maintains affiliations with the SUNY Downstate Medical School and the SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn  According to a number of SUNY Downstate department chairs  the medical school is integrated with most of the clinical programs  Just as the relationship between the Manhattan VA and NYUSM would be imperiled by closure of the Manhattan VA  closure of the Brooklyn VA would threaten the existing SUNY relationship with the VA   Closure of the Brooklyn VA could also endanger the continuation of important research    with funding estimated at more than  1 million per year          Moreover  I understand that  according to NYUSM and SUNY Downstate  the Manhattan VA and the Brooklyn VA have already been through a successful consolidation process generating substantial savings while maintaining high quality of care for New York  s veterans   They maintain that this shows the past success of evolutionary change and the vital role that local stakeholders must play in such a process            I understand that NYU Medical School Dean Robert Glickman  MD  and the SUNY Downstate College of Medicine Dean Eugene Feigelson  MD  have jointly written to VA Secretary Nicholson to suggest that three options proposed by PwC    options 1  6 and 7    merit further consideration  However  they emphatically make the point that consolidating the Manhattan VA and the Brooklyn VA into one campus would   be a disservice to our veterans  severely compromising both the quality of care and the access to care           Indeed  the bottom line remains the same as it has throughout the CARES process    the closure of either the Manhattan VA or the Brooklyn VA would hurt veterans          In addition to individual considerations applicable to each VA facility  I am also concerned that the accuracy of VA  s projections for future demand for services are open to question   According to PwC  s Stage I Summary Report    veteran utilization for healthcare services was projected for 20 years  using 2003 data supplied by the VA as the base year and projecting through 2023      However  faulty VA health care demand projections regarding the number of servicemembers returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  was reportedly one of the reasons the VA recently had to make enormous revisions in its health care budget projections  at least with respect to fiscal year 2005          I also question whether the kinds of severe injuries we are seeing in some of the heroic returning veterans of OIF and OEF are being accurately accounted for in VA  s modeling of projected demand   According to the deans of NYUSM and SUNY Downstate  their records indicate that already more than 2 000 veterans from OEF and OIF are currently registered with the New York Harbor Health Care System   They note appropriately that   it is quite possible that the healthcare needs for veterans in modern wars will be higher because a much higher percentage survives severe wounds    and live longer               If VA is unable to accurately predict this year  s and next year  s budgets  in the context of OEF and OIF  projections twenty years in the future should be subject to even greater scrutiny   To move aggressively to close major facilities such as the Manhattan VA or the Brooklyn VA on the basis of such projections is truly ill advised          In meeting with veterans and hearing the comments that veterans and other stakeholders have provided to my office  I have learned a tremendous amount about the value of these facilities and the quality of health care that is delivered there   Our nation  s veterans have served their country with distinction   Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces    a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system   I urge the Panel to take into account the proper factors and input from veterans  I am convinced that if you listen to the voices of New York  s veterans  you will reject proposals for closure and will advise the VA to maintain both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s          Thank you
