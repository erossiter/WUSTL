                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Legislation Aids School Recovery in Hurricane Impacted States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   United States Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D LA   Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV   along with Representatives George Miller  D CA  and Charlie Melancon  D LA  have introduced companion bills in the Senate and House to recruit teachers and principals to public schools  including charter schools  devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  The bill also helps the recovery of colleges and universities in the region           Senator Kennedy is chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee and Rep  Miller is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor  Also cosponsoring the bill are Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY            Hurricanes Katrina and Rita drove many of our teachers and principals away from Louisiana because their homes and communities were destroyed   Senator Landrieu said   We are working to rebuild these communities  and a crucial component of this effort is recruiting dedicated teachers and experienced principals and administrators to our schools so that Louisiana students can receive the quality education every child deserves            This legislation provides incentives for teachers and principals so they will come back to the region  It will help us stand up our public school system  a vital component to our recovery  and give greatly needed aid to our colleges and universities              Schools can t open without teachers  and teachers can t come back if they can t afford to live   Senator Kennedy said   We need leadership and a coordinated  sustainable plan to ensure that families can return to New Orleans and put their lives back together without the added burden of struggling to find classrooms for their children   This bill would provide a critical infusion of resources for schools in the communities most affected by the hurricanes to attract good teachers and principals back to the region and would help our colleges and universities on the Gulf Coast continue to rebuild and recover           The legislation authorizes  250 million over five years to recruit K 12 teachers and principals to the hurricane impacted Louisiana and Gulf Coast region           It also authorizes  500 million in grants to hurricane impacted higher education institutions that were closed or have relocated and continue to lose revenue and enrollment  The money can be used to help the colleges and universities recover by funding needs such as faculty salaries and incentives  student recruitment  and grants to students who attend these institutions           For a year and a half  schools in New Orleans and other Gulf Coast communities have waited in vain for much of the help they need to get back to the business of educating the thousands of students returning to the area   Representative Miller said   Teachers and principals are key to building a vibrant K 12 system and this legislation will help make sure that schools can attract and retain quality staff  providing a model for other schools around the country   These resources are critical to rebuilding education systems that are essential to the future of our children who live in the Gulf Coast   and essential to the future of the Gulf Coast itself            I am very pleased to work with Senator Landrieu on this long overdue piece of legislation   Senator Clinton said   The schools in the Gulf Coast region are in desperate need of passionate  qualified principles and teachers  This bill will not only provide the incentives needed to attract educators to this region but it will also supply housing assistance to ensure a smooth transition              This legislation provides powerful and crucial incentives to get the best and brightest teachers and principals to Louisiana s school districts most impacted by Katrina and Rita   said Paul Pastorek  the new Louisiana superintendent of education   Presently  over 750 teachers are needed for the 2007 2008 school year in New Orleans alone or children will not receive the necessary instruction and further and unnecessary harm will come to them  These incentives also provide an additional boost to get those excellent teachers and principals displaced by the storms back to Louisiana   We need these incentives now in Louisiana to ensure that the 2007 2008 school year starts effectively with the best faculty in place           The provisions for K 12 education include               Teachers who commit to teach in hurricane impacted school districts for at least three
