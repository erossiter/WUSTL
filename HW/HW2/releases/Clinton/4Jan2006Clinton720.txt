January 4  2006 Senator Clinton Calls For Immediate Action to Address Implementation Problems in New Medicare Prescription Drug Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Amid news reports of disarray in the implementation of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today urged the Bush administration to act immediately to aid local pharmacists and Medicare beneficiaries who are bearing the brunt of problems plaguing the new program   In a letter to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  at the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  the federal agency responsible for the program  Senator Clinton called on the agency to aid pharmacists struggling at the front lines to help Medicare recipients access needed medications and step up outreach to seniors who have not yet received enrollment information              During this implementation  where a single mistake can cut off access to critical medicines  we must ensure that we bring all necessary resources to bear to reduce the confusion and complexity involved with the Part D benefit and help seniors in New York and across the nation receive the assistance they need and deserve     wrote Senator Clinton     I urge you to act immediately to increase the resources devoted to processing and confirming enrollments  and ensure that both the computer system and telephone hotlines are able to handle high volumes of inquiries   I also urge your agency to engage in more outreach and education to help address the concerns of seniors who have not received enrollment confirmation             Senator Clinton has been a vocal advocate for the need to ensure that Medicare recipients receive the assistance they need and deserve in the transition to the new Medicare prescription drug program   Senator Clinton has released a resource guide to prescription drug coverage under Medicare  which has been distributed to more than 65 000 New Yorkers and is posted on the Senator  s website   In December  Senator Clinton introduced legislation to help the most vulnerable beneficiaries  those who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid  make a smooth transition from Medicaid prescription drug coverage to the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program   Seniors and disabled Americans who are dually eligible for both programs stopped receiving prescription drugs through Medicaid automatically on January 1 and local pharmacists are bearing the brunt of responsibility for aiding and advising these recipients during the transition of their coverage from Medicaid to the new Medicare Part D benefit   Senator Clinton  s bill  the Medicare Dual Eligible Identification and Enrollment Facilitation Act  would require outreach and education to pharmacies on dually eligible beneficiaries and waive the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting these beneficiaries          The following is the text of the letter from Senator Clinton to CMS Administrator McClellan          The Honorable Mark McClellan  Commissioner  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20201         Dear Dr  McClellan          I am deeply concerned by reports from New York and around the nation regarding the serious and ongoing problems being experienced by patients and pharmacists since the implementation of Medicare Part D on January 1  and I would urge you to address these issues immediately to ensure that all those who are eligible and have enrolled in the new benefit can access essential prescription medications  In this transition  we cannot afford even a temporary denial of lifesaving drugs for Part D beneficiaries           Of particular concern are the problems being faced by pharmacists who are struggling on the front lines to confirm coverage and eligibility for their patients  Since January 1  the computer system set up to verify enrollment has repeatedly been unable to process queries in a timely manner  or has returned incorrect information  Pharmacists who seek telephone assistance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  and individual prescription drug plans face busy signals and long hold times  and  in several cases  have also been given incorrect information  Because these systems are overwhelmed  some pharmacies have resorted to providing short term supplies of medication for free because they cannot determine which plans cover beneficiaries  Pharmacists are spending hours confirming enrollment because many beneficiaries do not know which plan provides them with coverage  or do not know what documents to bring to the pharmacy to help them access their drugs   You yourself have stated that seniors may not have received their enrollment cards or letters acknowledging enrollment in a plan           I understand that December  s increased enrollment in Part D programs has resulted in delays in processing applications  but this burden should not then in turn be passed along to the patients and pharmacists who are relying on CMS to facilitate a smooth transition to the Part D benefit  It is unacceptable for them to bear the brunt of the failure of CMS to adequately plan for this transition          During this implementation  where a single mistake can cut off access to critical medicines  we must ensure that we bring all necessary resources to bear to reduce the confusion and complexity involved with the Part D benefit and help seniors in New York and across the nation receive the assistance they need and deserve  I urge you to act immediately to increase the resources devoted to processing and confirming enrollments  and ensure that both the computer system and telephone hotlines are able to handle high volumes of inquiries  I also urge your agency to engage in more outreach and education to help address the concerns of seniors who have not received enrollment confirmation  I ask that you provide details of the ways in which CMS will immediately address these serious problems being faced by beneficiaries and those that are helping them access prescription drugs  as well as the measures you will take to ensure that similar situations do not occur as enrollment continues over the next few months           Sincerely yours           Hillary Rodham Clinton
