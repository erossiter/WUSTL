February 1  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton on Senate Passage of Minimum Wage Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC      Today  Democrats delivered on our commitment to give working families the pay raise they need and deserve  This is a real victory for millions of working families who have waited for ten long years for Congress to act           This pay increase is a real step forward and will make a real difference in the lives of many Americans  Women especially will benefit from this wage increase   Nine million women earn the minimum wage    59 percent of all minimum wage earners    many of them struggling to support families and make ends meet   It provides a pay raise of more than  4000 a year to help pay for groceries  housing  energy costs and all of the other necessities of every day life   However  this must be just the first step toward lifting up working families who for too long have been falling behind           The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities just released a report showing the effects of a  7 25 minimum wage  Even with this increase  a family of five with a full time  minimum wage earner that receives food stamps and the refundable tax credits would fall  1 139 below the poverty line in 2009  The cost of housing is likely to take far more than 30 percent of most low income working families   incomes  the federal standard for housing affordability  even after the minimum wage increase takes effect   Approximately 45 percent of children in poverty are uninsured  most low income working parents are not eligible for health insurance through Medicaid and few have private coverage          It is critical that we acknowledge and address these challenges   We also need to make sure our lowest paid workers benefit from the growing economy that their work helps fuel          This is the first of many opportunities we will have in this Congress to raise the living standards of our hardest working Americans  I am eager to work with my colleagues to advance a Democratic agenda that invests in our children and families and creates opportunity again for all of our families  Increasing the minimum wage is a tremendous down payment on that investment
