                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senators Schumer  Clinton  Lautenberg  Menendez  Reps  Maloney and Fossella applaud action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Today  the federal government announced they were distributing  40 million in funds for the medical treatment of those exposed to the toxic air around Ground Zero          Shortly before the fifth anniversary of 9 11  at a meeting arranged by Reps  Carolyn Maloney  D NY  and Vito Fossella  R NY  with Senators Hillary Clinton  D NY   Charles Schumer  D NY   Robert Menendez  D NJ  and New York area Members of Congress  Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt agreed to expedite the distribution of this money  It was originally planned to go out over a period of as many as three years          The  40 million announced today is part of the  75 million for treatment and medical monitoring included in the  125 million for 9 11 responders that was originally rescinded in the Administration s budget  but was successfully restored by the New York Area Delegation last year  These funds mark the very first federal dollars spent for treating those suffering from 9 11 related illnesses            On September 11th 2001  thousands of brave men and women rushed to Ground Zero to assist in the recovery effort in any way they could     said Senator Schumer    While they courageously risked their lives in a time of national crisis  today the health of many first responders continues to suffer from their heroic work  The money released today is a good step in ensuring that all first responders and those affected by the toxic air at Ground Zero get the treatment they need               Last year  we restored  125 million so that it would be available for the continued recovery from the September 11  2001 attacks and could be used for ongoing medical and mental health treatment     Senator Clinton said     We know from recent work by Mount Sinai  the FDNY and others that many heroes who rushed to Ground Zero and Fresh Kills are experiencing medical problems and we must take care of them   They came to our rescue in our time of need and we must do the same   I am grateful that the Department of Health and Human Services is distributing a significant amount of the  75 million we secured so that we can continue to do what is right for these heroes   We have a long way to go to fully address all of the outstanding needs of people who were exposed to toxins and I will continue to push legislation to fully address these needs               Many of the brave Americans who toiled at Ground Zero following the Sept  11 attacks are still suffering because of their service     Senator Menendez said    I was proud to work alongside colleagues in both chambers of Congress to ensure these Americans receive the medical treatment they need  These funds will allow our nation to stand by those who stood by America in her darkest hour               We owe nothing less to those who risked their lives at Ground Zero than compensation for the injuries and illnesses they incurred   They risked their lives to save others and today we are providing them with funds for the care they need     Senator Frank R  Lautenberg said     We should move quickly to do more  not only for our first responders but for all of those who suffered on September 11th               I am gratified that the first federal money for treatment of 9 11 related illness has finally been sent     said Representative Maloney    I am glad that Secretary Leavitt acted swiftly on the request the New York area delegation made last month    he and his point person  Dr  John Howard  should be commended for this action  We hope that the administration will now finally begin creating a long term  comprehensive plan to take care of all affected rescue and recovery workers  residents  office workers and school children and that adequate funding will appear in the president  s next budget  This is not just a five year health crisis  it  s a crisis that doctors say could last decades  and the federal response should reflect that reality               I  m extremely pleased the  75 million we secured for medical treatment will finally be used to help suffering 9 11 first responders   I applaud Secretary Leavitt in acting quickly on our request to get this funding out in October   The secretary and his point person  Dr  John Howard  expedited our request  and they have made sure the funds would be available based on need and not an artificial spending rate     said Representative Fossella     While we must continue pushing the federal government to develop a long term plan to monitor and treat all those afflicted with 9 11 related illnesses  today  s announcement is a great start   I also want to thank Mayor Bloomberg for lobbying the government tirelessly on this issue and announcing new efforts by the City to strengthen treatment and monitoring services for the men and women who responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center
