               Washington  DC   Citing the recent filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy by Delphi Corporation  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called upon President Bush to convene a national auto manufacturing summit to address the serious problems facing the auto manufacturing and parts industry and their workers             The crisis facing auto makers and their suppliers is of such significance that it not only calls for  but demands  the attention and focus of our national leaders      Senator Clinton wrote in a letter to the President    The economic consequences of the government  s failure to address these matters will be severe unless we demonstrate the will and the leadership to deal with them head on   Given the fact that there are over 1 million Americans currently employed in the auto industry  we cannot simply allow one of the core elements of our national economic infrastructure to whither away             In the letter  Senator Clinton recommended that the summit include the Administration  Members of Congress  state and local officials  executives from the auto industry and labor representatives and address such issues as legacy costs like heath care and pensions  fuel efficiency and foreign competition and trade          A full text of the letter is below            October 20  2005         The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  DC 20500         Dear Mr  President          As you know  Delphi Corporation has recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy   I believe that this development will have serious ramifications not only for Delphi employees  but for the entire auto manufacturing and parts industry as well    Indeed  Delphi  s Chief Executive Officer has already warned that this bankruptcy filing   is not just a Delphi issue  but an auto industry issue      It is clear that given the indispensable role of the United States auto industry in our Nation  s economy  these troubling events require substantive action from our national leadership           Not only have jobs in the auto industry long been the bedrock of America s economy  but they have also provided a ladder into the middle class for millions of workers and their families   However  it is clear that many aspects of the auto industry are changing rapidly  and our domestic manufacturers find themselves saddled with enormous legacy costs including paying the health care and pensions of retirees   These are also costs that are not shared by our Asian  European or our fellow North American competitors with whom we are engaged in increasingly intense competition in the auto market            These problems can be seen throughout the entire auto industry    Nevertheless  I sincerely believe that this crisis does not have to result in a zero sum game  where wages and benefits to workers are slashed to the bone in order to maintain a company  s solvency   American workers can compete with anyone and we still maintain a technological and innovative edge over every other nation in the world  so it  s clear that creative solutions can be achieved if we put forth a good faith effort to address these long term problems           Given that the future viability of one of our Nation  s core economic sectors is at stake   I believe it would be prudent for you to call for a national auto manufacturing summit that would include the Administration  Members of Congress  state and local officials  executives from the auto industry and labor representatives   I believe that a summit where everything can be put on the table  including legacy costs like health care and pensions  fuel efficiency  foreign competition and trade  could yield beneficial results and solutions for our auto industry   This could be a historic opportunity for government leaders  industry executives and auto workers to work together and substantively address these issues which have been ignored for too long             The crisis facing auto makers and their suppliers is of such significance that it not only calls for  but demands the attention and focus of our national leaders   The economic consequences of the government  s failure to address these matters will be severe unless we demonstrate the will and the leadership to deal with them head on   Given the fact that there are over 1 million Americans currently employed in the auto industry  we cannot simply allow one of the core elements of our national economic infrastructure to whither away           Thank you for your attention to this critical issue          Sincerely yours            Hillary Rodham Clinton
