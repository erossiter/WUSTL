June 20  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on Administration to Provide Long Awaited Answers on 9 11 Air Quality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senate Hearing in Washington  DC Raises Questions About Deliberate Administration Interference to Reassure New Yorkers their Air was Safe  Outlines Serious Inadequacies in EPA s Test and Clean Program and Reveals that the EPA is Unprepared to Deal with Future Disasters   Senator Calls on the Government Accountability Office to Conduct a Separate Investigation Into the EPA s Level of Prepa           Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  questioned Administration officials at length today about the systematic failures of the Federal government in responding to the environmental crisis that resulted from the September 11  2001 World Trade Center attacks  Senator Clintons hearing was held to examine the federal response to 9 11  including risk communication and EPA programs to test and clean indoor spaces in lower Manhattan   The hearing also examined lessons learned from 9 11 and federal readiness to respond to releases of hazardous substances in future emergencies             When we turned to our Government in Washington for guidance in the hours  days  and weeks after 9 11 we wanted to know if the air was safe and if our homes  our schools and our offices would be taken care of  All we got was deliberate misinformation  manipulation and half truths  Senator Clinton said following the hearing  We never got the information we needed to understand just what toxic hazards were present in the air  we never got the comprehensive test and clean up program that would have protected families  students and workers  and we are left with a federal agency that is completely unprepared if this kind of air quality disaster were to happen again    Senator Clinton questioned the officials about why the Bush Administration  EPA and CEQ management chose to downplay and grossly misrepresent the health risks related to exposure in the days and weeks after 9 11  She also asked why  when the EPAs own Inspector General blasted the EPAs program to clean up indoor contamination  the EPA is making the same mistakes again four years later  Senator Clinton challenged the EPA and CEQ as to whether they have learned any lessons from this disaster and whether they are better prepared to protect public health from environmental hazards in future disasters           At the hearing  Senator Clinton questioned several representatives from the Administration  including James L  Connaughton  Chairman of the Presidents Council on Environmental Quality  CEQ  whose office pressured the Environmental Protection Agency to weaken the wording of its public statements about the air quality in New York City in the days after the September 11  2001 attacks  According to the EPA Inspector Generals  IG  report of 2003  White House officials persuaded the Environmental Protection Agency to minimize its assessment of the dangers posed by airborne dust and debris from the buildings collapse and to replace cautionary statements with reassuring ones in news releases  After the release of the EPA Inspector Generals  IG  report about the EPA s 9 11 response in August of 2003  Mr  Connaughton was also responsible for committing the Administration to establish the EPA World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel   That panel examined a range of issues relating to contamination of indoor spaces that were raised by the 2003 IGs report     The hearing also included testimony from Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  official Susan Bodine  who oversees the EPA s emergency response office and who testified about their post 9 11 activities  including their two programs to test and clean indoor spaces    The Committee also heard from the Government Accountability Office  GAO  who testified for the first time about investigatory work they have done at the request of Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler to evaluate the EPA s efforts to test and clean indoor spaces in New York City   When the EPAs second unacceptable Test and Clean program came out last year  Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler requested a GAO investigation  Today was first time GAO spoke about some of their findings   including their conclusion that the EPAs plan has serious inadequacies  A full copy of the report will be out later this year  Following the hearing  Senator Clinton also called on the Government Accountability Office to conduct a separate investigation into the EPAs level of preparedness to deal with future environmental disasters    The Committee also heard from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health and a local resident     The Senate hearing today was the first of two hearings which represent the first comprehensive Congressional oversight investigations into these environmental matters since the immediate aftermath of the attacks  The second will be held by Congressman Jerrold Nadler  NY 08   Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  on June 25  2007    For more than five years  Clinton and Nadler have staunchly criticized and questioned the Administration s misleading public statements about post 9 11 air quality  as well as its continued failure to provide a proper testing and cleaning of indoor spaces contaminated by WTC toxins and its lack of provision of health care for the thousands of people who are already ill as a result of exposure to the pollutants       Senator Clintons hearing focused specifically on the Federal government s failure to date  to systematically and properly test and remediate all indoor residences  workplaces and public areas of buildings affected by the hazardous materials from the WTC disaster    In 2003  the EPA Inspector General found that the EPA s first post 9 11 indoor residential cleanup plan was improperly limited in scope  deeply flawed in methodology  and failed to utilize EPA s own standard health based benchmarks   The EPA s most recent Test and Clean plan  currently underway  fails to correct the problems diagnosed by the Inspector General  and ignores her specific recommendations for development of a proper plan   This second plan was rejected by most members of the EPA s own World Trade Center Technical Review Panel  a body created at the request of Senator Clinton   The hearing also examined the EPA s current readiness to respond to Bush Administration disaster policy      The witnesses were as follows  A transcript of Senator Clintons opening remarks is below         The hearing will come to order      I thank you all for being here  I know there are a number of New Yorkers in the audience  and I welcome all of you  Kimberly Flynn  and Joseph Jones  and Jenna Orkin  and Marvin Bethea  and Barbara Einzig  and everyone else    This is the first hearing of the Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  and it is entitled EPA s Response to 9 11 and Lessons Learned for Future Emergency Preparedness     Also in the audience is my friend and colleague  and someone who has been a real leader on these issues  Congressman Jerry Nadler    This follows a hearing that I chaired in the HELP Committee earlier this year in March to address the urgent health needs of the thousands of first responders  workers  volunteers  and residents who have suffered illnesses because of the toxins to which they were exposed following the attacks of 9 11   It is a companion hearing to one that Congressman Nadler will hold on the House side next week    We will first hear testimony from a federal panel that includes EPA  the White House Council on Environmental Quality  the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Government Accountability Office    We will then hear from a panel that includes a New York City resident and a scientific expert  both heavily involved in 9 11 contamination issues     And I am delighted to be joined by the Ranking Member on this Committee  Senator Larry Craig   Thank you very much Senator Craig for coming  And my Chairman of the full committee  Senator Barbara Boxer  as well as my friend and colleague Senator Lautenberg   I really appreciate each of their interest in this issue  and of course Senator Lautenberg and I share many constituents who have been suffering and even dying because of their exposure to the toxins at and around Ground Zero    I called this hearing because it is time for answers  Nearly six years after 9 11  we still don t have the whole truth about the toxic cloud of poison that filled the air after the towers fell  We dont have an explanation for the misrepresentations that put countless people at risk of exposure to chemicals that we know are causing illness and death     When we turned to our Government in Washington for guidance in the hours  days  and weeks after that tragedy  one of the questions people asked was obvious and important  Is the air safe    What did EPA tell us   On September 18  2001  Governor Whitman said  and I quote   I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington  D C  that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink    Now  based on the EPAs statements  parents sent their children to school in the area and residents returned to their apartments   But as the EPA Inspector General informed us in 2003  the EPAs statements were  and I quote  not supported by the data available at the time     Now  I recognize that EPA and everyone else involved were operating under unprecedented and extremely difficult circumstances   But I simply cannot accept what appears to have been a deliberate effort to provide unwarranted reassurances   at the direction of the White House   to New Yorkers about whether their air was safe to breathe    I well remember my first visit to Ground Zero  the day after 9 11  You could feel it on your skin  the air was acrid and thick   You could taste it  you certainly could smell it   Back in Washington  I went to work  pushing then Administrator Whitman to address environmental hazards from the 9 11 fallout  and to hold hearings in New York City on the issue in February of 2002   I pushed for EPA to address the indoor contamination issue  and fought for the Bush Administration to address the shortcomings identified in the first cleanup program  leading to a commitment to establish the EPA World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel in 2003    I have also worked to secure funding for programs to provide medical screening and tracking for first responders   I am very pleased that the Senate Labor  HHS  Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee has approved a bill yesterday to provide an additional  55 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards   And for the first time we were able to secure bill language yesterday requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to extend the program to residents  students  and others impacted by the toxins  And I want to thank Senators Harkin and Spector for including this in the legislation    The reason I have worked so hard on these issues is because of heartrending stories of people like Felicia Dunn Jones  and members of her family are here with us   In May  the New York City medical examiner reversed an earlier decision  and ruled that the death of Felicia Dunn Jones was connected to her exposure on 9 11  the first such ruling in New York   And we already had had a ruling by the coroner in New Jersey connecting the death of an NYPD detective to his exposure    Felicia Dunn Jones was a 42 year old lawyer who worked near the World Trade Center   In February of 2002  she passed away from Sarcoidosis  often associated with environmental hazards  Her husband  Joe Jones  who lives in Staten Island with his two children  is here today  as is Felicia s sister  Sharon Alvarez    She was caught in the toxic cloud  and her story recognizes how difficult the balance has been of scientific and medical evidence  but it is shifting   showing that increased exposure to 9 11 toxins actually can cause illness and death      The first responders were the first to see these effects   Within two months of the attacks  300 firefighters were on medical leave  suffering with lung ailments  Subsequent research has shown that this was just the first sign of the persistent health problems     More than 11 500 firefighters and 3 000 emergency medical technicians and paramedics took part in the greatest rescue ever mounted  We know that thousands are now suffering from adverse health effects   According to fire department studies  exposed firefighters on average experienced a decline in lung function equivalent to that which would be produced by 12 years of aging     More than 34 000 employees of the New York Police Department participated in rescue  recovery and cleanup operations at Ground Zero or Fresh Kills  where the debris from the disaster was taken  More than 2 000 members of the police department have filed medical claims     The rescue and recovery efforts were assisted by heavy machinery operators  laborers  ironworkers  building and construction tradespeople  telecommunication workers  and others from the public and private sector  Researchers at Mt  Sinai Medical Center have documented physical and mental health effects among this population  with 69 percent reporting new or worsened respiratory symptoms experienced while at Ground Zero  and 59 percent still experiencing persistent health effects more than two years after the attacks     Almost 60 000 residents live in the vicinity of the World Trade Center  south of Canal Street in Lower Manhattan  The dust and debris settled in many of the apartments and buildings in the vicinity of the attacks  An analysis of more than 2 000 residents in the area found 60 percent experienced the onset of respiratory symptoms  a rate approximately three times higher than that of the surrounding area in Manhattan  In addition  students at Stuyvesant High School in Lower Manhattan  who were evacuated because of their proximity to the World Trade Center  resumed classes one month after the attacks  they had rates of respiratory and other illnesses at rates that were higher than those at other New York City high schools     Sadly  some of these illnesses were not preventable  as the toxic dust cloud literally enveloped many people as they fled from the scene   But many who were exposed could have been protected     That is why it is important that we examine what went wrong   Americans deserve to know what we can do to better protect them     And we have a number of questions    First  why did the Bush Administration  EPA and CEQ management choose to downplay and grossly misrepresent the exposure health risks posed in the days and weeks after 9 11      Second  the EPAs own inspector general blasted the EPAs program to clean up indoor contamination  But four years later  the EPA is making the same mistakes again     Third  have EPA and CEQ learned lessons from the disaster and are better prepared to protect public health from environmental hazards in the future   To me  it is clear from the GAO testimony that some lessons are being ignored and I dont want us to repeat the mistakes     We can never repay those who sacrificed for us  who answered the call of duty  We cannot go back in time and pull the brave men and woman off that pile or order them to wear respiratory protection equipment  We cant tell the residents  first responders  workers  volunteers  and others that the air is too dangerous to breathe   But we can clear the air here in Washington and clear the way to help those affected and to hold accountable those who let New Yorkers and Americans down  to learn lessons so that we should to be fully prepared for the unthinkable  That is why I have called todays hearing       Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the lasting health effects of 9 11
