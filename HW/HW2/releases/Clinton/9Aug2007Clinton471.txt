neighborhoods leaving a path of destruction in its wake  Damage from this storm ranged from flooding to the destruction of cars  homes and local businesses      A copy of Senator Clintons letters to President Bush is attached    August 9  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    I write in anticipation of the request by New York Governor Eliot Spitzer for the Administration to immediately provide funding and assistance to those people in New York City who were affected by the severe storms that hit the area on August 8th   As you are aware  in the early hours of Wednesday morning  a series of severe thunderstorms dumped approximately 3 5 inches of rain in New York City and the surrounding boroughs   The storms which were stronger than previously expected  caused devastating flooding  and they also were responsible for generating the first tornado to hit Brooklyn in over a century     The rains that battered New York City crippled mass transit causing the shutdown of nearly 90  of subway service  stranding hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers during the morning commute and throughout the day   However  the damage done in Queens where neighborhood streets were completely flooded  and Brooklyn where a tornado ripped through the Southwest neighborhoods  was nothing short of devastating   The tornado  which registered 135 mph winds according to the National Weather Center  tore through the borough of Brooklyn destroying cars  homes and businesses  and uprooted trees causing damage to sidewalks and roads       There are reports that between forty to seventy buildings were seriously damaged  and at least 100 people were left temporarily homeless   Windows were shattered  roofs were obliterated  and trees were blown into residences causing major damage to their structures   According to one report  a residential buildings wall was completely stripped from the residence   This storm has not only severely impacted residential properties  but it also caused damage to local businesses as well      The financial burden for the residents and business owners from the storms damage has the potential to be overwhelming for the State and local government therefore federal assistance is absolutely critical in helping New Yorkers recover from this disaster     Upon receipt of the request from Governor Spitzer  I urge you and your agencies to expedite an assessment of the storm damage and provide the appropriate federal funding and assistance so that the people of New York can begin to rebuild their homes and repair their businesses    I thank you for your immediate consideration of this critically important matter   I look forward to your swift response    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
