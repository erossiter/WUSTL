July 6  2006 Clinton and Murray Call for GAO Investigation Into FDA Outsourcing of Public Comment Review on Plan B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Patty Murray  WA  are calling for the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to investigate yet another troubling departure from standard FDA practice in the handling of the application for Plan B to be made available over the counter   The FDA has taken the unusual step of outsourcing to a private contractor  Booz Allen Hamilton  the responsibility of collecting and reviewing comments submitted to the FDA on Plan B              We are deeply troubled by what appears to be yet another example of unusual handling of the Plan B application   The American people deserve an FDA that they trust makes decisions based on science not ideology   The Plan B process has already tarnished that trust   Outsourcing public comments on Plan B is yet another warning sign that the FDA is not taking seriously its responsibility to make a decision on Plan B  yes or no     said Senators Clinton and Murray          After more than two years  the FDA continues to drag its heels on making a yes or no decision on Plan B   In September of 2005  the FDA announced a public comment period   The agency has not announced its next steps  including how or when it will make a decision   Senators Clinton and Murray underscored that they will press Acting FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach about this arrangement if questions about this contract are not satisfactorily resolved             The text of their letter to GAO Comptroller General David Walker follows          The Honorable David Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  442 G Street  N W   Washington  D C   20548    Dear Mr  Walker     We are writing to you to request that you review the contract between the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton  BAH   pursuant to which BAH has been given the responsibility of collecting and reviewing comments submitted to the FDA in response to its current rulemaking on Plan B           As you are aware  the FDA has departed from standard practices in reviewing the Plan B application   Most recently  FDA has opened a rulemaking process on its authority to approve the marketing of FDA to adults over the counter and to minors with prescriptions             One unusual element of this process is that while FDA has placed great emphasis  on the need to consider public comments and the development of a regulation for proper implementation  FDA apparently has outsourced the comment review process  at least in its initial stages  to a private contractor           FDA  s arrangement with BAH raises several questions           Did FDA enter into a written contract with BAH for this project alone   If not  is FDA piggybacking this work onto a previously existing contract   Does FDA have the legal authority to do so   Have any other contracts been issued with regard to this regulation or product approval           Exactly what is the extent of the work that BAH is performing for FDA   What are the tasks and deliverables  Will BAH merely tabulate the comments   If so  what categories is BAH using   Will BAH summarize the comments   What are the qualifications of the BAH personnel who will write the summaries   Will BAH offer any conclusions or advice as to the comments           Why doesn  t FDA keep this work in house   Does FDA lack personnel to digest comments in rulemaking proceedings   What level of staffing has FDA assigned to the development of this regulation           Who at FDA decides whether comment reviews should be outsourced   What office division center at FDA oversees the contractor and who is the project officer   Does FDA have written standards that govern the oversight of contractors in cases such as this one           What is the cost of subcontracting the review of Plan B comments to BAH   If FDA is subcontracting reviews of comments in other rulemakings  how much does FDA spend annually on such contracts           Does FDA  s arrangement with BAH contain any incentive provisions   What are the deadlines for deliverables  Does it call for penalties if deadlines are not met or work is unsatisfactory           It may be that additional questions will arise once you begin your work  so we reserve the right to modify this request           In the meantime  we believe that time is of the essence   The President has nominated Andrew Von Eschenbach to serve as Director of FDA  this nomination will go through the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  on which we both sit   We would like to resolve these questions about the BAH Plan B contract prior to Dr  Von Eschenbach  s confirmation hearings  failing that  we intend to ask him about the contract at those hearings           So that you may complete your work in a timely fashion  we are asking for less than a full scale GAO report   An evaluation of the contract in the form of a memo would suffice   We would like to discuss the parameters of this project with you at your earliest convenience             Sincerely yours          Patty Murray                                                           Hillary Rodham Clinton
