November 30  2005 Clinton  McHugh Call on Greyhound To Reconsider Bus Service Cutbacks In The North Country                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   In response to reports of the potential elimination of bus service to several parts of the North Country  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congressman John M  McHugh  R NY  made a plea to Greyhound Bus Lines to reconsider their decision  Clinton and McHugh also said they would do what they could to help keep this essential transportation route in the North Country  writing to Greyhound CEO Stephen Gorman and Governor Pataki to offer assistance as the State Department of Transportation deals with the situation          I am terribly disappointed to hear of Greyhound s possible plans to cut back on this critical transportation service     Senator Clinton said    Eliminating this important  affordable transportation service in the North Country will have an untold impact on the region  Not only will it reduce the ability of people to get from place to place for work or to see family  it will also limit the options available to students who want to access the region s premier educational institutions  I hope that we can resolve this situation and keep an affordable  transportation system in the North Country             Like Senator Clinton  I was deeply disappointed to learn that Greyhound was eliminating its vital bus service throughout the North Country   In this region of the world  we measure our trips by hours  not miles and  for the most part  mass transit is simply not an option   These cutbacks will have a dramatic negative impact on North Country residents  especially our college students  many of whom rely on Greyhound as their sole means of transportation from their respective campuses back home to their families   I cannot emphasize enough how important Greyhound service is to North Country residents and urge them to reconsider this decision     Congressman McHugh said        Copies of the letters are attached        November 29  2005       Mr  Stephen E  Gorman  President and Chief Executive Officer  Greyhound Lines  Inc   15110 North Dallas Parkway  Dallas  Texas  75248       Dear Mr  Gorman        We are disappointed to have read about your company s recent announcement to discontinue critical transportation services in Upstate New York between Syracuse  Watertown  and Massena  New York   This line has been operating to serve many of our residents and visitors who would otherwise not have access to affordable and accessible transportation in this part of our State        We understand that the State of New York currently provides an operational subsidy for this route which enables Greyhound to continue its operations   Discontinuation of these services will have a direct  negative impact on the lives of thousands of people who utilize Greyhound s services   If additional state subsidies are required for Greyhound s continued operation  we stand ready to support additional assistance from New York State should that prevent the elimination of this important service        Although there may be ongoing discussions with other carriers to take over this route  we are concerned that there is no guarantee that our fellow New Yorkers can be confident that other transportation options will be forthcoming    The information our offices have received indicates that there were about 7 200 riders over the first and second quarter of 2005 and that ridership is operating steadily at around 3 000 4 000 per quarter   Many of our schools need this service so that students who commute to the airport  train  and other destinations can do so affordably   We believe Greyhound s decision is unfair to those living  visiting  working  and going to school along this route and we ask that your company reconsider this decision        If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact our offices   We look forward to working with you to ensure that Greyhound will continue to be an important provider of critical transportation services in every part of New York        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senate       John McHugh  United States House of Representatives         November 29  2005       The Honorable George E  Pataki  Governor  State of New York  State Capitol  Albany  New York  12224       Dear Governor Pataki        It has recently come to our attention that Greyhound is anticipating the elimination of critical service in Upstate New York that provides transportation access between Syracuse  Watertown  and Massena  New York  with other key stops in between   We do not believe discontinuation of these services is in the best interests of New York   We know that you  and New York officials  have been in contact with Greyhound and we urge you to reach an amicable agreement with Greyhound  or with another potential operator such as Adirondack Trailways  to ensure future  adequate transportation services for Upstate New York          We are contacting Greyhound to ask that they reconsider their planned elimination of this route and while we hope that they will reconsider  we will do whatever we can to assist finding an alternative carrier to prevent termination of this service   In the impacted counties  reports indicate that there were about 7 200 riders over the first and second quarter of 2005   It appears that ridership is operating steadily at around 3 000 4 000 per quarter and that there remains a strong need for this service         Additionally  institutions like SUNY Potsdam utilize this service for students who need viable transportation alternatives commuting to the airport  train  and other destinations   St  Lawrence University must have access in order to market their colleges in the North Country as well   Overall  while Greyhound has made the initial decision to cancel this route  we do not believe this is fair to those living  visiting  working  and going to school along this route        We urge you and the New York State Department of Transportation to continue working with Greyhound  and other available carriers  to find an amicable resolution that will ensure continued transportation access to these areas   If your staff needs additional information please contact our offices   We thank you in advance for your attention to this important transportation issue impacting Upstate New York          Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senate       John McHugh  United States House of Representatives
