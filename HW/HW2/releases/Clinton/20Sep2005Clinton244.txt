to ship wine to other states                    New York has it all    great foods  great wines  great restaurants     said Trezise     When most people think of New York  they think of the Statue of Liberty  Broadway  or Times Square   But New York is much greater than those wonderful attractions  and it  s fun to watch people discover that fact  We applaud Senator Clinton for using New York Farm Day to raise awareness among her colleagues  the media  and others that New York State produces some of the world  s best foods and wines  which some of the world  s best chefs turn into mouth watering magic
