July 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Following Her Meeting with Secretary Chertoff Today on Homeland Security Funding for New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I am disappointed to think that we are never going to agree with Secretary Chertoff about how to allocate our nations limited Homeland Security funds   We believe that New York has never gotten its fair share  that there has been an underestimation of the risk we have to confront and we certainly made that very clear to the Secretary today      I am profoundly disappointed that the Secretary continues to ignore the homeland security needs of New York  I remain shocked at the Department of Homeland Securitys disregard for the threats the New York City region faces and am very discouraged that the Department still has not learned from its past mistakes on this critical issue     It is insulting to the New York City Region  and to all Americans  that at the very same time he is warning us about the growth of al Qaeda and a possible terrorist attack on American soil this summer  the Secretary is also disregarding the funding needs of high threat areas like New York City    We were not satisfied with the explanations that the Secretary put forth today and we are going to continue to fight for every dollar we can get because we believe that New York remains the number one terrorist target in the nation and we are going to do everything we can to protect it    I will continue to press this issue until the Secretary and the Administration finally recognize that our limited Homeland Security funds must go to the regions facing the greatest risk  I will not stop fighting for the funding that New York needs and deserves    In anticipation of her meeting with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton earlier this week called on the Secretary to explain the Departments reasoning behind the continual short changing of the New York metropolitan area when it comes to national homeland security funding   See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 278517      Recent reports indicate that the New York metropolitan area  which includes New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties  will receive  134 million from the Department of Homeland Security under its Urban Area Security Initiative grant program for 2007  which represents a 7 7  increase over the  124 million awarded in 2006  but is still nowhere near the  207 million received in 2005  Senator Clinton emphasized that New York continues to be a top terrorist target and this repeated under funding threatens New York s ability to maintain its necessary high level of vigilance   An announcement on the final amount is expected from the Department of Homeland Security shortly
