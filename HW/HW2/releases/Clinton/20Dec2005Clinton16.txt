December 20  2005 Floor Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Mr  President  last week  I came to the floor to speak against the proposed reconciliation bill  and I used the analogy of the Grinch who stole Christmas  At that time  we did not have a conference report yet before us  and I hoped that we might make some significant changes in what would be sent to us after the House acted              Unfortunately  although there were some changes  the overall impact of what has been sent to the Senate for action is disappointing and deeply disturbing  While the Grinch stole the gifts  the decorations  and even the Christmas tree  this budget slashes hope  It slashes opportunity  It slashes support that the least among us need in order to be as productive and healthy as possible  This Republican budget slashes child support enforcement  Medicaid benefits  student loans  and so much else              Now  the story of the Grinch who stole Christmas actually has a happy ending  because the Grinch  seeing the error of his ways  returned what he had taken  Unfortunately  I fear the budget before the Senate today does not have a happy ending  It represents a monumental failure by the Republicans in Congress to recognize the real priorities that the people of America  working families   students  seniors  and particularly children  need              The Republican priorities are crystal clear in this bill  The Republican majority chose  2 6 billion in new tax breaks for oil companies  I don t know how that is a priority  I don t even know how that is understandable  The oil companies could not be doing any better than they are doing  and we are still giving them more tax breaks from hard working American taxes  We still prohibit the Government from negotiating for prescription drugs to lower the cost to Medicare beneficiaries  which could save  100 billion for taxpayers  The Republicans decided not to eliminate the  5 4 billion Medicare insurance company slush fund and  instead  chose to cut home health care  hospital quality improvements  imaging services  medical equipment  and hospital payments  And as usual  with the Republican majority  they decided against cracking down on abusive corporate tax shelters such as mailbox headquarters and other loopholes              We have heard a lot of this from the eloquent  persuasive argumentation by the Democratic ranking member on the Budget Committee  the Senator from North Dakota  We have heard from others of our colleagues raising the alarm about this ill conceived budget  But one issue that has not yet been raised that I would like to highlight is that I think this bill may very well increase the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in our country              Why  you might ask  Today contraception and other family planning services are provided as a matter of course under Medicaid  We do this because it is good for women to have access to such treatments and medications  It also prevents unintended pregnancies and  therefore  prevents abortions and  therefore  saves money  For every dollar Medicaid spends on family planning   the Government saves  3  But this bill eliminates the guarantee              I don t understand this  We obviously have very strong opinions and deeply held convictions about abortion  but are we also divided about contraception and family planning   Are we not in this body committed to reducing the number of abortions              Apparently  we are not because the provision in this reconciliation budget that eliminates family planning for Medicaid recipients makes it very clear that the majority opposes contraception and family planning   which reduces unwanted pregnancies and abortions              It makes no sense to me  I thought we were working toward a bipartisan agreement that we would try to prevent unwanted pregnancies and  therefore  reduce the need for abortion  I sadly predict that if this measure stays in the bill  which apparently it is going to because we expect to vote on it in the next several hours  the number of abortions will go up  the human and financial costs will go up  and many women will really be out of luck              The other piece that is so troubling to me is young people aging out of foster care  These are young people for whom we try to provide some support services by continuing their access to Medicaid  They  too  will not have access to family planning               This is all about misplaced priorities  choices that do not serve our Nation s future and puts the burden of balancing the budget on the backs of working families   college students  seniors  single moms  and the middle class              Consider who is bearing the costs because we know there are winners and there are losers  Certainly  the winners will be oil companies  drug companies  corporate freeloaders  and deadbeat parents  That is a wonderful list of whom we are helping in this Christmas season              Despite rising medical expenses that burden middle class and low income Americans  this bill cuts  6 9 billion from Medicaid by slashing benefits and increasing costs to beneficiaries  We know there is a considerable body of research from RAND to the Urban Institute and many others that have found if you increase copays and premium costs  beneficiaries will skip needed care and may lose coverage entirely              This bill also  for some reason  has it out for college students  the very people we should encourage to get their education  to become productive citizens  to have competitive jobs in a global economy  The bill cuts over  12 7 billion from student loan programs  resulting in higher payments for 472 000 New Yorkers today and millions more in the years to come              The bill also undermines the Direct Loan Program which has been shown by every independent analysis to cost as much as 12 times less than the private loan program  So I guess we should put the banks on the list of winners along with the corporate freeloaders and the deadbeat parents and the oil companies              As millions of seniors struggle with medical bills  this bill slashes  6 4 billion from Medicare over the next 5 years  including a  1 6 billion increase in Medicare Part B premiums  making it more expensive for their seniors to visit their doctor this year instead of last              The thing I am still totally amazed by is cutting  4 9 billion in child enforcement  eliminating  343 million from foster care programs  undermining childcare for working families and TANF that rewards and enables work              I don t know  Mr  President  I guess there are different priorities between us in this Chamber  and I am disappointed in that  Given that 1 1 million more Americans fell into poverty last year  and over 37 million Americans  including 13 million children  live in poverty today  we are headed in the wrong direction              I guess the Republican majority can brag about  2 6 billion in new tax cuts for oil companies   6 9 billion in Medicaid cuts  and cuts to foster children  the most vulnerable of all of our citizens  Corporate welfare was saved  Student loans were cut  I don t know how you can  with a straight face  say that is the kind of priorities we should be having at any time but particularly in the Christmas season  But I suppose the folks who find these great big tax breaks under their tree are going to be grateful              The ultimate irony is that this bill is being called deficit reduction  We know how to do deficit reduction  We did it in the 1990s  We did it by making hard choices  We did it by making it clear that nobody was going to get off scot free  that everybody would have to pay their fair share  Tough decisions would be made on both the revenue and the spending side              This bill doesn t reduce the deficit at all  In fact  it worsens the deficit outlook by at least  30 billion  That is going to become even more clear when we come back after the first of the year and the Republicans give us  70 billion in additional tax cuts  Let s tell everybody those tax cuts are  once again  going to help people who have been helped already  quite substantially  over the last 5 years              It is not doing much for the average American  it is not doing anything for some of the poorest of Americans  other than telling them they are on their own              In a time of war  with the third largest budget shortfall in our Nation s history  when we have rising poverty again  the call for financial sacrifice by the White House and the Republican Congress falls only on families struggling to make ends meet  It falls on our children particularly  the poorest of our children  foster care children  children whose parents are not providing support for them  It doesn t fall on oil companies reaping record profits  not on the drug companies  not on the corporate freeloaders  not on the deadbeat parents              This bill is not in keeping with the spirit of this season or the priorities of the American people  I hope that we will do better next year  I hope that people will realize  as the Grinch did  that we don t need to act in a way that is playing to the lowest common denominator  that takes care of the privileged at the expense of everybody else  I do think it is fair to say that this bill is unprecedented  Never has so much been done for so few who need it so little              This is a very sad day in the Senate  I hope we can do better in the future on a bipartisan basis  and I hope that the real values of America once again are put into action in the Congress              Mr  President  I yield the floor
