May 25  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Senate Committee Approval of  33 1 million for Defense Projects to Benefit Western New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Clinton Measure also Approved to Develop Long Term Plan for Niagara Air Reserve Base   Amendment and Funding Included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill Approved by Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized defense funding for Carwell Products  DRS Electronic Warfare Network Systems  DRS EWNS   and NanoDynamics Energy  Inc  The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill   The Committee also approved key language proposed by Senator Clinton to require the Secretary of the Air Force to develop a long range plan for the Niagara Air Reserve Base while beginning to work on important new initiatives there            Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor           Our local research and development facilities are developing cutting edge technology in support of our troops but they are also critical for the local economy  As our troops continue to fight bravely overseas and to defend our nation  we know too well the importance of giving them the best equipment available  And these investments are a welcome boost as we continue to promote Western New York as a center for research and New York s rightful place at the forefront of defense development and manufacturing   Senator Clinton said          The Senator s legislative language in support of the Niagara Air Reserve Base requires the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a detailed assessment of the current aviation assets as well as a plan for future allocation of assets to House and Senate Defense Committees by the end of the year  The language mirrors an amendment proposed by Rep  Louise M  Slaughter in the House version of the bill           Two years have passed since an entire community came together to prevent the closure of Niagara Air Reserve Base   Senator Clinton said    I have worked tirelessly to ensure that this base remains an essential part of Western New York and a critical element of our military operations and now we need to focus on the base s future  We have all made a commitment to this base and the time has come for a plan that aligns the base with the needs of the military and a timeline for the allocations of aviation resources to make it possible to achieve the goals of such a plan           Funding in the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill includes       NanoDynamics Energy  Inc   Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Fuel Cell Power Source    2 million  Funding will develop a flight weight 300 Watt solid oxide fuel cell system suitable to demonstrate the viability of providing sufficient power for propulsion  sensor  and communication systems for small tactical unmanned aerial vehicles   UAVs   with a solid oxide fuel cell   The demonstration system will be fueled with propane and the development issues associated with a JP 8 version will be identified         DRS Electronic Warfare and Network Systems  DRS EWNS    Multi spectral Threat Emitter System    8 million         Funding will provide two Multi spectral Threat Emitter Systems  MTES s  with key characteristics such as mobility for  Time Critical Targeting   selectable   visual cue  radio frequency  RF   Infrared  IR   C2 Communications Architecture and Radar Cross Section  RCS  signatures stimulating multiple sensors for realistic joint force training along the East Coast Ranges   The proliferation of lethal surface to air missile  SAM  and anti aircraft artillery  AAA  threats represents a clear threat to the US warfighter   Previous funding has started a Navy implementation plan for mobile MTES capable of training aircrews at ranges and ships along the East Coast   The mobile MTES s will support a number of East Coast electronic warfare training ranges for stand alone and joint force exercises  The multi spectral aspects of MTES have the ability to stimulate multiple aircraft sensors with one electronic warfare  EW  threat simulator on the ground  An MTES therefore yields a higher return on investment for the Government and meets joint force guidelines for training characteristics       Carwell Products   USAR Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    4 million      Carwell Products   ARNG Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    4 million      Carwell Products   USMC Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    15 1 million         Over the last few years Congress has provided funding to help establish a corrosion control program for the Army and the Marines  The Army National Guard  ARNG  and the Army Reserve  USAR  would like to establish similar programs  The ARNG and USAR have critical needs for corrosion control in that their vehicles and equipment are older  they have a large number of unprotected assets and manning levels are not sufficient to provide extensive maintenance support for corrosion abatement            Additionally  the Marine Corps currently has a requirement of  36 8 million in its corrosion control program  Lack of sufficient funding in the FY 08 Budget Request prevents the Marine Corps from satisfying this requirement  Of the  36 8 million requirement   15 1 million is required to expand the Marine Corps mobile corrosion efforts  Without sufficient funding to meet corrosion control requirements  future costs to repair corrosion damaged equipment will be enormous  An effective mobile corrosion abatement program will easily provide a return on investment of 10 1   This  funding request is needed to establish and continue the operation
