March 14  2005 Senator Clinton Vows to Fight Medicaid Cuts in Budget Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today pledged to fight the  15 billion cut in Medicaid funding proposed by the Republican Congressional majority in the budget resolution to be considered by the Senate this week  The cut would hit New York especially hard  cutting Medicaid funding by almost  2 billion         While I believe wholeheartedly that we need to return to fiscal discipline and reduce the unprecedented deficits we are running  slashing Medicaid funding is not an answer to getting our fiscal house in order   said Senator Clinton   It is unacceptable to try to balance the budget on the backs of our most vulnerable Americans         Senator Clinton announced that she will be co sponsoring an amendment with Senator Gordon Smith  R OR  and Senator Jeff Bingaman  D NM  to restore the cuts and create a bipartisan commission to recommend how to improve service delivery and quality in the Medicaid program in a way that is cost effective        New York s Medicaid program provides insurance to 4 1 million New Yorkers  including 1 7 million children  1 4 million adults and 1 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries  A  2 billion cut would severely impact the services that these New Yorkers receive  For many of them  Medicaid is their last resort  The Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas particularly hard  Nearly one in four residents of rural areas is uninsured  compared to less than one in five of those living in urban areas  Nearly 16 percent of people who live in rural areas have Medicaid coverage    compared with about 10 percent of people in urban areas  Medicaid covers more than one in four children in rural areas  27 percent of children in rural areas are enrolled in Medicaid  compared with less than 19 percent of children in urban areas         We all agree that Medicaid reform is needed to help control costs and improve the efficiency of the program  but we need the right diagnosis and the right prescription for Medicaid  These slash and burn cuts aren t reform  they re a shell game   Senator Clinton said   Making drastic cuts without addressing any of the underlying issues facing the program isn t a solution to controlling costs  All the cuts will do is shift the financial burden to states which will be forced to cut people from the program and trim back critically needed benefits         Senator Clinton noted that those New Yorkers who get cut from the Medicaid rolls will still need health care  placing a burden on already stretched emergency rooms         The people of New York cannot afford to assume an even greater financial burden and I cannot stand by while this Congress puts in place arbitrary budget cuts that do irreparable harm to those who need our help the most  That s why I am going to fight this week to protect the future of our Medicaid program and start laying the groundwork for real reform
