March 1  2007 Senator Clinton Questions Administration and Military Officials About U S  Policy in Afghanistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Clinton  I really appreciate Senator Webb s line of questioning because it really illustrates the continuing difficulty we have in sorting out what it is that s happening on the ground  What I am concerned about is whether we are losing time to be able to get that figured out  I think we are really at a tipping point in Afghanistan  I felt that when I was there last month  And I hope that the Administration s commitment to new troops  the effort to get NATO more focused  the hope that we can strengthen the Karzai government  all has to happen simultaneously in order to take on these challenges  Whether it be a new offensive this spring or the growing strength of the drug lords            I wanted to switch gears for a minute though because there are many things that have been spoken about that are very clearly difficult for America to influence  But I want to talk about force protection for our forces and their quality of life because we are putting more in  number one  and number two  I think we all believe the violence will increase  Whether we will see an explosion of violence that brings other elements of the Afghan society into it  as we saw after the bombing of the mosque in Samara  I don t know  But clearly  with the up tick in suicide bombers and some of the other activities that we are seeing there is going to be a big push to escalate the violence           Earlier this month the 82nd Airborne Division assumed responsibility for the combat mission from the 10th Mountain Division  which is based at Fort Drum in upstate New York  As subordinate units from the 82nd moved into position  10th Mountain Division 3rd Brigade combat teams were displaced to Jalalabad  And what we re getting in reports back to Fort Drum  in fact a February 26 Fort Drum news release highlights the issue I want to discuss with you  There is a Sergeant First Class who is quoted by saying the amount of people on the FOB and the amount of billeting didn t coincide  In other words  soldiers were living in a variety of very difficult and challenging living conditions           My concern is that with a build up in offensive capability coming from Pakistan and other areas within Afghanistan  whether we re also leaving our troops more exposed than they need to be  particularly in these forward operating bases  it is disconcerting to extend a brigade by four months  which is what we did with the 10th Mountain Division and make further demands  if we don t have some adequate planning and execution for their logistical needs  We are getting reports that we don t have enough bunkers  force protection barriers  check point security systems  artillery radar systems  UAVs and other critical equipment for expanding the mission as I think the majority  certainly speaking for myself  agree we must do  The deficiencies in the GAO report highlighted equipment shortages in the CENTCOM areas of operations  I have referred to that earlier in hearings focused on Iraq because that was a constant source of complaint on my recent trip and in my discussions with a lot of the soldiers and Marines who have returned from their deployments           So I think that it would be incumbent upon you General and others to make sure we don t have shortages in resources as we are adding more American troops  And that we have the services and logistics for the arriving troops  And again  I see this as an issue of force protections primarily          What I wanted to ask about is an article in today s New York Times that NATO and American forces knew there was a suicide bomber in the Bagram area before the suicide bomb attack that killed 23 at the main gate  Probably all of us have been at Bagram and we know the security checkpoints one goes through  We know  obviously that the Vice President was there and that the timing of the suicide attack  some have said  at least contributed to the sell off in the stock market  Whether it did that or not  it was a serious and concerning incident   Apparently  according to this article  the Afghan police chief in the area said he had not been informed of the possible threat  I would like to ask the General first and then the Ambassador  Is there a reason why the Afghan police forces would not have been notified  And what mechanisms exist for coordinating with Afghan forces when intelligence threats are received  How would you analyze what happened or what went wrong here       General Lute   Well Senator  I m aware of the same reports today that you refer to   It is not usual that specific threats would not be coordinated with all elements that could address them  to include the Afghan police   I do know that there are force protection mechanisms in place around Bagram and every place else that we have Americans stationed that feature close coordination with local officials   So this caught me a bit short as well and I really can t explain it today until I have some time to look into it  The other point though I d make  is that  without crossing into the classified realm  is that with a suicide bomber roughly every third day last year in Afghanistan  so over 100 suicide bombers last year  most of them acted without any specific indications in terms of time and place   So  while there may well have been a report  it was probably not specific in terms of time and location   And of course that doesn t lead us far in terms of what we might do by way of prevention         Senator Clinton   I think it would be useful General  to perhaps submit some additional information to the committee after you have conducted further inquiry       General Lute   Fair enough  Will do so       Senator Clinton  Ambassador  do you have anything to add        Ambassador Edelman  No  I really don t  Senator Clinton  I saw the same story in the Times today  but like General Lute  I didn t have any awareness that there had been a specific intelligence report  So we ll check into it and get back to you        Senator Clinton   Let me also ask that with the changes in command that have occurred recently with General McNeil  the overall Senior NATO Commander  with our Ambassador in Afghanistan  scheduled to leave  with our Ambassador in Pakistan leaving  I think we re really going to regret the disruption of all these relationships  I ve suggested to the White House that they at least try to get some permanent presence with a high level Presidential envoy to move back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan   There s so much disagreement and misunderstanding  as well as different perspectives about what should be in the interest of both of these leaders and their countries   But I m just worried that what we re seeing as an unraveling situation that will accelerate because there is no  there s nobody there who has any on going relationship base            And I m also concerned about the command changes and adjustments about lines of authority in Afghanistan  and again General  maybe you could get back to us on this   Who authorizes targets to be bombed   Who gets priority for Medivac assets  Who gets priority for artillery support or receives logistics and what priority  What rules of engagement are now actually in effect   We ve had these problems with NATO countries sending in troops but having different rules of engagement   Where does that stand now and who sorts out all of the potential disagreements among the various troops        General Lute   Senator  the 32 000 troops  to include 15 000 Americans that are part of the NATO structure  so ISAF   are under one set of rules of engagement  They re approved by the North Atlantic Council  General Jones is the resident expert in this room in terms of the specifics  but all those troops operate under the same rules  What distinguishes some national contributions inside that structure from others is that some are assigned missions that don t take them into the combat realm  So there are some forces inside that 32 000 NATO force structure that conduct PRT  Prevention Reconstruction Team missions  and not combat operations  But they  none the less  operate under the same ROE   As for all your  the list of different forms of support  casualty evacuation  close air support  logistic and so forth  those are all today coordinated by four star NATO Commander  who happens today to be a U S  Commander  General Dan McNeil out of Kabul         Senator Clinton    Just one final follow up   Are they the same rules of engagement that we had in Iraq prior to this latest escalation       General Lute    They re not precisely the same  but they re very close       Senator Clinton    There were many complaints about the rules of engagement  at least for our forces in Iraq and they ve been changed because of the escalation   But I d like to know what the differences are       General Lute    The key difference in Baghdad I think   is the place in particular that you are citing  was that before this recent change in azimuth  in Iraq  there were political constraints on locations inside Baghdad and some political party affiliations inside Baghdad  which prohibited  or at least inhibited our operations against them   Those have been removed and we don t suffer that same problem in Afghanistan       Senator Clinton    Thank you       Ambassador Edelman   Senator Clinton  if I might also address some of the understandable concerns I think you raised about continuity with some of the changes  I think there are some mitigating factors  One is that General McNeil  of course  is going back for a second tour in Afghanistan  So although he is new to his current job and responsibilities  he does have a familiarity with the key players like President Karzai and others  And I think General Freakley is there for some period of time in a U S  duel hatted Deputy  So there are some  I think  mitigating circumstances there               Read more about Senator Clinton s visit to Afghanistan
