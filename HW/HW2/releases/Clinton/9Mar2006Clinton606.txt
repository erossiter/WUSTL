                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   New York Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton  and Long Island Representative Tim Bishop  called on Federal Energy Regulatory Chairman Joseph Kelliher to recuse himself from all matters related to Broadwater Energy  a controversial liquefied natural gas  LNG  proposal to be sited in the Long Island Sound  on the basis of Kelliher s past employment with LeBoeuf  Lamb  Greene   MacRae   Broadwater Energy has retained LeBoeuf  Lamb  Greene   MacRae as Counsel for Broadwater s application before the FERC   Although Senators Schumer  Clinton and Represenative Bishop make no claim of impropriety  they request the Chairman s recusal to avoid the appearance of any possible conflict of interest         The significance of the impact that Broadwater would have on the safety and environment of the Long Island Sound cannot be understated and the people of Long Island need to know that there is not even a chance that other considerations may be involved in FERC s decision making process   Schumer said   To avoid even the appearance of a conflict on this important decision  I think recusing himself from any decisions related to Broadwater is the wisest course of action for Chairman Kelliher  It is vital that the public have confidence in the decisions rendered by federal agencies           The Broadwater project has enormous implications for the future of Long Island Sound  and the FERC review should be free of any appearance of a conflict of interest  I hope that the Chairman will recuse himself from this decision   stated Clinton          It is imperative that we ensure that the process of siting a nearly quarter mile long floating terminal in an environmentally sensitive area be as free as possible of any potential conflict   Bishop stated   Although I commend Mr  Kelliher s service to the FERC  I want to make sure that the public s interest is served  not the special interests         Chairman
