                Funds Included in Department of Defense Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate has approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report which includes  18 4 million in defense funding for Western New York    The bill  having been approved by both chambers of Congress  will now be sent to the President for his signature    This is terrific news for Western New York and a vital step in the appropriations process  said Senator Schumer  These critical funds will help us ensure that in defending our nation  we are equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our nations defense forces and the Western New York economy  I will urge the president to sign this bill immediately    The Senates approval of this bill is wonderful news for Western New York  and it is the next step in ensuring that these key projects receive this important funding  As these local companies and institutions continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  Not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in Western New Yorks local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said    The  18 4 million for Western New York in the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes   Nanodynamics Energy  Inc   Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Fuel Cell Power Source    2 Million   Funding will develop a flight weight 300 Watt solid oxide fuel cell system suitable to demonstrate the viability of providing sufficient power for propulsion  sensor  and communication systems for small tactical unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs  with a solid oxide fuel cell   The demonstration system will be fueled with propane and the development issues associated with a JP 8 version will be identified   DRS  Unmanned Threat Emitter  UMTE  Modernization    2 4 Million   This project will upgrade four  4  Unmanned Threat Emitter  UMTE  systems located at one of the key ranges at the Nellis Test and Training Range  NTTR   Range 62 63  The upgrade of the UMTE systems takes advantage of mature electronic warfare threat simulation technology and will result in more realistic training  increased aircrew survivability while providing substantial operations and maintenance savings    Calspan Corporation  Military Aircraft Loss of Control Training Research    1 Million   Funding will be used to collect data from military trained pilots  analyze the data  and allow the Navy and military flying community to determine the value of Upset Recovery Training and the operational value and risk attached if this training is not provided    Current data collected underscores the inherent danger of pilots flying without this training and the drastic difference in situational awareness and ability to recover an aircraft that would otherwise crash   Once this data is collected  analyzed  and the value of the training is determined and understood  the broader ultimate purpose of this training activity is to teach military pilots in non fighter aircraft  transport  utility and patrol aircraft  for instance  how to evaluate a never before seen situation and maneuver the aircraft back to a safe and stable condition  In the end  the goal is to combine expanded situational awareness  knowledge  and judgment with the requisite stick and rudder skill sets to successfully master the many flying challenges faced over a career of military operational flying   Hauptman Woodward  Virus Mutation and Virus Transfer from Humans to Animals    3 Million   The long term goal of this project is to develop tests  vaccines and broad spectrum antivirals to deal with global pandemic threats  which hit vulnerable populations such as those found in military settings and densely populated communities   Historically  pandemics have most severely devastated people in compact living conditions such as in the Army  Navy  Air Force and Marine Corps   The project will enable the understanding of how mutations occur and how viruses may be transmitted from animals to humans  and the application of knowledge to rapidly develop tests  vaccines and antibiotics when new viruses threaten our military and civilian populations    Carleton Technologies  Inc   Microclimate Cooling Unit  MCU     1 Million   Funding would procure and install approximately 1100 autonomous  modularly adaptable Microclimate Cooling Units  MCUs  in tactical vehicles   The increased use of armor  both personal and vehicle mounted  coupled with the desert heat in the Middle East has resulted in a critical need for personal cooling to ensure performance and associated mission success   The Army has attempted to mitigate this problem by cooling the vehicle cabin with an add on air conditioning system   These vehicle mounted air conditioning systems have had minimal impact because armor and other field gear that soldiers wear prevents the body from being cooled   Army helicopter crew members encountered this same problem in dissipating body heat  however  this thermal stress problem was mitigated by wearing an undergarment through which a chilled fluid is pumped by a small  lightweight power efficient vapor compression based cooling unit   The MCU has been tested and proven effective in Bradley  Stryker  and HUMMWV applications   Carwell Products  U S  Marine Corps Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    1 8 Million   The Marine Corps currently has a requirement of  36 8 million in its corrosion control program   Of the  36 8 million requirement   15 1 million is required to expand the Marine Corps mobile corrosion efforts  Without additional funding to meet corrosion control requirements  future costs to repair corrosion damaged equipment could be enormous  This  funding is needed to establish and continue the operation of Mobile Corrosion Service Teams  CST  at  each of the three Marine Expeditionary Forces  MEF  and Support Commands located at  Camp Lejeune  NC  Camp Pendleton  CA  Camp Kinser  Okinawa  Japan  Camp Smith  Kaneohe  HI  Blount Island  FL  and Albany  Ga    Carwell Products  U S  Army Reserve Mobile Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    1 8 Million   Over the last few years Congress has provided funding to help establish a corrosion control program for the Army and the Marines  The US Army Reserve  USAR  would like to establish a similar program  The USAR has a critical need for corrosion control in that the Reserves vehicles and equipment is older  they have fewer Controlled Humidity Units  CHU   and they are currently manned at 62 percent of their required force   This adversely impacts the USARs ability to support a proper vehicle maintenance program   Carwell Products  U S  Army National Guard Corrosion Prevention and Abatement Program    1 8 Million   Over the last few years Congress has provided funding to help establish a corrosion control program for the Army and the Marines  The Army National Guard  ARNG  would like to establish a similar program  The ARNG has a critical need for corrosion control  in that  the Guards vehicles and equipment is older  they have a large number of unprotected assets and manning levels are not sufficient to provide extensive maintenance support for corrosion abatement   This adversely impacts the Guards ability to support a proper vehicle maintenance program   Janya  Multilingual Text Mining Platform    1 Million   Funding will be used to develop  field test and deploy the next generation of technologies for extracting useful information from unstructured text  such as open source news  email and message traffic  The developed platform will support DoD intelligence applications where the current technology is insufficient  providing multilingual multi source intelligence to analysts and warfighters in both tactical and strategic situations  increasing their effective bandwidth when processing intelligence information   CUBRC  Defense Against Viral Infection  DAVI     1 6 Million   Funding will support the application of scientific research that could result in the development of a new generation of anti viral drugs for the treatment of new and emerging viral threats for which current medical counter measures are inadequate or non existent   This effort seeks to identify small druggable molecules that will be effective against all strains of a given virus  be less susceptible to drug resistance and achieve this faster and at lower cost than the currently accepted drug development models   Success will permit rapid treatment of all members of the Influenza virus family  thereby mitigating the damage to national security which will result from a diminution in military manpower effectiveness sustained in an Influenza pandemic   The high transmissibility of Influenza could lead to significant morbidity and mortality and the crippling of critical national security functions through degradation of defense capability    Prestolite Electric  No Idle System  NIS     1 Million   Funding will be used to develop and demonstrate a market ready capability for enabling military vehicles to operate all electrical systems without running the engine  This capability will help to improve crew survivability  The No Idle System will be a Dual Use program for both military and commercial vehicles as this same technology and resulting system will have direct application to commercial Class 8 Trucks enabling them to meet the anticipated No Idle Federal Legislation
