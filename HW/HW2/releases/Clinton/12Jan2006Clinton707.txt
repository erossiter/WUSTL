                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Highlights Difficulties Faced by New Yorkers in Transition to New Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Bush Administration to fix problems that have plagued implementation of the new Medicare Prescription Drug program  Medicare Part D    In a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  at the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  Senator Clinton underscored that her office has been deluged with complaints and questions from frustrated and confused beneficiaries  pharmacists and other providers struggling in this transition   Senator Clinton outlined the complaints she is hearing from New Yorkers  including patients not being able to obtain critical medications due to inadequately staffed telephone help lines  difficulty obtaining accurate beneficiary information and problems with the computer system established to confirm beneficiary eligibility                  Your agency has advised patience as you work to resolve these concerns   My constituents have been patient  but these problems continue to mount   Now they deserve to see leadership and action toward solving these predicted problems     Senator Clinton wrote         Senator Clinton has been a vocal advocate for the need to ensure that Medicare recipients receive the assistance they need and deserve in the transition to the new Medicare prescription drug program   Senator Clinton has released a resource guide to prescription drug coverage under Medicare  available in English and Spanish  to help New Yorkers navigate this transition   The guide has been distributed to more than 65 000 New Yorkers and is posted on Senator Clinton  s website at www clinton senate gov          In December  Senator Clinton introduced legislation to help the most vulnerable beneficiaries  those who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid  make a smooth transition from Medicaid prescription drug coverage to the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program  Seniors and disabled Americans who are dually eligible for both programs stopped receiving prescription drugs through Medicaid automatically on January 1 and local pharmacists are bearing the brunt of responsibility for aiding and advising these recipients during the transition of their coverage from Medicaid to the new Medicare Part D benefit  Senator Clinton  s bill  the Medicare Dual Eligible Identification and Enrollment Facilitation Act  would require outreach and education to pharmacies on dually eligible beneficiaries and waive the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting these beneficiaries   Senator Clinton is also a co sponsor of legislation that would extend amount of time seniors have to enroll in the program         The text of Senator Clinton  s letter follows          The Honorable Mark McClellan  Ph D    Commissioner  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20201         Dear Dr  McClellan          As Medicare Part D implementation enters its second week  the problems facing Medicare beneficiaries  pharmacists and other providers continue to mount   I have been inundated with complaints and questions from concerned and confused New Yorkers who are unable to get the help they need to obtain the medications they depend on to stay healthy   Everywhere I go  I am deluged by heart breaking stories of beneficiaries suffering life threatening consequences as a result of being cut off from needed medications and providers struggling to help them in a system that is impossible for health care professionals to navigate  Since I wrote you last week urging you to act immediately to fix the problems plaguing the new program  your agency has failed to respond adequately to the scope of the problems we are facing   I am writing today to highlight some of the scores of complaints my office has received to underscore the urgent need for action       Help lines are Inaccessible      Call centers of the private plans are still not adequately staffed to address the high numbers of inquiries coming in from both patients and beneficiaries   I understand that in a January 4  2006 letter  Cynthia Tudor  the Acting Director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  Medicare Drug Benefit group  asked participating plans to both increase capacity on help lines and establish a technical assistance number to support calls without multiple transfers   Yet despite this request  problems persist   For example              A pharmacist in Orange County reports that one plan  s help desk is not accessible at all  even though this plan has been contacted repeatedly since January 1   Patient advocates have also indicated that they are having trouble reaching this plan   Some plans are also telling callers to contact them at a later date   Pharmacists who called one plan on  January 4 were told to call back on January 7            Another pharmacist in New York City reports that on January 6  he repeatedly tried to contact a plan from mid afternoon until evening  and was only able to reach a recording advising him to try his call again later         Although many of these help desk calls are attempting to confirm enrollment  providers and pharmacists are also reporting that they are having trouble responding to requests for prior authorization from private insurance plans  resulting in delays in medically necessary drugs           There are also widespread problems with the CMS telephone help line   Advocates in Queens report that the CMS hotline has been busy throughout January  with hold times of more than an hour  hampering their ability to assist their senior clients with their questions about the Part D benefit  I am particularly concerned because your agency has advised pharmacists that this hotline is appropriate for use in emergency situations  as a way to help access the services of a regional office           It is imperative that CMS perform an immediate review of the help desk operations of private plans and require  not simply request  plans to allocate additional resources to call centers to meet the needs of beneficiaries and pharmacists   CMS must also adjust its own call center operations to ensure beneficiaries and their advocates get the help they need and deserve during this transition       Incorrect Information is Being Provided to Callers      Individuals that are able to get through to representatives on the telephone help lines set up by both CMS and private plans are frequently receiving incorrect information about their coverage  resulting in delays or denials of prescriptions   For example             A dual eligible patient in the Bronx filled two prescriptions   For one  she was billed the  1 3 copayment expected for those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid  who as you know are the poorest and most vulnerable recipients   For the other  her plan charged a  28 copayment   When she called Medicare to inquire about the cost  she was told that the increased copayment was due to the fact that her pharmacist  who filled both prescriptions  was not certified by her plan   The pharmacist confirmed his registration with the plan   After this  the beneficiary called Medicare again  and was told that the confusion was the problem of the private plan   The private plan  when contacted on  January 5  said they would contact the pharmacy and let them know when to rebill at the correct price   They had not contacted the pharmacy by January 9         A dual eligible patient in Westchester was charged a  230 copayment  and was told by his plan that it would take 30 days to sort out the billing issues   In order to access medication during that time  the  230 copayment must be paid   The patient is currently trying to obtain the money to get this medication while advocates help to resolve this case         One dual eligible patient in New York was told by their plan that if no prior authorization was obtained  the patient would have to pay  69 95 for the medication at the point of service   The patient left the pharmacy without the medication           For millions of Medicare recipients  including those who are residents of a long term care facility  navigating the system to resolve enrollment issues is impossible   As a result  beneficiaries are paying increased copayments  going without medications  and otherwise not receiving the benefits that were supposed to result from Part D   I have heard reports that patients are now being hospitalized because they cannot access the drugs they need           The situation is particularly acute within the mental health community  where patients who are stabilized on medications must fight to remain on those medications  instead of being forced to switch to medications to meet the requirements of their private plan   As a result  my office has heard reports that patients are forgoing the drugs that keep them healthy and productive           Many of these issues would be mitigated if transition plans  through which patients are supposed to be able to access short term supplies of drugs while these issues are being sorted out  were operating as designed   Unfortunately  the individuals at your agency staffing the hotline    the people who are charged with giving correct information to beneficiaries    in some cases do not even know that these transition plans exist           Plans and pharmacists must be given immediate guidance on how to implement transition plans  rather than information on how the program is  in theory  supposed to work           I would ask that your agency immediately establish an office outside of your already existing appeals process to focus solely on ensuring that beneficiaries who are denied coverage or are charged exorbitant copayments receive adequate attention and redress from CMS        Medicare  s Computer System and Website Experience Frequent Failures      The computer system established by your agency to provide a way for pharmacists to confirm enrollment for beneficiaries is failing to provide the information needed to fill prescriptions  There have also been problems with using the CMS website to confirm enrollment   For example             A pharmacist from Long Island reports that queries are returning other information such as the bin numbers or the telephone numbers for a private plan  rather than the ID numbers for specific patients  and this complaint has been echoed by other providers across the state   Without the correct ID number  patient claims are denied by plans  and patients cannot get their medication at the correct price         Last year  advocates in Westchester County used your website when working with senior clients to confirm enrollment in Part D  as well as determine what other plans might provide coverage to them   But when they tried to use this resource in January to help seniors determine their enrollment status  the website was down           I would urge you to resolve these database and website issues  and develop alternate methods of helping pharmacists and patient advocates resolve eligibility questions   If staffed adequately  the pharmacist only hotline CMS has established is a step in the right direction  and I urge you to establish similar resources for beneficiaries and patient advocates           I will continue to monitor problems New Yorkers are facing in the implementation of the new benefit and share with you and your staff the concerns of beneficiaries  their families  and their health care providers in New York   If you need more information about the cases noted in this letter  please contact my office  and we will work with you to help resolve them          Your agency has advised patience as you work to resolve these concerns   My constituents have been patient  but these problems continue to mount   Now they deserve to see leadership and action toward solving these predicted problems          Sincerely yours           Hillary Rodham Clinton
