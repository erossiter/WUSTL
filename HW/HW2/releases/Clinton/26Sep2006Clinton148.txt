September 26  2006 Schumer  Clinton Announce Congressional Panel Backs  10 55 Million for Greater Rochester Region Defense Projects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York Economy and National Security Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report filed late yesterday included  10 55 million for military projects in the Greater Rochester Finger Lakes Region  The House and Senate must approve the bill before being sent to the President and signed into law            This is great news for Greater Rochester   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Greater Rochester Region and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Rochester Region defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             This is wonderful news for the Greater Rochester Region  This is cutting edge defense technology being made locally  supporting our men and women in uniform and our national security  These are important investments in local companies and research institutions that will in turn help the economy as well  I look forward to their final approval by the Senate     Senator Clinton said          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          General Motors    Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion    1 95 million    This funding will help General Motors expand on current demonstrations of the latest generation of hydrogen fuel cell technology in an SUV style  with further enhanced fuel cell technology providing significantly improved capabilities and performance in a commercially based non tactical SUV style vehicle  The fuel cell SUV vehicle delivery is planned for 3rd quarter 2007 with operations through 1st quarter 2010        Icuiti    Wearable Hyperspectral Imaging    1 million     This funding will be used to help to complete the development of a Wearable Hyperspectral Imaging System  Hyperspectral Imaging  HSI  is imaging of a scene over a large number of selectable  discrete  contiguous spectral bands such that a complete reflectance spectrum can be obtained for the region being imaged  By turning a dial  the imager can quickly see though several different light spectrums  giving the user a significant advantage at night or even in seeing through smoke or fog  Currently  HSI systems are in use on vehicles and some larger unmanned vehicles  Icuiti  s systems would provide this significant capability to dismounted soldiers or smaller squad based teams for the first time        Rochester Institute of Technology   Defense Sustainment and Modernization Initiative    2 7 million     The objective of this research program is to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems  The Department of Defense  DOD   while developing new systems that will enable a leap ahead or transformation in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems  The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the staggering replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems  This research program provides DOD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles  Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems        Infotonics Technology Center    1 million     The Infotonics Technology Center is a collaboration to accelerate research and technology commercialization and transfer and industry development in photonics and micro systems  Dozens of companies involved in photonics and micro systems are working with a number of research universities in New York State to develop a comprehensive approach to solving problems facing the photonics and micro systems industries and make them more competitive internationally  Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems of the military  Funding under this request will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies  Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications  Funding under this request would support research into photonics and micro systems applications to measurement and control systems  automotive aerospace systems  information and communications systems  and power technologies        Impact Technologies   Intelligent Engine Technology Development    1 4 Million    The project will develop and deploy automated high performance turbine engine control and monitoring system   Additionally  the proposed technology contributes directly to the US Air Force  s goal of minimizing the maintenance and upkeep costs  and will improve reliability and operational readiness of the vehicle fleet   Current procedures to detect and predict component and system failures of advance turbine engines are both labor intensive and accurate   As a result  many preventable system failures are not caught and readiness  safety and equipment are compromised       ITT Space Systems Division   Tactical Airborne Communications Node  TACNODE     1 Million    The Tactical Airborne Communications Node  TACNODE  program  initiated by the Air Force in FY 05 as the Tactical Objective Airborne Gateway program  is designed to link communications systems   TACNODE will develop a dedicated unmanned tactical airborne platform to function as a flexible communications node to be deployed in a variety of tactical scenarios that will extend the communications range into high threat areas while enabling high value command and control centers to remain back in safer territory       Rome Labs ITT Space Systems    MASINT Warfighter Tools    1 5 million     This funding for Air Force Research Laboratory  AFRL  Rome Research Labs and ITT Space Systems Division will help them to further their Measurement and Signals Intelligence  MASINT  project  MASINT offers huge benefits in identifying obscured and hidden targets  but the near term challenge is to integrate MASINT into existing and future information processing systems in a way that enables users to manage and display the information in time to take action  MASINT gathers measurements from unintentional radiation  effluent and debris sampling  acoustic signals  non visible imaging and other sources and then subjects that data to specialized processing in order to transform it into actionable intelligence for both national command and tactical users  This funding would allow the AFRL Rome Research Site to build upon the initial success of the MASINT Visualization Tools Program and allow an expansion into newer  less mature techniques such as hyperspectral  acoustic and overhead non imaging infrared  It will also expedite the integration of MASINT into the information architectures of other national security agencies
