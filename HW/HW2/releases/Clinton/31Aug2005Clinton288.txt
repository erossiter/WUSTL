August 31  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on New Poverty Statistics from the US Census Bureau                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    Today  s news from the Census Bureau on the rising rate of poverty in our nation is a sad reflection of this Administration  s failed economic policy   Indeed  one of the more troubling aspects of this new report is the fact that in 2004  the third full year of the   economic recovery     from the recession of 2001  there were 4 1 million more Americans living in poverty           This troubling data on poverty comes at the same time as new Census Bureau data stating that the number of Americans with health insurance coverage increased by 2 million from 2003 to 2004  largely due to expansions in the Medicaid program   In times of economic downturn and increased poverty  the Medicaid program is a critical source of coverage  helping children and working families to access health care benefits that fewer employers are able to provide   Since 2000  over 5 million Americans have joined the ranks of the uninsured          What is discouraging and ironic is that despite these figures  the Republican leadership in Congress is currently considering severe cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid  Medicare  food stamps  and child nutrition programs that are literally a life line to those living in poverty    In particular  enacting any proposals that slash Medicaid benefits will result in millions more becoming uninsured  It is unconscionable for the Administration to balance the budget on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens            At the same time  the Administration is also considering repealing the federal estate tax which will benefit the wealthiest estates in the nation while adding over  1 trillion to the deficit and making the resources for those critical safety net programs even scarcer   It  s clear that the consequences of these proposals will be borne by the growing number of low income families who live every day in poverty  including 2 6 million New Yorkers               As the gulf deepens between the poor and the rich and more working families struggle each day to make ends meet  it will take courage and recognition from the Congressional leadership and the Administration that we all have a moral obligation to ensure that this nation  s economic polices work to uplift and empower all Americans  not just the wealthy
