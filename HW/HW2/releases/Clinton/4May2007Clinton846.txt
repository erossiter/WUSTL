May 4  2007 Senator Clinton Urges Administration to Strengthen Food Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Calls for Stricter Testing and Monitoring of Imported Food and Feed Materials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today urged the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to account for their apparent failures to test  track and monitor food and feed materials coming from overseas and called on them to develop and implement a national food safety strategy  In a letter to the heads of the FDA and the USDA  Senator Clinton called for a comprehensive and integrated monitoring and regulation plan to ensure the safety of the nation s food supply           This Administration is clearly failing all of us when it comes to food safety   Senator Clinton said   There are countless problems with our current monitoring program including outdated practices  internal fragmentation and inadequate resources that have resulted in a situation where we simply do not know what kind of food or feed material is coming in from overseas and what kind of risks it poses to our livestock and our safety  It is tragic that we have seen again and again how vulnerable our nation s food supplies are without proper regulation and inspection and yet we haven t learned any lessons from our past mistakes  I am extremely concerned about the recent instances of food contamination and I strongly urge the FDA and the USDA to create a proper food safety program  especially when it comes to imported food and feed materials           Recent illnesses involving E  coli in spinach and lettuce  the discovery of Salmonella in peanut butter  and the importation of unsafe pet food ingredients from China illustrate the continued vulnerability of the American food supply and the failure of FDA s food safety program to protect consumers   In the latest case  a chemical used in plastic manufacturing was placed in feed material from China           FDA is severely hampered by obsolete statutes enacted in 1938 that keep it stuck in a reactive mode rather than working to prevent food safety problems as well as declining and completely inadequate resources that result in limited inspections and little capacity to discover and implement preventive solutions to food safety problems          Senator Clinton supports strengthening the nation s food safety program by initiating a plan that modernizes food safety laws to give FDA a clear mandate to prevent food safety problems  ensures substantial and stable food safety funding for FDA through an establishment registration fee on food manufacturers  processors and storage facilities  and integrates the efforts of the FDA  CDC  USDA and state and local food safety agencies  The Senator also supports restructuring FDA to unify and elevate its food safety program under a senior  empowered and accountable leader reporting directly to the Secretary of HHS as well as empowering FDA to elevate food safety standards                     The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary   United States Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20250      The Honorable Andrew C  von Eschenbach  M D   Commissioner  United States Food and Drug Administration  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  Maryland  20857      Dear Mr  Secretary and Dr  von Eschenbach       I am deeply concerned  as are many Americans  by gaping holes in monitoring practices when it comes to our nation s food supply  especially imported food and feed materials          In the most recent incident  a component found in animal feed  imported from China and tainted with melamine  has resulted in an unknown number of pet deaths and still has the potential to threaten humans   This episode is the latest in a series of incidents involving executive branch agencies and the nation s food supply   Recent illnesses involving E  coli in spinach and lettuce and the discovery of salmonella in peanut butter also illustrate the continued vulnerability of the American food supply and the failure of the Federal Drug Administration s  FDA  food safety program to protect the American people            I am particularly concerned by the regularity with which the FDA and United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  test and track food and feed materials from foreign countries   It appears that food and feed products entering our country are not checked  tested or monitored to nearly the same degree as domestic products          With respect to melamine tainting  the FDA has admitted being unable to ascertain how long the United States has imported food and feed materials from China with melamine or other chemicals not meant for consumption   In fact  the USDA also cannot tell us the degree to which the contaminated feed has entered the food chain through livestock consumption   The fact that it has taken more than a month to uncover even the most basic facts about the melamine tainting  including where the tainted products have been consumed  is troubling           On top of the direct threat to human health  this contamination also threatens our agricultural industries   It is unconscionable that America does not have proper mechanisms in place to adequately test and track food and feed materials from overseas   I am deeply concerned that our federal officials still can not verify the risk to humans   We saw the frightening impact on both consumers and farmers with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE  or  Mad Cow  disease   Yet we seem to have learned little from that experience   Our agencies need to become a proactive force rather than a reactive one when it comes to preventing food safety problems          I have joined my colleagues in requesting that your agencies form a joint task force and develop recommendations on how to effectively address the problem of food borne illnesses   I am pleased to learn that the FDA has taken a step in the right direction by creating the position of Commissioner for Food Protection            Specifically  I would also like information on          1   What procedures you plan to put in place to test food and feed products coming in from overseas  especially countries with lax food safety standards          2   How you can improve the monitoring and tracking of products once they enter into the United States  and         3   How you will alert the public to these problems in the future          We must ensure that we have adequate testing  tracking and monitoring mechanisms in place to ensure the health of our livestock  our farmers and our consumers nationwide  Our citizens need and deserve to have confidence in their food supply          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
