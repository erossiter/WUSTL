May 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Internet Video of Apparent Honor Killing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Internet video circulating this week showing the stoning death of a young Iraqi woman in an apparent honor killing is deplorable  I am saddened and shocked not only by this needless death  but also by the fact that this loss of life was recorded with no intervention by any of the onlookers observing or recording the event            This tragic act of violence is just one of many faced by women around the world every day  and the silent epidemic of gender based violence is far too pervasive in every country around the world  According to a 2005 study by the World Health Organization  more than 50 percent of women in several of the countries surveyed reported experiencing physical or sexual abuse at the hands of their partners  We have a moral duty to speak out against such forms of violence  and bring those who perpetrate them to justice           Honor killings are never justified or acceptable  and I believe we cannot stand idly by   like those who watched this young woman die    while such violent acts are perpetuated against girls and women around the world  As First Lady and Senator from New York  I have worked to ensure that women are safe from all forms of violence and exploitation  such as human trafficking and domestic violence  and I pledge to continue working with my colleagues in Congress to improve the safety of women around the world  and end the practice of honor killings and other forms of gender based violence
