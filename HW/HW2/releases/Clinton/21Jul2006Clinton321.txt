July 21  2006 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approval of  11 Million in Defense Funding for the Greater Rochester Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Funds included in Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill Washington  DC    Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval late yesterday by the Senate Appropriations Committee of the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill  which includes  11 million for the Greater Rochester region          The bill will now proceed to the Senate floor for consideration   Following consideration and passage on the Senate floor  the bill will head into a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between the two bills  Following conference  the bill will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which it will be sent to the President for his signature           This is great news for the Rochester region   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Rochester region and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Rochester region defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             As our men and women in uniform continue to fight bravely overseas  these New York companies are helping to support them with the best equipment and technology available  This funding is a tremendous boost to these local companies who are on the cutting edge of research and development and are also local employers  contributing to our regional economy  As we look to develop the state  s future as a center for research and results  these are the kinds of investments that we need to continue making     Senator Clinton said          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          General Motors    Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion    3 million    This funding will help General Motors expand on current demonstrations of the latest generation of hydrogen fuel cell technology in an SUV style  with further enhanced fuel cell technology providing significantly improved capabilities and performance in a commercially based non tactical SUV style vehicle  The fuel cell SUV vehicle delivery is planned for 3rd quarter 2007 with operations through 1st quarter 2010       Icuiti    Wearable Hyperspectral Imaging    2 million    This funding will be used to help to complete the development of a Wearable Hyperspectral Imaging System   Hyperspectral Imaging  HSI  is imaging of a scene over a large number of selectable  discrete  contiguous spectral bands such that a complete reflectance spectrum can be obtained for the region being imaged   By turning a dial  the imager can quickly see though several different light spectrums  giving the user a significant advantage at night or even in seeing through smoke or fog   Currently  HSI systems are in use on vehicles and some larger unmanned vehicles   Icuiti  s systems would provide this significant capability to dismounted soldiers or smaller squad based teams for the first time       Rochester Institute of Technology   Defense Sustainment and Modernization Initiative    4 million    The objective of this research program is to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems  The Department of Defense  DOD   while developing new systems that will enable a leap ahead or transformation in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems  The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the staggering replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems  This research program provides DOD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles  Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems         Infotonics Technology Center    2 million    The Infotonics Technology Center is a collaboration to accelerate research and technology commercialization and transfer and industry development in photonics and micro systems   Dozens of companies involved in photonics and micro systems are working with a number of research universities in New York State to develop a comprehensive approach to solving problems facing the photonics and micro systems industries and make them more competitive internationally   Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems of the military   Funding under this request will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies   Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications   Funding under this request would support research into photonics and micro systems applications to measurement and control systems  automotive aerospace systems  information and communications systems  and power technologies
