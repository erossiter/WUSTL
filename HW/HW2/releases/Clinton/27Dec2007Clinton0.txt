                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bill Signed Into Law Wednesday By President Bush    br   Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illnesses  with Numbers Rising   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Students  and Other Individuals                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  and Robert Menendez  along with Representatives Carolyn Maloney  Jerrold Nadler  and Vito Fossella today announced that the FY2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill signed into law by the President Wednesday includes an additional  108 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  The money builds on the  50 million that was provided in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that was signed into law earlier this year  bringing total funding for the year to  158 million    The latest funding increase was signed into law as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill and includes  51 5 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill and  56 5 million in additional emergency spending     I am so proud that this critically needed funding is finally on the way to those who need it   Thousands of responders  residents  workers and others continue to suffer the devastating health effects of 9 11   This funding will help sustain the 9 11 health programs while we work on a bipartisan  long term solution in the Senate  said Senator Clinton      It is high time that the first responders and residents of Lower Manhattan that were exposed to toxins six years ago receive the treatment they need and deserve  I am pleased that this essential funding for the men and women who are now suffering from the effects of the attacks has been approved  and promise to continue to fight for the full funding they need  said Senator Schumer    First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero   This funding is a welcome first step to finally help these heroes get the treatment they deserve  said Senator Lautenberg   Senator Menendez said  This is the type of federal commitment that puts the mantra We will never forget into action  and its the type of commitment that had been lacking in previous Congresses  With major investments in the health of those who inhaled the toxic air around Ground Zero  we can help address the needs of all those who deserve their government s attention and resources  whether they developed symptoms in the days after 9 11 or in the years after 9 11  Moving forward  we cannot rest until all of those who inhaled the toxic dust around Ground Zero are examined and those found to be sick are treated   I am glad the President has finally approved the needed health care funding for first responders exposed to toxins at Ground Zero  and for the first time that funding can go to help lower Manhattan residents  workers and students  Now  his administration must explain why it stopped the effort to provide health care for first responders from outside the New York area  Those who came from every state to help New York in its time of need now need help themselves  said Congresswoman Maloney    This landmark funding is a tremendous step toward caring for those who  six years later   are still suffering as a result of the 9 11 attacks on our nation  said Congressman Nadler  As Abraham Lincoln said  we must care for him who shall have borne the battle  We must also continue fighting for comprehensive health benefits for all those who have become sick as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Center  whether they be first responders  local residents  office workers  or students  And we must ensure a full and proper clean up of all affected areas  so that no more innocent people will be harmed by the environmental scars of 9 11    This funding will finally provide medical monitoring and treatment to all the unsung heroes of 9 11  including 9 11 responders  area workers  residents and others  It is also an important step forward in fulfilling our responsibility to help all those who are sick today as well as those who become ill in the future  said Congressman Vito Fossella    The  108 million in new funding will go towards monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The  51 5 million portion in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill also includes statutory language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mount Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    The lawmakers said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed
