June 21  2007 Remarks of Senator Clinton on the Senate Floor on the Employee Free Choice Act and the Senate Energy Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I come to the floor on two very important issues  issues that really do go to the heart of the kind of economy and future that our nation will have   One is the Employee Free Choice Act  which we will be voting on in the next day or two   And the other is the very important energy bill that we have been debating     With respect to the Employee Free Choice Act  for me  Mr  President  this is about preserving  supporting  and growing the American middle class   The middle class is the backbone of the American economy and our unions are the backbone of the American middle class      It s time we passed into law the Employee Free Choice Act to give unions a level playing field so they can organize for fair wages  safe working conditions  and the hard won rights and responsibilities that American workers demand and deserve     This is a moment of profound challenge for our country   Theres a deep sense of concern that I have certainly heard and listened to as I ve traveled throughout America   Americans know they cannot win in the global economy unless the middle class wins   But there is a feeling that some people are betting against the American middle class  that some people have assumed that in a global economy  one of the changes that will have to be made is the middle class will have to shrink  that inequity is inevitable  that globalization is a harsh phenomenon that we have to accept     Well  I do not  Mr  President     And our families are right to be concerned  In 2005  all income gains went to the top 10 percent of households   The vast majority of people  the other 90 percent  saw their incomes decline  Healthcare costs are up  gas prices are up  the cost of college is up   And for six straight years  worker productivity  which means how hard people work because American workers are the hardest working people in the world  productivity has gone up  but wages have either been stagnant or falling   2005 was the first year since the great depression that average personal savings were negative for a whole year     There is a sense that we re losing something in America   that basic bargain that allowed our country to succeed  if you work hard  you and your family can reach the middle class  you can have that American dream   So it is not surprising that we re seeing the weakening of the American middle class at the same time that we see unions under assault      In the early years of the National Labor Relations Act  the majority sign up procedure was the presumptively valid way in which employees could choose a union   Over the years  however  culminating in the 1960 s  a number of decisions shifted us to a new regime   A new regime where employers can choose to require their employees to vote for unions through a one sided election process dominated by employers in order to secure collective bargaining rights   Now  some employers even began to make efforts to push unions out of the workplace     Just consider these comparative facts   In the 1950 s  companies illegally fired or punished during organizing campaigns  or they otherwise violated National Labor Relations Act rights  fewer than 1 000 employees   The number increased to 6 000 workers in 1969  and now today it is 31 000 workers who have been illegally fired or otherwise punished for wanting to exercise a fundamental right  one that we believe people should be able to exercise not only here in our country but around the world     As the number of labor violations has increased  we have seen it become harder and harder for workers to organize   In 1956  unions represented 35 percent of the private work force  The number today is only 7 percent   Our middle class  which the unions helped to build in the 30 s  40 s  50 s  60 s is suffering as a result   Studies show that the decline in union membership has been responsible for at least 20 percent of the rise in income inequality over the last three decades   I think it s probably much more than that  but that s what we can quantify     Therefore  Mr  President  it is time we modernize labor laws that are stacked against working people and stacked against their right to unionize   Right now  employers have unlimited access to employees in one sided union representation elections  employers are given every opportunity to dissuade workers in mandatory one to one meetings  they can delay votes for years  there are no fines  or penalties  or sanctions if an employer illegally fires or discriminates against a worker for collective bargaining   At most  the worker is reinstated with back pay  an award that is  on average  so small that many employers regard it as a cost of doing business   And finally 32 percent of workers who choose to unionize still do not have a contract after a year of making that choice     The system is broken and it s not only our collective bargaining and unionization system  it is our economy as it affects our middle class   Our country needs reforms that will bring balance to our labor laws and our workers need the opportunity to be able to unite with their co workers to obtain the protections and benefits of Americas labor movement   Union wages are 27 percent higher than non union wages   Union members are almost twice as likely to be covered by health insurance and to participate in employer provided retirement plans   Unions improve safety conditions   For example  deaths in non union mines are almost twice as likely as deaths in mines where the workers are union members   And unions certainly provide opportunities for women and minorities   Women in unions earn an extra  179 per week   African Americans in unions earn an extra  187 per week  and Latinos in unions earn an extra  217 per week   Non union employees benefit from the efforts of unions to seek benefits and protections     That s why it s so important we pass the Employee Free Choice Act   It is really long past time to enact real financial penalties against those employers who illegally fire or retaliate against workers during an organizing campaign   Its long past time to allow employees to decide if they want to use majority signup to organize   And finally  it is long past time to allow either employers or employees to request mediation if they are unable to negotiate a contract after 90 days of collective bargaining   These changes will finally give employers an incentive to bargain in good faith and to avoid situations where years and even decades can pass without a bargaining agreement     Mr  President  I believe in the basic bargain and I believe that unions help keep that bargain for America s working people   And I hope this Congress will uphold its end of that basic bargain  that this Congress will pass the Employee Free Choice Act  that the Senate will join the House  which has done so  to give employees the real fair chance to garner the protections and benefits of unions  and to give unions the opportunity to help bring workers into the middle class     Now that s part of the equation  Mr  President  to respect and protect the rights of those in the workplace and to give them the opportunity to unionize   The other part of the equation is to have good jobs  good jobs with rising incomes   We need a source of new good jobs in America     That s why this energy bill is so important   Much of the debate about the energy bill has been  rightly so  about the need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  which I agree with 100 percent  the need to begin finally to address seriously global warming  which I think is way overdue   But there hasn t been enough talk about why this energy bill is critical to the economy of the United States in the way it will help to create millions of new jobs      As the presiding officer knows  he and I offered an amendment which we are pleased that the manager has accepted  to provide incentives for training and equipping and preparing the workforce to do what are called  green collar jobs   These are jobs that can t be outsourced by and large      If we finally get serious    and I hope we ll get back to visit some of the financial incentives that need to be in this bill that  unfortunately  we were unable to include    we will begin to join other countries that have gotten smart about this   Germany gets a lot of its electricity now generated by solar panels on the roofs of residences and offices   And the last time I checked  Germany was not a tropical climate  but they have taken advantage of government incentives to move the market toward using solar     Denmark is also moving toward more wind energy   The United Kingdom  which went into Kyoto when our country left it  has created tens of thousands of new jobs  weatherizing homes  installing new energy technology like solar  like wind   We could do this many times over  We believe we could create millions of new  good paying jobs for hard working Americans     You know  every so often we have to regenerate our job creation in America   During the 90 s we had a lot of new jobs that were related to telecom and information technology   We saw the creation of 22 million new jobs between 1993 and 2001   We saw more people lifted out of poverty than at any time in our country s history   We saw shared prosperity  not what we re seeing today where the bulk of the benefits go to a very small sliver of us     So  Mr  President  this energy bill is about jobs   It s about creating new  good paying jobs for hard working Americans   So what I m looking at when I think of the Employee Free Choice Act and when I think of this energy bill is how we get back into balance  how we get back to where the economy works for everybody  where the market is not stacked against those who are not already privileged  where unions can once again be a vehicle for people moving into and staying in the middle class  and comparably where we can have a new source of jobs     We also have to recognize how we have to look at the jobs that are already in the economy and how the energy bill will affect them   I am hopeful that we will think seriously about lifting the healthcare costs off of a lot of our labor intensive  energy intensive  capital intensive industries in America  like the automobile industry   Because laboring under the costs of healthcare is an uncompetitive position for them in the global economy      So there s a lot to be done  Mr  President  and I want to be sure that as we look at the economy and begin to try to get it back into that balance that works best for America  that we vote for the Employee Free Choice Act  which is really a way of giving employees the choice to have a better life for themselves and their families     There s a lot to be done in our country  I m very optimistic that we can begin tackling our challenges   But so much of what we have to do to create the framework for our people to have that better future has to come from this chamber   Let s look at the future together  Let s make decisions that will give the tools to our people to show that they are the best workers  and the most competitive and productive people in the world  to unleash that dynamism in the American economy and to demonstrate clearly that we stand with the American middle class     Thank you  Mr  President  and I yield the floor    Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning labor  Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning energy
