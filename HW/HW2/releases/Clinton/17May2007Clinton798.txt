May 17  2007 Clinton Expresses Concerns about Possible Postal Service Relocation of Bronx Mail Sorting Operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on the United States Postal Service to carefully consider the impact of their proposal to move their Bronx mail sorting operations to Manhattan  In a letter to Postmaster General John E  Potter  the Senator said she was concerned that such a move would have a significant and adverse impact  not only on the 8 000 members of the New York Metro Area Postal Union  but also on the more than 1 3 million residents of the Borough of the Bronx           I am very concerned about the possible impact of this move  not only on local postal workers but on the Bronx community as a whole  I hope that the Postal Service will carefully consider the ramifications of this proposal and consequences for the more than 1 3 million residents of the Bronx  Concerns about undue financial hardship and possible public health risks are well founded and deserve a thorough investigation   It is essential that this investigation finds the best possible situation for the residents of the Bronx and Manhattan and for New York s postal workers   Senator Clinton said          A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below            The Honorable John E  Potter  Postmaster General  475 L Enfant Plaza SW  Washington DC 20260 0010      Dear Mr  Potter             I am writing to express my concern regarding reports that the United States Postal Service  USPS  may consolidate mail sorting operations from the Bronx into the James A  Farley Post Office in Manhattan  where USPS recently decided to reduce the number of sales associates working at the windows during a single shift                These reports are disturbing  as there is reason to believe that such a move would have a significant and adverse impact on not only the 8 000 members of the New York Metro Area Postal Union  but also the more than 1 3 million residents of the Borough of the Bronx   The more than 1 3 million residents in the Bronx are certain to experience slower and more limited service   The merger could result in job losses for some employees  while others would be forced to commute to Manhattan and endure greater financial hardship   Finally  the consolidation would also result in a substantial increase in truck traffic throughout New York City   This traffic increase would undoubtedly affect the area s asthma rate  The South Bronx has the highest incidents of asthma in the country  and this move would only exacerbate this public health crisis                I understand that USPS is planning to conduct an investigation into the proposed merger   I ask that the investigation be conducted with the utmost care and transparency  and that it give every consideration to the number of ways in which this proposal could adversely affect the employees and consumers of New York City  and the Bronx in particular                 I will be monitoring this situation closely in the coming weeks to ensure that interests of the postal workers in the Bronx and Manhattan are fairly represented in your investigation                Thank you for your attention to this matter and I hope that it can be resolved in an expeditious and satisfactory manner                                                 Sincerely                                                   Hillary Rodham Clinton
