                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Projects Include Improvements at Niagara Falls International Airport  Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and Funding for Hunters Hope Foundation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DCSenators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill signed into law by the President on Wednesday includes funding for projects in Western New York such as improvements at Niagara Falls International Airport and Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station  and increased research at the Hunter James Kelly Research Institutes Kelly Center     These projects are crucial to fueling economic growth across Western New York and for giving local residents top notch services in education  law enforcement and health care  said Senator Schumer  By investing in these vital projects  we ensure that Western New York continues to lure new businesses and tourists to the region  while ensuring families have the first class services they need    These funds are a wise investment in the future of Western New York  and will benefit the regions people  economy and infrastructure  said Senator Clinton  I especially welcome funding for Niagara Falls International Airport  as well as for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station located there  The proposed expansion at the airport will allow more extensive cargo operations and spur even more economic activity in Western New York  The improvements at the Air Reserve Station will further enhance its role in our national defense  I am also proud to announce funding to support potentially life saving research on genetic disorders at the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute    Federal funds will be used at the Niagara Falls International Airport to build a new terminal apron and for road improvements  The new apron will be large enough for two B 747 aircrafts to park alongside the cargo facilities and simultaneously operate  Adding 53 850 square feet of asphalt pavement  and 29 500 square feet of concrete in phase 1B will alleviate any operating constraints related to simultaneous operations of multiple aircraft  Filling in the 162 000 square feet of pavement from Phase 1A  will prevent the cargo operators from having to tug the planes to the cargo hanger in order to comply with FAA clearance and operating regulations  This construction will meet the needs of planned cargo operations  accommodate the various types of aircraft that would use the facility  and be a significant step in integrating the airport into the economic development infrastructure of the greater Niagara area    The funds for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station will help construct new facilities on the base  which will include administrative and organizational buildings designed to house headquarters  classrooms  arms rooms  logistics supply rooms  motor pools  and maintenance bays  When these facilities are completed  units will have modern and revitalized facilities from which to support their missions  There are approximately 100 AFRC units being built nation wide to support the BRAC consolidation plan  The funding approved for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station marks the continuation of Senator Schumer and Clintons commitment to keeping the facility running to its full potential and to further ensuring the stations future   The federal funding for Hunters Hope Foundation will establish the technology infrastructure of the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute inside the University at Buffalos Center for Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences  The Institute will coordinate research initiatives into finding a cure for Krabbe disease and related genetic disorders  One in 100 000 live births in the United States are afflicted with Krabbe Disease  Approximately 2 million people  or one out of 125  in the United States are carriers of the genetic deficiency that causes Krabbe Disease  The Hunters Hope Foundation was established in 1997 by Pro Football Hall of Fame member and former Buffalo Bills Quarterback Jim Kelly and his wife  Jill  after their infant son  Hunter  was diagnosed with Krabbe Leukodystrophy  an inherited  fatal  nervous system disease  The Foundation is the Kellys life long commitment to increase public awareness of leukodystrophies as well as to increase the likelihood of early detection and treatment  Their ultimate goal is to raise money to fund research efforts to identify new treatments  therapies  and a cure for Krabbe and other leukodystrophies    The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes funding for the following projects for Western New York
