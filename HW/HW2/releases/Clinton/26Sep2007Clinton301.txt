September 26  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on New GAO Report Showing Lack of Progress in Addressing Problems in Health Care snd Disability Evaluations for Returning Servicemembers                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Our men and women in uniform are the best that our nation has to offer and they deserve to be treated as the best  When we send our men and women into combat  we have a solemn obligation as a nation to provide them with the best care and utmost dignity when they return home  They deserve nothing less     Today  we learned from the Government Accountability Office that although some progress has been made  the Administration continues to let our servicemembers down  We all remember the heartbreaking stories about soldiers languishing in filthy  decrepit facilities at Walter Reed  And when I met with wounded New Yorkers at Walter Reed the common complaints I heard involved the inefficient disability ratings system and a belief that they had been simply forgotten and were lost in the system  All of us expressed shock and disbelief that a nation as grateful as ours for the service and sacrifice of these brave men and women could let this happen  and that is why I quickly introduced legislationthat was eventually included in the Senates Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act which will address many of these critical issues when it becomes law    I am deeply disappointed to learn today that his Administration has not moved with the urgency that this serious issue demands  The GAO reports that almost half of our wounded warriors eligible for personalized care are not receiving it  the disability evaluation system continues to be convoluted and slow with payments delayed by an average of almostsixmonths  the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs need to do more to share medical records  and basic staff shortages persist  Unfortunately  the Administrations failure to take quicker action is sending the shameful message that the well being of our troops returning from the battlefield is simply not a priority for his Administration These problems havegone on for far too long Not another day should go bywithout real action to address them
