June 10  2005 Clinton Wins Senate Language To Block Contaminated Sediment Study                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                At Clinton  s request  Senate Appropriations Committee disagrees with House study requirement that threatens to derail the Hudson River clean up    Final decision to be made in House Senate Conference after full Senate approval of committee bill                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has included language in the Senate version of the FY 2006 Interior Appropriations bill that opposes a provision in the House version of the bill requiring the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  to begin a new study of contaminated sediments  which could have derailed the Hudson River clean up project        The House study requirement was included in the House Interior Appropriations bill in May at the request of General Electric  Following consideration and passage on the Senate floor  the bill will head into a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between the two bills          I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with my concerns about the study  which has the potential to delay the Hudson clean up     Senator Clinton said    I will continue to work with my colleagues to help that the House provision does not become law           On May 18th  Senator Clinton sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee  expressing her concern that a new and largely duplicative NAS study could mean further delays in the Hudson clean up  as well as at other sites with contaminated sediment across the country   Senator Clinton called on Senators Burns and Dorgan to include language opposing the House study provision when their Committee acts on the Senate version of the Interior Appropriations bill next week         The Committee responded to her request by including the following language in the Interior Appropriations report          At this time  the Committee disagrees with the position of the House as to the need for an additional contaminated sediment sites study and does not recommend that EPA enter into any further agreement with the National Academy of Sciences           In her letter of May 18  Senator Clinton said that the NAS study requirement included in the House bill focuses only on clean up costs  rather than on the full range of contaminated sediment issues recommended for further study by the NAS in 2001   In addition  the Senator is concerned that the study language could be interpreted as requiring a protracted review of the EPA  s cleanup decisions at all contaminated sediment sites  ignoring the fact that EPA has recently put a detailed review process for contaminated sediment sites in place          The language included in the House bill focuses almost exclusively on remedial costs and would re open many of the issues surrounding the Hudson River that were decided by EPA in 2002 after more than a decade of study     Senator Clinton said    The clean up should go forward as planned  and I will be working with my Congressional colleagues to help ensure that it does            A copy of Senator Clinton  s May 18th letter is attached        May 18  2005       The Honorable Conrad Burns  Chairman        The Honorable Byron L  Dorgan  Ranking Member       Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510        Dear Chairman Burns and Ranking Member Dorgan        As you prepare to markup the FY 2006 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  I write to urge you to include language in the Senate report disagreeing with language added to the House report last week regarding contaminated sediments   Page 115 of the House report directs the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to contract with the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  to answer a number of questions associated with EPA  s efforts to clean up contaminated sediments   This language was inserted at the request of General Electric        Although the House language purports to build on the recommendations of a recent National Research Council study entitled   A Risk Management Strategy for PCB Contaminated Sediments     the questions that the report directs the NAS to focus on have little to do with those recommendations   The NAS recommended assessing the human health and ecological risks of single chlorobiphenyls in particular environments  a range of risks presented by sites contaminated with PCBs and other pollutants  the fate and transport of PCBs in sediments  improvement of remedial technologies  the impact of continuing PCB releases and the global cycling of PCBs   By contrast  most of the questions in the House report focus on cost considerations relevant primarily to potentially responsible parties        The last question in the House report asks the NAS to review the EPA  s decisions at contaminated sediment sites to determine whether EPA regions are following agency sediment remediation guidance and   recommendations made by the  NAS  in its 2001 report     This could be interpreted to ask for a protracted review of the EPA  s cleanup decisions at all contaminated sediment sites  and ignores the fact that EPA has recently put a detailed review process for contaminated sediment sites in place   Key stakeholders are already integrated early on in this review process to help inform the EPA  s remedial decisions        With all of these factors in mind  I believe that requiring a new NAS study would do more harm than good  and could stall decisions and action on cleanup of contaminated sediments at sites across the country   I am especially concerned that this study could be used by General Electric to stall cleanup of the Hudson River   In 2002  after more than a decade of scientific investigation and analysis    including considerable governmental scrutiny and an extensive peer review process that provides the foundation for the agency  s proposed clean up plan    the EPA finalized its decision to require General Electric to cleanup PCB contaminated sediments from hot spots in the Hudson River   The EPA decision reflected the agency  s scientific conclusion that dredging hotspots was the best way to eliminate the continuing health and environmental impacts caused by the estimated 1 3 million pounds of PCBs that General Electric released into the Hudson   After years of additional work since the EPA decision was finalized in 2002  cleanup work is set to begin in 2006   Yet the study language included in the House bill is clearly intended to revisit many of the issues that were decided in 2002 by EPA after extensive study   The Hudson River cleanup should not be delayed by further study   I urge you to include language in the FY 2006 Senate Interior Appropriations report disagreeing with the House requirement for an NAS study of contaminated sediments       Sincerely yours      Hillary Rodham Clinton
