November 8  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for Full Funding of LIHEAP to Help Families Meet Financial Burden of Rising Energy Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clinton   5 1 Billion in Funding For LIHEAP Critical to Ensure Thousands of New Yorkers Can Afford Skyrocketing Energy Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined several of her senate colleagues in calling on the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  to support a funding level of  5 1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   In a letter authored by Senator Jack Reed and sent to OMB Director Jim Nussle  the lawmakers stressed the importance of supporting the  5 1 billion funding level for the FY 2009  as millions of Americans are continuing to struggle under the burden of increasing energy costs     Every year hardworking families throughout New York struggle to meet the ever rising heating and energy costs  With energy prices near record highs  thousands of New Yorkers must constantly face the unthinkable situation of paying for necessities like food and prescriptions  or paying their energy bills  said Senator Clinton  LIHEAP makes a big difference for people who have to face decisions like these  and I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that LIHEAP receives full funding    LIHEAP protects public health and safety by helping low income families pay for high energy costs  In FY 2006 this critical program served approximately 904 705 households throughout New York State who struggled to cope with the soaring costs and diminishing availability of home heating fuel  According to the Energy Information Administration  households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels this winter than during the 2006 2007 winter     Senator Clinton has worked tirelessly to increase LIHEAP funding to make sure low income New Yorkers are able to heat their homes in the midst of record energy costs  Earlier this year  Senator Clinton called on the President to make available the remaining  151 5 million in the LIHEAP contingency fund for low income households  See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 282491     A copy of the letter to Director Nussle is attached     November 7  2007     The Honorable Jim Nussle  Director  Office of Management and Budget  Old Executive Office Building  Washington  DC 20503   Dear Director Nussle    As you prepare the Presidents fiscal year  FY  2009 budget request  we urge you to support a funding level of  5 1 billion  the full amount in the most recent authorization  for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP      Many Americans are struggling under the burden of high energy prices   According to the Energy Information Administration  households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter   LIHEAP protects public health and safety by helping low income families pay for these high energy costs   In addition  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden   Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year     In FY 2007  LIHEAP appropriations totaled  2 2 billion   1 billion less than the programs peak funding in FY2006 of  3 2 billion   This decrease meant that many low income households eligible for LIHEAP did not receive assistance   Earlier this summer  the National Energy Directors Association conducted a national survey of utility arrearages and shutoffs   The survey estimated that at least 1 2 million households were disconnected from electric and natural gas service during March  May of this year   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between paying an energy bill and putting food on the table for themselves and their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances      We believe increased LIHEAP funding should be a top priority in the Presidents FY 2009 budget   Your support for  5 1 billion in LIHEAP funding in the fiscal year 2009 budget process would help qualified low income households receive much needed LIHEAP assistance in the coming year     Sincerely
