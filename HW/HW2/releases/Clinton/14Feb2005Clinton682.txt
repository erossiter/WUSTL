February 14  2005 Clinton  Tragedy Is A Bitter Reminder That Assault Weapons Ban Should Be Reinstated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  D C     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement regarding the tragic Hudson Valley Mall shooting that occurred Sunday  February 13th          I was deeply saddened to learn of the incident of violence in Kingston  NY   I hope that those who were injured or witnessed what happened will be able to move on from this traumatic experience   This is an unfortunate and bitter reminder that there are important steps our nation must take to avoid such unnecessary tragedies from occurring in the future   These steps include  renewing the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole to ensure that we keep guns out of the wrong hands   The assault weapons ban and gun show loophole are public safety initiatives that works and most importantly don  t prevent anyone who can otherwise own a gun from owning one
