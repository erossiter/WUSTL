January 16  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton Regarding the EPA  s Announcement Today that It will Open Registration for the Post 9 11 Lower Manhattan Test and Clean Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today released the following statement in response to the Environmental Protection Agency s announcement that it has opened registration for the Lower Manhattan Test and Clean Program aimed at testing for contaminants associated with the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center            It has taken years and constant pressure to force the EPA to respond to the continuing concerns of those whose homes were contaminated by the dust that arose from the collapse of the World Trade Center   Unfortunately  the new EPA program falls short and would leave many New Yorkers out in the cold   A comprehensive testing and clean up program that really serves those New Yorkers who were impacted by the dust and toxins from the World Trade Center must have broader geographic boundaries and include workplaces   We cannot ignore the realities of this situation   I plan to use my chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health to continue to press for a more expansive test and clean program in the new Congress
