May 13  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Groundbreaking For Corning Reservoir                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the City of Corning today as they break ground for the restoration of the City reservoir   Two years ago when I learned about the history of this century old structure  I was immediately convinced that federal funding was necessary for this infrastructure preservation project      Corning is a vibrant city that has proved its resilience time and time again   Unfortunately  overwhelming costs often prohibit many small  to medium sized communities from making local structural improvements   Recently  I learned that the  250 000 my colleagues and I secured for this project prevented burdensome tax increases for Corning residents   I commend the City on their perseverance with this project   Their hard work and that of many community leaders and active community members will soon lead to safer drinking water for all  I look forward to a visit when I may see the progress on this essential project
