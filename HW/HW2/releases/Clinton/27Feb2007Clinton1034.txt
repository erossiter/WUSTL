February 27  2007 Senators Clinton  Schumer Press HHS Secretary on AIDS Funding for Nassau Suffolk Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer today joined Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt expressing concern over the agency s decision to strip eligible metropolitan area  EMA  status from several of our nation s areas that have been hit hard by the AIDS epidemic  Without such status  Nassau and Suffolk Counties and other areas most impacted by AIDS are likely to lose millions of dollars in funding for essential AIDS care and treatment programs            The interpretation of HHS unfairly penalizes areas providing services that improve long term health outcomes for people with AIDS  A rigid adherence to a five year AIDS lookback period does not reflect the reality of the epidemic or the burden in these communities   Senator Clinton said   We worked to ensure that areas like Nassau and Suffolk counties would be protected  and to have the Department go against the letter of the law like this is unacceptable   I will continue to fight this decision  and I call upon HHS to recognize the clear need in this region            HHS s decision to strip Nassau and Suffolk of critical AIDS funding is both bewildering and infuriating  Starving Nassau and Suffolk counties of the money they need to provide services for people with AIDS is dead wrong   Schumer said   We will continue to fight tooth and nail to ensure that these counties get the money necessary for these essential services           Under the recent reauthorization of the CARE Act  the criteria for an eligible metropolitan area  EMA  was changed from areas with 2 000 newly diagnosed AIDS cases over the past five years to also include areas that have more than 3 000 living AIDS cases  Such a change reflects advances in treatment  which have allowed many individuals to live longer than five years after an initial diagnosis with AIDS  Without this change  there would be no way to recognize the burden in areas that have been successful in helping people with AIDS live longer  healthier lives  However  rather than allow all areas that meet this 3 000 living AIDS case criteria to remain EMAs  HRSA is instead downgrading them to  transitional grant areas   despite the clear need       The Senators  letter to HHS is below       The Honorable Mike O  Leavitt  Secretary  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  D C  20201      Dear Mr  Secretary       We write to express our concern over the implementation of the recently reauthorized Ryan White CARE Act by the Health Resources and Services Administration  HRSA    Several eligible metropolitan areas  EMAs  in our jurisdictions have been notified that they will now be classified as transitional grant areas  TGAs    We believe this notification is in error           In the recent reauthorization of the CARE Act  Sec  101 contains the following language regarding EMA eligibility           b  Continued Status as Eligible Area  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section  a metropolitan area that is an eligible area for a fiscal year continues to be an eligible area until the metropolitan area fails  for three consecutive fiscal years         1  to meet the requirements of subsection  a   and       2  to have a cumulative total of 3 000 or more living cases of AIDS  reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available      2  to have a cumulative total of 3 000 or more living cases of AIDS  reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available      Title I eligibility is lost only when an area fails to meet both of these requirements   Nothing in this Act specifies that failure to meet one of these requirements in FY 2007 would result in loss of EMA status from FY 2006   Nor does anything in the Act specify that the language regarding transitional grant areas  as laid out in Sec  107 of the reauthorized CARE Act  should be applied prior to application of this continued status clause           This provision does not confer EMA eligibility to all areas that your department has classified as a TGA under the CARE Act   Rather  it applies only to six areas  New Haven in Connecticut  Nassau and Suffolk Counties in New York  Riverside  Oakland and Orange Counties in California  and Seattle  Washington   According to December 2005 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  each one of these areas easily meets the 3 000 living AIDS case threshold set up in this reauthorization           As you know  recent advances in treatment have enabled many people living with HIV and AIDS to lead longer  healthier lives   The 5 year lookback period in the original CARE Act was amended to recognize the need in EMAs that have provided quality care to people living with HIV and AIDS   This new system allows for us to account for individuals who have lived more than 5 years beyond their initial diagnosis with AIDS  rather than to inadvertently penalize EMAs that have provided the essential care and support services that help people with AIDS survive          We would urge you to immediately reexamine your implementation of this provision for FY 2007  and ensure that these six areas retain their EMA status   Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  Maria Cantwell  Joseph I  Lieberman  Charles E  Schumer  Patty Murray
