March 16  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Vote to Increase the Federal Debt Limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement on the Senate vote to raise the federal debt limit   Republicans voted overwhelmingly for the amendment  approved 52 to 48          Today  s vote to increase the federal debt limit to nearly  9 trillion represents a profound failure of this Administration  s and Republican Congress   policies   It is not only a failure of fiscal discipline   It is a failure of foresight  vision and above all a failure of leadership        Instead of building upon the progress made in the 90  s  when tough decisions were made on both the spending and revenue side which resulted in budget surpluses  job creation and unprecedented economic growth  the Republicans instead chose a path that moved our nation towards the four largest budget deficits ever and the highest level of indebtedness of any nation in the history of the world          Instead of making investments in the American people through education  job training and health care and creating a foundation for new economic opportunities and a stronger America in the future  we have increasingly ceded our fiscal sovereignty to foreign nations like China  Japan  and the OPEC consortium who now finance about 45 percent or  2 2 trillion of our nation  s publicly held debt          Instead of offering budget plans that were balanced and didn  t place further burdens on the middle class  the neediest in our society and future generations  we were given reckless tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy   These shortsighted policies have since exploded the debt to the point where today  the fourth largest expenditure for this federal government is simply interest on the national debt to the tune of  247 billion per year         Regrettably  this Administration and the Republican leadership were unable or unwilling to accept the basic logic and simple math which clearly demonstrated that their policies were unsustainable   This failure has forced this chamber to confront the bleak reality of the fiscal landscape that their policies have wrought  the fourth increase in the debt limit in five years totaling over  3 trillion   Indeed  since this President has taken office  the national debt has increased 53 percent   Foreign held debt has increased 120 percent   And the President  s own budget acknowledges that in five short years  his policies will have resulted in a national debt of nearly  12 trillion  roughly the size of our entire economy today          Clearly  today should be a wake up call for all Americans concerned about the future of our children and the economic security of our nation   The current leadership has steered us away from the path of responsibility  shared sacrifice  and prudent  judicious policy making to the reckless course of crushing debt  deficit financed tax cuts and increasing the burden on the middle class   Raising this debt limit while embracing policies that further exacerbate the deficit is in essence a   children  s tax   a burden borne not by this Administration or this Congress  but by our sons  our daughters and our grandchildren    It is for these reasons that I oppose this increase in the debt limit
