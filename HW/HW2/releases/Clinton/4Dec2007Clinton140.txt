December 4  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Department of Energy Decision to Reconsider Designation of Mid Atlantic Electricity Transmission Corridor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It is good news that the Department of Energy may now be listening to the New Yorkers who stand in the path of the NYRI power line  I continue to believe that the federal government should not circumvent the state s review of the power line  and today s announcement is a step in the right direction    Earlier today  the U S  Department of Energy  DOE  said it would grant a re hearing on its October decision to declare two areas of the country National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors  NIETC   This includes the designation of a Mid Atlantic NIETC that encompasses large sections of New York State from the Utica area to the suburbs north of New York City  the area in which the proposed NYRI project would be located     This news follows the recent decision by a federal judge in U S  District Court in Albany to dismiss a lawsuit by NYRI that challenged a state law protecting homeowners from the use of eminent domain by private power companies  Following this decision  the DOE stated that groups such as NYRI would need to spend another year trying to negotiate solutions with states  If the negotiations fail  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  could intervene and approve the use of eminent domain     In early October the DOE announced the designation of a Mid Atlantic NIETC that includes the area in which the proposed NYRI project would be located  Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005  Congress authorized the Department of Energy to designate NIETCs in congested areas of the high voltage power grid   The law also granted the FERC new authority to permit construction of transmission lines in the designated NIET corridors to companies like NYRI   The most problematic provision of that law gives power line permit holders  like NYRI  the right to petition in U S  district court to acquire rights of way for the construction of transmission lines through the power of eminent domain  Under current law  a project such as NYRI would be allowed to use the new federal right of eminent domain to condemn private property along its route between Utica and Orange County     Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined with Senator Schumer in introducing legislation to fix the law in order to give New York and other states the final say on siting of power lines
