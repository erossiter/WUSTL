February 6  2006 Voinovich  Carper  Isakson  Clinton  President Bush Commits  50 Million in 2007 Budget to Diesel Emissions Reduction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    The President  s Fiscal Year 2007  FY2007  Budget request includes  50 million for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act  DERA    The President also calls for all diesel reduction programs  including the Clean School Bus USA Program  the Diesel Truck Retrofit and Fleet Modernization Program  and the Engine Idling Reduction Program  to be carried out within DERA   Introduced by Senators George V  Voinovich  R OH   Thomas Carper  D DE   Johnny Isakson  R GA   and Hillary Clinton  D NY   DERA was developed with the support of over 200 environmental  industry  labor and public officials with the goal of reducing diesel emissions          VOINOVICH     I am very pleased that President Bush understands the importance of funding this vital program   The bottom line is that if we want to clean up our air to improve the environment and protect public health  diesel retrofits are one of the best uses of taxpayers   money   The President  s commitment will go a long way toward helping states and localities meet the nation  s new clean air standards   This is vitally important for Ohio  which has 38 nonattainment counties   While  50 million is a very good start  full funding of this program is sound environmental  economic and budgetary policy   I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act receives the funding it deserves     said Senator Voinovich          CARPER    Diesel retrofits are a vital component to any comprehensive clean air plan   While this  50 million budget request represents a good first step toward our goal of reducing the amount of pollution from existing diesel engines  my hope is that we will be able to do more in the future   By incorporating today  s clean air technology with yesterday  s diesel engines  retrofitting will allow states like Delaware to enjoy cleaner air sooner rather than later     said Senator Carper              ISAKSON    I am very pleased President Bush has included funds for this important program  which was drafted in cooperation with environmental  industry and public officials   Diesel emission reductions will help communities  especially in my state of Georgia  attain the new air quality standards  significantly improve the environment and protect public health     said Senator Isakson          CLINTON    The budget includes  50 million to clean up pollution from diesel engines such as school buses  bulldozers  trucks and other vehicles   This builds on the Clean School Bus USA program that I helped create   These funds will give New York and other states new tools to protect public health     said Senator Clinton          By a vote of 92 to 1  the bill was included as an amendment to the Energy Bill   Establishing voluntary national and state level grant and loan programs to reduce diesel emissions  the bill was signed into law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  Public Law No  109 58  on August 8  2005   DERA is pivotal in the effort to clean the nation  s air as on road heavy duty diesel vehicles  such as transit buses and garbage trucks  and non road diesel vehicles  such as construction equipment and tractors  account for roughly one half of the nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions from mobile sources nationwide          In November  over 200 organizations representing a diverse coalition of environmental  industry  labor and public officials sent the President a letter requesting full funding for DERA and that programs like the Clean School Bus USA Program  the Diesel Truck Retrofit and Fleet Modernization Program  and the Engine Idling Reduction Program would be carried out within it          Coalition Support for Diesel Emissions Reduction Program Funding            The President  s support for clean diesel retrofit funding is a critical first step  and a victory for the broad coalition of over 200 environmental  industry and government organizations that has called for a new national program   While  50 million is a solid start  we urge Congress to finance this important clean air program at  200 million as originally authorized            Allen Schaeffer  Executive Director  Diesel Technology Forum          The inclusion of  50 million for cleaning up pollution from existing diesel engines in the Bush Administration s proposed budget recognizes the seriousness of the problem of uncontrolled diesel emissions   However  states will need full funding of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act  DERA  to realize the goal of cleaner air and attainment of air quality standards   We look forward to working with Congressional appropriators to see that DERA is fully funded to the level authorized             Conrad G  Schneider  Advocacy Director  Clean Air Task Force           This is a good downpayment  but the balance can t come soon enough to protect Ohioans  health from the toll of dirty diesel pollution   Congress should fully fund this important initiative at the authorized level            Vicki Deisner  Executive Director of the Ohio Environmental Council              AGC has been a proud supporter of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Program  We re pleased the President recognizes this shared commitment and the tremendous cost to retrofit construction equipment  and look forward to working to grow the effectiveness of this program            Stephen E  Sandherr  CEO  The Associated General Contractors of America  AGC            Caterpillar enthusiastically supports this initial funding to help our customers retrofit their existing engines with clean diesel technology   This important step will help our environment by reducing emissions while supporting the vital economic role the diesel engine plays in our nation s economy             Doug Oberhelman  Group President  Caterpillar            Cummins enthusiastically supports the President s  50 million commitment to DERA in the 2007 fiscal year federal budget   DERA is truly a win for both the environment and the economy   Fully funding the program will serve as a cost effective tool for states to reduce emissions  while also promoting domestic manufacturing jobs   The clean diesel engines and emissions after treatment devices funded through DERA are produced in numerous locations around the U S    Cummins will continue to work with a broad coalition of environmental and industry groups and Congress to build on the important first step taken by the President today            Mike Cross  Vice President  Cummins Inc  and General Manager  Emissions Solutions           ECTA is very pleased that the Administration has demonstrated its commitment to diesel retrofits by including DERA in its FY 07 budget proposal  We look forward to working with Congressional appropriators to build on the President s initiative             Tim Regan  President  Emissions Control Technology Association
