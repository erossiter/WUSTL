January 28  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton   Regarding Lockheed Martin s US101 Helicopter   Winning the  Marine One Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     What a great day for Owego  the Southern Tier and all of New York  I extend my warmest congratulations to the employees and management at Lockheed Martin s Owego plant and to the entire Southern Tier of New York which will benefit from this contract  I am so proud of what they have accomplished  The U S  101 will provide the President of the United States with a state of the art helicopter powered by three engines and complete with an Oval Office in the sky  I had the opportunity to fly in one of the US101 helicopters last year and can attest that it will serve the President well  With partners in over 41 states  the US101 truly represents the best that New York and America have to offer  As a member of the Armed Services Committee  I look forward to celebrating with the employees of Lockheed Martin s Owego facility and the rest of the southern tier
