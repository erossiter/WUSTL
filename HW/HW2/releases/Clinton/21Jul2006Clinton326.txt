July 21  2006 Senator Clinton Welcomes Restoration of Community Development Block Grant Program Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Key Senate Panel Rejects President s Budget Cuts to Critical Economic Development Program for New York State      Move will restore  70  80 million in funding for New York Towns and Cities      Nearly 50 towns and cities throughout New York are direct beneficiaries of the CDBG program                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee late yesterday of the Fiscal Year 2007 Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill  which included  3 887 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Program  CDBG   one of the most important economic and community development programs in the nation   This funding level basically rejects the President s cuts  and ensures that New York won t see a cut in its CDBG funding           The President s FY  07 Budget had initially proposed cutting the CDBG program by over 20   which would have resulted in a loss of over  70 million to New York   Given that New York receives about 10  of the funding for the entire CDBG program  it would have been one of the most deeply hit states by the cuts              The CDBG program has been supporting affordable housing for working families  cleaning up streets and neighborhoods  and creating new jobs and business opportunities in New York for over 30 years   I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee has rejected the President s shortsighted cuts to this critical program for our State  and I will continue to work to ensure that this funding level is maintained as we move forward on FY 2007 funding matters   This is an important win for New York  Restoring these cuts was the right thing to do for all the local communities that use these funds and rely on them to make critical investments for the future     Senator Clinton said          Senator Clinton joined an effort earlier this year to restore the CDBG funds for New York  Since the President s budget containing these cuts was released earlier this year  Senator Clinton has cosponsored and supported several amendments to the FY  07 budget to restore this funding and has lobbied her colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to oppose the President s cuts           The CDBG program  begun in 1974  is designed to allow communities to develop affordable housing  neighborhood revitalization activities and economic opportunity  principally aimed at low and moderate income persons   In New York CDBG empowers cities and towns to provide affordable housing  social services  neighborhood revitalization and job development programs
