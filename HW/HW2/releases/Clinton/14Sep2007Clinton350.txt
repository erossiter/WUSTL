September 14  2007 Senator Clinton Renews Call to Department of Homeland Security to Halt Downsizing of Federal Protective Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Downsizing FPS Would Affect Federal Buildings in Manhattan  Queens  Long Island  Albany  Binghamton  Buffalo  Champlain  Plattsburgh  Poughkeepsie  Rochester  and Syracuse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined a bipartisan coalition of senators to reiterate their call to stop the proposed cutbacks to the Federal Protective Services  FPS   the only agency tasked with protecting thousands of non military federal buildings across the country  In a letter sent this week  the lawmakers urged the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Subcommittees on Homeland Security Appropriations  to include a provision to the Department Of Homeland Security Appropriations Act  2008  H R  2638   that would halt the Department of Homeland Securitys  DHS  attempts to downsize the FPS    The idea that the Bush Administration would take steps to reduce the force of an agency like the Federal Protective Services  which is so vital to the security of our federal buildings  is unconscionable  It is especially troubling in light of the testimony this summer of The Deputy Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security who stated that further reductions in the FPS could lead to uneven effects across the nation  perhaps place some facilities at risk    said Senator Clinton  I am pleased that my Senate colleagues agree that the Bush Administrations plan when it comes to the Federal Protective Service is completely unacceptable  The proposed staff cuts are clearly inconsistent with the ongoing threat that New York faces  which is why it is so critical that the final bill includes the provision halting the DHS attempt to downsize the Federal Protective Services    The proposed downsizing plan would affect the security at government buildings in New York State  many of which are considered high risk facilities  The facility locations include lower Manhattan  upper Manhattan  Queens  Long Island  Albany  Binghamton  Buffalo  Champlain  Plattsburgh  Poughkeepsie  Rochester  and Syracuse    Last July  the Senate unanimously confirmed an amendment by Senator Clinton to the Senate version of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would prevent the Administrations plan from moving forward  and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the workforce of the FPS includes no fewer than 1 200 Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors  and Special Agents engaged on a daily basis in protecting federal buildings  The Administration currently plans to replace current serving FPS law enforcement personnel with Inspectors  This would reduce the number of FPS officers and special agents from just under 1 200 personnel to 950  and would leave nearly 9 000 non military federal buildings  located in over 2 100 American communities  and 1 1 million Federal employees at risk   As a vocal critic of the Administrations plan to downsize the FPS  Senator Clinton sent a letter to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff earlier this summer  expressing her concerns about the current plan to significantly reduce the size of the Service    The letter to the members of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security is attached    September 7th  2007   The Honorable Robert C  Byrd  Chairman  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510   The Honorable David E  Price  Chairman  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations   United States of Representatives  Washington  D C  20515 The Honorable Thad Cochran  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510   The Honorable Harold Rogers  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States House of Representatives  Washington  D C  20515   Dear Chairmen Byrd and Price and Ranking Members Cochran and Rogers    As you move forward with conference negotiations on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act  2008  H R 2638   we ask that the final bill includes a provision halting the Department of Homeland Securitys attempt to downsize the only federal agency that is tasked with protecting the thousands of non military federal buildings throughout the United States  the Federal Protective Service  FPS      The Senate version of H R  2638 includes a provision that prevents the Administrations plan from moving forward  and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the workforce of the Federal Protective Service includes no fewer than 1 200 Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors and Special Agents engaged on a daily basis in protecting federal buildings   The provision requires the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security to adjust security fees as necessary  not an across the board fee increase  to ensure full funding of no fewer than 1 200 in service Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors  and Special Agents at the Federal Protective Service    The plan put forward by the Administration to reduce the number of FPS officers and special agents from just under 1 200 personnel to 950 would leave the almost 9 000 non military federal buildings  located in over 2 100 American communities  and with 1 1 million Federal employees at risk   The Administration intends to replace current serving FPS law enforcement personnel with Inspectors   FPS officers and special agents have essential law enforcement skills and responsibilities that go far beyond those of on site contract guards at federal facilities   The day to day responsibilities of FPS Police Officers and Special Agents are not at all the same as Inspectors or contract security guards  These individuals perform a unique function in the homeland security safety net   FPS Officers and Special Agents represent boots on the ground that cannot be replaced    The most recent key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate stated that our homeland is under a heightened threat environment and that Al Qaeda is undiminished in its goal in attacking us here at home   This summer it was reported that the FPS issued an internal document detailing high risk threats to federal buildings and employees   Headlined Increased Risk of Terrorist Attack This Summer  the document instructs FPS officers to begin monitoring employee conduct within the nearly 9 000 federal facilities it guards across the country   On May 1  2007  Jim Taylor  Deputy Inspector General  U S  Department of Homeland Security testified before the House Committee on Homeland Security and Mr  Taylor could not have been clearer when he stated that further reductions in the FPS could lead to uneven effects across the nation  perhaps place some facilities at risk    In light of these facts  reducing the number of FPS personnel at this time would be disastrous   We recognize the difficult choices you will have to make in completing a final version of the bill  but we think this provision deserves special consideration and should remain in the final bill   Thank you for your consideration of this important request    Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton Edward M  Kennedy   Chuck Schumer Joe Lieberman   Barbara A  Mikulski Ben Cardin   Daniel Akaka      John F  Kerry   Frank R  Lautenberg Robert Menendez   Susan M  Collins
