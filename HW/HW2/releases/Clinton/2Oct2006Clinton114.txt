October 2  2006 First Responders Health Monitoring Amendment Sponsored by Sens  Voinovich and Clinton and Rep  King Included in Port Security Conference Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Provides for Health Monitoring of Individuals Exposed to Harmful Substances As a Result of Terrorist Attacks or Natural Disasters Washington  DC   The Port Security Conference Report approved by the House and Senate includes an amendment sponsored by U S  Senators George V  Voinovich  R OH  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and U S  Representative Peter King  R NY   the Disaster Area Health and Environment Monitoring Act  which is focused on health monitoring for our nation s first responders   It will now go to the president for his signature          The amendment authorizes the president  if he determines that substances of concern have been released in a federally declared disaster area  to establish a program in a federal partnership with appropriate medical institutions for the protection  assessment  monitoring and study of the health and safety of individuals  The amendment also directs federal agencies to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study and report on disaster area health protection and monitoring            This issue first came to my attention during a series of hearings in 2002  when my colleagues and I learned of the severe health problems facing the thousands of workers and volunteers who heroically responded to the September 11  2001  attacks on the World Trade Center   Sen  Voinovich said   It is extremely important that we take care of these individuals who bravely gave of themselves to help those in need  Whether people will volunteer to be first responders in the future depends on how the first responders on 9 11 and other disaster areas are treated  We must take care of our heroes             September 11 showed us that we need a national program to fully track    and thus enable us to treat    the health effects of disasters   Responders and volunteers who came to New York from all over the country and people who lived and worked near Ground Zero but have since moved to other parts of the country are experiencing health effects their local health providers may not connect to 9 11   For the protection of those who will answer the call to help in the wake of future tragedies  I am proud the Senate has approved what will become a critical part of our public health preparedness   said Senator Clinton            This amendment is absolutely essential to protect the health and safety of our first responders  The legacy and lessons of 9 11 require no less    said Representative King           Many of the Ground Zero first responders have suffered from mental illness and a variety of long term respiratory illnesses  including asthma and pneumonia   This group includes Ohio Task Force One  one of 28 federal Urban Search and Rescue teams deployed to New York City following the attacks  Currently  the Federal Emergency Management Agency does not hold the authority to conduct the necessary long term monitoring of health impacts following environmental exposures in the wake of a disaster           A five year study conducted by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Ground Zero first responders confirmed suspicions about the effects of having worked at the World Trade Center  WTC  site  According to the findings  almost 70 percent of WTC responders had a new or substantially worsened respiratory symptom following their work at the WTC  Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9 11  61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC           The Senate passed this bill by Unanimous Consent in the 108th Congress  but it failed to move through the House         Click here for more information about Senator Clinton s work on 9 11 health effects
