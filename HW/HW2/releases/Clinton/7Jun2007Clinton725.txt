June 7  2007 Senator Clinton Delivers Remarks on the Senate Floor in Introducing Immigration Amendment to Help Reunite Immigrant Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Vows to Continue Fight to Remove Barriers to Family Reunification                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton last night spoke on the Senate floor to introduce an amendment to the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 to reunite lawful permanent residents with their spouses and minor children caught in visa backlogs  The amendment  which was defeated late last night by a vote of 44 53  would have exempted the spouses and minor children of lawful permanent immigrants from visa caps  finally bringing back together these nuclear families that have been separated  The Senate last night also defeated an amendment offered by Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  and co sponsored by Senator Clinton that would have moved the May 1  2005 cut off date for family backlog reduction to January 1  2007  ensuring that all of those who have played by the rules and sought legal entry into the country are part of the backlog reduction  Hundreds of thousands of lawful permanent residents are separated from their spouses and minor children due to visa backlogs that can stretch for five years or longer  Under our current policies  lawful permanent residents are forced to choose between their newly adopted country and living with their spouse or children  Five years in the life of a young child or a marriage is precious time that cant be recaptured  By defeating these family reunification amendments  the Senate missed an opportunity to take all the rhetoric about family values and put it into action and show that we mean what we say when we talk about putting families first  said Senator Clinton  More than 100 advocacy organizations and faith based groups had endorsed and rallied support for the Clinton Hagel Menendez amendment  including the New York Immigration Coalition  Hispanic Federation  National Council of La Raza  Asian American Justice Center  Esperanza USA  Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society  Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service  World Relief Refugee and Immigration Programs  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  United Methodist Church  U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops  Episcopal Church  AFL CIO  SEIU and UNITE HERE  among others   The following is a transcript of Senator Clintons remarks last night on the Senate floor     Senator Clinton  Mr  President  I know there are very strongly held and honestly felt disagreements in this chamber on the legislation before us  and many of these differences are mirrored across our country   The issue of immigration strikes deeply at our values and our concept of America  It stirs our emotions  And while we may reach different conclusions  I think we all have to begin at the same place    our immigration system is in crisis  Now  I have concerns about this underlying bill  but I think we all do  This is not the bill that any of us individually would have written and produced for the senate s consideration  But I commend the primary sponsors for bringing this to the floor of the senate so that we can debate the issues it raises and try to craft a solution that simultaneously honors our nation s strong immigrant heritage and respects the rule of law   As a nation  we place a premium on compassion  respect  and policies that help families  but our immigration laws don t reflect that  In fact  our current laws tear families apart   For lawful permanent residents and their spouses and minor children  this bill not only fails to help them  it actually makes matters worse  It is time to take all the rhetoric about family values and put it into action and show that we mean what we say when we talk about putting families first  And that s what my amendment does   This amendment is a bipartisan amendment introduced with Senator Hagel and Senator Menendez  It is our view that we must make reuniting families a priority in our immigration system  that we should show compassion for those living apart from their spouses and minor children  that we should reform immigration in a way that honors families and brings them together  Unfortunately  the compromise bill before us fails to help families and children stuck in a bureaucratic quagmire created by our tangled  broken immigration system   Spouses of  and minor children of  lawful permanent residents applying for a green card are required to remain overseas while awaiting their new legal status  The problem is  there is a huge backlog  Despite what some have suggested on the floor this week  the visa backlog for spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents is significant and substantial  According to the June 2007 State Department Visa Bulletin  the backlog is currently more than five years long  Now  for some  that backlog can stretch even longer  And what does that mean  Well  in very human terms  it means parents are forced to part from their children  husbands are separated from their wives  and tax paying  law abiding  legal immigrants who are doing the right thing are treated as though their families don t matter at all  If you are a lawful  permanent resident and your spouse or minor children are caught in this long line  your family is not allowed to enter the United States  even for a brief visit  You are limited in your ability to leave the United States to visit your spouse and children overseas  Under our current policies  lawful permanent residents are forced to choose between their newly adopted country and living with their spouse or children  And  you know  five years may not seem long to some of us    we serve six years in the senate  it seems to go by very fast    but five years in the life of a young child or in a marriage is precious time indeed  For a 10 year old child  it is half of his life  And it is time that can never be recaptured  And  unfortunately  that five year time frame is often much less than what actually happens to these families   We re proposing that spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents be exempt from the visa caps and that we finally allow that these nuclear families  who have been separated for far too long  be reunited  This amendment is necessary because the compromise bill does absolutely nothing to bring these families together  In fact  the compromise actually reduces the number of visas for spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents  and it does not allocate a single visa to address the existing backlog for these family members  As I ve said many times before  we have a national interest in fostering strong families   This amendment is supported by more than 100 faith based family and immigrant advocacy organizations and denominations  And I want to thank all of these organizations that have endorsed and rallied support for the Clinton Hagel Menendez amendment  They do an invaluable service for people whose voices would otherwise not be heard   So  Mr  President  I hope that on this particular amendment  it s not considered a bill killer  It is not considered an amendment that everybody has to vote against who has agreed to the compromise because many of us know these legal permanent residents  Many of us actually work with them  Some of them even contribute to the campaigns of people in this chamber  These are people who are doing everything they can to play by the rules  except they are divided for years from their spouses and minor children   So  Mr  President  I would hope that this chamber would endorse this act of compassion and common sense  And I yield the floor
