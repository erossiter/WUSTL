                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator also Looking for Federal Waiver if Necessary of Per Capita Threshold for Disaster Assistance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today backed Governor Eliot Spitzers call for a Major Disaster Declaration as a result of flash flooding on June 19  2007  Governor Spitzer announced that he is requesting Individual Assistance and Public Assistance Categories for Delaware County and Hazard Mitigation statewide    The floods were not only devastating  they could not have come at a worse time  just as people are finally putting their lives back together after last years terrible rains  Local communities are not only struggling to recover  they are also struggling under the weight of the combined impact of last years floods and several instances of heavy rain in the past year  Costs are mounting up and our local authorities need financial aid now  I hope that the President recognizes just how much these communities are struggling and will make the necessary disaster assistance available as soon as possible  Senator Clinton said    In anticipation of a request for federal assistance from New York s Governor Spitzer  Senator Clinton and Representative Kirsten Gillibrand last week called on President Bush to quickly provide the necessary aid and assistance to the areas that have been hit by the recent flash flooding  as soon as it is formally requested by the Governor  In a letter to President Bush  Clinton and Gillibrand asked that as soon as he receives the request for disaster assistance from Governor Spitzer  the White House expedite FEMA s assessment of the storm damage and issue a Presidential Disaster Declaration consistent with the Stafford Act as soon as possible     Clinton and Gillibrand also asked that the President waive the per capita threshold for Public Assistance and provide relief if necessary  In order to be eligible for Public Assistance from FEMA  certain per capita damage assessment impact thresholds must be met  Currently that threshold is  1 22 for the State   3 05 for the County  At times there are extraordinary concentrations of damages that might warrant Federal assistance even if the statewide per capita is not met  This is particularly true where critical facilities are involved or where localized per capita impacts might be extremely high  Because the damage from these flash floods was very localized  Clinton and Gillibrand made the waiver request in case the threshold is not met     For more

22  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  D C   20500   Dear Mr  President    On June 19  a series of thunderstorms dropped 6 to 8 inches of rain in the span of three hours near the border of Sullivan and Delaware Counties with almost no warning   The National Weather Service anticipated severe thunderstorms in the area  however the flash flooding and destruction wrought by the storms has destroyed roads  bridges and homes in the Town of Colchester  in Delaware County    The Town of Colchester received eight inches of rain in less than two hours   This rain impacted two roads in Colchester  County Rt  7 and town road Holliday Brook   There are miles of the roads washed out   Six miles of the town road have been completely demolished   There has been one death reported already  and authorities suspect there could be more   The storm has left residents stranded and homes destroyed  It has also destroyed critical infrastructure    Currently the Town is working under four disaster declarations   1565 Hurricane Ivan September  2004  1589 April 2  2005  1650 June 2006  and 1670 November 2006   In addition to those floods  the town has suffered from 2 additional floods that did not receive a FEMA declaration that the Town is economically responsible for the damage suffered   The Town is extremely overwhelmed financially by these tragic events   Early estimates indicate over  10 million in damages just for the Town of Colchester alone   Delaware County may have sustained nearly  6 million in damages      Colchester is making an early loss projection of over  10 million and an early assessment of property damage just to Delaware County exceeds  5 million  These damage assessments only pertain to county roads  bridges and other infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed     We understand that at the request of Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York  the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  will be participating in joint State FEMA Preliminary Damage Assessments for both Individual Assistance and Public Assistance  along with locals and the SBA  in the affected areas    The damage that the thunderstorms have brought to Delaware County and specifically the Town of Colchester is nothing short of devastating   The extraordinary nature of this occurrence and the concentrated destruction on the Town of Colchester requires a federal and state response as quickly as possible   The Town of Colchester should not be penalized for being the only area that has sustained large amounts of damage   Given the extraordinary concentrations of damages sustained by the Town  Federal assistance should be provided even if the statewide per capita or county wide per capita damages are not met    Therefore  we urge you to waive the per capita threshold for disaster assistance and provide relief as soon as possible      Assistance is needed in the form of debris removal  infrastructure repair  small business loans  home repair  and other disaster related aid available from FEMA   In anticipation of a request from Governor Spitzer  we urge you to issue a Major Disaster Declaration consistent with the Stafford Act as soon as possible so we can provide the assistance that so many people desperately need       We thank you for your immediate consideration   Please do not hesitate to contact us should we be able to provide additional information    Sincerely     Hillary Rodham Clinton   Kirsten Gillibrand
