                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Underscores Critical Need to Meet Our Responsibilities to Our Men and Women in Uniform        Washington  DC   In a major address at the Center for American Progress  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today emphasized the failure to meet our responsibilities to our servicemen and women before they are deployed  when they are deployed and when they come home   Clinton called for immediate action steps to address challenges facing our troops and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again invest in our servicemembers             I believe that if you serve your country  your country must serve you well   That is the promise we make to all of those who enlist and to all those who go into battle   Sadly  as America learned these last few weeks  that is not always the case   There are huge gaps in the care  treatment  protection  survivor s benefits and educational benefits afforded our troops and their families   said Senator Clinton  Read  the full text         I am today proposing a series of steps to remedy these issues   to enact a new GI Bill of Rights and a series of reforms aimed at keeping our promise to those who give their all for their country   But I am saying something more  we will do everything we can in the Senate to fix this  but if it is not fixed  then the next president must overhaul the benefits we provide our troops to ensure that they never have to worry about having adequate protection in the field  never have to worry about having the best in healthcare  never have to worry about whether their family is being helped in a crisis and never have to worry about how they will be able to pay for college   I would reorder our defense priorities from wasting billions in funds in overpayments to contractors overseas that can t be accounted for and instead spend what it takes to replace this national disgrace with benefits that truly honor our soldiers  our veterans and their families   Senator Clinton emphasized          Senator Clinton today proposed three immediate action steps to address egregious problems facing our servicemen and women       Expanded Heroes at Home Initiative      Senator Clinton underscored that we have a duty to reform and ready the military for the increasing number of veterans suffering from complex injuries like traumatic brain injury  TBI    Last year  Senator Clinton authored legislation signed into law creating a groundbreaking  Heroes at Home  initiative aimed at helping U S  troops and their families to transition after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan and get the help they need with readjustment to work and coping with post traumatic stress disorder and TBI   Today  Senator Clinton announced a new initiative to expand Heroes at Home by improving the screening process for our troops before deployment to improve TBI diagnoses after deployment and help families struggling to take care of a loved one with training and certification for dealing with brain injuries and psychological injuries       Assistance for Orphaned Children   Senator Clinton underscored the unique challenges facing single parents deployed overseas and the unique hardship faced by these children when that parent is killed in the line of duty   These minor children  now orphaned  are often cared for by a loving but financially ill prepared grandparent  relative  or guardian   In too many cases  single parents killed in combat were not provided sufficient options to designate a guardian as a beneficiary for survivor benefits   Senator Clinton today announced a proposal to provide service members the option to select a guardian as a beneficiary to provide care for designated dependents   an option that does not currently exist        Independent Review of Disabilities Claims   Senator Clinton noted that one common denominator to many of the complaints that she heard from New York soldiers in her most recent visit to Walter Reed remains the disjointed and unfair process for evaluating disabilities  untrained and overworked staff  inaccurate documentation by a revolving door of medical providers  missing documents  lack of legal counsel  failures to adequately address wounds like TBI and the seemingly endless time spent waiting to start or complete the process   Another troubling development that highlights how our wounded heroes are being mistreated is the fact that 45 percent of Traumatic Servicemen s Group Life Insurance claims have been denied  an unacceptable rate for insurance designed to provide immediate financial relief for wounded service members and their families   Senator Clinton today outlined her proposal to fix the process that determines medical compensation for injured troops  calling for an independent review of previously denied cases and failed appeals and a new hearing for servicemembers when warranted          Senator Clinton also called for a comprehensive effort to renew and reenergize our commitment to those who wear our uniform   Senator Clinton announced that in the coming weeks  she will propose a new GI Bill of Rights for the 21st Century to honor the basic bargain at the heart of America s promise             If you do your part   or more than your part   your country will have your back    to achieve a college education  to afford housing  to start a small business  and more   said Senator Clinton    My parent s generation  the original beneficiaries of the GI Bill signed into law by President Roosevelt  believed in that basic bargain and understood that if the bargain wasn t honored for our soldiers and veterans it wasn t honored for anybody  That bargain helped a generation return from war to build the highways and schools  expand higher education in America  forge the great middle class  and unleash the creative and hardworking spirit of Americans           As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need   She has been a leading voice for making sure our troops have adequate body armor   She has worked for healthcare that recognizes the new realities facing our men and women in uniform and that honors our responsibility to our veterans   She has been an advocate for wounded troops stuck in red tape  and she has worked to stop in their tracks those who prey on soldiers trying to do the right thing for their families         SENATOR CLINTON    STANDING UP FOR SERVICEMEMBERS AND THEIR
