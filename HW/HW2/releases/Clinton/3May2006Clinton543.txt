May 3  2006 Statement Of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton On The Release Of President  s Pandemic Influenza Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC     The President  s pandemic plan is long on scary scenarios but short on specifics for how we will make sure we can respond adequately when crisis strikes  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made clear that we need clear lines of authority and accountability   However  under the President s plan  we still don t know who is accountable within our federal government   The responsibilities for federal coordination are split among the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   which will handle the medical response  and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   which will handle non medical support and response actions  as outlined in the government  s National Response Plan  Yet in the Administration  s own analysis of the response to Hurricane Katrina  HHS was criticized for failing to carry out its functions under the National Response Plan  It remains unclear what actions the federal government is taking to ensure that the mistakes of Katrina will not be repeated in a pandemic flu situation  and if DHS and HHS are truly prepared to cooperate in an emergency situation   The President s plan also pushes additional responsibility on the backs of states and local communities without providing additional federal funding   We cannot afford to wait for crisis to strike to address shortcomings in our plan for response            We are particularly vulnerable when it comes to vaccine distribution as our repeated shortages of seasonal flu vaccine have made all too clear   Pandemic influenza will place a great strain on our nation  and our public health system will need to respond to unforeseen complications for which we cannot plan   It is essential to establish a tracking system for vaccine distribution that can be used in both seasonal and pandemic events and have a system that is already operational  rather than rely on untried mechanisms in an emergency situation where we will already be facing multiple obstacles to delivery of health care          In order to address these concerns  I introduced the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Pat Roberts   Our legislation would establish a tracking system to better trace the distribution of vaccine from the factory to the provider and identify counties with high numbers of priority populations   With such a system in place  we could easily determine in times of shortage where vaccine is most needed and facilitate distribution to those areas   All of this could take place in a matter of hours  rather than days or weeks          Unless we take steps now to  set clear lines of authority  provide additional support for local preparedness efforts and reform the distribution  tracking and communication around seasonal flu vaccine  we won t be prepared to provide  adequate response  credible information or  sufficient treatment when a pandemic arrives   An ounce of prevention now is truly worth a pound of cure
