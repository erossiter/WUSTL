                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed her support and admiration for the life and work of Simon Wiesenthal this week  co sponsoring a Senate resolution in his honor  The resolution was proposed by her colleague Senator Schumer  honoring Wiesenthal  s life and accomplishments          Simon Wiesenthal was a man without peer    a tireless advocate who devoted his life to bringing some measure of justice to those who lost loved ones in the Holocaust and those who endured its terror  He was a one man global conscience and a true example to us all     Senator Clinton said    I am pleased to co sponsor this resolution with my colleague Senator Schumer as we honor his incredible life and enduring legacy            Text of the resolution follows        Whereas Simon Wiesenthal was born on December 31  1908 to Jewish merchants in Buczacz  in what is now the Lvov Oblast section of the Ukraine           Whereas after he was denied admission to the Polytechnic Institute in Lvov because of quota restrictions on Jewish students  Simon Wiesenthal received his degree in engineering from the Technical University of Prague in 1932           Whereas

Jewish professionals           Whereas following the Germany  s occupation of Ukraine in 1941  Simon Wiesenthal was initially detained in the Janwska concentration camp near Lvov  after which he and

sent to the Belzec death camp as part of Nazi Germany  s   Final Solution     and by the end of the next month 89 of his relatives had been killed           Whereas with the help of the Polish underground Simon Wiesenthal was able to help is wife escape the Ostbahn camp in 1942  and in 1943 was himself able to escape just before German guards began executing inmates  but was recaptured the following year and sent to the Janwska camp           Whereas following the collapse of the German eastern front the SS guards at Janwska took Simon Wiesenthal and the remaining camp survivors and

Soviet refugees  Simon Wiesenthal tenaciously continued his pursuit of Adolf Eichmann  who had served as the head of the Gestapo  s Jewish Department and supervised the implementation of the   Final Solution              Whereas in 1953 Simon Wiesenthal acquired evidence that Adolf Eichmann was living in Argentina and passed this information to the government of Israel           Whereas this information  coupled with information about Eichmann  s whereabouts in Argentina provided to Israel by Germany in 1959 led to Eichmann  s capture by Israeli agents  trial and conviction in Israel  and execution on May 31  1961           Whereas following Eichmann  s capture  Wiesenthal opened a new Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna with the purpose of collecting and analyzing information to aid

ensuring that the memory of the Holocaust and the sanctity of these sites are preserved             Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center played a pivotal role in convincing foreign governments to pass laws enabling the prosecution of Nazi war criminals            Whereas the Simon Wiesenthal Center Latin American played a key role in the identification and extradition of a number of Nazi war criminals including Erich Priebke  a former SS officer who was responsible for the infamous massacre at the Ardeatine Caves in Italy  and Dinko Sakic and his wife  Nada Sakic  who were charged with crimes against humanity in Croatia           Whereas throughout his lifetime  Simon Wiesenthal has had many honors and awards bestowed upon him including decorations from the Austrian and French

of Simon Wiesenthal    To those who know his story  one of miraculous survival and of relentless pursuit of justice  the answer is apparent  From the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust  only a few voices survived  to bear witness  to hold the guilty accountable  to honor the memory of those who were killed  Only if we heed these brave voices can we build a bulwark of humanity against the hatred and indifference that is still all too prevalent in this world of ours               Whereas  at the end of a life dedicated to the pursuit of justice and advocacy for victims of the Holocaust  Simon Wiesenthal passed away on September 20  2005 at the age of 96           Let it be resolved that                    Simon Wiesenthal  after surviving the Holocaust  spent more than 50 years helping to bring Nazi war criminals to justice  was a vigorous opponent of anti Semitism  neo Nazism  and racism                     The Congress of the United States recognizes and commends Simon Wiesenthal  s legacy of promoting tolerance  his tireless efforts to bring about justice  and the continuing pursuit of these ideals
