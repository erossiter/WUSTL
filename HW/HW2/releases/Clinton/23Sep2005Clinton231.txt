September 23  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Resignation of Lester Crawford                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      With the resignation of Dr  Crawford  the FDA has a real opportunity to restore its battered reputation and nominate a leader with vision and drive to ensure that the FDA upholds its gold standard of drug regulation   The FDA needs a Commissioner who improves the internal morale at the Agency and ensures that the voices of medical and scientific experts are heard        As I noted at his confirmation hearing  Dr  Crawford  s tenure at the FDA was marked by controversy  Under his watch  the agency faced scrutiny over its response to various crises  the failure to adequately warn us of the possibility of an influenza vaccine shortage  the failure to heed concerns about drug safety raised by both agency employees and outside scientists  and the failure to adequately separate science from what can only be seen as ideology driven decision making        The FDA is a vitally important agency  charged with ensuring that the products we rely on for our health and well being are safe and effective   Having a strong and experienced leader at the helm is essential to protect and enhance public health   I encourage the Bush Administration to send Congress a nominee who will put health and safety first and provide assurances that the FDA will make science  not ideology or other interests  the cornerstone of its decision making
