                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator writes Governor and President  urging them to secure disaster declaration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on both the State and Federal Governments to help provide financial assistance for several areas in the North Country that were severely affected by Monday s heavy rains  In letters to Governor George Pataki and President Bush  Senator Clinton urged them to take immediate action and issue a major disaster declaration  Such a declaration would make way for federal assistance to help local communities clean up and to repair damaged sections of I 87         The Senator today also reached out to Michael D  Brown  Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response in order to urge him to take action as quickly as possible to expedite sending FEMA damage assessment teams to the area  FEMA teams must state their recommendations before the President can make a major disaster declaration  Damage to areas in the North Country hard hit by Monday s storms have been estimated in the millions of dollars         The storm s violence has left communities and transportation in the North Country in a terrible mess  Many local residents have been seriously affected and they need our help immediately   Senator Clinton said   On the eve of the crucial summer tourist season  we need to expedite State and Federal assistance to repair I 87 so that those traveling through New York can get back on the road and local communities can rebuild and continue their livelihoods         A Presidential Major Disaster Declaration would put into motion long term federal recovery programs  some of which are matched by state programs  designed to help disaster victims  businesses and public entities  A Major Disaster Declaration is requested by the Governor  based on the damage assessment and an agreement to commit state funds and resources to the long term recovery  FEMA then evaluates the request and recommends action to the White House based on the disaster and the local community and the State s ability to recover  If declared  funding comes from the President s Disaster Relief Fund  which is managed by FEMA  and disaster aid programs of other participating federal agencies         Copies of Senator Clinton s letters are attached        June 15  2005       The Honorable George E  Pataki  Governor  State of New York  State Capitol  Albany  New York 12224       Dear Governor Pataki        As you are aware  many parts of northeastern New York State experienced disastrous weather conditions and flooding earlier this week  Some of the initial reports indicate such severe damage as a mudslide closing a 16 mile stretch of Interstate 87 just 60 miles north of Albany resulting in approximately 13 000 vehicles being diverted        Among the hardest hit areas were the counties of Essex and Warren  which were deluged with several inches of rain and subsequent flooding and mudslides  power outages  and substantial damage to homes and public infrastructure  Many residents have now been displaced from their homes and published reports are estimating the damage to be in the millions of dollars         I understand that yesterday you toured some of the affected counties in northern New York to assess the impact of the floods  I hope that as a result of what you have seen first hand  you will seek a Disaster Declaration from the President should the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  assessments warrant such a declaration         In addition  I will be in contact with FEMA and the White House to urge them to act expeditiously on your request for a disaster declaration so that federal assistance can be provided         Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton                 June 15  2005       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  D C  20500       Dear Mr  President        I write to ask for your full  expeditious consideration of the Governor of New York s request for a major disaster declaration for the counties of Essex and Warren in New York and any additional counties suffering similar damage        Excessive rains on June 13  2005  caused damage and flash flooding to many parts of northeastern New York State  Assistance is needed in the form of debris removal  infrastructure repair  small business loans  and other assistance available from FEMA         Many areas received near record levels of flooding resulting in closed roads and widespread damage  Nearly 2 000 residents were left without water after flash floods and mudslides tore out swaths of asphalt roadway and a water main  Another major mudslide closed a 16 mile stretch of the main highway linking New York and Montreal  I ask that you instruct FEMA to conduct the necessary damage assessments and provide a recommendation to you for a disaster declaration as soon as possible         I thank you for your consideration of this request         Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
