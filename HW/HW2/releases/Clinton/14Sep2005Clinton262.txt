September 14  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Consideration of the Katrina Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC     Four years ago this week  our nation was grappling with the catastrophic aftermath of the attacks on 9 11   What happened on that tragic day changed my state of New York  our nation  s capital and our country forever          Over the past two weeks  we have come to a similar realization about Hurricane Katrina   The Hurricane left in its path not just death and devastation  but a deep  lasting scar   And while we must now work to do everything we can to help the victims of this national tragedy  we must also do everything we can to make sure that the mistakes that were made never happen again          I called for an independent Katrina Commission because it is simply not appropriate for government to investigate itself   If we are truly going to provide the people in the Gulf    and all Americans    with the answers they deserve  we need an independent commission free of partisan politics   It is also important that Congress not be distracted from the task at hand    making sure that our fellow citizens get all the help they need as they recover and rebuild          What happened today on the Senate floor is the same thing that happened four years ago when our nation was desperately searching for answers after 9 11   Urgent calls for an independent commission were repeatedly ignored  but the American people did not fall silent   They continued to demand action and eventually the Administration relinquished its opposition to the 9 11 Commission   And our nation was well served by the Commission  s work          On behalf of the people of the Gulf who I visited with last week in Houston  and all Americans who are demanding answers  I will continue to fight for the creation of the Katrina Commission   I firmly believe that we need to look back to see what went wrong so we can move forward and do better   Only through an independent Katrina Commission will we be able to know that no storm or no act of terrorism will ever again leave us so unable to respond
