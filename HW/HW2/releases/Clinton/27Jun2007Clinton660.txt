June 27  2007 Clinton and Reynolds Introduce the Screening for Health of Infants and Newborns  SHINE  Act of 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Representative Thomas Reynolds  R NY  today introduced in both chambers of Congress the Screening for Health of Infants and Newborns  SHINE  Act of 2007   The legislation will allow for the expansion of newborn screening programs at the state level   It also will create a clearinghouse of newborn screening information to increase understanding of newborn diseases and screening services and offer research funding to develop new screening tools for additional life threatening disorders    I am proud that New York has been a leader in newborn screening  However  we want to ensure that the great strides made by New York can be a model for all states and that New York can continue to make advancements that will benefit children around the nation   Every child should have access to screening tests that can help identify serious conditions and allow parents to seek treatments as early as possible  said Senator Clinton    This legislation is a tribute to children and their parents who have had to face the pain of experiencing a disease that wasn t caught by infant screening  children like Hunter Kelly and his parents Jim and Jill  Congressman Reynolds said   Every child born with a disease  whether it is common or rare  should receive an early diagnosis   The Shine Act will help make sure all newborns are screened and have a chance to receive the needed treatment    Each year in our nation  at least four million newborns are screened and severe disorders are detected in 5 000 of them   These disorders are often life threatening and can cause serious mental and physical disabilities if left untreated   Early detection by newborn screening can lessen these side effects  or completely prevent progression of many of these disorders if medical intervention can be started early enough   Newborn screening experts suggest states should test for a minimum of 29 treatable core conditions  While New York currently screens for 44 conditions  some states screen for as few as seven conditions     The SHINE Act is supported by the following organizations  American College of Medical Genetics  March of Dimes  Hunter s Hope Foundation  Save Babies through Screening Foundation  Blythedale Children s Hospital  and Pediatrix Medical Group and its subsidiary  Pediatrix Screening
