January 16  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Commemorating Martin Luther King  Jr  Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            New York  NY      Across America  people young and old are gathering to pay tribute to a man who gave voice to a movement and transformed a nation by peaceful protest  by faith  and by a profound belief that every single American deserves the freedom to reach his or her potential   Martin Luther King  Jr  fought for the millions of African Americans    and all Americans    struggling to find work  to be treated fairly  to have the chance to live a life of their choosing  He believed in the promise of America and the promise of democracy  It is his memory    and his belief in that promise    that we honor today            In 1963  Martin Luther King marched on Washington  That day and every day he called for freedom  On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial  before hundreds of thousands on the National Mall  he said    Let freedom ring      Those were more than words to him and to the millions of men and women  white and black  who heard them and cheered and pledged to do their part   Freedom was a call to action and it must be ours as well           At times  when we see the priorities of this Congress and White House  it can be frustrating  But I hope that this day reminds all of us of what can be achieved when we work together  stick by our principles  and stand up for what we believe   I pledge to do my part by continuing to fight in the Senate to make progress toward greater freedom and opportunity for all Americans  for health care that allows all Americans to have a healthy life and a healthy start  for education that gives all of our children the chance to reach their potential and for a budget in line with our values              As a nation  we have made great strides thanks to the foundation Dr  King built and the movement he inspired  But  to paraphrase Dr  King  we  ve come a long  long way  but still have a long  long way to go   Today and every day  we can honor Dr  King  s legacy by working for greater freedom and opportunity for all Americans  Together  we can continue to build an America that is fairer and freerer  stronger and better
