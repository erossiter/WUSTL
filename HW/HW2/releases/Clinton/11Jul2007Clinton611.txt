July 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on House Vote on FDA Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC  It is disappointing that the House bill does not include a workable pathway to end drug companies monopoly on biologic drugs   These are among the most promising  cutting edge treatments and making them more affordable and accessible will help drive down healthcare costs and improve the quality of care for more Americans  I am committed to working with my colleagues to include a pathway for follow on versions of biologic medications in the conference report   I will also work to make sure the final bill reauthorizes the Pediatric Rule  which I secured in law to require drug companies to prove that medications marketed for use in children are safe and effective for our kids
