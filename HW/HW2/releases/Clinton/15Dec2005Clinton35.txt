December 15  2005 Senator Clinton On National Assessment Of Adult Literacy  Call To Action To Improve Our Nation s Education System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Today  the National Center on Education Statistics of the Department of Education released a national assessment  the first since 1992  of our nation s literacy levels    The Center also released a New York state specific report   Both reports show that our nation s education system is failing many Americans  particularly people of color         This report is a real wake up call for policymakers and educators   said Senator Clinton   Unfortunately  it confirms what I ve heard from employers for years    far too many New Yorkers lack the skills to compete in today s economy   The No Child Left Behind Act shined a bright light on the achievement gap and we have made some progress  But this stunning report illustrates that we still have a long way to go   No Child Left Behind was supposed to be a combination of real reform and the resources needed to make that reform real  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has failed to deliver the resources it promised  In 2005  New York received  729 1 million less than what the state was promised under No Child Left Behind   Nationally  the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress have provided nearly  7 billion less than what was promised when the law passed   We need high standards and high quality teachers   To deliver both  we need the President and the Republican leadership in Congress to keep their promises   said Senator Clinton         The report found that only 11 percent of New Yorkers and 13 percent of Americans nationwide are proficient in basic reading skills   The average literacy of blacks and Asian Pacific Islanders is significantly lower in New York than across the nation   Thirty percent of blacks in New York read at a below basic level  according to the assessment  and only one percent are proficient  Whites fared somewhat better  Sixteen percent of whites in New York are proficient in reading and only nine percent read at a below basic level        Senator Clinton has consistently fought for more resources for New York schools   On October 26  2005  Senator Clinton offered an amendment to meet the federal government s promise to fully fund special education by providing  243 million for New York Schools  She also co sponsored an amendment to provide the promised funded level for No Child Left Behind in the FY06 education spending bill
