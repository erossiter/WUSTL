April 6  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Fire and Shutdown at Indian Point 3 Nuclear Plant Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Today s fire resulted in the fourth unplanned shutdown of Indian Point Unit 3 since July  This constant stream of problems simply does not square with the insistence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Entergy that an Independent Safety Assessment is not needed at Indian Point   The best way forward would be for both Entergy and the NRC to embrace an Independent Safety Assessment but in the absence of such a commitment  I will continue to press for action on my legislation to require an ISA
