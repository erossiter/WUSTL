March 20  2006 Senators Clinton  Schumer and Representatives Slaughter  Higgins Urge President Bush to Compensate Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Letter to President Bush Seeks Approval of   Special Cohort    Petition Filed by Bethlehem Steel Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer and Representatives Louise Slaughter and Brian Higgins today wrote to President Bush urging him to approve a special cohort petition recently filed by a group of former Bethlehem Steel workers   Approval of the petition would enable eligible Bethlehem Steel workers to be added to a   special exposure cohort    and receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program without going through case by case radiation dose estimates             The President can right the wrong that has been done to Bethlehem Steel nuclear workers and their families  who have not received the compensation they deserve     said Senator Clinton    I hope he acts swiftly to bring justice and closure to these Cold War heroes                  We need to give New York  s Cold War heroes the support they need  and their petition for a Special Exposure Cohort will make all the difference in getting them the compensation they rightly deserve     Schumer said     I have heard heartbreaking stories of friends and loved ones dying of cancers at a young age  and everyone involved is frustrated with this endless process  These former nuclear workers can t wait another minute to find information that could make a difference to their claims               The President has the responsibility to see that Bethlehem Steel workers are compensated for the brave and often dangerous work they did for the national security of this country   I urge him to designate Bethlehem Steel with special exposure status without delay     Congresswoman Slaughter said             This is a matter of justice for workers who helped win the Cold War and their families   The President has the ability to instruct the Administration to designate the special cohort  he needs to do the right thing and stop delaying   said Rep  Higgins            Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 to compensate workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War  Under EEOICPA  former nuclear workers or their survivors were eligible to file claims with the US Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history             Claims are decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history  Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was likely to have caused the worker  s illness  This   dose reconstruction    process has been time consuming and controversial  particularly at facilities like Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna  New York  where workers did not wear individual radiation monitors  and there was minimal monitoring of ambient radiation  For Bethlehem Steel workers  compensation decisions have been made using a radiation exposure model that relies on data from another facility  the Simonds Saw facility in Lockport  New York             Anticipating problems with poor records  EEOICPA also provides a process by which groups of workers can petition the Department of Labor to be designated as members of a   special exposure cohort      Being added to a cohort means that employees do not have to go through a   dose reconstruction    process  Instead  if a person has an eligible cancer and worked at a facility when weapons work was performed  their cancer is presumed to have been caused by workplace exposure and the person  s claim is paid   Bethlehem Steel workers recently filed such a petition  which will require approval by several executive branch agencies              The full text of the letter follows          March 20  2006          The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  D C  20500         Dear Mr  President          We write to ask for your help in delivering long overdue justice to Western New Yorkers who were on the front lines of the Cold War    the former employees of the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna  New York         During the early Cold War  the federal government lacked the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons in federal facilities and turned to the private sector for help   Workers at these private facilities helped to create the huge nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War   However  in the process  they handled dangerous radioactive materials  often without their knowledge or consent   Although government scientists knew of the dangers posed by the radiation  workers were given little or no protection   Many of these workers subsequently contracted cancer  or beryllium disease or chronic silicosis           In recognition of this injustice to workers and their families  Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act in 2000    The law enabled nuclear workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis to file a claim with the United States Department of Labor  DOL   and be eligible for a payment of  150 000 and medical benefits   To decide the claims  the law called for a science based process to use information about worker exposure to radiation to reconstruct worker radiation doses and thereby determine if a claimant  s illness was more than likely to have resulted from workplace exposure to radiation   The law also directed the Department of Labor to establish a separate process  known as the   special cohort    process  to decide groups of claims at facilities where a lack of data prevented dose reconstructions from being completed with sufficient accuracy              At Bethlehem Steel  workers did not wear individual radiation exposure monitors when uranium was processed there   The few ambient air samples from that time period were taken at monitors that were far removed from the rollers where exposure was the greatest    In spite of this nearly complete lack of data about worker exposure at Bethlehem Steel  the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  has used data from other facilities to reconstruct individual radiation doses for Bethlehem Steel claimants   As a result  many claims have been unfairly denied            We have stood with the workers and their families throughout this lengthy process  and have called on NIOSH to make the needed corrections   NIOSH concluded its original profile of conditions at the Bethlehem Steel site    the document that is the basis of dose reconstructions   without even interviewing surviving workers   These workers then came forward with information that showed major flaws in the site profile document   NIOSH has subsequently made some improvements as a result  but has refused to accept the fundamental point that we and the workers have repeatedly made   the data needed to accurately reconstruct radiation doses for Bethlehem Steel workers simply does not exist   Given this fact  the law requires that they be given the benefit of the doubt  and placed in a special cohort              We therefore call on you to direct NIOSH and the DOL to follow the law  and create a special cohort to decide claims filed by Bethlehem Steel workers and their survivors   Bethlehem Steel workers recently submitted a special cohort petition  and it should be processed and approved with urgency   Only speedy approval of a special cohort for the Bethlehem Steel workers can salvage the justice promised to these workers and their families more than six years ago   Your leadership can make the difference for these deserving Cold War heroes  and we urge you to exercise it now          Thank you for your consideration   We look forward to your reply              Sincerely
