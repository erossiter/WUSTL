March 29  2007 Senators Clinton and Kerry Introduce  Zero Emissions Building Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Bill Would Require New Federal Buildings to be Carbon Neutral by 2030                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Senator John Kerry  D MA  today announced introduction of the  Zero Emissions Building Act of 2007    The bill directs federal agencies to immediately require that all new federal buildings or major renovations reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50 percent as compared to a 2003 baseline   In 2010  and every five years after that  the emissions reduction level would increase by 10 percent  until new federal buildings become  zero emissions  buildings in 2030   The legislation would also apply to major renovations of existing federal buildings             This legislation sets an ambitious goal of making new federal buildings carbon neutral by 2030   said Senator Clinton   Buildings account for 40 percent of global warming pollution in the United States  and the federal government should lead the way in developing building designs and technologies to reduce these emissions             The federal government is not only the nation s single largest energy consumer  but the number one energy waster as well  About  1 billion in taxpayer dollars is squandered every day due the needless wastefulness of outdated technology   said Senator Kerry   We know that energy efficiency is the fastest  cheapest  surest way to strengthen America s energy security  environmental quality  and economic vitality   and the federal government should be taking the lead  I am proud of the legislation we are introducing today and I look forward to working with Senator Clinton to pass it           Buildings could achieve the goals of the bill in three ways            First  by using design principles and energy technologies  such as building orientation  daylighting  efficient lighting  and ground source heat pumps            Second  by using on site generation of renewables  such as solar photovoltaics          Third  any remaining emissions would be offset by efficiency projects in other federal buildings          Many of these technologies are being used successfully today by both the federal government and the private sector   For example  the Government Services Administration recently constructed a Denver courthouse that uses natural light in 75 percent of the building            The legislation builds on successful programs that have been implemented in the past   Executive Order 13123  which was issued by President Clinton in June 1999  required each federal agency to reduce energy consumption per gross square foot at existing facilities by 30 percent by 2005 and by 35 percent by 2010  relative to a 1985 baseline   Two years ago  the Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the energy reduction goals outlined in Executive Order 13123 for existing federal buildings by mandating that agencies use a new baseline of 2003 energy consumption and achieve additional reductions per gross square foot of 2 percent each year beginning in 2006 and ending with a 20 percent reduction by the year 2015          Experts predict that over the next 30 years  the current U S  building stock of 300 billion square feet will change dramatically  with 52 billion square feet being demolished  150 billion square feet remodeled and another 150 billion square feet being added
