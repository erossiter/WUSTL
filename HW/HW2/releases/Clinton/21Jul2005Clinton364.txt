July 21  2005 Senators Clinton  Chafee And Reid Introduce Bill to Expand Biomonitoring and Establish a Nationwide Health Tracking Network                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY   Lincoln Chafee  RI  and Harry Reid  NV   the Senate Minority Leader  today introduced the Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act of 2005 to expand the Centers for Disease Control biomonitoring work  establish a nationwide tracking network to help identify connections between disease and environment and develop a response system for addressing public health threats                Today  s release of the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals by the Centers for Disease Control underscores the need to better understand which chemicals we are exposed to and what the effects are     said Senator Clinton     Our legislation will expand on the CDC  s biomonitoring work  and will give us new tools to draw links between disease and environmental causes   Establishing a comprehensive tracking network will enable us to unlock the mystery behind unexplained clusters of chronic disease  like the high rates of breast cancer on Long Island and similar examples in communities across the country               The coordination of our public health surveillance systems is long overdue   said Senator Chafee     A coordinated environmental health tracking network will allow the critical linkage between environmental factors and chronic disease to be made so that outbreaks are responded to quickly  and future public health emergencies can be averted             In the small town of Fallon  Nevada 17 children out of a community of only a few thousand have been afflicted with leukemia   Three of those children have died   As a parent  I can think of nothing more heartbreaking than watching a child battle a life threatening illness  and nothing more frustrating than not knowing the cause of that disease     said Reid  the Senate  s Minority Leader     Our legislation will help put in place a system to finding answers to these horrible questions   The bill is designed to track the outbreak of disease  locate potential environmental causes and start working on ways to prevent tragedies like cancer clusters from occurring in other communities                The legislation would increase authorized funding for the biomonitoring work that underpins the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals released today by the CDC   This latest CDC report documents exposure levels to 148 chemicals  and includes exposure data on 32 new chemicals   In addition to increasing funding for biomonitoring  the legislation would create the infrastructure necessary to collect  analyze  and report data on the rate of disease and the presence of relevant environmental factors and exposures   The Network would also coordinate national  state  and local efforts to bolster our public health system s capacity to investigate and respond aggressively to environmental exposures that threaten health  In addition  the Coordinated Environmental Health Network will alert health officials when there is a sudden increase in any disease or condition  including those associated with a biological or chemical attack           The nation s existing public health surveillance systems were developed when the major threats to health were infectious agents   Currently  over 50 infectious diseases are tracked on a national basis  but now chronic diseases  such as cancer and cardiovascular disease are the nation s number one killers  and there is evidence that rates of some chronic diseases and conditions are rising  Survey data from the CDC suggests that endocrine and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and neurological conditions including migraines and multiple sclerosis have risen roughly 20 percent between 1986 and 1995  and some have cited an increase in autoimmune diseases  and learning disabilities  Yet our systems for tracking chronic disease are woefully underdeveloped           Once fully operational  the network will coordinate national  state  and local efforts to inform communities  public health officials  researchers  and policymakers of potential environmental health risks  and to integrate this information with other parts of the public health system
