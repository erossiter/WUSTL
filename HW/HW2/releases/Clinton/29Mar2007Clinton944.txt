March 29  2007 Senator Clinton Secures Agreement for Federal Railroad Administration Statewide Investigation into Major New York Rail Lines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Meets with Federal Railroad Administrator Boardman to Express Serious Concerns Over Recent Train Derailments in New York Washington DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today personally expressed her serious concerns to Federal Railroad Administrator  FRA  Joe Boardman about the state of New York s rail system and the Administration s response to the recent train derailments  At a meeting in her Washington  DC office  Senator Clinton said she was concerned that the recent FRA inspection into CSX track across 23 states raised questions about the condition  not only of the CSX track  but of non CSX track as well and asked the Administrator to undertake a full investigation into all of the state s railroad tracks  Senator Clinton also presented Administrator Boardman with a detailed letter outlining her concerns and requests           During the meeting  the Administrator agreed that he would expand his investigation into non CSX rail lines in New York and said he would ensure that railroads are in compliance with the FRA safety regulations  He also said he would report back to Senator Clinton as the review process continues           It was good to meet with Administrator Boardman today to talk to him personally about my concerns with railroad safety in New York   Senator Clinton said   I made it known to him that I want a full and comprehensive investigation of rail safety in New York and I was very pleased when he agreed that he would expand his investigation to non CSX track  After the alarming results of the FRA s recent report on CSX  we must do everything we can to ensure the safety of railroad tracks all across the state and this includes conducting a thorough state wide investigation  as well as ensuring CSX compliance with FRA s safety regulations  Administrator Boardman s commitment is certainly a positive step but I look forward to seeing the progress that CSX and the FRA make and I will continue to closely monitor this situation as we go forward           Earlier this week the FRA released a report detailing the disturbing findings of a 23 state inspection of CSX railroad tracks and procedures following several recent train derailments  Over 3 000 problems and violations were discovered during the course of the investigation with sixty of the 583 inspections taking place in New York   The report found 376 defects  including 13 violations along CSX track in New York  Following the train derailment earlier this month in Oneida  Senator Clinton wrote a letter to Administrator Boardman expressing the need for a state wide investigation into all New York railroad tracks  Read More     The full text of today s letter to Administrator Boardman is below      The Honorable Joseph H  Boardman  Administrator  Federal Railroad Administration  United States Department of Transportation  1120 Vermont Avenue  N W  7th Floor  Washington  D C  20005      Dear Administrator Boardman       I thank you for your recent investigations into New York s rail lines and for your efforts to ensure New York s tracks are safe and secure   The recent 23 state report issued by the Federal Railroad Administration  FRA  on the conditions of CSX railroad is deeply troubling   In the State of New York  60 inspections conducted by the FRA revealed 376 defects  including an alarming 13 violations   Violations cited include failure to replace defective rails and joint bars  rail cars standing on mainline tracks with no hand brake applied  failure to properly maintain records on signal testing  mechanical crews working on equipment without safety signals and tank cars with hazardous materials found with loose closures            While the report certainly raises a red flag on track owned by CSX  it also raises serious questions about other non CSX owned track   I believe that we must conduct a comprehensive investigation of all railroad track throughout the state   We must determine whether the issues cited with CSX track are unique or whether other non CSX railroads face similar problems  I appreciate your recent announcement that you will use the T 16 automated inspection car to investigate the recent derailments in New York State  but I hope you will personally take the necessary steps to investigate non CSX owned track as well           In addition to expanding your investigation  we must also ensure that the defects and violations found in the report are rectified immediately   We cannot sit idly by  waiting for the next derailment   Enforcement and compliance on the part of railroads with rail safety is paramount  I hope that you will take active and public steps to determine that CSX is in compliance with your safety regulations  I understand that Michael Ward  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CSX Corporation  has assured you that CSX Transportation will move promptly and aggressively to address safety concerns and I hope you will personally monitor their progress to ensure that all the safety concerns and violations are addressed immediately           We cannot compromise when it comes to the safety of New York s railroads   I look forward to working with you to address this need as quickly as possible          Sincerely Yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
