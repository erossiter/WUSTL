November 20  2007 Senator Clinton Urges White House to Release Remaining  20 Million in LIHEAP Contingency Funds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clinton Urges Action to Assist Low Income Households in Coming Winter Months as Energy Prices Reach Record Highs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that she has joined a bipartisan coalition of Senators in calling on President Bush to make available the remaining  20 million in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund for low income households   In a letter to the President  the bipartisan group urged him to provide assistance to households this winter that are facing hardship due to rapidly increasing energy costs by releasing the contingency funding  and to also support at least  2 411 billion for the LIHEAP program in FY2008      With temperatures dropping and energy prices now reaching record highs  we cannot wait to provide struggling families with the assistance they need to keep their homes warm  The President should take a proactive step by releasing the LIHEAP contingency funds now  said Senator Clinton  Nobody should be forced to choose between paying for food or prescriptions and paying their energy bills  but that is exactly the kind of false and dangerous choice that many people are facing this year  LIHEAP can offer critical assistance to families who face this unthinkable situation  and the time to act is now    Senator Clinton has worked tirelessly to increase LIHEAP funding to make sure low income New Yorkers are able to heat their homes in the midst of record energy costs  Earlier this month Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined several of her senate colleagues in calling on the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  to support a funding level of  5 1 billion for LIHEAP for the FY 2009  See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 287040     LIHEAP protects public health and safety by helping low income families pay for high energy costs  In FY 2006 this critical program served approximately 904 705 households throughout New York State who struggled to cope with the soaring costs and diminishing availability of home heating fuel  According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels this winter than during the 2006 2007 winter  Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02     A copy of the letter sent to President Bush follows     November 20  2007   The President  The White House  Washington  D C   20500   Dear Mr  President    We are writing to request that you release the remaining  20 million in contingency LIHEAP funds and to urge you to support at least  2 411 billion for the LIHEAP program in FY2008   With the price of oil approaching  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter    Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population   During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305   Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise   Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02   As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power    According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding   The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million    LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children   In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances      We request that your Administration release funding from the LIHEAP contingency fund to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses and we urge you to support at least  2 411 billion for the program in FY2008      Sincerely
