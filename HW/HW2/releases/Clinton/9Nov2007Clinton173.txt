                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Funding Included in Department of Defense Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate has approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report  which includes  20 1 million in defense funding for Long Island    The bill  having been approved by both chambers of Congress  will now be sent to the President for his signature    This funding is a huge boost not only for Long Island  but for our men and women serving overseas  said Senator Schumer  This  20 million in defense funding will ensure that Long Island continues to be at the forefront of defense technology in America  while also strengthening the local economy and bolstering Long Islands role in protecting our service men and women abroad  I am pleased that the Senate passed this essential funding  and will continue to fight for this important bill for Long Islands local defense infrastructure and reputation    This is wonderful news for Long Island  and approval by the Senate is the next step in ensuring that these key projects receive the funds necessary to help them move forward  As these local companies continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  This funding is an important investment in Long Island for many reasons  not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said    The  20 1 million for Long Island in the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes   Northrop Grumman  AN SPQ 9B Radar for DDG 51 Modernization    4 8 million   The AN SPQ 9B radar provides early and reliable horizon surveillance including detection of sea skimmer missiles at an ultra low false alarm rate  gunfire control against surface targets  and an aid to navigation   The DDG Modernization program is scheduled to deliver the first modernized ship  DDG 51  in FY10   Funding will initiate AN SPQ 9B radar procurement now in order to make an AN SPQ 9B radar available for the programs in yard need date in the first quarter of FY10    STIDD Systems  Recon Navigation  RNAV  for Diver Propulsion Devices  DPD     2 4 million   The Recon Navigation System  RNAV  is an innovative  mission essential equipment upgrade for the Armys fleet of Diver Propulsion Devices  DPD    Army DPDs are currently equipped with only an antiquated compass and depth gauge for navigation purposes   The RNAV offers Army Divers a precise  rugged  reliable underwater navigation and reconnaissance data collection system  mapping   which may be mounted in and powered by the DPDs onboard lithium ion battery system   Funding will provide US Army Divers a commercial off the shelf RNAV for the Armys entire fleet of DPDs  Funding directly supports a Department of the Army Required Capability Document  RCD  which requires an electronic reconnaissance and navigation system for the DPD   Curtiss Wright Corporation  JP 5 Manifold  globe  Electric Valve Operator  EVO     1 6 million   JP 5 Electric Valve Operators control the flow of aircraft fuel from the storage tanks to the flight deck of aircraft carriers during flight operations and ballasting  There are 430 of these manifold valve operators onboard each Nimitz Class carrier   Current generation valve operators are prone to frequent breakdowns  replacement and servicing  and leakage that create environmental challenges and fire hazards   Funding would help to sustain production and installation of JP 5 Manifold  globe  Electric Valve Operators  EVO  on Nimitz Class Aircraft Carrier aviation fueling systems and would support an EVO upgrade of old generation valve operators already produced and paid for by the Navy   Precision Pharma  Fibrin Adhesive Stat  FAST  Dressing    2 Million   The FAST Dressing is effective against all kinds of blood loss  including severe arterial and venous bleeding  Funding will help to develop the manufacturing process for the dressing and to test the product in order to apply for FDA permission to conduct clinical studies   Interdigital Communications  Advanced Wireless Technologies    500 000   The Communications Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center  CERDEC  Space  Terrestrial Communications Directorate is working to adapt Third Generation  3G  commercial wireless technology for application in several important military programs  Funding would support the demonstration of the feasibility of a 3G tactical wireless handset  including delivery of a prototype radio chipset that can operate in a frequency band that has been selected by the government allowing for worldwide terrestrial operation    Truetech   M291 M295 Skin Equipment Chemical Decontamination Kits    5 6 Million   The M291 Skin Decontamination Kit  SDK  is a chemical skin decontamination device for the U S  warfighter  This kit decontaminates skin from known nerve and blister agent threats   Funding will be used to sustain current operations for the M291 SDK and to conduct a pilot to renew the M295 equipment decontamination kit as it was originally developed using M291 SDK technology   L 3 Communications  Ground Multiband Terminal    1 6 million   Ground Multi band Terminal  GMT  systems support warfighter tactical communications using military and commercial satellites  GMT provides a robust communications capability in C  X  Ku and Ka frequency bands and will replace the Ground Mobile Force  GMF  terminals that are reaching the end of their life cycles   Stony Brook University  Cancer Prevention through Remote Biological Sensing    1 6 million   Funding will be used to design and develop prototype wireless data collection and deployment infrastructure for collecting information detected by biocompatible wireless sensors and to develop the sensors themselves   The method supported by the wireless infrared sensors seeks to detect and eliminate cancer at its earliest stages  thus minimizing loss of manpower and  compared to standard treatments  reducing health expenses dramatically   The system could also measure non cancer related molecules and viruses  such as those that can be used in biological warfare  The simplicity  low cost and real time responses of the system could allow a  real time remote wireless monitoring of military personnel for exposure to toxic chemicals or biological agents  and b  programmed  operator independent responses  such as administration of an antidote  Additionally  the approach could enable real time remote and wireless monitoring in humans of other parameters such as markers of endurance or performance status  An example would be the oxygenation status of pilots
