July 30  2007 Clinton and Bishop Come to the Aid of New York s Commercial Fishermen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lawmakers Urge an Audit of the SAFIS System for Reporting Quantity Fish Caught During Specific Seasons  Error Caused Catch Limits for Fishermen to Be Reduced  Forcing a Loss in Profits                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Tim Bishop today called on the National Marine Fisheries Service to conduct an audit of the system that is responsible for the reporting and accounting of the amount of fish caught during a given fishing season  In a letter to William Hogarth  Director  National Marine Fisheries Service  NMFS   Senator Clinton and Congressman Bishop expressed their concerns about potentially incorrect information involving scup catch  which led to a drastic cut in quotas for New York fishermen    Commercial fishing is a historically vital industry  especially on Long Island  and it s unconscionable to think that our fishermen whose livelihoods are tied to the NMFS system have suffered considerable financial losses because of what may have been a preventable error  said Senator Clinton  It s not enough to recognize the mistake  We must take immediate action so that this problem does not repeat itself  and so that our fishermen can continue to build profitable businesses by fishing to the maximum allowable quota    This is a simple request   Determine if there is an error  and if so  assist those who were harmed and put systems in place so it is not repeated  said Congressman Bishop   Fishing is not just a part of Long Island s heritage   It is a vibrant component of our economy   As long as our fishermen are working hard and attempting to play by the rules  NMFS needs to make sure those rules are fairly enforced    The Standard Atlantic Fisheries Information System  SAFIS  system is presently used so that fish dealers can electronically report to NMFS the number of fish they have purchased from commercial fishermen on a given day  Currently  this system allows a dealer who is purchasing fish to automatically enter the date of purchase as the date landed although the actual date of purchase is often a few days after the fish are caught in New York State  It is believed that the current scup problem occurred during a change in seasons when fish that were caught at the very end of the Winter season were purchased at the beginning of the Summer season  and erroneously attributed to the Summer catch     This artificial spike at the beginning of the season caused NMFS to determine that New York was nearing its catch limits   As a result  the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation  NYDEC  drastically cut its scup quota from 250 pounds to 60 pounds per day from June 7 30   This cost affected fishermen an average of  6 000 over that span      In order to resolve this problem  Clinton and Bishop have recommended that the SAFIS system be updated so that the date purchased cannot automatically be entered as the date landed  They have also urged NMFS to conduct an audit of New York s data in the weeks during the change of season to ensure that fish caught in the Winter are correctly applied to the Winter quota in order to prevent cutbacks in the quota for New York s fishermen during the summer months    A copy of Senator Clinton and Congressman Bishop s letter follows       William Hogarth  Ph D    Director   National Marine Fisheries Service   Room 14222   1315 East West Highway   Silver Spring  Maryland 20910    Dear Dr  Hogarth     We write to follow up on our July 9  2007  meeting in East Hampton  New York  concerning the National Marine Fisheries Service s  NMFS  system of dealer reporting and accounting for the number of fish landed in a given time period  As you know  this system is adversely affecting New York State s commercial fishermen  It is our understanding that the current reporting system utilizes the Standard Atlantic Fisheries Information System  SAFIS  system for Dealer Electronic Reporting  whereby fish dealers electronically report the number of fish they have purchased on any given day to the NMFS resulting in a disparity at the close of the season between the total number of purchased fish and the total number of landed fish     We understand that scup landed at the end of April in the 2007 Winter Season I  when the quota was 30 000 pounds per trip  were purchased by a fish dealer in early May of 2007  and wrongfully attributed to the Summer I  May  period  when the quota was 100 pounds per day  As a result of this error  daily catch limits were reduced for Summer I period  thereby limiting the June  July  and August catch profitability margins to the detriment of New York s fishermen and the businesses that depend on them    It is imperative that this problem be resolved so that the commercial fishermen throughout New York and Long Island can maintain their viability in this historically important industry and support themselves  their families  and their communities     We respectfully request that the SAFIS system  by which fish dealers enter their purchase information  be updated so that the person entering the data upon purchase cannot automatically enter the current date for date landed  As the system is currently constructed  a dealer can simply double click and automatically enter the current date for date landed  even though in New York  the date purchased is often a few days after the date landed     It is our hope that by eliminating the automatic option and incorporating new efforts that will alert fish dealers to the importance of the correct date landed  that we can take major steps to ensure accuracy and reduce the volatility in seasonal catch limits    Given that New York s accounting and reporting problem occurred at the change of a season  we also urge NMFS to conduct an immediate audit of New York s data in those critical weeks surrounding the change of season  specifically the last week in April and the first week in May 2007  An immediate audit and correction of this specific reporting error would  hopefully  increase the quota for these fishermen in the month of August when scup are still present in the inshore waters    A system that ensures that fish caught in Winter I are correctly applied to Winter I s quota  prior to releasing the data to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation  NYS DEC   should be in place going forward to prevent the resulting cutbacks in the quota for New York s fishermen during the summer months  We must enable a system that permits commercial fishermen to fish to the maximum quota allowed for any given season    Thank you for participating in the meeting in East Hampton on July 9  2007  and for your continued attention to this matter    Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senate   Tim Bishop  United States House of Representatives
