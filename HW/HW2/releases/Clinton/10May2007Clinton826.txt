May 10  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Sweeping Legislation to Fix Major Problems Facing Wounded Servicemembers Transitioning from DoD to VA Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Continuing her efforts to address problems facing wounded servicemen and women  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced new legislation to bridge the gap between healthcare provided by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs   Senator Clinton s bill  the Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act  provides a comprehensive solution to these transition issues and ensures a continuum of care for severely injured servicemembers              The Department of Defense  DoD  has failed to meet the medical needs of this generation s wounded warriors as they transition from the Armed Services to civilian life   Effective collaboration and coordination between the DoD and VA healthcare systems is critical for supporting an all volunteer force and meeting the needs of this generation s wounded warriors   said Senator Clinton          The mistreatment of servicemembers at Walter Reed and testimony from recent hearings in both the Senate Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees have revealed major gaps affecting servicemembers  including discrepancies in benefits for active duty and medically retired servicemembers  difficulties in obtaining needed care for wounded servicemembers transitioning from the Armed Services to civilian life  and disparities between the DoD and VA disability rating systems          To address these issues and improve oversight to prevent future problems  Senator Clinton s bill               Establishes a two year blanket overlap of active duty and veterans health services and benefits for all severely injured servicemembers to facilitate their recovery and help resolve administrative problems like those found at Walter Reed   All costs of health care services and benefits  for both active duty and medically retired servicemembers  will be paid for by the DoD  Those injured on or after October 7  2001 would be covered  but eligibility will not include retroactive compensation for payments already made               Creates a joint DoD VA Office of Transition for the coordination of assistance to members of the Armed Forces in their transition from service in the Armed Forces to civilian life    The Secretaries of DOD and VA would have oversight of the Office of Transition and the office would also be required to submit mandatory annual reports and biannual briefings to Congress  The GAO would also submit a biennial report on the Office of Transition s activities               Reforms the current disability rating system to ensure that there is continuity of medical care and no disruption in compensation payments made to wounded servicemembers   DoD would no longer assign the actual disability rating  but would still determine fitness for duty and document such a decision in writing  while VA would assign final ratings for all service connected injuries  Further  the legislation would revoke a requirement in current law that requires the delay in payment of VA benefits  making them available to eligible recipients immediately                Requires GAO investigation of DoD and VA coordination on medical treatment   The GAO will submit a preliminary assessment and final report on the extent to which medical facilities of the DoD and VA offer interdisciplinary medical treatment for wounded members of the Armed Forces            This legislation builds on a measure introduced by Senator Clinton  along with Senator Evan Bayh  D IN   to provide a temporary fix to these transition problems by extending active duty status for one year for severely wounded soldiers   Senator Clinton s bill introduced today will provide a long term solution to this challenge   The Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act is endorsed by the Wounded Warrior Project  the Military Officers Association of America  and the National Military Family Association             The provisions in this legislation will help insure a smoother transition from military service for our nation s wounded warriors   said John Melia  Wounded Warrior Project Executive Director   It will streamline the retirement process for the severely injured and will provide these brave men and women with access to the comprehensive benefits of both the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs            The Military Officers Association of America strongly supports the Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act   This legislation addresses three key elements to improve seamless transition between DoD and VA personnel and health systems   It is designed to ensure a continuum of health care  a DoD and VA team working together everyday to craft solutions  and a disability rating system that will guarantee fair and consistent long term compensation benefits for wounded servicemembers   We applaud Senator Clinton s foresight and understanding of the complex problems faced and the solutions needed   said Colonel Ana Smythe  Retired   Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Military Officers Association of America  MOAA             As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need   She has introduced a new legislative initiative to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families   Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits   She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform   She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing  recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need   She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning veterans
