September 6  2005 Clinton Unveils Legislation to Restore FEMA to Independent  Cabinet Level Status   Launch Katrina Commission to Investigate Hurricane Recovery Efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    On the heels of her visit with victims of Hurricane Katrina in Houston yesterday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is introducing legislation today to restore FEMA to Cabinet level  independent federal agency status to ensure that it has the authority it needs to effectively manage recovery efforts for future national crises   In addition  to make sure that response efforts are conducted better in the future  Senator Clinton is also introducing legislation to create an independent commission to investigate the handling of relief efforts              It  s difficult to have visited with those whose lives have been shattered by Hurricane Katrina and feel that they were well served   At every turn  I encountered our fellow citizens with desperate questions and few answers   The bureaucracy created by moving FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security is clearly not working   That  s why I am introducing legislation to make FEMA an independent agency again so that our nation is truly prepared to respond when our citizens need our help     said Senator Clinton          The legislation Senator Clinton announced will restore FEMA to Cabinet level rank and establish it once again as an independent agency   The FEMA Director would report directly to the President and would have full authority to coordinate with all agencies and take whatever executive action is necessary to ensure needed resources and recovery personnel are deployed to impacted areas in an efficient and timely manner   As part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002  President Bush moved FEMA from an independent  Cabinet level rank to a sub agency of the Department of Homeland Security under the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security          The FEMA legislation also will clarify the mission of the agency to ensure that its primary focus is on preparedness  response  recovery and mitigation issues   It will also ensure that FEMA will budget for and champion key mitigation programs such as Project IMPACT that establish successful partnerships between federal  state and local government agencies   Finally  the legislation will require that FEMA retains independent control of the assets needed to prepare for and respond to significant natural disasters            The independent Katrina Commission would be modeled after the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States convened in the wake of September 11   The Katrina Commission would be charged with providing a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of what could and should have been done to avoid the extraordinary damage  the loss of life  the evacuation problems and the inadequate relief efforts that have exacerbated the dislocation and suffering of thousands of Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina   The Commission would bring together officials with knowledge  expertise  training and experience with natural disasters to determine how to fix our broken system of federal response to natural disasters of a cataclysmic nature
