April 8  2005 Senator Clinton Protests Drastic Cuts to Federal Housing Aid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     New York  s housing programs will be among hardest hit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton protested a Bush Administration proposal to cut millions of dollars in funding for public housing in New York State  The decision by the Department of Housing and Urban Development would rob New York State of over  185 million annually  In a letter sent to the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  yesterday  Senator Clinton said there was no justification for such arbitrary and drastic changes to New York  s funding levels          Under the proposed new formula  the New York City Housing Authority alone would lose over  165 million  According to published reports  four of the five agencies with the deepest cuts are in upstate New York  The Syracuse Housing Authority would see its federal operating subsidy drop from roughly  9 5 million to less than  7 million and the Albany Housing Authority would see a cut of roughly  1 2 million to its subsidy of  5 9 million          This proposal doesn  t just hurt New York  s housing authorities  it hurts New Yorkers     Senator Clinton said    Without these funds  it will be an uphill struggle to provide even basic services to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in public housing across this state           Last year the Administration proposed steep funding cuts to the Section 8 housing voucher program and now they want to cut funding to New York  s housing authorities     Senator Clinton said    I cannot help feeling that this is part of a concerted effort on the part of the Bush Administration to punish our low income families           The news of the funding cuts came as the Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to publish its new operating funding formula for housing agencies  The rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register early next week  The proposed changes represent a stark contrast from an agreement that housing authorities made with HUD last June  The new rule would mean losses of over  185 million annually for New York State over the next five years        The chart below from the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities  details some of the estimated

States Department of Housing and Urban Development  451 Seventh Street S W   Washington  D C   20410       Dear Mr  Secretary        I  write to express my strong opposition to the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  proposed public housing operating fund rule  which was recently submitted to the Senate Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs          The rule does not reflect the diligent work of the public housing agencies in New York State nor the housing agencies nationwide that participated in good faith with HUD in the negotiated rulemaking process   The negotiated rulemaking process involved the active participation of all stakeholders  It demanded sacrifices from everyone involved and  although the process was difficult  it resulted in an acceptable solution for all   Nevertheless  HUD unilaterally rejected the negotiated rulemaking decision  opting instead for a formula that will devastate New York        Under the rule that the Administration is proposing  it is estimated that New York will lose over  185 million annually in public housing operating funds  significantly more than any other state   Under the final product of the negotiated rulemaking committee  it is estimated that New York would have lost only  26 million   This discrepancy of  159 million will preclude housing authorities across New York from providing thousands of New Yorkers the security and comfort of a home        There is no justification for these arbitrary and drastic changes to the negotiated agreement   I strongly urge you to honor the diligence and good faith efforts of the negotiated rulemaking process and publish the rule as it was negotiated         Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
