September 27  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Former FEMA Director Mike Brown  s Testimony on Hurricane Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Senator Clinton renews Call for Legislation Making FEMA an Independent Agency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Like many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle  I was deeply disturbed by Mike Brown  s testimony today on FEMA  s response to Hurricane Katrina   While it came as news to no one that FEMA failed in its mission to help those in harm  s way before  during and after Katrina hit   the unanswered calls for help from FEMA to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security should send a shiver down every American  s spine   Whether it is a natural disaster or a terrorist attack  the public has the right to expect that our federal government is ready to respond   Unfortunately  the response to Katrina proves otherwise          The fact is that FEMA used to work   And it worked well   When a natural disaster hit  FEMA was ready   We owe it to the American people to return FEMA to the Agency that it once was   We must return it to an Agency that is not so tangled up in bureaucracy that it spends more time cutting through red tape than saving lives           Earlier this month  I introduced legislation to take FEMA out from under the bureaucracy of DHS and make it an independent agency   I call upon my colleagues to support this effort and once again make FEMA the gold standard of response  rescue and recovery that our citizens deserve
