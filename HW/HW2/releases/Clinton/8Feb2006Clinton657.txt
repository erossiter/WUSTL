February 8  2006 Clinton and Dingell Introduce Legislation to Roll Back Bush Giveaway To Insurance Companies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Representative John D  Dingell  D MI  today introduced legislation in both chambers of Congress to roll back a giveaway to HMOs and insurance companies in the budget reconciliation bill that will be signed into law today by President Bush  Senator Clinton and Representative Dingell vowed to introduce the legislation after a news report revealed that Republicans secretly removed measures from the budget reconciliation bill thus allowing HMOs and insurance companies to keep excess payments from Medicare  The Clinton Dingell bill  the Patients Before Profits Act  also eliminates an unnecessary slush fund established to encourage more insurance companies to participate in the Medicare prescription drug program  The Clinton Dingell bill would use the funds that would have gone to insurance companies to restore Medicaid funding for much needed medical care for working families  the elderly and people with disabilities slashed and shredded in the new budget law          Our bill takes a stand against the misplaced priorities of the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress  We will stop this giveaway to insurance companies and put this funding back where it is critically needed  providing health care for our most vulnerable   said Senator Clinton         Health care for working families took a severe blow in the Republican reconciliation bill  And the President s Budget for Fiscal Year 2007 continues that attack   said Dingell  Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce    Our legislation begins the process of setting things right again  but clearly we have an uphill battle when the President is proposing yet another cut to Medicaid coverage of  17 billion over the next five years         According to the non partisan Congressional Budget Office  of the  28 billion in cuts to Medicaid in the bill the President will sign today  about 75 percent is due to provisions that will increase the number of uninsured and under insured by raising co payments and premiums  cutting benefits  and tightening access to long term care  CBO analysis also shows that the reconciliation bill increases the number of uninsured   Twenty percent of the savings from new premium charges under this bill would come from families no longer being able to maintain their Medicaid coverage due to the new charges   Not only would those who today have health insurance coverage under Medicaid lose it  but additional beneficiaries who are eligible for coverage would simply not be able to afford the new premiums and therefore not enroll due to the new premiums   In 2015 alone  there would be 65 000 fewer people enrolled in Medicaid due to new and much higher premiums for low income populations  and 60 percent of those losing coverage due to new premium charges would be children         While preserving a windfall of taxpayer dollars to the insurance industry  the budget law that President Bush signed today reduces coverage and increases costs for Medicaid recipients to see their doctors and obtain needed medicines and other benefits  These changes to Medicaid will increase healthcare costs significantly for working families by raising co payments for medically necessary services like doctors visits  operations  or therapies  reducing access to medicines through restrictive formularies and higher cost sharing  and increasing out of pocket costs for emergency room visits  In addition  the law allows States to provide bare bones coverage  rather than the appropriate and adequate coverage Medicaid offers today         The Patients Before Profits Act gives top priority to ensuring affordable and comprehensive health care coverage for millions of American families rather than protecting HMOs who are profiting at the expense of taxpayer dollars  The bill closes a loophole that allows insurance companies to game Medicare payments  eliminating excessive overpayments that the Congressional Budget Office projects would total  22 billion  The bill also eliminates a slush fund that Republicans protected in the closed door conference negotiations that would provide  10 billion over 10 years to encourage Preferred Provider Organizations to participate in the Medicare prescription drug program  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  the independent group established by Congress to oversee and report on Medicare payments  has called for elimination of both of these unnecessary windfalls for insurance companies
