                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Grants to be awarded to Fire Departments in Cohoes   East Northport  Liverpool and Long Beach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded over  340 000 in Firefighter Grants to four fire departments in New York as part of the thirty ninth round of the Fiscal Year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program          Time and time again I speak to firefighters and first responders who are struggling with increasing demands and decreasing funds   Senator Clinton said   These programs provide essential grants directly to fire departments across New York and the country  Every dollar that our local communities receive means extra resources not only to help them fight fires but to help them respond to other emergencies and ensure public safety          While the Senator said she was pleased to announce the grants  she also expressed her serious concerns about the potentially devastating impact of cuts to the Fire Act program detailed in the Bush Budget proposal        The President s recent budget proposal includes a 30 percent cut   a loss of more than  215 million nationwide   in funding to the FIRE Act program  These reductions represent a continuing pattern in which President Bush has either not included any funding for the FIRE Act or substantially reduced funding below what Congress appropriated in previous years         Given the critical job that firefighters perform each and every day  I am disappointed and quite frankly perplexed by the President s proposed cuts to Fire Act in the 2006 Budget proposal  We should do everything we can to ensure that our firefighters have the resources  equipment and training they need to keep us safe   Senator Clinton said        The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  AFGP  awards one year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation s firefighters and the services they deliver  The Department of Homeland Security s Office for Domestic Preparedness  ODP  administers the program  in cooperation with the U S  Fire Administration  USFA          The grants awarded today will be funded under the Operations and Firefighter Safety program  The Operations and Firefighter Safety Program provides funding for training  equipment  personal protective equipment  wellness and fitness  and modifications to fire stations and facilities         Senator Clinton has continuously fought for full funding of the FIRE Act and for passage of the  Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters Act of 2003    SAFER Act    to provide  7 6 billion in funding over seven years to help our nation s fire departments hire an additional 75 000 firefighters  Senator Clinton was also proud to announce the Senate passage of the SAFER Act proposal  which was included in the Department of Defense Authorization bill  and was enacted in November 2003         Senator Clinton also worked with her colleagues to secure Senate approval of amendments to the FY 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill that were designed to provide greater support to our fire fighters and other first responders and improve our nation s homeland defense  The final Homeland Security Appropriations law contained  650 million in homeland security funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program and  65 million for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters  SAFER  Act for Fiscal Year 2005  which began October 1st         In January 2003  Senator Clinton introduced a resolution calling for full funding for first responders  She also co sponsored an amendment to the budget resolution offered by Senator Dodd  which sought to provide more funding for the FIRE Act as well as fund the SAFER Act for Fiscal Year 2004  Senator Clinton also fought for more funding for firefighters and other first responders in the  Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2003          Recently  Senator Clinton re introduced legislation designed to increase the flow of homeland security funds directly to our local communities and their first responders  The Domestic Defense Fund Act of 2005 would provide direct funding to cities and towns  as well as to states  using a threat and risk based formula  This legislation also calls for significant increases in federal homeland security funding and provides local communities and first responders with the flexibility they need regarding the use of that funding         A list of grants awarded to New York State in this round is listed below  Lists of grant awards are posted regularly on their web site
