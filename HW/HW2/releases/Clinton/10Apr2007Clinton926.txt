April 10  2007 Senator Clinton on the Growing Controversy Surrounding Don Imus  Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I am very proud of these young women on the Rutgers basketball team  They have acquitted themselves with great dignity and grace under a very difficult pressure that was placed on them through no action of their own but because somebody wanted to try to score some cheap shot on them   I think we should all be very proud of them  They represent best of young people  These are young women who are seeking a college education  they are competing hard on basketball court  they are willing to put in the long hours in being both students and athletes  Isn t that what we want young people to do  Don t we want our young men and women to be out there doing something productive  Competing in the right way on the basketball court  Really showing leadership  I am very proud of them and I regret that anybody  especially someone who has a prominent position in the media would denigrate and degrade them in the way that he did so I hope that there will be a great outpouring of public indignation and outrage against what he said   And furthermore  following the example of the players and their coach today as they face the media  let s all show a little more respect toward one another  We don t need to be engaging in racist and sexist remarks  Let s respect each other and let s show the world that s what makes America great   we re all working to be the best we can everyday in this country and I think that ought to count for something   The decision about his career really rests with his employers but I think the public s reaction very is telling and I certainly think that some lessons need to be learned here that apply not only to him but to a lot of people who engage in this kind of despicable denigration of other people based on race or gender or ethnicity  We ve come so far in America  why do we allow or support people in the media or anywhere in our society who engage in that kind of trash talk and disrespectful behavior  So what happens to him is the responsibility of his employers but the real story is the dignity and class shown by the basketball players and their coach and that should set the standard for all of us          Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  in response to a reporter s question  Ft Drum  NY
