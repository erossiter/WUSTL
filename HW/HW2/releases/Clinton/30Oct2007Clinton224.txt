October 30  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Her Opposition to the Nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We need an Attorney General who has the strength to challenge this Administration when it is wrong  who is committed to reestablishing the independence of the Department of Justice and to restoring respect for the Constitution and the rule of law   I am deeply troubled by Judge Mukaseys continued unwillingness to clearly state his views on torture and unchecked Executive power    The Attorney General is the chief defender of the rule of law in our country   After Alberto Gonzales s troubled tenure  we cannot send a signal that the next Attorney General in any way condones torture or believes that the President is unconstrained by law   When we leave any doubt about our nations policy on torture  we send a terrible message to the rest of the world   Judge Mukasey has been given ample opportunity  both at his confirmation hearings and in his subsequent submission to the Judiciary Committee  to clarify his answers and categorically oppose the unacceptable interrogation techniques employed by this Administration   His failure to do so leaves me no choice but to oppose his nomination    We need to restore the nations confidence in the Department of Justice   The Department must once again defend our Constitution and the rule of law without regard to ideology and partisanship   And we need to protect the country from terrorism while also respecting Americans civil liberties
