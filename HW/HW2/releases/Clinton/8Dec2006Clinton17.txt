December 8  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Senate Confirmation of Dr  Andrew von Eschenbach as FDA Commissioner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC      Last night  the Senate confirmed Dr  Andrew von Eschenbach as Comissioner of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA    I am proud to note that we have made a great deal of progress since Dr  von Eschenbach was nominated for this position  and I voted in favor of his confirmation           It is critical that the FDA again be the gold standard of drug approval   By making a long overdue decision on Plan B  Dr  von Eshenbach showed encouraging signs that he will take seriously the FDA  s responsibility to put science over ideology   It is vitally important that Dr  von Eschenbach continue to put science first   It is also essential that the agency improve its efforts to ensure drug safety and respond quickly when threats emerge          With a permanent Commissioner at the FDA  I hope that we can now begin to address many of the challenges that face our public health sector   Among them  I hope that Dr  von Eschenbach will turn his attention to addressing the growing concerns about food safety in our country   Earlier this year  an outbreak of E Coli that sickened almost 200 people in 26 states    including 11 New Yorkers    was traced to spinach products  And just this week  we have learned that another E Coli outbreak in New York  New Jersey and Pennsylvania is likely linked to contaminated onions  Considering that there are more than 70 000 cases of E  Coli alone in the United States every year    and that this disease is just one of many foodborne illnesses    we must do more to ensure the safety of the food Americans eat  and reduce the number of these outbreaks          I look forward to working with Dr  von Eschenbach to make progress for public health  restore the agency  s reputation for protecting consumer safety  and bring new openness and transparency to the FDA
