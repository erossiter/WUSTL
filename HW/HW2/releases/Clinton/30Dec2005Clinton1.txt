                                                                                                                                                                                                                         New York  NY    As the Holiday Season continues  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with child safety advocates today in releasing recommendations for parents and families to keep children safe in and around motor vehicles  with a reminder that it is especially important to look out for children around cars during this time of year  when people are home for the holidays  Tragically  at least 217 children have died already this year in nontraffic incidents  which represent an unprecedented 31  increase over 2004 fatalities            While parents are mindful of their kids all year round  it  s especially important to look out for them during this time of year  when more children are home from school for the holidays     Senator Clinton said    With all the hustle and bustle of shopping  family gatherings and celebrating  it  s easy to lose track of kids  if only for a moment  This is particularly dangerous when they are playing games in the driveway or enjoying the snow in the front yard  as many parents across New York and America know all too well  These tragedies are heart wrenching  not only due to the unimaginable suffering these families endure  but because they are preventable               The holidays have already been fraught with the type of incidents Senator Clinton is working so hard to prevent   On Christmas Eve  a Wisconsin mother inadvertently backed over her 6 year old daughter   She thought she had driven over a snow bank  not realizing until later that she had hit the child  The little girl was playing inside the house with other children when the mother was leaving to purchase candy  but apparently ran outside and behind the vehicle not wanting to be left behind  Another tragic incident took place on Christmas Day in New Mexico when a 15 month old girl left the house undetected while an extended family member was backing out of the driveway  On Tuesday in California  a little 3 year old was killed when an SUV rolled over her in the family  s driveway  These incidents and the thousands of others that happen each year can be prevented with existing technology     said Janette Fennell  Founder of KIDS AND CARS           Since 1999  at least 1 000 children  mostly under the age of 4  have been killed in non traffic incidents   Tragically  the children are being killed in several ways               Backing over incidents  because drivers  including parents  cannot see that a child is behind the moving vehicle             Rollaway incidents  because children can move the transmission shift lever out of park and into gear on certain passenger vehicles and light trucks  and by            Power window entrapment  because children get trapped and strangled          Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined with her colleague Senator John E  Sununu  NH  to introduce the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act of 2005  S  1948   named after a two year old Long Island boy who was killed when his father accidentally backed over him  To prevent child deaths in backing incidents  S  1948 provides for a rearward performance standard to ensure that drivers can detect the presence of a person or object behind the vehicle   To eliminate child deaths in rollaway incidents  S  1948 requires that the vehicle service brake must be engaged in all ignition key positions before the automatic transmission can be shifted into gear   Finally  to reduce child deaths and injuries due to power window entrapment  S  1948 adopts automatic window reverse technology  similar to the technology on millions of home garage doors  to stop the window from closing when an obstruction is detected   The bill sets a reasonable schedule for government rulemaking and establishes a child safety information program as well          15 HELPFUL TIPS FOR KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE IN AND AROUND VEHICLES         1  Walk around and behind a vehicle prior to moving it    2  Know where your kids are  Make children move away from your vehicle to a place where they are in full view before moving the car and know that another adult is properly supervising children before moving your vehicle   3  Teach your children to never stand behind vehicles  even if the car is parked  And teach children that   parked    vehicles might move   Let them know that they can see the vehicle  but the driver might not be able to see them   4  Teach your children to never play in  around or behind a vehicle  enforce this rule by keeping toys and sport equipment out of the garage and driveway   5  Consider installing cross view mirrors  audible collision detectors  rear view video camera and or some type of back up detection device   6  Measure the size of your blind zone  area  behind the vehicle s  you drive   A 5 foot 1 inch driver in a pickup truck can have a rear blind zone of approximately 8 feet wide by 50 feet long  A driver  s blind zone in a large SUV is up to 40 feet long and 7 feet wide   the approximate size of a kindergarten class   7  Be aware that steep inclines and large SUVs  vans and trucks add to the difficulty of seeing behind a vehicle   8  Hold children  s hands when leaving the vehicle   9  Homeowners should trim landscaping around the driveway to ensure they can see the sidewalk  street and pedestrians clearly when backing out of their driveway   Pedestrians also need to be able to see a vehicle pulling out of the driveway   10  Never leave children alone in or around cars  not even for a minute   11  Keep vehicles locked at all times  even in the garage or driveway and always set your parking brake   12  Keys and or remote openers should never be left within reach of children   13  Make sure all child passengers have left the car after it is parked   14  Be especially careful about keeping children safe in and around cars during busy times  schedule changes and periods of crisis or holidays   15  Teach children that riding in a car is no safer than a carnival ride   sticking their hands  heads or any body part outside of the window is dangerous        See  www KidsAndCars org
