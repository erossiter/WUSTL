                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Innovative Public Private Partnership on the Verge of Transforming High Line                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined the leadership of the Friends of the High Line and other partners in highlighting the progress that has been made toward realizing the vision of transforming the former High Line railway into open public space   Senator Clinton has been a leader in Congress in fighting for funding for the innovative project  which will convert the former elevated freight railway into a pedestrian walkway stretching 1 45 miles and spanning 22 blocks across Hell  s Kitchen  Chelsea and the Meatpacking District  opening to New Yorkers 6 7 acres of public space atop the elevated rail deck   The restored space will boost the area  s appeal as an ideal destination for businesses  entertainment and living  while preserving its historic character                  I am proud that  along with my colleagues Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Jerry Nadler  we have been able to secure funding for this project  including  18 million in the transportation bill just approved by Congress   The High Line is one of my top priorities  and I am glad that we have fought for and secured funding for the project every year over the past three years     said Senator Clinton     I will continue to be a champion of this project because I believe it is an investment that will spur economic development and create an enduring legacy for future generations of New Yorkers                The High Line project started as a grass roots effort  and it  s a great example of how a small group of people can really make a difference   But it took the visionary support of Senator Clinton to make the High Line dream a reality     said Robert Hammond  co founder of Friends of the High Line     The Senator gave us much needed political support when we were fighting to preserve the High Line   And now  by working with Senator Charles Schumer and Congressman Jerrold Nadler to bring major federal funding to the project  she  s ensuring that the High Line will be transformed as a great new open space for New York City              The High Line is a key piece of the puzzle to what we need to move West Side development ahead and break the culture of inertia that has plagued New York City   said Senator Schumer   Anyone who lives or works in Midtown West  Chelsea  or the Meatpacking District knows that the one thing this area lacks is open space  This funding will go a long way into converting the High Line into a world class park that is original and different from any other  it will become a true gem of the West Side             It  s an incredible pleasure to announce the progress we  ve made on the High Line project     Congressman Nadler said     Not too long ago the High Line faced demolition  and we saved it because we saw its promise to our communities and our city   Now we  re counting down to groundbreaking  thanks to tireless grassroots advocacy and hard work in Congress   I was delighted to work with Senator Clinton  the High Line  s longtime champion  and Senator Schumer in securing  18 million in the transportation bill               The project is a key step in the revitalization of the far West Side where it will serve as an essential cultural and natural link between downtown  s art galleries and shops and midtown  s Javits Center  creating a distinctive new   High Line District      Senator Clinton also helped secure  15 million in funding for Moynihan Station  the vision of the late Senator Daniel P  Moynihan  to be a new intermodal transportation facility designed to expand and enhance Pennsylvania Station   Like Moynihan Station  the High Line will serve as a living monument that enriches the lives of all New Yorkers   In addition  this unique project will be a model for innovative land use development and environmentally responsible transportation planning  improving air quality by encouraging pedestrian traffic            The High Line project was recently granted a   Certificate of Interim Trail Use    by the Surface Transportation Board  paving the way for the City to finalize negotiations with the railroad and move toward the start of construction   The preliminary design for the High Line project  which is currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art  was created by the design team of Field Operations  landscape architecture  and Diller Scofidio   Renfro  architecture    The preliminary design can also be viewed here   Groundbreaking on the High Line project is planned for late 2005
