                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Seniors and most vulnerable citizens supposed to be vaccinated by October 24th  but not all providers have received vaccine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    As reports of seasonal flu vaccine distribution problems surface and the recommended deadline for seniors and most vulnerable citizens to get their vaccine a week away  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt to act immediately to address the delivery issues facing state and local health departments this flu season   She also urged that HHS step up communication and outreach efforts around flu vaccine with state and local providers           I am very troubled by recent reports in New York and across the country that many providers currently find themselves without adequate flu vaccines to administer to their high priority patients and are unsure as to when supplies might arrive  As concern over the pandemic flu continues to mount  it is imperative that we have a seasonal flu vaccine production and delivery system in place that works   There are fixes that can be made and I call upon you to join me in our efforts to strengthen our system so we can better protect the public health     said Senator Clinton        Senator Clinton and Senator Pat Roberts have introduced legislation to help prevent recurring shortages of flu vaccine and strengthen our vaccine delivery infrastructure so that we are able to respond to a crisis   The Clinton Roberts bill  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  addresses the causes of the influenza shortage by bringing increased stability to our nation  s seasonal flu vaccine market  The bill provides a framework through which our public health officials can track vaccines to ensure we have an adequate supply and to make sure high priority populations are vaccinated  The bill also provides technical assistance to companies that wish to produce vaccine domestically  and it will increase education about the importance of obtaining seasonal flu vaccines  The legislation will also strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza         The following is the text of the letter from Senator Clinton to Secretary Leavitt          October 17  2005         The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue S W  Washington  D C   20201       Dear Mr  Secretary        I am very troubled by recent reports in New York and across the country that many providers currently find themselves without adequate flu vaccines to administer to their high priority patients and are unsure as to when supplies might arrive   It is clear that even when we are facing a flu season when a vaccine shortage is not predicted  serious flaws in our procurement and distribution system remain         Since 2000  there have been three shortages of seasonal influenza vaccine   While we are fortunate that a shortage is not expected this season  there is clearly a problem with the delivery and distribution of vaccines   According to the National Association of County and City Health Officials  only six of 120 local health departments surveyed reported no delays in shipments   Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  are recommending that flu shots only be given to priority populations prior to October 24  the deadline is just a week away  and many seniors  long term care residents and chronically ill individuals are still unable to access doses       What is most disconcerting is that the delays we are now facing are entirely predictable  and pertinent information about them can easily be shared with the public   As vaccines cannot be delivered until they have been certified as safe by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   it would seem that within HHS  FDA approvals should be coordinated with CDC issued alerts that would enable state and local health departments  health care institutions  and individual providers to know when the vaccine they have ordered will arrive      I recently introduced legislation with Senator Pat Roberts that contains provisions to enable the CDC and state and local health departments to track the distribution and delivery of vaccine  from the time vaccine leaves the factory to the time it reaches the patient   If such a system were established  it would reduce the confusion and uncertainty that many patients are now facing   It would also enable employees in our nation  s public health infrastructure to devote their time and resources to tasks other than tracking down vaccine   This is not only critical to a fully functioning seasonal influenza vaccine system  but provides one of the fundamental building blocks for an appropriate response to a pandemic crisis        It is critical that HHS act immediately to address the delivery issues facing state and local health departments this flu season   I also urge you to increase communication and outreach efforts regarding flu vaccine with state and local providers to ensure they have the information they need to plan and keep their patients fully informed   I would like to meet with you to discuss needed efforts        As concern over the pandemic flu continues to mount  it is imperative that we have a system in place that works   There are fixes that can be made and I call upon you to join me in our efforts to strengthen our system so we can better protect the public health        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
