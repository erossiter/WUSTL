April 18  2006 Clinton Calls on President to Take Action to Prevent  Gas Price Gouging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Joins Colleagues in Letter to President  Calling for Immediate Action to Protect Consumers and Businesses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New York  NY    In the face of skyrocketing oil prices  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Senate Democrats  calling on President Bush to take immediate action to ensure that New Yorkers and Americans do not become the victims of price gouging at the pump this summer           In a letter to President Bush  Senator Clinton and her colleagues urged him to take action to support federal anti price gouging legislation and renewed their call for a bipartisan energy summit to solve the dangerous problem of America  s dependence on foreign oil  The letter comes only days after Senator Clinton made a similar call to Department of Energy Secretary Samuel W  Bodman and released a county by county analysis showing the impact of projected summer gas price increases on New York        Click here for the county by county breakdown of the projected impact of summer gas prices across the State         High oil prices are already taking their toll on New Yorkers and Americans  From small businesses to county governments  to schools  manufacturers and consumers    everyone is hurting under the pressure of increased prices at the pump and there is no relief in sight  Experts are already predicting an increase in prices of up to 25 cents over last summer  which could have an untold impact on communities and businesses     Senator Clinton said            It is totally unacceptable that New Yorkers are paying  3 or more at the pump for gas  but even more unacceptable that the Administration and the Republican leadership will not support legislation that would protect consumers against unscrupulous companies taking advantage of this already serious situation     Senator Clinton said    We must take long term steps to end our dependence on foreign oil  but in the short term we also need to ensure that New Yorkers are not fleeced this summer to pad the already high profits of oil companies              The text of the Senators   letter is below          April 18  2006         The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President       We are writing to enlist your support in enacting strong consumer protection measures that will protect American consumers from price gouging at the gas pump this summer  You are undoubtedly aware of projections from the federal Energy Information Administration  EIA  that gas prices will rise 25 cents per gallon across this nation compared to last summer   In light of these projections  we believe a federal anti price gouging law should be enacted before the summer driving season begins in earnest  this Memorial Day          Already  price gouging legislation  S  1735  exists that has been cosponsored by nearly a third of the United States Senate  and endorsed by a number of state Attorneys General  This legislation would give federal and state regulators new authority to prosecute price gouging in the wake of national energy emergencies  as well as put in place measures to ban manipulation and enhance the transparency of our nation  s fuel markets  One of the hallmarks of this legislation is that it would also apply to the wholesale fuel markets  an important distinction  given that it is often the large vertically integrated oil companies that dictate the prices that gasoline retailers can charge  While the oil companies rake in record profits  it is often these retailers that bear the brunt of consumer anger          A strong federal price gouging law is only one element of the equation when it comes to putting our nation on the path toward greater energy independence  A comprehensive and smart approach to this vital issue of national security will help curb the tremendous volatility in energy prices that is impacting consumers  businesses and the American economy as a whole  We have thus far been disappointed by your Administrations   lack of response to our invitation to co host an emergency bipartisan national energy summit   This offer still stands  However  in the absence of leadership or cooperation from your Administration  we will soon be moving ahead with our own set of real solutions  which will spur the kind of innovation and investment America needs to secure its energy future for the 21st Century          Our oil dependency is one of the greatest economic and national security challenges faced by our generation  The status quo  in which the security of the United States and our domestic economy is left to the whims OF foreign regimes and companies that do not have the best interests of our nation at heart   is simply not an option  How quickly and aggressively we rise to meet this challenge will be one of the most important tests on which future generations of Americans will measure our leadership and resolve   As such  we hope you will join with us in acting quickly to protect American consumers from price gouging this summer and to vastly accelerate market penetration of biofuels  alternative fuels  and energy efficiency vehicles and technologies  We stand ready to work with you to develop a serious national strategy to curb America  s dangerous dependence on oil          Sincerely           Senator Maria Cantwell  Senator Harry Reid  Senator Richard Durbin  Senator John Kerry  Senator Joe Lieberman  Senator Russ Feingold  Senator Evan Bayh  Senator Ron Wyden  Senator Debbie Stabenow  Senator Hillary Clinton  Senator Jack Reed  Senator Barbara Mikulski  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Senator Byron Dorgan  Senator Joe Biden
