January 31  2006 Statement by Senator Clinton and Representative Dingell On CBO Study on Impact of Republican Medicaid Cuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative John Dingell released the following statement today on a new report from the Congressional Budget Office on the impact of cuts to Medicaid in the Republican budget           We have repeatedly warned that the Republican Medicaid cuts will have devastating consequences for children and families   Now  the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed what many of us have warned all along  if you increase costs for Medicaid recipients  many will skip needed care or lose Medicaid coverage all together          The Republican Medicaid cuts will mean higher premiums and co payments for millions of children and families   According to the Congressional Budget Office  by 2015  4 5 million children will be affected by higher cost sharing charges for services like physician visits  13 million people in total would face higher charges to access their health care services   In addition  by 2015  twenty million people would face higher charges to access medically necessary prescription drugs   One third of those individuals affected by the drug cost sharing  6 6 million  would be children and half  10 million  would have incomes below the poverty level  incomes less than  1 380 a month for a family of three           These cuts also translate into more uninsured  particularly for the most vulnerable  CBO estimates that sixty percent of those losing coverage due to new premiums imposed under this legislation would be children  They also anticipate that not only would beneficiaries lose coverage  but also those who are eligible for coverage wouldn  t seek it because of these new fees          These cuts are not only a shameful attack on our values  they are just plain short sighted and will wind up costing us more money  Cutting Medicaid will put even more pressure on our overburdened emergency rooms and drive up the cost of care even further when our most vulnerable wait until a crisis strikes before seeking care          To add insult to injury  Republicans made these cuts at the same time they were protecting a windfall for insurance companies  pharmaceutical companies  and funding a tax cut for the most affluent among us  Instead of addressing our health care challenge  Republicans in Congress once again are adding to the problem          We urge the House to reject these cuts  We also urge the President to renounce these cuts in his State of the Union address  Medicaid recipients don t need more empty promises on health care  They need leadership and action to ensure they have the health care they need and deserve
