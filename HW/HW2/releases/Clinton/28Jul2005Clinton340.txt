July 28  2005 Schumer  Clinton Secure Millions of Federal Dollars in Transportation Bill For North Country                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senators Announce Money for Rooftop Highway  Fort Drum Connector and Plattsburgh Airport Access Road Projects Funded Through Transportation Authorization Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill approved by the House Senate Conference Committee today includes  2 5 million for North Country projects   Schumer and Clinton secured  230 million in special projects for New York   In addition  Schumer and Clinton announced a substantial increase   16 5 billion  in total transportation funding for New York State for fiscal years 2004 2009   Specifically  the legislation includes  10 07 billion in highway funds and  6 5 billion for New York State  s transit systems  a 19 percent increase for New York in highway funding and a 30 percent increase in public transit funding over the last transportation authorization bill   The bill also contains funding for research  safety  environment  transportation planning and security that will benefit all New Yorkers          Senator Clinton served as a member of the Conference between the House and Senate due to her role as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Schumer is a member of the Banking and Finance Committees  which control the transit funding and tax portions of the bill   Both Senators fought hard to ensure that provisions important to New York were retained in the Conference Report            This is great news for the North Country   These transportation funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state  These federal dollars will be a huge shot in the arm for critical highway repairs and expansion   Without first rate highways  New York would literally stop short     Schumer said    The funding for the Rooftop Highway will help bring out the best the North Country has to offer   Our goal is to enhance access to Watertown and Plattsburgh and every mile in between for residents and visitors alike  But we must take care to put safety first at every step of the way and this study will do just that   This federal funding will present enormous opportunities for the North Country             After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to the North Country  These funds will go a long way towards helping communities make the infrastructure improvements needed to keep their economies moving     said Senator Clinton  who served as a Senate conferee in negotiations on the bill    I am proud that our efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the ever increasing transportation demands on our state   We have made a substantial contribution to the future of the North Country by investing in these critical road and transit projects   I am especially pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Rooftop Highway which is critical to the future of Watertown and Plattsburgh and all the communities in between and I am also pleased we could secure these funds for Plattsburgh International Airport and the Fort Drum Connector           The funding approved in the bill today includes          1 5 million that Schumer and Clinton secured for the Rooftop Highway scoping and planning study   Since Plattsburgh and Watertown are currently linked by roads that do not provide sufficient or safe transportation between the two communities  the Development Authority of the North Country has been working on a North Country Transportation Study  examining the best route for a four lane  limited access highway between the cities  While plans for this proposed regional  Rooftop Highway  remain under consideration  the new federal funding would help to address some of the immediate infrastructure concerns facing this corridor by improving signage  implementing rail relocation projects  making port and water improvements and improving telecommunications access in the region          1 million secured by Senators Schumer and Clinton for the Fort Drum Connector  which will provide direct access from I 81 to US Route 11 and the North Gate of Fort Drum  bringing the total amount in the bill for the Fort Drum Connector to  5 8 million   It is intended to provide a direct and safe route for military personnel and military vehicles moving between I 81 and Fort Drum  by replacing the accident prone Route 342   It would also offer a new direct route for commercial and personal vehicles moving between I 81 and the cross state highway which spans the North Country        Schumer and Clinton also said the Fort Drum connector would increase safety  improve access to the base  and represent the first leg of the Rooftop Highway   The Northern Tier Expressway  also known as the Rooftop Highway  is a proposed four lane interstate between I 81 and I 87         500 000 secured by Senators Schumer and Clinton for the Plattsburgh International Airport Access Road  which will be used to construct and improve the access road from NY Route 22 to Plattsburgh International Airport        Senators Schumer and Clinton today also announced the approval of several of their own provisions  including        Mass Transit Benefit    Senators Schumer and Clinton were able to secure an increase in the tax free transit benefits employers can offer to their employees up to par with tax free parking benefits  Under current law  employers are only able to offer employees a tax free benefit for mass transit commuting costs up to  105  Last month  Schumer secured approval in the Finance Committee to raise the transit benefit from  105 to  155 per month  The amendment keeps the transit benefit at  155 until the end of 2009  then in 2010  the transit benefit will equal the parking benefit   200 plus in 2010  and the two benefits are linked together for all future inflation adjustments  CHECK       According to a survey by The Transit Center  a leading advocate for increasing the transit benefit and creator of the nation  s first transit voucher  24 percent of MetroNorth  25 percent of Long Island Railroad  and 18 percent of NYC Transit  s daily riders take advantage of commuter benefit programs  In the New York metro area alone  commuters will save cumulatively over  150 million this year  Employers have saved significantly as well  over  35 million since the benefit went into effect in the New York area  The added subsidy will not only benefit employees  but will also provide additional tax relief for businesses who contribute to their employees   deductions and will encourage employers to offer transit benefits to their workers         9 25 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for the University of Buffalo  s Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER   Clinton and Schumer secured approval for  1 25 million per year  over the next five years  in funding for research on the impact of seismic activity on the federal highway system and the nation  s transportation network as well as ways to reduce our vulnerability from earthquakes  In addition  the Senators provided an additional  3 million to support ongoing research activities   The funding will also help improve earthquake simulation facilities  This is an important economic generator in Western New York and will keep the University of Buffalo at the forefront of this important research  Senator Clinton promised to fight hard to include the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  in this version of the bill  MCEER is a national center of excellence in advanced technology applications dedicated to the reduction of earthquake losses nationwide  MCEER is headquartered at the State University of New York at Buffalo  The Center was originally established by the National Science Foundation  NSF  in 1986 and has been included in every reauthorization bill since its creation        High Priority Corridor Amendment   Clinton and Schumer secured approval for Route 219 in Western New York and I 86 I 99 to be designated as high priority corridors  making them eligible for specific high priority corridor funding         National System Study Commission   The Conference Report contains a provision creating the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that Senator Clinton authored as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee   This Commission will determine the future transportation needs of New York and the nation   This Commission will combine the National Transportation System Study and the Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission   Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward   The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing is to provide a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future   A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York   It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network        Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured language in this bill renaming all of I 86 after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  a fitting tribute to a man who once chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee and who fought hard in previous transportation reauthorization bills for the needs of New York   Senator Clinton introduced an Amendment last year that was accepted by the Senate during consideration of the surface transportation reauthorization bill   The provision was retained in this year  s bill and will now become law        CargoWatch Technology    the Senators secured  3 5 million for PAR Technology  s CargoWatch Transportation Management Program   This funding is in addition to funds added in the House  These funds will be used to identify  track  and manage cargo within containers along with associated over the road assets from point origin until destination  Tracking container shipping supply chains will provide essential national security and efficient transportation management   The tracking system is being developed by PAR Technologies  based in New Hartford  NY        The Conference Report is now scheduled to be considered by both the Senate and the House sometime later this week  After passing each house  the approved Report will then go to the President  s desk to be signed   The bill originally passed the House on March 10 and the Senate on May 17   The new project funding is in addition to any money already approved by the House
