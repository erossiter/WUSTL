June 27  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for New Foreign Policy to Meet Challenges Around the World                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 New Legislation Introduced to Safeguard Nuclear Materials and Stop Proliferation                Washington  DC  Delivering a keynote address at the inaugural forum of the Center for a New American Security  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today emphasized the urgent need for America to chart a new course on foreign policy   Six years of the Bush Administrations failed agenda has squandered our respect in the world and threatened our national security   At a time when we face the greatest confluence of challenges in our countrys modern history and the world is more interdependent than ever  we need a new and optimistic foreign policy that again widens the scope of our strength by rebuilding alliances  reclaiming Americas moral authority  and transforming our military and government to meet the host of challenges we face    We have a long road ahead to repair the damage that has been done these past six years  But I am hopeful because the choice is in our hands  We can create a new foreign policy that finally recognizes the wide scale and scope of the challenges before us by widening the scale and scope of Americas response  We can rebuild our alliances  restore our moral authority  and retake the leadership that is ours to lose  A new security is what we need  and what we can help forge together  said Senator Clinton             Senator Clinton emphasized that around the world every challenge we face begins with the biggest challenge  restoring our leadership by once again valuing alliances  respecting our values  and understanding that American strength is more than just the show of force     Ending the War in Iraq   Senator Clinton noted that the failed ideology which led us into Iraq  and the failed execution by President Bush and Vice President Cheney  has had perhaps the most devastating effect on our leadership in the world of any foreign policy decision in decades   Senator Clinton emphasized that it is time to end this war and to bring our troops home as soon as possible   Senator Clinton noted her three step plan to bring our troops home while preserving our security   Senator Clintons plan would   1  start bringing our troops home now  2  demand that the Iraqis take responsibility for their country or lose their aid  and 3  begin intensive regional and international diplomacy    Combating Terrorism   Senator Clinton emphasized that Iraq should not distract us from the fact that terrorists still want to do us great harm  There is a global threat of terrorism  and we have to engage it  not ignore it  and here too the policies of the Bush Administration have set us back   Senator Clinton underscored that it is time to reassert our strength in a way that actually makes us stronger  by leading the world to defeat the grave threat of violent extremism   We need an approach that uses alliances to hunt down terrorists   We also must demonstrate moral leadership by showing that America is invested in lifting people up around the world through Education for All  an initiative Senator Clinton has proposed to provide  10 billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl   Senator Clinton also emphasized that shoring up our alliances is also critical in safeguarding against the threat of a global pandemic  be it an act of terrorism or an act of God    Stopping Proliferation and Preventing Nuclear Terrorism   Senator Clinton emphasized that the greatest threat is a terrorist armed with a nuclear weapon and nowhere is the need for restored alliances and diplomatic engagement more clear than in how we combat nuclear weapons proliferation and the extremists who seek to acquire nuclear weapons and materials  To meet this challenge  Senator Clinton announced that today she is introducing legislation to help prevent nuclear terrorism   The Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007  based on research by former Senator Sam Nunn and the Nuclear Threat Initiative  would devote real resources to combat the threat of nuclear terror   Senator Clintons bill would increase funding dedicated to converting research reactors around the world from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium and removing the highly enriched uranium from such facilities  invest in forensic measures to advance our capability to identify the origins of a nuclear weapon in the horrific event of a nuclear terrorist attack  and create international guidelines to raise the security standards at nuclear sites worldwide   Senator Clintons bill also would require the President to develop a comprehensive plan to work with the international community to secure nuclear weapons and materials and create a new post of Senior Advisor to the President for Preventing Nuclear Terrorism to coordinate these efforts and report to Congress     Meeting Other Challenges Around the World   Senator Clinton emphasized that across the board  from Asia to the Middle East to Africa to Europe to Latin America  we can see the importance of a new American leadership that values alliances and leads by example   She underscored that we face a strengthening China  with growing economic  diplomatic and military influence and power which requires American engagement and frank dialogue   And she emphasized the need to bolster our humanitarian work in Africa  including showing leadership in Darfur  redoubling our commitment to fighting HIV and AIDS and combating Islamic extremism taking hold in the horn of Africa   She also emphasized the need to renew American leadership and build alliances on climate change and the critical need to rebuild our military and transform our government for the threats of the 21st century      Senator Clinton is the first New York Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  where she has worked tirelessly to address the needs of our men and women in uniform and their families   Senator Clinton also serves as a member of the Transformation Advisory Group which is part of U S  Joint Forces Command    Read the full text of Senator Clinton s remarks
