                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illnesses  with Numbers Rising   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Students  and Other Individuals                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  and Robert Menendez announced final Senate passage of an additional  108 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  The money builds on the  50 million that was provided in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that was signed into law earlier this year  bringing total funding for the year to  158 million    The latest funding increase was approved as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill and includes  51 5 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill and  56 5 million in additional emergency spending  The omnibus bill  which includes 11 appropriations bills  will now go back to the House for final passage before being sent to the President for signature    Six years after the tragedy of September 11  2001  that days tragic events continue to afflict many of those who lived and worked near Ground Zero  as well as those brave responders who rushed to the scene  said Senator Clinton  By approving this important funding  we are recommitting to stand with the victims of September 11th for as long as it takes    It is high time that the first responders and residents of Lower Manhattan that were exposed to toxins six years ago receive the treatment they need and deserve  I am pleased that the Senate approved this essential funding for the men and women who are now suffering from the effects of the attacks  and promise to continue to fight for the full funding they need  Senator Schumer said    First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks   Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero    I look forward to the House passing this bill and the President signing it into law so these heroes can get the treatment they deserve  said Senator Lautenberg    Senator Menendez said  This is the type of federal commitment that puts the mantra We will never forget into action  and its the type of commitment that had been lacking in previous Congresses  With major investments in the health of those who inhaled the toxic air around Ground Zero  we can help address the needs of all those who deserve their government s attention and resources  whether they developed symptoms in the days after 9 11 or in the years after 9 11  Moving forward  we cannot rest until all of those who inhaled the toxic dust around Ground Zero are examined and those found to be sick are treated    The  108 million in new funding will go towards monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The  51 5 million portion in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill also includes statutory language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mount Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    The lawmakers said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed
