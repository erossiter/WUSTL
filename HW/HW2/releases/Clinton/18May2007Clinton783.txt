their letter to the UN Secretary General          His Excellency Ban Ki Moon  Secretary General of the United Nations  First Avenue at 46th Street  New York  New York 10017      Dear Mr  Secretary General       We write to express our deep concern over the imprisonment on May 8th of renowned scholar and women s rights activist Haleh Esfandiari and the detention of journalist Parnaz Azima  Haleh Esfandiari currently serves as the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington  D C    Parnaz Azima is a correspondent for the Persian language broadcaster Radio Farda   Both women have dual Iranian and American citizenship  yet are unable to leave Iran to be reunited with their children and grandchildren  We request you take urgent action to press the Government of Iran to secure the immediate release of Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima and allow them to promptly return to the United States          Dr  Esfandiari was in Iran in order to visit her 93 year old mother   As she drove to the airport to return to Washington  she was robbed of her belongings  including her United States and Iranian passports   After Dr  Esfandiari applied for replacement Iranian travel documents  the Iranian government subjected her to repeated harassment and multiple interrogations because of her position as head of the Wilson Center s Middle East Program   On February 20th  former U S Representative Lee Hamilton  the President and Director of the Wilson Center  wrote to President Ahmadinejad about Dr  Esfandiari s case and asked him to use his good offices to help send Dr  Esfandiari home  however  Mr  Hamilton has not received a reply   On May 8   Dr  Esfandiari was arrested after being summoned to meet with officials at the Ministry of Intelligence in Tehran and taken to Evin prison   Reports have indicated she needed medical attention at that time and that her passport has been withheld            Ms  Azima has been barred from leaving Iran since she arrived in January 2007 to pay a visit to her elderly and ill mother   Her work as a journalist for the U S  funded Persian language broadcaster Radio Farda contributes to expanding access to information for citizens in the Middle East   According to the State Department  her passport has been confiscated  and her lawyers have reportedly been told that she will be unable to leave the country for several years  In April  the Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that it was investigating the case  but to date  the government has taken no action to return the passport to Ms  Azima   In 2006  she was subject to similar harassment from the Iranian government  which seized her passport and refused to return it to her for several weeks           The detention of these women is inexplicable and unjustifiable   Haleh Esfandiari is an author  journalist  and former Princeton University lecturer on such topics as international women s issues  contemporary Iranian politics  and democratic developments in the Middle East  and she has made significant contributions to the body of research on these issues   She has served as the Deputy Secretary General of the Women s Organization of Iran and has written extensively on the role of women as force for positive change in Iran   Her employer  the Wilson Center  is a respected public institution whose mission is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on global issues and it does not try to influence policies directed at the Iranian Government or any government in the Middle East   Ms  Azima works for Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty s Persian language broadcasting service  which is run jointly with the Voice of America   Her journalistic work does not in any way involve activities that would compromise or threaten the Iranian government  rather  it serves to help provide vital information to individuals living in the Middle East   Detaining Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima on questionable grounds contradicts the very essence of their work   to promote peace  reconciliation and freedom for all           We urge you to intervene with the Government of Iran on behalf of these two Iranian American women in order to end their unjust detention and ensure their imminent release and safe passage home          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton   Kay Bailey
