January 10  2006 Clinton  McHugh Call for Overhaul of Rural Utilities Service Broadband Loan Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Cite Current Program s Impediments and Inefficiencies  Urge Critical Improvements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Congressman John M  McHugh  NY  are urging the head of the Rural Utilities Service  RUS  to address problems with administration of the Broadband Loan Program that are preventing it from achieving its potential   In a letter sent to RUS Administrator James Andrew  Clinton and McHugh emphasized the pivotal role the program plays in encouraging broadband deployment in rural and underserved areas  one of the most critical elements in promoting economic development   The two also underscored the factors   such as long processing time  the cost and complexity of the application process  and the fact that more loan applications are being rejected or returned than funded   that show the program is not adequately serving those it was intended to benefit         Deploying broadband service to our rural areas could be as important to economic development as rural electrification was during the Great Depression as it holds tremendous potential to bridge the technological and economic gap of many rural and underserved communities in New York   It is critical that the Bush Administration and the Rural Utilities Service give serious consideration to our proposed improvements  It is vital for this loan program to function efficiently and reach the companies and communities that Congress intended it to   said Senator Clinton         As America s telecommunications infrastructure continues to advance with newer technologies  bridging the digital divide between urban and rural areas remains important as ever   Congressman McHugh said    While I have witnessed some significant progress in this area throughout my longstanding commitment to promoting broadband deployment  it is disappointing to see such a promising broadband loan program riddled with bureaucratic inefficiencies   I support the President s goal that all Americans should have access to broadband by 2007   Addressing these shortcomings within the Rural Utilities Service will certainly help move the country  particularly rural areas such as the 23rd Congressional District  toward that end         Text of the letter from Senator Clinton and Congressman McHugh follows         The Honorable James M  Andrew   Administrator   Rural Utilities Service   South Agriculture Building   1400 Independence Avenue  S W    Washington  D C   20250        Dear Mr  Andrew         We are writing regarding our concern with the administration of the Rural Utilities Service  RUS  Broadband Loan Program   As you know  this program plays a pivotal role in encouraging broadband deployment in rural and underserved areas  which we believe is one of the most critical elements in promoting economic development   Since it was first enacted as a pilot program in the last year of the Clinton Administration  the program has remained as important as ever   Indeed  the role of rural broadband is as critical to the economy of the 21st century as rural electrification was in the 1930s  and we are particularly committed to ensuring its continued viability and success                   In parts of rural Upstate New York  we have already seen the tremendous impact of broadband on businesses and entrepreneurs   It is clearly an economic multiplier and the effects of its widespread deployment cannot be overstated   For these reasons  we are committed to ensuring that this critical program remains available in New York  However  we do believe that there are certain inefficiencies that must be addressed if the program is to work as Congress intended   Specifically  we have concerns that certain impediments may be preventing the program from fully realizing its goals and utilizing its allocated resources        First  it is our understanding that  since its inception  this program has received approximately 150 loan applications  totaling more than  2 billion   but has only approved roughly one third of those applications  approximately  770 million   Considering the program was allocated funds of  2 157 billion in FY 2005 alone  the fact that there appears to be a significant disparity in the amount of funds available and those awarded to applicants is of great concern   In addition  we feel that it is critical that factors be addressed to correct the wait times of up to a year for loan processing  such as adequate staffing to prevent a pile up of applications   This long processing time simply does not suit the quick turnaround times and operating deadlines that are associated with the telecommunications industry   We believe that  if the program is to function properly  steps must be taken to streamline the turnaround time of the loan applications        We are also concerned that the program  as it is currently administered  may discourage new and young companies   the very companies that should be targeted to take advantage of the program   from even applying for the loans   As you know  there is a requirement that applicants for the program have on hand at least one year of operating cash   However  many start up companies typically do not have access to such capital as they have invested their resources in mapping out a business plan or purchasing capital resources   In an effort to ensure that more of the resources from the loan program are dedicated to truly underserved rural areas  it may be worth revisiting the stringent and prohibitive cash on hand requirement and perhaps considering alternative requirements that would not prevent companies with sound business plans and revenue growth projections from qualifying for these loans        In addition  it has been brought to our attention that application process itself may be prohibitive to the many smaller telecommunications companies the program was designed to assist   Under current rules  prospective borrowers first submit a letter of inquiry explaining their intended service  territory and technology to the agency   The agency reviews this and assigns a field staffer to work with the applicant on the project   However  as currently structured  the loan application has associated with it expensive market research  competitive analysis  engineering  publication  and financial costs   While such provisions are all part of a good business plan  these requirements all constitute a significant allocation of resources  especially for smaller companies        Perhaps most troubling is the fact that  after committing significant resources and a long uncertain wait time for these loans  statistics show us that many companies are rejected   We urge you to consider implementing a two step process   adding a pre application  which could consist of financial disclosures and a business plan outline   This step would provide applicants with more certainty and confidence that if specific conditions are met  then a loan would be made and  in turn  giving them the assurances needed to raise additional capital to leverage a broadband loan        Overall  interest in this important program has cooled significantly due to the long loan processing time  the cost and complexity of application process  and that RUS has rejected or returned more loans than have been funded   as evidenced by the surplus of unexpended resources   Nevertheless  we believe that addressing some of the concerns outlined in this letter could significantly improve the program and ensure that it reaches out to those it was intended to benefit        Thank you for your consideration of these issues   We remain committed to working with you to ensure the success of this program and we look forward to hearing from you how Congress can coordinate its efforts with you to strengthen and improve the program s administration         Sincerely         Hillary Rodham Clinton                                  United States Senate                     John M  McHugh
