May 22  2007 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Testifies Before Senate Commerce Committee on Rail Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Testimony Highlights Concerning Series of Derailments in New York Over Recent Months   Senator Calls for Increased Oversight and Enforcement Power for Federal Railroad Administration       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today testified before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure  Safety  and Security at a hearing on Rail Safety            During her testimony  the Senator highlighted the litany of derailments and accidents that have occurred in New York in recent months  including incidents at Cheektowaga  Syracuse  Selkirk  East Rochester  and Oneida and blasted the inadequacy of the current system of monitoring and managing safety issues on our railroads  During her testimony  the Senator also called for            Increased inspectors  more frequent system wide safety inspections of major railroads  and routine use of new technologies on the part of the Federal Railroad Administration  FRA              Legislation that creates safe working conditions for workers   and in turn safe conditions for our railroads            Implementation of a data driven evaluation system by the FRA to measure the effectiveness of its enforcement program   instead of relying on the railroads for compliance             Stronger regulations and better enforcement to hold railroad companies accountable  and           Extension of the process for assessing risk and managing risk beyond commuter railroads and pipelines to freight lines as well          Senator Clinton is currently working with the Senate Commerce Committee on comprehensive rail safety legislation           Her testimony today represents another step in Senator Clinton s continued efforts to ensure rail safety throughout the state of New York   In the wake of several rail incidents in New York  most notably the recent train derailment in Oneida  Senator Clinton has been a vocal force in the call for reforming our current rail system ensuring its safety           Earlier this year  the FRA conducted a 23 state inspection of CSX properties  which exposed hundreds of defects  including over a dozen violations along CSX tracks in New York   With these alarming discoveries  Senator Clinton pushed the FRA to inspect not only CSX tracks  but also non CSX owned tracks  and subsequently called for a comprehensive inspection of all railroad tracks across New York State while reiterating the very real need for track safety standards to be strictly enforced   Senator Clinton met with Joseph H  Boardman  the Federal Railroad Administrator  and called on him repeatedly to lead an investigation into the safety of New York railroads   During this meeting  the Administrator informed Senator Clinton that the FRA would expand its investigation to non CSX tracks            A copy of Senator Clinton s testimony is below           Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  On Rail Safety before the Surface Transportation Subcommittee  May 22  2007      Chairman Lautenberg  Ranking Member Smith  and members of the subcommittee  thank you for the opportunity to testify before this committee   Chairman Lautenberg  thank you for your work and your commitment to our nation s transportation systems and infrastructure  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague  Senator Schumer  As you might assume from our both being here we have some very important questions and concerns about the situation of our railroads in New York          As you said  Chairman Lautenberg  Railroads today transport about 42 percent of the nation s freight and the U S  Department of Transportation estimates that between 1998 and 2020 the amount of freight transported by rail will increase by 50 percent          At the same time  the Federal Railroad Administration  FRA    the nation s chief rail safety agency   is understaffed  overextended  and has the capacity to inspect only 0 2 percent of the nation s railroads  While gains have been made in rail safety  the primary responsibility is delegated to the railroad industry  And in the absence of public scrutiny and private responsibility  rail safety is being neglected   and the consequences have been deadly          On December 10  2006 a 64 car CSX freight train derailed in Cheektowaga  New York           On December 14  2006  a CSX carman with 30 years of experience was struck and killed at a CSX yard in Syracuse  New York           On December 19  2006 a CSX carman with 15 years of experience was struck and killed by a train in Selkirk  New York            On January 16  2007  a 13 car CSX freight train traveling at 62 mph derailed near East Rochester  New York           Most recently  a CSX train derailed near Oneida  New York on March 12  2007   The train was carrying liquefied petroleum gas and the accident resulted in a massive fire   Fortunately  there were no injuries   but authorities were forced to enact a mile wide evacuation of the surrounding area  If this train had been carrying chlorine or any other extremely dangerous material  the result could have been catastrophic          Derailments on CSX properties in recent months have occurred in Kentucky  Maryland  and Ohio          On March 27th  the FRA released the results of a focused inspection on CSX properties in each of the 23 states where the railroad operates   It found 3 518 defects and 199 potential violations   In New York alone  60 inspections revealed 376 defects  including 13 violations   It is my understanding that the violations cited in the inspection are still being reviewed by FRA          I have met with and called on the Administrator of the FRA  Joe Boardman  to expand his investigation to other railroads besides CSX   I don t think that we want to sit idly by waiting for the next derailment to occur          I commend the response of Administrator Boardman and the FRA in light of these troubling accidents and derailments in New York            The FRA is doomed to fail  however  without the resources  authority  and support to properly ensure the safety of our nation s railroads  And that s why it is so important  what you re doing Mr  Chairman            This Congress needs to fill the leadership vacuum left by previous Congresses and the current Administration and implement meaningful rail safety reform          The FRA needs more inspectors  more frequent system wide safety inspections of major railroads  and routine use of new technologies   The number of inspectors has remained flat in recent years   As of July 2006  FRA has 657 full time and part time safety staff  including 400 inspectors in the field  In contrast  the railroad industry has about 235 000 employees  219 000 miles of track in operation  158 000 signals and switches  and more than 1 6 million locomotives   It s plain and simple   in order for the FRA to ensure rail safety  it needs the inspectors and the inspection technology to do its job          We also should do more to protect railroad workers  For too long  fatigue related errors in the rail industry have contributed to rail work injuries and deaths   I think we should look at legislation that creates safe working conditions for workers   and in turn safe conditions for our railroads          FRA needs a data driven evaluation system to measure the effectiveness of its enforcement program   instead of relying on the railroads for compliance   It s hard to correct problems when the FRA does not have the facts about what is being fixed and what isn t          The FRA must have stronger regulations and better enforcement to hold railroad companies accountable  It has entered into only 13 compliance agreements and one compliance order over the past decade   And I urge the Committee to look into how these methods can be used more effectively            Finally  this Committee and Congress should also explore risk management   The systematic process for assessing risk and managing risk helps us protect commuter railroads and pipelines in our country as well as Canadian railroads   why not our freight lines as well          Chairman Lautenberg  and to the other members of the committee  I appreciate the opportunity to come and share our concerns from New York and I look forward to working with you on legislation that will provide the FRA with the tools necessary to ensure the safety of our nation s railroads   I look forward to your leadership on this important issue          Thank you
