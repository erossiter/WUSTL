November 15  2005 Joint Statement by Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Chuck Schumer on the Failure of the Joint House Senate Conference Committee to Restore 9 11 Aid For New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC     We are extremely disappointed that the Joint House Senate Labor  HHS Conference Committee is poised to reject a provision that passed the Senate which would restore  125 million in 9 11 aid to those in need of worker  s compensation and medical and mental health needs because the House Republican Leadership refuses to permit this funding to be added to the bill   This money would have gone to our firefighters  police officers  workers  volunteers  and others who came to Ground Zero and who need our help   Many House Members and Senators visited Ground Zero shortly after September 11th and stood with our heroes   But there were thousands of men and women who worked at Ground Zero for several days  weeks and months beyond September 11th looking for their brothers and sisters  friends and families  and those they did not even know   Many of them still suffer medical and mental health problems and worker  s compensation claims are not being approved or addressed   The Amendment we included in this bill would have addressed these problems   While we are extremely disappointed that this provision is in jeopardy  this fight is not over   We will not abandon these men and women who did not abandon us in our time of need   The President of the United States  and this Congress  promised  20 billion to New York and rejecting this provision is a rejection of that promise   It is only right that we restore this funding to New York and we will do whatever is in our power to right this wrong
