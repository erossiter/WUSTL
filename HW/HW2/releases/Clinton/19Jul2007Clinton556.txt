                                                                                                                                                                                                                      At a Meeting in Washington  DC Senator Clinton Presses Entergy CEO on Deadline for Sirens  Independent Inspectors and Safety Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today met with Entergy CEO J  Wayne Leonard in her office in Washington  DC to discuss several important issues relating to Indian Point    Specifically  Senator Clinton expressed her concerns to Mr  Leonard about Entergys failure to have the new siren system in place and asked for a progress report on the prospect of the company making the new deadline for operable and effective sirens  The Senator also asked the CEO to report on the status of Entergys efforts to identify and contain leaks of radioactive water at the plant  Finally  the Senator called on the CEO to commit to independent assessment of the plant that she and others have called for     At the meeting  Senator Clinton also presented Mr  Leonard with a letter outlining her concerns  pointing out that the steady drumbeat of problems have eroded public confidence in Indian Point    The litany of recent problems at Indian Point has eroded public confidence in the plant at a time when Entergy is beginning its re licensing process  Senator Clinton said  I urged Entergy to commit to an independent safety assessment at the plant so that concerns about safety and emergency preparedness can be addressed to the satisfaction of the community   In addition  I stressed the importance of getting the sirens operational on time       A copy of Senator Clintons letter is attached     July 19  2007   Mr  J  Wayne Leonard  Chief Executive Officer  Entergy   Dear Mr  Leonard    Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss Entergy s Indian Point Energy Center in Buchanan  New York      Since September 11th I have worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  Despite improvements in both Entergys management of Indian Point and NRC oversight  problems have persisted at the plant   For example  repeated failures of the sirens have raised questions about emergency preparedness  and leaks from spent fuel pools have prompted safety questions   The steady drumbeat of these and other problems have eroded public confidence in Indian Point      Concerns about these and other issues led me to call for the NRC to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment  ISA  at Indian Point   The NRC refused my request  and I have subsequently introduced legislation to require an ISA at the plant   I will continue to push that legislation  but I believe that it is in the best interests of the community  the NRC  and Entergy to begin such a review now  so that it can inform the re licensing process   With that goal in mind  I ask that you join in my call to have the NRC conduct an ISA at Indian Point   I believe that the best way for Entergy to demonstrate its confidence in Indian Point is to invite independent inspectors inside to examine the plant alongside the NRC      The ISA would be particularly valuable because the re licensing process does not review aspects of Indian Point operations that are the subject of routine inspection by NRC  nor does re licensing evaluate emergency preparedness   Residents and officials have expressed concerns about these and other lacks in the re licensing process to the NRC  and are pressing the NRC to address them   I share many of their concerns      As Entergy moves forward and begins meeting with New Yorkers to discuss re licensing  one of the most visible signals about Entergys competence and progress at Indian Point will be whether the company meets its commitment to have the new siren system in place by August 24th   As you know  I added a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to install a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated failures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power   That provision was signed into law in August of 2005  and the NRC set a January 2007 deadline for having the system operational   Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th  and subsequently missed the deadline   NRC fined Entergy  130 000  and Entergy has since committed to have the system operational by August 24th   It is critical that Entergy meet this deadline      Thank you again for meeting with me to discuss these concerns   I ask that you give strong consideration to my request that Entergy back an ISA at Indian Point       Sincerely     Hillary Rodham Clinton     Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Indian Point
