                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illnesses  with Numbers Rising   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Students  and Other Individuals   Call for Focus on Long Term  Comprehensive Solution to Screen and Monitor All Individuals Who were Exposed to the Environmental Hazards After the September 11th Attac  Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer today announced that the full Senate has approved an additional  55 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center     The funding  which comes in addition to the  50 million that was provided in the recent Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill  was included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill by the Senate Labor  HHS  Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee  The bill will now proceed to the conference with the House as the next step in the appropriations process    Passage of this bill by the Senate is great news for those who still suffer from the lingering effects of the 9 11 attacks  Senator Clinton said  This additional funding is vital to the first responders  building and construction trades workers  volunteers  office workers  residents  students  and others who are experiencing health problems from the exposure to toxic substances released by the attacks  It is our national responsibility to care for those who did our country proud in the hours  days  weeks  or months following the horrific attacks  Todays announcement by the Senate gives us renewed hope that the funding needed to carry on these vital health tracking and treatment services will be delivered  and I strongly urge the President not to veto this critical legislation    Senate passage of this essential funding is encouraging news for all of the workers at Ground Zero who served America in its time of need  and for others affected by air contamination around the World Trade Center site  The message of this vote is clear  America is here for you in your time of need  However  the fight is not over  The administration has refused to fully fund the many clinics and programs that serve the heroes still suffering from the affects of 9 11  and those yet to develop symptoms  That is simply not right  We will continue to fight for full funding for our first responders to ensure they receive the attention and care they deserve  said Senator Schumer     Specifically  the  55 million will go towards screening  monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The bill also includes language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mt Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    Finally  the bill  which was given full Senate approval last night  encourages the development of a long term  comprehensive solution to screen and monitor all individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards from the World Trade Center  WTC  collapse and encourages the provision of long term comprehensive medical services for those experiencing illnesses or injuries as a result of these exposures     Senators Clinton and Schumer said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the health effects of 9 11
