December 13  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton on Passage of Energy Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Today the Senate passed an energy bill that is an important step towards increasing our energy independence and fighting global warming   The bill will raise fuel auto fuel economy standards for the first time in over 30 years  to 35 miles per gallon by 2020   It will raise the production of biofuels to 36 billion gallons by 2022   And it will help consumers save money by improving the energy efficiency of appliances   In addition  the bill includes provisions to push the federal government to become more energy efficient that I co authored  It also includes a provision that I worked on with Senator Sanders to create a program to train workers to join the growing energy efficiency and renewable energy fields   Unfortunately  President Bush and Senate Republicans stopped this from being an even better bill   They blocked our efforts to include a provision to require utilities to generate 15 percent of our electricity from wind  solar and other renewable sources by 2020   Republicans also chose to stand with oil companies and against American consumers  They blocked our efforts to begin to fix our broken energy tax system by repealing tax breaks for big oil companies and putting those funds towards clean energy   So while this bill is a big step forward  we still have work to do  and I will continue to fight for a clean energy future
