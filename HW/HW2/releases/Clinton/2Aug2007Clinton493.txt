August 2  2007 Senator Clinton Introduces Bipartisan Amendment to SCHIP Bill to Extend Family and Medical Leave for Family Members of Wounded Soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with Senator Christopher Dodd and a bipartisan coalition of Senators to introduce an amendment to the SCHIP bill under consideration by the Senate to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to family members of wounded soldiers to six months   The bipartisan Support for Injured Servicemembers Act is also cosponsored by Senators Dole  Graham  Mikulski  Chambliss  Brown  Salazar  Cardin  Menendez  Kennedy  Boxer  Reed  Murray  Harkin and Lieberman    The following is a transcript of Senator Clintons remarks on the Senate floor     Mr  President  I thank Chairman Baucus  and I thank both Senators Dodd and Senator Chambliss for their vigorous explanation and advocacy of the bill which we have introduced that we are proposing to have as an amendment to the current legislation pending before the Senate  because we think that the duty to honor our veterans  our servicemembers and their families is urgent     This is a duty that we take very seriously  and clearly based on the recently released Commission on Care for America s Returning Wounded Warriors  chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala  it is a matter of grave urgency for our nation to do everything we can to improve support for our servicemembers and veterans  The commission found that one of the most important ways to improve that care is to improve support for families  And that is why Senator Dodd and I have introduced an amendment to the CHIP legislation  the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act     Mr  President  we are proud to have the bipartisan support of Senators Dole  Graham  Mikulski  Chambliss  Brown  Salazar  Cardin  Menendez  Kennedy  Boxer and Jack Reed  because this is a matter that goes way beyond politics as usual  It is certainly way beyond partisanship     During the course of the Dole Shalala commission work  they showed what many families across the country already knew  that the Family and Medical Leave Act  which Senator Dodd worked so hard on for so many years and which was the first piece of legislation signed by my husband  has been a godsend to 60 million Americans over the course of the last years    people taking care of newborn babies  a family member with an accident or illness  with an aging relative  And it has made it possible for so many Americans to balance the difficult responsibilities of family and work   But what has been abundantly clear with all of our wounded warriors returning from Iraq and Afghanistan is that it was not sufficient for family members to care for those young servicemembers who have sustained a combat related injury     Currently spouses  parents  and children can receive only 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act  All too often  as we have now learned  that is insufficient as injured servicemembers grapple with traumatic brain injuries  severe physical wounds  learning how to use a prosthetic  trying to understand what post traumatic stress disorder means to them and to their futures  and indeed family members have dropped everything  They have tried to be at the bedside  stay in the area to help their loved one  give up jobs even  That seems to us to be more than the sacrifice that their loved one has already made demands     Imagine if your husband or wife or your son or your daughter had been injured  You d want to be with them  You d want to take care of them  But you wouldn t want to lose your job in the process     It s not a choice that military families should take  Therefore  that is why we are asking for our colleagues to join with us to pass the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act and to allow us to really fulfill this duty that we all feel to our military families  And I appreciate very much Senator Dodd s leadership on this for many years  and on this particular legislation  And we invite even more cosponsors from both sides of the aisle to join us  And we hope that we will have a vote on this before we leave the Congress  before we finish the CHIP legislation  so that we can go home and tell military families that help is on the way      UPDATE  Senate Approves Dodd Clinton Measure to Expand Family and Medical Leave Benefits to Wounded Warriors and Families
