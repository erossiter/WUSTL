October 10  2007 Clinton  King Call on Army Corps of Engineers to Expedite Dredging of Jones Inlet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Dredging Project is Critical to Ensuring Boater Safety and Protection of Town of Hempstead s Beaches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Peter King today called on Lt  General Robert L  Van Antwerp  Chief of Engineers of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  USACE   to expedite the review of a proposal that would allow the USACE to accept funds from New York State which would allow the dredging of Jones Inlet to begin in the upcoming season  The lawmakers stated that while they are still committed to federal funding for this project  approval of this agreement would allow the dredging to be completed by the April 1  2008 deadline    By the Army Corps own standards this dredging project is long overdue  said Senator Clinton  There is a very real need to address the dangerous conditions created by the shoaling in Jones Inlet  and the agreement reached by the State of New York will provide the Army Corps with the funding needed to begin the dredging project on schedule  While I am still committed to federal funding for this project  I urge the Army Corps to review and approve the States agreement so that we can immediately address the Inlets safety risks and protect the Town of Hempsteads beaches as soon as possible     I am pleased that the Corps and the State are very close to an agreement  said Rep  King  but until the papers are signed  the project cannot begin  We have a very small window of time left if we are going to reach our April 1 deadline  and I urge them to resolve their differences quickly  Jones Inlet has become too dangerous to put this project off another year    While the FY 2008 Senate Energy and Water funding bill approved earlier this year by the Senate Appropriations committee allocates  3 million for the dredging of Jones Inlet  and the House has already approved  5 million for the project  New York State has also recognized the importance of this project and has appropriated  7 6 million in state funds so that dredging can begin this upcoming season  An agreement was reached that would permit the USACE to accept the State funds so that the project could begin next season and be completed by the April 1  2008 deadline  However  before the project can begin  the USACE must first review and approve the State funding agreement     Though the Army Corps recommends dredging Jones Inlet every four to five years  the last maintenance dredging of Jones Inlet was performed in 1995 and now  12 years later  the inlet has filled with sand  making both the channel perilously shallow and water conditions unpredictable for mariners  A primary concern is also for the safety of thousands of recreational boaters who are either forced to use other water channels or navigate outside Jones Inlets designated ones  since the water depth has shifted making the official lanes unsafe  The inlet also protects the Town of Hempsteads precious beaches by absorbing the brunt of storms  but has been unable to adequately do so with its diminished depth   This request marks the continuation of Senator Clinton and Representative Kings efforts to alleviate the dangerous conditions present at the Jones Inlet  In addition to their work to move forward with the dredging of the Inlet  earlier this year the lawmakers called on the USACE to work with the Coast Guard to monitor the Inlet so that the best and safest channel could be marked for boaters until the dredging could be performed    A copy of the Clinton King letter is below     October 10  2007   Lieutenant General Robert L  Van Antwerp  USA  Chief of Engineers  United States Army Corps of Engineers  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20310   Dear Lt  General Antwerp    We write in regards to Jones Inlet  a federal navigation channel in Nassau County   As you know  we have written in the past to the Army Corps of Engineers about the shoaling that has occurred in Jones Inlet and the dangerous conditions this presents to commercial and recreational boaters using the Inlet   Additionally  the beach at Point Lookout is in need of nourishment to protect the coast and surrounding homes and community from erosion and storm damage    The FY 2008 Senate Energy and Water funding bill approved earlier this year by the Senate Appropriations committee allocates  3 million for the dredging of Jones Inlet  and the House has already approved  5 million for the project   We remain committed to federal funding for this project in line with the historic precedence  and will continue to work for the FY08 bill to become law   New York State has also recognized the importance of this project and has appropriated  7 6 million in state funds so that dredging can begin this upcoming season   It is our understanding that an agreement has been reached permitting the Army Corps of Engineers to accept state funds to allow the project to occur this season  but that it presently awaits final approval by Army Corps headquarters      We write to respectfully urge you to expedite the review and approval of this agreement so that the dredging of Jones Inlet can be completed by the April 1  2008 deadline   This project is immensely important to the Point Lookout community and the boaters who travel the Inlet   Now that funding has been lined up  a prompt review is necessary to ensure that dredging of the Inlet can be completed this season   This will ensure the safety of this community in the upcoming storm and boating season    Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton     Peter King
