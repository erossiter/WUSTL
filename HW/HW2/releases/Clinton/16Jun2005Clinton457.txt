June 16  2005 Senators Voinovich  Clinton Introduces Bill to Reduce Harmful Emissions From Existing Diesel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    U S  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and George V  Voinovich  Ohio  today introduced bipartisan legislation to further reduce harmful emissions from existing diesel engines  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005  which is also cosponsored by Senators Thomas Carper  Delaware   Johnny Isakson  Georgia   Kay Bailey Hutchison  Texas  and Dianne Feinstein  California   will distribute over  1 billion over 5 years to establish voluntary national grant and loan programs for diesel emission reduction projects and programs that improve air quality and protect public health  The bill will help areas come into attainment for the new air quality standards  Developed with environmental  industry  and public officials  the legislation complements Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  regulations now being implemented that address diesel fuel and new diesel engines         I am pleased that the Administration has taken strong action with new diesel fuel and engine regulations  which were developed in a collaborative effort to substantially reduce diesel emissions  However  I am concerned that the full health benefits will not be realized until 2030 because these regulations address only new engines  The estimated 11 million existing diesel engines have a long life ahead of them and need to be addressed as well  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 will provide pivotal funding through national and state level grant and loan programs for the voluntary retrofitting of existing diesel engines  I am pleased that such a strong  diverse coalition of environmental  industry  and public officials understands the need for this legislation and is working hard to make it a reality   said Voinovich        Senator Clinton said   I am proud to support this legislation  which will provide funding for proven  cost effective technologies to reduce diesel pollution          Reducing diesel emissions is pivotal in our effort to clean the nation s air  On road heavy duty diesel vehicles  such as transit buses and garbage trucks  and non road diesel vehicles  such as construction equipment and tractors  account for roughly one half of the nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions from mobile sources nationwide  These emissions contribute to ozone formation and fine particulate matter  and they contain numerous other chemicals that are listed by EPA as hazardous air pollutants        EPA has finalized diesel fuel and new engine regulations that will reduce diesel emissions from new diesel buses  freight trucks  and non road equipment by more than 80 percent from 2000 levels  Unfortunately  the full benefits of EPA s rules will not be realized until 2030 because of the long lifetime of the 11 million existing engines  The durability of the diesel engines used to power school buses  trucks and railroads  agriculture processes  and emergency response vehicles can last for hundreds of thousands of miles over a lifetime of up to 30 years        In the meantime  EPA has designated 495 counties nationally and 38 counties in Ohio as in non attainment for the new ozone and or particulate matter air quality standards  Currently  state and local governments are hard at work developing plans to meet the new  fast approaching deadlines for the air quality standards    but without federal assistance  many will fall short        In order to help states and communities meet these standards and reduce exposure to harmful diesel emissions  a voluntary diesel retrofit initiative is needed to substantially reduce emissions from our aging diesel fleets  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005  DERA  establishes national and state level grant and loan programs to promote the reduction of diesel emissions  The legislation             Authorizes  1 billion over 5 years   200 million annually         Provides that 70 percent of the funds are distributed by EPA        Allocates 20 percent of funds to states to develop retrofit programs with an additional 10 percent available as an incentive for state s to match the federal dollars being provided        Establishes priority areas for projects    such as those that are more cost effective and affect the most amount of people    and focuses the federal program on public fleets  and       Includes provisions to help develop new technologies  encourage more action through non financial incentives  and require EPA to outreach to stakeholders and report on the success of the program        DERA is based on the understanding that existing engines can benefit from technology that  retrofits  or replaces older engines  In doing so  cost effective emissions reductions can be provided for these fleets and dramatically accelerate the public health benefits        In the near future  states must develop State Implementation Plans  SIPs  to achieve ozone and particulate matter reductions to meet the new air quality standards  This legislation gives states and communities the opportunity and flexibility to design programs to fit their own needs  This legislation will help bring counties into attainment by encouraging the retrofitting or replacement of diesel engines  which will substantially reduce diesel emissions that contribute significantly to ozone and particulate matter        EPA estimates that this billion dollar program would leverage an additional  500 million leading to a net benefit of almost  20 billion with a reduction of about 70 000 tons of particulate matter  This is a 13 to 1 cost benefit ratio
