July 18  2007 Senator Clinton Speaks on the Senate Floor on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered remarks on Iraq on the floor of the Senate at 4 12 am this morning as part of the debate leading up to consideration of the Levin Reed amendment  of which she is an original co sponsor      A transcript of Senator Clintons remarks is below    Mr  President  the description of the problems that are currently existing in Iraq and in the region by my friend and colleague is not only accurate  but unfortunately  an indictment of the policies of this Administration  What has been described in terms of the instability in Iraq and the consequences for further conflict are ones that I take very seriously     The issue before us now is what is the best approach that we  as a nation  can take that will fulfill our obligations to our men and women in uniform  that will make clear to the Iraqi government and people that their lives and futures are at stake  and will strengthen the hand of the United States diplomatically to deal with the consequences of the misguided policies that have brought to us this point   There are no good answers   Anyone who stands here and believes that he or she has the truth  the facts  understands both what is going on and what is likely to flow from whatever decision we take is most probably to be proven wrong by reality as it unfolds   Many of us have been searching for the best approach to take with respect to our involvement in Iraq for a number of years   But we don t do it with any sense that we know everything that will happen no matter what decisions are taken      But what we do have is a history of miscalculation and mistakes that we are now attempting to deal with  The Levin Reed Amendment attempts to put into law a new direction for Iraq  one that I and others believe is long overdue     The reason that I have come to support this amendment is because if one looks at the actions of our military in Iraq based on the authority under which they are operating  they have achieved the missions they were given  They were asked to remove Saddam Hussein from power and bring him to justice  and they did so  They were asked to provide the Iraqi people with the opportunity for free and fair elections  and they did that as well  They were asked to give the Iraqi government the space and time to make the difficult political decisions that are required in order to have any hope of stabilizing Iraq over the longer term  and they did that as well  Our military has performed not only heroically  but successfully  with courage and determination against odds and enemies from all sides     What we know is that when the people of Iraq turn against violence  there is a chance for success  That s the basis of the counterinsurgency strategy  It cannot succeed unless the people on the ground are part of the winning strategy     What has happened in Al Anbar province is an example of that  The tribal sheikhs and the people turned against the violence and extremism of the Al Qaeda factions  many of whom were led by foreign fighters who violated not just the human rights  but the cultural norms that existed in the area  So there became the opportunity for an alliance  an alliance between our military and local people against Al Qaeda  That is why the Levin Reed Amendment includes the continuing efforts against Al Qaeda as a remaining mission and a vital national security interest of the United States     If one looks  though  at the map that was just on the easel  that does not describe the situation in the rest of Iraq  In the south  I think it is clear that Iran is the political occupier  that Iranian agents are largely calling the shots and that there is an internecine struggle for power among a variety of Shiite militias  The lawlessness inside Basra and in the surrounding region cannot be quelled by any external force  The British have not only drawn down their troops  but they ve withdrawn to their bases  They know they can t go out and calm the waters  because the various factions are vying for power   They re going to continue to do so until someone emerges  And Iran is largely influential in determining who that might be    In Baghdad  we ve gone from neighborhood to neighborhood  And  yes  where we are  we secure the area  The violence recedes only to pop up somewhere else  either in Baghdad or maybe in Diyala or Baqoubah or somewhere else     So  Madam President  the problem is that Iraq is not Al Anbar province  Al Qaeda is not the major source of the instability in Iraq  It conducts the most violent and spectacular missions  It provides the suicidal killers who blow themselves up and blow up the cars and trucks in which they live at the moment  But they are not the primary cause of the violence and instability in Iraq     Therefore  the counterinsurgency cannot succeed unless there is a dramatic change in the attitude of both the government and the people of Iraq  I do not see that happening     The Iraqi government has not been willing to make the hard decisions  The debate as to whether they are incapable or unwilling is beside the point  They haven t done it  We keep hearing every year  every month  every week  things will be different  How many times have we heard that as the Iraqis stand up  our troops will stand down  How many times have we heard that in 6 months  8 months  12 months our troops may start coming home    Meanwhile  there are more American troops in Iraq today than ever before  The Iraqi government is more fractured and less effective       The right strategy before the surge and the right strategy now  post escalation  is the same  Start bringing our troops out of this multisided  sectarian civil war  I believe since our troops have accomplished the missions that were originally set forth  that withdrawing them from urban combat  from patrol duty  from the kind of hand to hand engagement that they are currently confronted by is the right military and political strategy     It is clear that as we look at where we are today in Iraq  we are asking our young men and women to police a civil war  There is no argument about the very basic premise that there is no military solution     And yet  the political front has been neglected  If there had been a political surge and a diplomatic surge  we might be looking at a different situation     We also know that the training and performance of the Iraqi army and police forces have not been sufficient to relieve our troops of the primary responsibility for the fight   In fact  because of setbacks and other problems  the number of Iraqi troops that are actually available to fight alongside or to take responsibility for the fight has diminished     And as our troops serve alongside Iraqi army officers and soldiers  they find that  yes  some do have loyalty to Iraq  Others  however  are loyal to sectarian militias  Others have looked the other way when the insurgents have planted bombs  And some have even taken up arms against Americans while wearing the uniforms that we helped provide     The catalog of miscalculations  misjudgments and mistakes in Iraq shocks the conscience  And the unilateral decision to rush to a preemptive war without allowing the inspectors to finish their work or waiting for diplomacy to run its course  to the failure to send enough troops or provide proper equipment for them  to the denial of a rising insurgency and the failure to adjust the military strategy  to continued support for a government unwilling to make the necessary political compromises  to the adherence to a broken policy more than four years after the invasion began     Many of us believe that it is time for us to move our troops out of harm s way in the middle of the Iraqi civil war  We believe that is an appropriate military decision that will be made sooner or later     The recent report which was an interim report did not have very much good news in it  In September  we will get another report which I predict will be also mixed  which will put the best face on whatever the facts are  but the bottom line will remain the same  Our troops and their families are paying the price for this administration s policies     Since the Bush administration announced this escalation  14 brave New Yorkers have been killed in Iraq and hundreds more wounded  Two soldiers from the Tenth Mountain Division based in Fort Drum listed as captured or missing     Since the war began  3 619 young Americans have been killed  26 000 wounded  Many with very visible wounds  loss of limbs  loss of eyes  Others with those wounds that are invisible but no less injurious  Depression  anxiety  post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury     We ve spent more than  450 billion so far   10 billion each month  We re straining our budget  The president s two major initiatives since he was sworn into office in January 2001 have been tax cuts for the rich and the war in Iraq  neither of which he s paid for  They have been put on the American credit card  They have been funded by borrowing money from foreign countries  further undermining our standing and our leverage in the world     Our involvement in Iraq continues to erode our position   It has damaged our alliances and it s limited our ability to respond to real threats   The unclassified key judgments of the recent National Intelligence Estimate  called the Terrorist Threat to the U S  Homeland  says that the threat of Al Qaeda is persistent and evolving   The report states that Al Qaeda will probably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of Al Qaeda in Iraq  its most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the homeland     This reality is a sobering one and I believe one that demands a new direction   I continue to press for a basic three step approach   First  start bringing our troops out of harm s way now   Second  demand and back up those demands that the Iraqis take responsibility for their country or lose the aid we are providing them     Everyone knows that the Iraqi government is as much a client of Iran as it is an ally of the United States   Our presence in this multisided sectarian civil war without a diplomatic or political strategy makes it unlikely that the Iraqi government will seek the resolution of the disputes that lie at the heart of this ongoing civil war     Thirdly  we should begin long overdue intensive regional and international diplomacy on a sustained basis   Now  diplomacy in and of itself does not promise any great solution  but we have neglected it at our peril   Others have rushed to fill the vacuum   In fact  the problems that were pointed out on the map of the region have also been impacted by the Administrations failure to pursue smart diplomacy   And as we look at the deteriorating situation in the Middle East  the pressures on the Israeli government because of the rise of Hamas and the strength of Hezbollah  we can see the consequences of both our failed diplomatic strategy and our problems in Iraq today      I have called for the strategic redeployment of U S  forces out of Iraq for several years   I ve introduced legislation to end the war  but to remain committed to vital national security interests that can be enumerated and more carefully defined   I voted against funding the war without any plan for ending it or without any companion efforts to engage in realistic  political  and diplomatic initiatives     That is why I joined a bipartisan majority in supporting the Levin Reed Amendment  It has been very difficult to get the President s attention   I hear that from both sides of the aisle   The Congress has both a duty and an opportunity to try to do that   We have one Commander in Chief at a time  and we have seen repeatedly this Administration fail to deal with the realities that we confront in Iraq and elsewhere around the world   When they do change course  as long as it takes them to make that decision as we have just seen in North Korea  the results can be very positive   And I can only hope that in the remaining 18 months of this Administration  similar actions are undertaken to deal with the problems we confront in the larger region  including Iraq and the Middle East     I believe  too  that it s imperative that the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs inform the Congress of the plans they have for redeployment and withdrawal   Withdrawing troops is dangerous and difficult   We must not redeploy out of Iraq with the same failure of planning with which our troops were deployed into Iraq   And yet  I wrote several weeks ago to Secretary Gates and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  General Pace  asking whether there is planning  very specific planning  not the usual response Oh  yes  we plan for everything  we plan for every contingency  What is the planning that will protect our troops when they do withdraw  which will happen  whether it happens in 120 days or it happens next year or it happens the year after   What have we done to make sure that we do it in as careful and orderly a way as possible     Madam Chairman  I believe our troops  as well as the American people  deserve a vote yes or no on this bill   If you believe in giving the President the continued power to pursue a failed strategy without checks or balance by this Congress  make your case and cast your vote   If not  then put partisanship aside and stand with the bipartisan majority working to end this war      Our message to the President is clear   It s time to start thinking of our troops and our broader position in Iraq and beyond  not next year  not next month  but today      I hope  Madam President  that we will be able to vote on the Levin Reed Amendment   I fear that we will not in the face of objections on the other side  but we are just postponing the inevitable   Come September  we will have another inconclusive report   We will have more casualties  we will have more who are injured  we will still have the same Iraqi government waiting us out   We will continue to empower Iran and to destabilize Jordan and to give a free hand to Syria and Hezbollah  and we will face an even more dangerous set of choices then   There is no reason to wait      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
