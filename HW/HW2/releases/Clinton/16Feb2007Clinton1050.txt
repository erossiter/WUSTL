February 16  2007 Schumer  Clinton  King  Israel  HHS Interpretation of Ryan White Funding Act Dead Wrong   Unfairly Slashes Money for Vital Services for Long Island Patients                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Under New Ryan White Modernization Act  HHS Erroneously Slashing Nassau Suffolk Title I HIV AIDS Funding Because of a Misinterpretation of Legislative Language   With Funding Drying Up  Long Island HIV AIDS Patients are in Danger of Losing Money for Vital Care and Services   Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel Demand Explanation and a Repeal of HHS Decision                      Washington  DC   With thousands of Long Island residents living with HIV and AIDS in jeopardy of losing vital health care and support services provided by Ryan White funding due to a flawed ruling by the Department of Health and Human Service  HHS   today  U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hilary Rodham Clinton and U S  Representatives Peter King and Steve Israel demanded an immediate explanation on how to repeal the decision  HHS recently ruled that the Nassau Suffolk region no longer qualifies as an Eligible Metropolitan Area  EMA  under the recently reauthorized Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006           Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel today argued that HHS misinterpreted the legislative language of the reauthorization  and that  in fact  Nassau Suffolk region does qualify as an EMA  They also demanded that HHS provide an immediate explanation on how to repeal its decision so that Long Islanders living with HIV AIDS don t lose critical services provided in part through Ryan White CARE monies            I am both baffled and dismayed by HHS  recent decision stating that the Nassau Suffolk region no longer qualifies for EMA funding   said Senator Schumer   Because of its misinterpretation  thousands of Long Island residents living with HIV AIDS could end up seeing their essential health related services cut  We re prepared to fight tooth and nail to repeal this flawed decision            I am extremely disappointed in the way in which the Department of Health and Human Services is implementing the recently reauthorized Ryan White CARE Act  We fought for so long to keep these critical funds coming to Nassau and Suffolk counties and to have the Department go against the letter of the law like this is particularly distressing  The new legislation should have ensured that areas like Long Island can continue to receive necessary Ryan White funds  The Administration s failure to apply this definition to the Nassau Suffolk EMA is extremely concerning and I will be calling on the Department of Health and Human Services once again to keep their side of the bargain and recognize the clear need in this region   Senator Clinton said            It is essential that Long Islander s continue to receive the vital care and services provided under this Act   said Congressman King   I will continue to fight to make sure that a simple misinterpretation of language does not jeopardize the lives of my constituents in any way   This is not a matter of semantics  it is a matter of life and death to thousands of people across Long Island            With over 3 200 Long Islanders living with AIDS  now is not the time to cut critical Ryan White funding   said Congressman Israel   Long Island should be praised for its efforts in preventing the spread of AIDS  not punished            We believe that the federal government has misinterpreted the new law to the detriment of Nassau and Suffolk Counties   said Nassau County Executive Thomas R  Suozzi   We are currently reviewing all of our options including litigation  Our low income  uninsured and under insured people living with HIV AIDS depend on the treatment and support services provided through the Ryan White CARE Act  and any decline in the level of funding we receive will greatly affect these programs            It is essential that this critical funding continue as more than three thousand people in Nassau and Suffolk depend on it for essential medical treatment and supportive care   said Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy Adding a second  more restrictive criteria  impacts not only those presently infected but will deny care to newly infected individuals  We thank Congress members Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel for their quick action and their determination to protect our region s interest in the area of funding for care for persons with HIV and AIDS            The Nassau County Executive was recently notified by HHS that the Nassau Suffolk region no longer qualifies as an EMA under the recently reauthorized Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006  The decision to discontinue the Nassau Suffolk region s eligibility as an EMA would devastate the HIV AIDS infrastructure Nassau Suffolk has carefully constructed to care for individuals with HIV AIDS            Under HHS  interpretation of the newly reauthorized Ryan White CARE Act  altered to address underfunded areas of the country  a community must have both 2 000 new AIDS cases over the last five years as well as 3 000 living AIDS cases as reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  data in the most recently reported calendar year  While Long Island meets the requirement for living AIDS cases in the most recently reported CDC data  it falls short of the second requirement  cases going back five years  with only 1 505 newly diagnosed cases for 2001 2005          Today  Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel called for a repeal of the decision  arguing that according to the reauthorization s legislative language  the Nassau Suffolk region only has to meet one of the two requirements to qualify as an EMA  While it does not meet the requirement for newly diagnosed AIDS cases over the last five years  it does meet the requirement of having a total of more than 3 000 living AIDS cases in the most recently reported CDC data  In a February 7th letter sent to HHS  the Senators and Congressmen argued that EMA eligibility is only lost when an area fails to meet both of the above requirements  Today  they also stated that it has been well established that where the conjunctive term  and  is used in statute  the legislative intent is that all of the requirements of statute must be fulfilled   Therefore  the Senators and Congressmen believe that the language of the Act leaves no room for the interpretation that Department of Health and Human Services has reached
