statement for the Congressional Record honoring Shirley Chisholm is attached        Senator Clinton Statement for the Congressional Record   Honoring Rep  Shirley Chisholm        I add my voice to so many in New York and Washington who are mourning the loss of Rep  Shirley Chisholm of New York  Shirley Chisholm was a bold pioneer who fought for civil rights and equality with an energy that forever changed the way American politics deals with matters of race and gender         When she was elected to Congress in 1968  Rep  Chisholm became the first African American congresswoman  She overcame the twin obstacles of racism and sexism to win election  But she didn t stop there  When she reached Congress she spoke with a loud  clear voice  and she quickly lived up to her slogan of being  unbought and unbossed   She was a co founder of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969  and she fought to improve the lives and opportunities of inner city children and families  She opposed the Vietnam War and the military draft  And she bravely declaimed the sexism and racism she encountered in a political world that  prior to her arrival  had been exclusively white and almost exclusively male         Her positions on the issues and her statements about race and gender made her a lightning rod for criticism  But despite the intense pressure of being both outspoken and a  first   Rep  Chisholm continued to blaze a path to greater equality  In 1972  she became the first woman to run for the Democratic presidential nomination  Despite being largely ignored by the media  her committed run for the Presidency  and the 152 delegates she won  proved to the entire country that a woman was up to the task of taking on a serious run for national office         Rep  Chisholm was a powerful symbol  an  historical person  as she put it  But perhaps her greatest achievement was reminding us that the purpose of fighting for equality is not to simply make a point or become a symbol  it is to work for that day when we can all enjoy the quiet responsibility of being equal  As she explained in her 1969 speech to the House in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment   A woman who aspires to be the chairman of the board or a member of the House does so for exactly the same reason as any man       She thinks she can do the job and she wants to try          Arthur Ashe said that heroism  is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost  but the urge to serve others at whatever cost   Rep  Chisholm was a heroine  She knew that  there is little place in the political scheme of things for an independent  creative personality  for a fighter  Anyone who takes that role must pay a price   She paid that price in order to serve Americans who were not being served by the political establishment  She fought injustice and discrimination and refused to be cowed by a history of exclusion  And in so doing  she served not only the constituents of her time but all Americans for all times         Shirley Chisholm s legacy is undeniable  thirteen African American women served in the House in the 108th Congress  We are grateful for her life  and we are grateful for the doors she opened and the barriers she brought down on behalf of us all
