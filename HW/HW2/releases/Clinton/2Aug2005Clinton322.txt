              Melville  NY    As part of her ongoing effort to help address the current challenges facing Long Island  Senator Clinton today brought together Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy  Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi and Town Supervisors for a frank discussion of ways to promote and implement a smart growth agenda for the Island  The meeting was a follow up to the   Suburban Evolution    Conference that Senator Clinton hosted with the Long Island Housing Partnership in February of this year          Long Island  s challenges as one of the nation  s oldest suburbs are increasingly putting the pinch on employers and residents  Today  s meeting clearly demonstrates that we are all committed to helping Long Island implement a smart growth agenda for the future     Senator Clinton said of the meeting        Senator Clinton said that the meeting was planned to include a discussion of Long Island officials   plans for sustainable growth and a mutual agreement to work together to examine the challenges and opportunities their towns face  All participants have taken steps to share ideas on the issues of housing  economic development  transportation and Brownfield redevelopment   In particular  the group is working to explore ways that neighboring towns impact one another    both positively and negatively    and ways they may be able to work regionally and cooperatively to achieve shared goals           Long Island  s future is not a partisan issue   Government officials   as well as leaders from the private sector  civic groups and activists  must work together to develop proposals to ensure that Long Island  s growth in the future remains smart and strong     Senator Clinton said          The meeting also was to include a discussion of Senator Clinton  s   Suburban Core Opportunity  Restoration  and Enhancement  SCORE  Act of 2005    which has received support from local Long Island officials   The bill establishes a  250 million Reinvestment Fund authorization within the Department of Housing and Urban Development to support suburban revitalization projects  It was introduced by Senator Clinton in May of this year as a means to promote revitalization initiatives in America  s older suburban communities and help slow down sprawl        The  250 million Reinvestment Fund created by the SCORE Act would allow local community leaders and elected authorities to develop initiatives in cooperation with private sector partners  The proposal would create local   revolving funds    to promote additional and ongoing reinvestment and revitalization projects to create a   cycle of success    within these first suburb communities  stimulating public and private investment  collaborative planning and citizen participation  Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by Congressman King  R NY  and Congresswoman McCarthy  D NY            Long Island  s suburbs face significant economic and growth related challenges and would benefit tremendously from a federal program targeted to their needs that fosters new investment and revitalization     Senator Clinton said         On February 7th  at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Uniondale  hundreds of Long Islanders attended the Long Island Housing Partnership s annual symposium entitled   Suburban Evolution     which centered this year on Smart Growth concepts  Senator Clinton and Congressman Peter King moderated the discussion of issues including Brownfields  affordable housing  transportation  downtown revitalization and environmental preservation         As home to 2 8 million New Yorkers  there are considerable challenges facing Long Island as its population continues to grow                   On Long Island the median price of a house is twice the national average  and 4 7 times the median family income   In fact  a majority of Long Islanders could not afford to purchase the homes they now live in                  Three out of every four Long Island workers drive alone to work and only 1 out of 10 Long Islanders takes public transportation to work                  Nearly two thirds of Long Island  s land surface is covered with buildings  pavement  or other man made structures   However  since residential property accounts for three fourths of this land  less than 10  of the Island  s total land remains
