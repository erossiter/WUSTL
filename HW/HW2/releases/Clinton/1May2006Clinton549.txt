                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee to Hold Hearing Tomorrow on Collins Lieberman Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC     With the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee set to hold a hearing tomorrow on a Collins Lieberman proposal that would abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   Senator Clinton again called on her colleagues to reconsider this proposal   Senator Clinton underscored the need to restore FEMA to a Cabinet level  independent agency that has a qualified Director who reports directly to the President of the United States   In a letter to Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT   Senator Clinton emphasized that eliminating FEMA and moving its responsibilities within the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  would only increase bureaucratic obstacles in our federal government  s ability to prepare for and to respond to disasters in an effective manner   Senator Clinton  along with Senator Trent Lott  R MS   has sponsored legislation to return FEMA to its status under the Clinton Administration            I believe that the lesson learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is that DHS is ill equipped to oversee FEMA and its responsibilities and that consolidating these duties within an independent FEMA is the best way to ensure the efficient and effective handling our federal disaster efforts   It is why I have sponsored legislation restoring FEMA  s independence  and why I hope that you will reconsider your recommendation to dismantle and to reassign its duties within DHS     Senator Clinton wrote          The text of Senator Clinton  s letter to Senators Collins and Lieberman follows            The Honorable Susan Collins                                   Chair                                                 Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  SD 340                                                                     United States Senate                                                     Washington  DC 20510                                                                      The Honorable Joseph I  Lieberman  Ranking Member  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  SH 601  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510      Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman       I write to express again my opinion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  should be reestablished as an independent agency and its Director restored to a Cabinet level position   I was disappointed to learn that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is prepared to recommend that FEMA be abolished and its responsibilities distributed under a new structure within the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    I believe that the lesson learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is that DHS is ill equipped to oversee FEMA and its responsibilities and that consolidating these duties within an independent FEMA is the best way to ensure the efficient and effective handling our federal disaster efforts   It is why I have sponsored legislation restoring FEMA  s independence  and why I hope that you will reconsider your recommendation to dismantle and to reassign its duties within DHS          As recent events have shown  FEMA should not have been moved from an independent  Cabinet level agency to a sub agency of DHS   What we have learned is that FEMA  s mission    to focus on preparedness  response  recovery and mitigation of disasters    was lost in the growing and expansive bureaucratic structure of the newly formed DHS   The flawed responses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita proved that adding this layer of administration hindered not only the preparation and recovery on the federal level  but also impeded communications between federal  state and local government agencies responsible for disaster preparedness and response   These barriers to effective communication need to be eliminated          For these same reasons  I believe the FEMA Director should report directly to the President and should have full authority to coordinate with all agencies and to take whatever executive action is necessary to ensure needed resources and recovery personnel are deployed to impacted areas in an efficient and timely manner   Restoring these direct lines of communication will make FEMA more effective and will help restore the public  s confidence in the federal government  s ability to prepare for and respond to natural and manmade catastrophes            Finally  restoring our citizens   confidence in our federal government  s ability to handle disasters requires the appointment of qualified people with the requisite emergency services experience to lead our disaster efforts   The Director and Deputy Director must be people whose professional qualifications make them right for the difficult job of coordinating our disaster preparation and response             I urge you to reconsider your recommendation to abolish FEMA and to redistribute its responsibilities within the Department of Homeland Security   As recent  tragic events have shown  the current bureaucratic model hinders our ability to effectively and efficiently prepare and respond to disasters           Thank you for your consideration           Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
