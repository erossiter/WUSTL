June 29  2006 Statement of Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Supreme Court  s Decision in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld   I applaud today  s ruling by the Supreme Court that the President cannot proceed with the military tribunals he created to prosecute detainees held at the U S  Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay  Cuba   The Court did not rule that the President must release any detainees from custody   Instead  it held that if the President wishes to charge the detainees with war crimes  he must do so in compliance with the rule of law   The Court confirmed that the President is not above the law           The seeds of this situation were sown when the President chose his course for the war against terror   Rather than treating the detainees in accordance with the governing principles of military engagement  he chose to institute policies that demonstrate disrespect for the rule of law  which has in turn lowered our nation  s moral standing in the world   Had the President chosen instead to respect international conventions that provide due process protections  we would not be facing the unprecedented problem we have before us            As we move forward  I invite the President to work with Congress to draft clear rules for the prosecution of terrorists  rules that will ensure the safety of our citizens at home as well as our soldiers abroad   We must work towards a system that corrects the missteps made by the President  respects the rule of law  and restores our nation to its proper standing in the world
