July 19  2005 Senator Clinton on the Nomination of Judge John G  Roberts Jr  to the Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Now that the President has nominated Judge John G  Roberts Jr  to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court  the Senate must initiate a thoughtful and deliberate process of closely examining and scrutinizing Judge Roberts   record   Not only does a thorough examination ensure that Judge Roberts is qualified to serve a lifetime appointment to our nation  s highest court  it also allows the Senate to fully discharge its constitutional mandate of providing the President with meaningful   Advice and Consent    on his nomination            In the coming weeks  the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin the process of studying Judge Roberts   record   I look forward to the Committee  s findings so that I can make an informed decision about whether Judge Roberts is truly a guardian of the rule of law who puts fairness and justice before ideology
