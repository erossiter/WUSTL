February 15  2005 Senator Clinton Meets With Army Corps of Engineers to Push for Action on Long Island Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator calls for action on Tiana Beach erosion  Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study and Long Island Sound Dredge Management Plan  NY Corps head pledges to work with Senator Clinton to get the results Long Island deserves                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today met with Colonel Richard J  Polo  Commander of the New York District of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  to press for action on a number of major environmental issues effecting Long Island         During the meeting  Senator Clinton requested that the Army Corps respond immediately to the erosion problems at Tiana Beach in Southampton  Specifically  the Senator requested that the Corps send representatives to the County s February 17th meeting with elected and regulatory officials and provide whatever technical and other resources they can to respond to this emergency  In addition  Senator Clinton asked that the Corps update the Breach Contingency Plan to reflect current conditions in order to be better prepared for any future breaches  In the meeting  Col  Polo agreed to send representatives to the meeting and to do everything possible to expedite the emergency permit needed to enable sand to be placed on the beach         At the meeting  Senator Clinton also stressed the importance of restoring funding for the  Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study   Last week  Senator Clinton strongly criticized the Bush Administration s budget for abandoning the Army Corps of Engineers  study of the shoreline from Fire Island to Montauk Point  The President s budget for Fiscal Year 2006  released last Monday  eliminates funding for the study for the second year in a row  Last year  when the President s FY 2005 budget also zeroed out the study  Senator Clinton worked with Congressman Bishop and County Executive Levy to get the Administration to restore funding for the study  After raising the issue in a Senate hearing in March of 2004  Senator Clinton received a commitment from the Corps of Engineers in June to restore funding for fiscal year 2005  and the study was funded at  1 4 million         Finally  Senator Clinton requested Col  Polo s immediate personal attention be given to the development of a Dredged Material Management Plan  DMMP  for Long Island Sound to ensure that this important work goes forward  In 2004  Senator Clinton introduced legislation to require the Corps to create a DMMP after public outcry about an EPA proposal to designate long term dredge disposal sites in the Sound         I was pleased to meet with Col  Polo today and to raise with him some of the critical environmental issues that are facing Long Island   Senator Clinton said   From shoreline erosion to the proposal to dump dredge management in the Sound  these issues affect the lives of millions of people living on Long Island and must be addressed as soon as possible         At the meeting  Senator Clinton presented Col  Polo with a letter outlining her concerns and her requests for action  A copy of the Senator s letter is attached        February 15  2005   Colonel Richard J  Polo  Jr    Commander and District Engineer   US Army Corps of Engineers  New York District   26 Federal Plaza   New York  NY 10278 0090          Dear Colonel Polo           Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss the vital work of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers in New York State  There are several issues in particular that I would appreciate your attention to        Tiana Beach   As you are aware  the ocean beach along Dune Road in the area between Mermaid Lane and Ponquogue Bridge in Hampton Bays  Southampton has suffered severe coastal erosion as a result of past and current winter storm systems passing over the Northeast region  Yesterday  Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy declared a state of emergency for this area of the county  To develop a coordinated response  the county will host a meeting on Thursday  February 17th with elected and regulatory officials from town  county  state  and federal government  I ask that you send representatives to this meeting and provide whatever technical and other resources the Corps can provide to respond to this emergency  In addition  I ask that you update the Breach Contingency Plan to reflect current conditions so that we are better prepared for any future breaches        The Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study   As you know  the Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study is a partnership between the Corps of Engineers and other federal and state agencies to develop a comprehensive  long term plan to protect coastal areas that are prone to flooding  erosion and other storm damage  The plan would replace ad hoc measures that have been used to protect individual properties with a comprehensive management approach that considers the entire coastal system         This vital study is nearing completion  and so I was dismayed to discover last week that the President s budget for FY 2006 eliminates funding for the second year in a row  Last year  I worked to bring this short sighted decision to the attention of the Corps  and received a commitment from the Corps of Engineers in June to restore funding for Fiscal Year 2005 and 2006  The Corps made good on the first half of this promise  and the study was funded at  1 4 million in FY 2005  I urge you to work with Corps Headquarters staff to again find a way to restore funding to complete this study        Environmental Restoration in NY Harbor   I am pleased that the President s FY 06 budget includes  101 million for continued work on the New York and New Jersey Harbor Project  I trust that this level of funding is will enable the harbor deepening to continue to stay on schedule  However  I am concerned that the environmental restoration component of the harbor project is lagging behind the deepening work  and I ask that you work to ensure that this important part of the project moves forward more expeditiously        Dredged Material Management Plan   As you know  I strongly believe that a long term plan is needed to manage disposal of dredged material in the Long Island Sound watershed  To accomplish this goal  I introduced legislation in 2004 to require the Corps of Engineers to work with the states of New York and Connecticut and the U S  Environmental Protection Agency to develop a Dredged Material Management Plan  DMMP  for Long Island Sound  Therefore  I was pleased to see that Governor Pataki and Governor Rell sent a letter to Lt  General Carl Strock on February 8  2005 asking him to begin developing a DMMP for the Sound  Development of a DMMP that includes alternatives such as reducing sediment sources  reducing contaminant loading  and developing beneficial reuses is critical for the health of the Sound  I request that you give the DMMP your personal attention  and see that work begins as soon as possible         Sincerely
