November 9  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Boeing Winning the U S  Air Force Combat Search and Rescue  CSAR X  Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We are all very disappointed to hear of the decision by the U S  Air Force that they will not be sourcing their new Combat Search and Rescue Personnel Recovery Vehicle out of Lockheed Martin  s facility in New York  s Southern Tier  The incredible skills  expertise and enthusiasm of the workers in Owego were universally acknowledged last year with the contract to build the new U S  101 which brought many jobs to the Southern Tier and has given us so much to build on  New York  s Southern Tier has the some of the best technology and workers anywhere in the world  I know everyone at Lockheed Martin and everyone in the Southern Tier will continue working to build a bright future for their company  their city and their region
