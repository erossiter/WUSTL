April 25  2007 Senator Clinton Questions NRC Heads in Advance of Indian Point Public Meeting Tomorrow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Expresses Dismay that NRC is Not Concerned about Problems at Indian Point   Reiterates Call for Independent Safety Assessment       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today took her continuing concerns about safety and security at Indian Point directly to officials from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  including Commissioner Dale Klein  At an Oversight Hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Senator Clinton put series of questions to top NRC officials in advance of tomorrow s public meeting on Indian Point  Following the hearing  Senator Clinton said she was disappointed by the NRC s continued reluctance to undertake an Independent Safety Assessment of Indian Point and was alarmed by their lack of concern about the litany of problems the facility has experienced in recent months             I was glad to have the opportunity to raise my concerns directly with the NRC Commissioners  but I am disappointed that they do not share my level of concern about the numerous problems that have arisen at the facility over the last several years   Senator Clinton said   I hope that the NRC officials have better answers for the people in the surrounding communities at tomorrow s public meeting   And I continue to think that an Independent Assessment is needed to restore public confidence in Indian Point  particularly in light of Entergy s intent to apply to re license the plant           The Senators heard from Dale Klein  Chairman  Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a number of NRC Commissioners including Ed McGaffigan  Jeff Merrifield  Greg Jaczko and Pete Lyons           A transcript of Senator Clinton s questions to the NRC appears below      Senate Environment and Public Works Committee   Oversight Hearing on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Wednesday  April 25  2007  Senator Clinton    Thank you very much  Mr Chairman and Members of the Commission  it won t surprise you to hear that I have continuing significant concerns about Indian Point and about the adequacy of the oversight that the NRC is providing   That s why I have introduced legislation to require an independent safety assessment at Indian Point   I simply don t have time in my round of questions to recite the full litany of recent problems at Indian Point  or to ask all of the questions that I have for the NRC  so I will submit additional questions in writing   But I do want to briefly describe some of the recent problems            Indians Point s rate of unplanned emergency shutdowns is now five to six times higher then the national average for all nuclear plants in the United States   And Indian Point Unit three has had three unplanned shutdowns just so far in 2007   Entergy recently failed to comply with an extended deadline of April 15 to have a new siren system installed in the communities around Indian Point pursuant to a requirement that I added to the 2005 Energy Bill   In December of 2006  the NRC gave Entergy 30 days to come up with a plan to resolve what the agency called a  chilling effect  among workers who might be intimidated to not bring safety concerns forward   In August of 2005  a leak was discovered in a spent fuel pool that seeped into the groundwater beneath the plant and reached the Hudson River  and that leak continues today          So you can see why I m concerned because my constituents are concerned and just about every week we pick up the local newspaper and find some other problem at Indian Point            First  I want to say thank you to the NRC for deciding to issue a fine of  130 000 for the failure of the sirens   But I remain concerned about Entergy s failure to meet a deadline that had already been extended three months   What is the cause of the delay  When do you expect the sirens to be fully operational  And why did you choose to assess a fine of  130 000  equivalent to the maximum daily penalty  when the violation has now exceeded ten days            With respect to the Independent Safety Assessment  when I discussed this with the NRC last year  I was assured that the NRC would conduct extra inspections at Indian Point   My understanding is those are underway  but the reality is that problems continue at the plant  and there is a significant trust gap in what the NRC is doing in Westchester and around Indian Point  If the NRC is so confident that its inspections are well run  why hasn t the NRC invited outside observers from state and local governments  and NGOs to participate in these added inspections            With respect to the  chilling effect  that you determined existed at Indian Point  I note that the commission relied on independent assessments to reach this conclusion   Why is relying on independent assessments appropriate in this case but not in looking at other safety issues          What is the estimated timeframe for stopping the current leaks from the spent fuel pool at Indian Point Unit one   Are Entergy s decommissioning funds sufficient to cover the groundwater cleanup          So these are some of the questions and I ask them all at one time because it may very well be that you want to answer them all at one time instead of taking them piecemeal   But I hope that NRC is prepared to address these concerns and other concerns from local governments tomorrow during the Annual Safety Review in Westchester County            And Mr  Chairman I want to ask a request of you  I hope we can examine the issue of the adequacy of the reactor oversight process and the need for independent safety assessments in some detail  because I think there are certain cases  and I believe Indian Point is one  where that additional safety check is necessary   So  Mr  Chairman and Commissioners  could you perhaps respond to my general concerns about Indian Point       Chairman Klein   Well Senator Clinton  as we had visited prior to my confirmation hearing  that it does seem like   as you indicated Indian Point is snake bit at some times   it certainly  things like not getting the sirens working does not instill public confidence and so we are addressing those issues            Let me talk more broadly and then turn it over to Commissioner McGaffigan for further comments but I d like to just talk a little bit about the independent safety assessment and compare it with our reactor oversight   One of the tasks that I looked at when I became Chairman was the Independent Safety Assessment and the reactor oversight and did a comparison   I don t believe we are doing a good job at the agency of explaining what our reactor oversight program is and what it does   It s a continuous evaluation process  Independent safety assessments tend to be a snapshot look   And I think we need to do a better job as an agency of articulating what the NRC does  And as you and I have talked in the past  we want all of our reactors to be safe and examined  including Indian Point   So we try and we do have a program to ensure that the reactors are safe   We have a rigorous inspection process and I d like to let Commissioner McGaffigan to talk a little further on the reactor oversight program and the independent safety assessment concepts       Commissioner McGaffigan     Thank you Mr  Chairman  First  I d like to tell Senator Clinton I ve been over ten and half years at the Commission and we have given Indian Point very close attention   The people of New York should thank God everyday that Entergy is running that site as an integrated site   ConEd and NYPA were not interested in running a safe nuclear site  they wanted to be out of the business   So  I believe Entergy has been an enormous step forward for the Indian Point site            Let me turn to the ISA  I also happen to be the sole commissioner left who actually watched the first  the one and only  ISA we ever conducted at Main Yankee  And Senator Sanders earlier today talked about how our ISA lead to the closure   Our ISA was an ad hoc procedure that we invented in 1996 on a one time basis   We had allegations that our Region one was too close to the licensee  We had people from outside of that region and outside the office of nuclear reactor regulations come in   We had state involvement because we had an agreement with them   We have state involvement in inspections  such as engineering inspections today at Indian Point   Our reactor oversight process that was developed in the late 90s  is infinitely better in my view than the ad hoc ISA that was conducted at Main Yankee   And it was not our conducting an ISA that lead to the closure of Main Yankee  it was a corporate structure with 14 different owners  many of which wanted to get out of the nuclear business  They had plenty of decommissioning funds and so they said we re out  They brought Entergy in  They let them work for only a few months  Entergy would have been able to save that plant  And in some sense it s a sad story that corporate governance led to the closure of Main Yankee because it could be providing a lot of very needed power in New England today  We have a much better   we could talk to you about this at great length   why the reactor oversight hearing program today  augmented as we deem necessary at Indian Point  is so much better than the ISA conducted in 1996       Senator Clinton    If I could  Mr  McGaffigan suggest that it might be worth considering having outside observers to try to rebuild some confidence in the work that you re doing   You all know  because you ve been following this  it is just a terrible dilemma because there is a feeling that we are keep being reassured that everything is fine and then something goes wrong   It may be that the work that was done before was not up to standards and there is still a lot of issues  But why not  let some outsiders in so at least there can be validation of the work that you describe is going on under the NRC s supervision       Commissioner McGaffigan    I do think we invite the state the engineering inspection that Commissioner Diaz initiated  In fact the whole concept of these extra engineering inspections  We had  or invited it  I don t know if it was taken advantage of when we had the first of our engineering inspections earlier this year  That is our protocol and that is our protocol in other states   The state of Illinois is famous for its aggressive participation in our inspections and we don t move away from that at all   I think a lot of the people who want Independent Safety Assessments really have quite a negative agendas  vis a vis nuclear power  and I think their version of an independent safety assessment is one where folks who are really quite opposed to nuclear power come in and second guess fairly minor incidents       Senator Clinton   Could I ask Commissioner Jazcko to comment       Commissioner Jazcko    I certainly think it s an interesting suggestion and I think it s one that I would support of look at ways that we could include an outside observer   I think your point about the trust gap is really very accurate  I think what we are dealing with at Indian Point is  to some extent  is a trust gap   There are situations and problems that you mentioned but based on our assessments in the oversight process  we think that those are lower on the level of safety significance   So they re not issues that we think are of tremendous safety significance  but I think we re having a challenge communicating that to the public around that plant   And I think adding something like outside observers to one of these design engineering inspections could perhaps go towards addressing that trust gap  And I believe we have done an inspection for Indian Point two as part of this design inspection   I believe that Indian Point three s inspection is coming up in the fall  So that would certainly be an area where I would support figuring out a way to include some outside observers  I think it would be good for the agency to show the process that we use to go through this inspection       Senator Clinton   Commissioner Merrifield       Commissioner Merrifield   Senator Clinton I appreciate the suggestion  I think it s certainly one we could take a further look at  I don t think I am willing to commit at this point to having external folks come on board  Frankly  as an agency that is trying to be very open in conducting inspections  we have a series of public meetings after that where open up our results  we have a dialogue in public to explain what we do  our staff goes into great detail about the process that we use  the facility s we inspected and the results           I think one of the things that we get somewhat defensive   and I think it s somewhat understandable  is we were appointed as the independent regulator of nuclear power and I think some of our staff understandably takes some umbrage when the issue  well gee you re not independent enough and there is a lost of trust  In our view  and I think one of the challenges that we deal with as an independent regulator  is we have to call it as we see it  And it is sort of like a soccer game  the officials  you re going to have certain people in the stadium that aren t going to like your calls and certain people who are  simply based on the score  And I agree with Commissioner McGaffigan   I think that there are some individuals  and certainly  I don t mean to impune your desire to seek the legislation  but I think there are some individuals  who believe that were we go down the route of an ISA at Indian Point that would have the same result as Main Yankee  But I agree with Ed   I think it s a completely different factual situation relative to the issues that we were confronted with at Main Yankee  which were quite serious  And the issues  although you have noted them at Indian Point  are not nearly of the same safety significance  We have to worry about having a degree of uniformity in the inspection programs that we do and I think that s ultimately one of the concerns I have that the application of our processes at Indian Point should also be applicable to my home state plant of Seabrook  to Arkansas Nuclear One  the Palo Verde in Arizona and elsewhere  And to the extent we get ourselves in a point of cherry picking additional inspection resources based simply on issues of public concern  I think that gets us into a very unpredictable standpoint as a regulator       Senator Clinton   Well let me just end by saying as I understand what Commissioner McGaffigan said  that you do work with the state and the state could participate in some fashion  Is that correct       Commissioner McGaffigan   That s my understanding  I don t know whether the January inspection  whether they took advantage of the opportunity or not       Witness   It is my understanding that the state did have an observer for the inspection at Indian Point two that we did       Senator Clinton   Thank you Mr  Chairman              Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Indian Point
