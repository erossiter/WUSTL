May 26  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on NRC to Require Backup Power for Emergency Sirens Around Nuclear Power Plants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  to reverse its decision not to mandate emergency response backup power systems for New York s and the nation s nuclear power plants  In a letter to NRC Chairman Diaz and in questions submitted to the NRC at an oversight hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air  Climate Change  and Nuclear Safety  Senator Clinton called for the decision to be changed immediately         In her letter  Senator Clinton also requested a meeting with the Chairman to discuss the issue and bring to light the reason for the NRC s decision          I was disturbed by the NRC s decision last Friday to reject a petition that would require all nuclear plants to equip emergency notification systems with backup power sources independent from the electrical grid   Senator Clinton said          I believe it is imperative that in the event of an accident  or an act of terrorism  we are able to promptly notify the public of a radiological emergency  It is critical that we have an effective emergency preparedness system in place at Indian Point and all the nuclear power plants across the state and the country         Last week  the NRC rejected a petition filed by several local governments and citizens groups that called on the Commission to require that all nuclear plants equip their emergency notification systems with backup power systems so in the event of a crisis that results in a loss of power  the public could still be promptly warned  Currently  New York s nuclear power plants including    Ginna  Indian Point  James A  Fitzpatrick  and Nine Mile Point    are not equipped with backup sources of power          A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is attached        May 26  2005       Nils J  Diaz  Ph D    Chairman  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Washington  D C  20555       Dear Dr  Diaz        I write to request a meeting with you to discuss an important nuclear plant security issue         As you know  I have taken a very active interest in security and emergency preparedness at Indian Point and other plants in New York  I was disturbed to learn recently that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  had rejected a public petition filed by local governments and citizen groups  including several groups from New York         The petition asked the NRC to require all nuclear plants to equip emergency notification sirens with backup power sources independent from the electrical grid  so that in the event of an accident or an act of terrorism accompanied by a loss of power the public could still be promptly notified of a radiological emergency  My understanding is that of the 62 commercial reactor sites that use sirens as warning systems  27  have backup power for all sirens  33  percent for some of the sirens and 40  have no backup at all  Indian Point has no backup power for its sirens  and I understand that none of the other New York plants have backup power for their sirens either         This decision defies common sense  In the event of a successful attack on a nuclear plant  it seems obvious that disruptions of the grid in surrounding areas are a possible if not likely outcome  What good are emergency sirens if they are not going to sound in the event of an attack         In your response to the petition  you include several justifications for your decision  One is that the petition was improperly filed  In addition  you suggest that this is perhaps a responsibility of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  or the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   and not the NRC  In my view  none of these answers is satisfactory  The NRC issues the operating licenses for our commercial reactors  and it is the responsibility of the NRC to make certain that emergency response plans work at Indian Point and other nuclear power plants across the country         I urge you to reconsider and change your decision  If we need to change the law to make this happen  then I will work with you and my colleagues to see that appropriate legislation is expeditiously introduced in the United States Senate  I look forward to meeting with you shortly to discuss this issue further         Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
