March 9  2006 Senator Clinton Urges Senate Leaders to Oppose the President  s Harmful Proposals to Dairy Farmers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Administration  s Budget Proposals would have shocking impact on New York  s Dairy Farmers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with her Senate colleagues in urging the leadership of the Senate Budget Committee to oppose the Administration  s proposal to cut the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  payments by 5 percent  and tax every dairy farmer in America 3 cents per hundred weight on all of their production             It is outrageous that this Administration is targeting our nation s dairy farmers with unfair and unsound policies that erode the safety net promised to them     Senator Clinton said    New York  s dairy farmers are the heart and soul of many of our rural communities  it is imperative that we do everything that we can to ensure that we provide them with the support that they need  I  m hopeful that the leadership of the Senate Budget Committee will do what is right and support our nation  s dairy farmers           Senator Clinton joined sixteen of her colleagues in signing onto a bipartisan letter to Senator Judd Gregg and Senator Kent Conrad  the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee respectfully   The letter calls on the leaders to reject the Administration  s proposed budget cuts and fee increases on America  s dairy farmers            Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate for New York  s dairy farmers  in particular fighting to extend the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program  which is a critical safety net to New York farmers and expired at the end of September of last year   The Senate approved an extension for the MILC program until 2007 at the end of last year   Since its inception  New York producers have received approximately  186 2 million in total MILC payments   About 95  of dairy farmers in Wyoming County  New York  s largest dairy producing county  and more than 90  of dairy farmers statewide have received MILC payments since the program  s inception in 2002   In addition  several counties in the dairy producing region of New York  s North Country  specifically St  Lawrence  Jefferson and Lewis counties  have each received over  8 million dollars in MILC assistance          The President  s budget also proposed a 3 cent per hundredweight farmer assessment tax on all milk produced   New York farmers produced about 11 7 billion pounds of milk last year  which would amount to a cost of over  3 5 million to New York State producers   Nationwide  the assessment is estimated to cost dairy farmers  55 million in fiscal year 2007   The budget also proposes a statutory mechanism to adjust the so called   butter powder tilt    in the dairy support program which would give USDA the authority to lower the support price that farmers receive  a change that is expected to cost dairy farmers  32 million            In addition  Senator Clinton has introduced legislation to block the dumping of milk protein concentrates into the U S  market  which has been thought to contribute to depressed milk prices and she has hosted several discussions forums with farmers in different parts of New York State to address ways to support the dairy industry          The full text of the letter follows          The Honorable Judd Gregg  Chairman  The Honorable Kent Conrad  Ranking Member  Committee on Budget  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad           We are writing to urge you to oppose the Administration  s budget proposals for our nation  s dairy producers   While the Administration has unjustifiably targeted agriculture programs for much greater cuts than many other government expenditures  hardworking dairy farmers are targeted for even deeper cuts            The President  s budget targets dairy farmers   income in three ways  by reducing the value of the price support program  cutting Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  payments by 5 percent  and taxing every dairy farmer in America 3 cents per cwt  on all of their production   There is no fair or justifiable reason to single out dairy farmers for such drastic programmatic cuts and tax increases            Though the Administration claims these cuts and tax increases are needed to recover the cost of dairy programs  the MILC program and the dairy price support program cost the government little or nothing to operate in 2005   These proposals amount to unfair taxation  not cost recovery for dairy programs            Furthermore the President  s plan to impose a new tax on every dairy producer in this country is not only at odds with the Administration  s efforts to extend and expand earlier tax cuts  but it comes at a time when dairy producers are already burdened by high fuel and utility costs  and declining prices   Budgeting for additional tax cuts for some while raising taxes on hard working family dairy farmers is doubly inexcusable             We strongly urge you to reject the Administration  s proposed budget cuts and tax increases on America  s dairy farmers
