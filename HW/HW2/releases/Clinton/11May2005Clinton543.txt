May 11  2005 Senator Clinton Urges Department of Veterans   Affairs to Reconsider Transfer of Services from Montrose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Transfer of Psychiatric and Long Term Care Inpatient Services from Montrose to Castle Point Could Undermine Care for Area Veterans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Senator Clinton today urged the Department of Veterans   Affairs to rethink the ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care inpatient services from the Montrose VA hospital to the Castle Point facility   Senator Clinton underscored her long standing opposition to consolidating the facilities in testimony conducted by telephone today for a Local Advisory Panel hearing held as part of the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  project          I oppose the VA  s ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care in patient services from the Montrose campus to the Castle Point campus   At this time  when we are seeing so many sacrifices  injuries and difficulties by our brave troops serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  I think it sends the wrong message to propose drastic changes in veterans   health care               Senator Clinton noted that her office had received information indicating there are still substantial waiting periods for certain services that veterans living in this region experience at VA Hudson Valley Health Care System facilities   This underlines the strain the system is experiencing and underscores the need for additional analysis before closing these in patient services at Montrose and shifting additional patient care to Castle Point          I hear from many of our veterans about significant delays in getting services at our already overstressed facilities and I don  t believe that we are prepared to make these changes without additional analysis             Senator Clinton underscored the importance of ensuring that VA s planning process for the Montrose and Castle Point VA hospitals is fully transparent   As a result of the Clinton Enzi CARES amendment  the Consolidated Appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2004 expressed concern that the recommendations of the CARES commission may lead to a reduction in long term care  domiciliary care and mental health services   The VA was expected to expedite the strategic planning process for these services  and Congress urged that no closures or reduction in these services take place until the full analysis was completed   However  the VA is moving forward with plans to shift inpatient mental health and long term care services from Montrose to Castle Point  apparently without having completed the strategic planning process for mental health care and long term care  or without having released the plans to the public if they have been completed        Senator Clinton also urged that the transportation challenges faced by seniors and disabled veterans in the Hudson Valley take a prominent role in the CARES deliberations   Many who rely on the Montrose VA for services could have great difficulty making the trip to the Castle Point VA            I urge the panel to take into account all of these factors and listen to the voices of New York veterans           Senator Clinton has fought for New York s veterans throughout the CARES process  Last month  Senator Clinton met with VA Secretary Nicholson to reiterate her serious concerns regarding the VA CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study yet more changes in New York s VA facilities  Secretary Nicholson agreed to consider the points she raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Montrose and Castle Point VAs         Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York s veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care and to keep New York VA hospitals open                   A copy of Senator Clinton  s testimony submitted to the hearing is attached       Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton   Before the Local Advisory Panel of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project   May 11  2005  Montrose  New York    Introduction    Distinguished members of the Panel  let me thank you for allowing me to present testimony on the consequences the Department of Veterans Affairs Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project  CARES  would have on the veterans of New York and the people who serve their needs at these institutions   As I will explain more fully below  I oppose the VA  s ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care inpatient services from the Montrose campus to the Castle Point campus        At this time in our nation  s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation  Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care        As a starting point  our bottom line goal should be the delivery of high quality health care services to our veterans  delivered as efficiently as possible  Veterans   health care is too important an issue to require an adherence to artificial deadlines and hasty recommendations   With literally the lives of veterans at stake  the panel should not engage in a rush to judgment over closing or reducing services at VA facilities and should not elevate financial considerations over the needs of our veterans       Listening to Veterans    On April 19th  I met with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson and handed him a letter in which I reiterated my serious concerns regarding the VA  s CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study further changes in New York  s VA facilities   He agreed to consider the serious concerns I raised regarding the Montrose and Castle Point VA  s        I must underline at the outset how absolutely essential it is that during this next phase in the process  the VA s planning process for the Montrose and Castle Point VA s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process  It is the veterans who must remain at the center of this process   I cannot stress strongly enough how essential it is that full community involvement be central to the process from beginning to end  With the full involvement of the community in these decisions  the VA will help to maximize the possibility that that our veterans will get the highest quality health care they deserve       VA CARES Process    There have been several stages to the CARES process  which in my view has been a rushed process that did not adequately heed the voices of New York  s veterans   The Draft National CARES Plan recommended eliminating all inpatient services at Montrose VA hospital and transferring inpatient beds to Castle Point   I strongly opposed that plan        The CARES Commission recommended that inpatient psychiatric and nursing home beds be moved from Montrose to Castle Point  but that domiciliary based residential rehabilitation programs and ambulatory care services stay at Montrose        Former VA Secretary Anthony Principi  s CARES Decision Document  VA Decision Document   issued in May 2004  directed VA to   transfer acute psychiatric  long term psychiatric  and nursing home beds from the Montrose to the Castle Point campus  To accomplish this consolidation  VA will augment the mission at the Castle Point campus with new construction and reduce the footprint on the Montrose campus through an enhanced use lease for assisted living and other compatible uses or divestiture of property     including a possible joint effort with the National Cemetery Administration   The Decision Document also states that by consolidation at Castle Point    VA can build one new state of the art and appropriately sized nursing home    and   develop plans for the size of the new nursing home using its long term care and mental health strategic plans      At the Montrose campus    VA will continue to provide outpatient  domiciliary  and residential rehabilitation services                Proposed Consolidation of Services between Montrose and Castle Point VA  s    I have long opposed ill considered proposals to move inpatient psychiatric and long term care beds from Montrose to Castle Point  and have maintained that a decision to follow through on this recommendation would be a serious blow to veterans who currently rely on the Montrose VA hospital for their care         The Decisions Document explicitly calls for the development of plans for a new nursing home using   its long term care and mental health strategic plans      Unfortunately  it appears the VA has either not yet completed its strategic planning process for long term care and mental health care  or  if either plan has finally been completed  VA has failed to release it to the public        In the absence of strategic plans  proceeding with these changes at New York s facilities calls into question the VA s commitment to follow congressionally expressed intent regarding CARES  As the result of the introduction of the Clinton Enzi CARES amendment to the Fiscal Year 2004 Senate VA HUD appropriations bill  the House Senate conferees specifically stated in the Fiscal Year 2004 Consolidated Appropriations conference report that they  are concerned that the realignment recommendations of the CARES Commission may lead to a reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services  The VA is expected to expedite the strategic planning process for these services  Based on the Secretary s statements the conferees urge that no closures or reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services  will take place until the full analysis is completed   In addition  in November 2003  former Secretary Principi pledged  no net reduction in VA s capacity to provide inpatient mental health and long term care prior to completion of a comprehensive assessment of veterans  need for these services         Moreover  moving inpatient services from Montrose to Castle Point will no doubt require substantial sums of federal funding   My office is not aware of any analysis showing how veterans will get services if future budgets do not include enough funds for the transition        Moreover  the challenges of travel faced by seniors and disabled veterans in the Hudson Valley should take a prominent role in your deliberations   Many who rely on the Montrose VA could find it extremely difficult to make the trip to the Castle Point VA         In light of these concerns and the failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to issue its strategic planning for mental health and psychiatric care  the Montrose closure should be reconsidered   According to information provided to my office by the VA Hudson Valley Health Care System  there are still substantial waiting periods for certain services that veterans living in this region experience at VA Hudson Valley Health Care System facilities  This underlines the strain the system is experiencing   Clearly  additional analysis is necessary before closing in patient services at Montrose and shifting additional patient care to Castle Point       Conclusion     In meeting with veterans and hearing the comments that veterans and other stakeholders have provided to my office  I have learned a tremendous amount about the value of these facilities and the quality of health care that is delivered there   Our nation  s veterans have served their country with distinction   Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces    a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system   Yet the VA  s ill considered decision to consolidate the Montrose and Castle Point VA  s threatens to undermine our commitment to our nation  s veterans   I urge the Panel to take into account the proper factors and input from veterans  I believe that if you listen to the voices of New York  s veterans  you will make the right decisions for our veterans        Thank you
