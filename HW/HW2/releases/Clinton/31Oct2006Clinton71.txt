October 31  2006 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton s Remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Thank you  Pete  Thank you very much  Well  it is a great privilege and honor to be back here at the Council and I want to thank Pete for that kind introduction  It s another small world story  I had no idea he had ever lived in Park Ridge  Illinois  And I want to congratulate you  Pete  on the recent re naming of the Institute for International Economics in your honor  That is a great tribute to the wonderful service that you have provided to the public over many years at the Council and government and now at what will be known as the Peterson Institute          I last spoke here in December 2003  Richard Haass was just settling into his new job  Saddam Hussein had been captured the weekend before  At that time I advanced the idea espoused by the Council that American internationalism is essential in the service of American interests          Three years later  the Council is flourishing under Richard s leadership  I cannot say the same about our foreign policy          I return today one week before an historic midterm election to argue with even greater urgency that our country desperately needs a foreign policy built on bipartisan consensus and executed with non partisan competence  When the votes are counted  the White House and the Congress must work together to forge that policy and ensure its execution          You all know the litany of threats and challenges          The metastasizing threat of terrorist networks recruiting troops  setting up training camps  amassing weapons          A regime in North Korea openly testing missiles and nuclear weapons  An activist  expansionist Iran pursuing its own nuclear arsenal  A resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan  and an emerging civil war in Iraq           Russia and China pursuing their own interests often at odds with such global imperatives as nuclear non proliferation and ending genocide in Darfur           Oil has never been more important in funding unstable anti American governments and yet we have failed to make the investments necessary to move more rapidly to alternative fuels  a policy that is now as important to our national security and our Mideast strategy as to our economy and environment          The lost opportunities of the years since September 11 are the stuff of tragedy  Remember the people rallying in sympathy on the streets of Teheran  the famous headline     we are all Americans now   Five years later much of the world wonders what America is now          As we face this landscape of failure and disorder  nothing is more urgent than for us to begin again to rebuild a bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests  increase our security and advance our values          It could well start with what our founders had in mind when they pledged  a decent respect for the opinions of mankind  in the Declaration of Independence  I think it s fair to say we are now all internationalists and we are all realists          This Administration s choices were false choices  Internationalism versus unilateralism  Realism versus idealism  Is there really any argument that America must remain a preeminent leader for peace and freedom  and yet we must be more willing to work in concert with other nations and international institutions to reach common goals          The American character is both idealistic and realistic  why can t our government reflect both          I want to suggest three principles I believe should underlie a bipartisan consensus on national security  and consider how they apply to some of the most difficult challenges we face          First  and most obviously  we must by word and deed renew internationalism for a new century  We did not face World War II alone  We did not face the Cold War alone  And we cannot face the global terrorist threat or other profound challenges alone either  A terrorist cell may recruit in southeast Asia  train in central Asia  find funds in the Middle East and plan attacks in the US or Europe  We can stop a deadly disease anywhere along the line as it hopscotches from continent to continent    or we can wait until it arrives at our own doors  We can deal with climate change together now or excuse its calamitous consequences later  We can turn our back on international institutions  or we can modernize and revitalize them  and when needed get about the hard work of creating new ones          Second  we must value diplomacy as well as a strong military  We should not hesitate to engage in the world s most difficult conflicts on the diplomatic front  We cannot leave the Middle East to solve itself or avoid direct talks with North Korea  When faced with an existential challenge to the life of our nation  President Kennedy said   Let us never negotiate from fear  but let us never fear to negotiate   Direct negotiations are not a sign of weakness  They re a sign of leadership          Third  our foreign policy must blend both idealism and realism in the service of American interests  If there is one idea that has been floated about over the last six years that I would like to see debunked  with all due respect to some of the political scientists in the room  it is this false choice between realism and idealism          Is it  realist  or  idealist  to stop nuclear proliferation          Is it  realist  or  idealist  to come together on global warming          Is it  realist  or  idealist  to help developing nations educate their children  fight diseases  and grow their economies          And is it  realist  or  idealist  to believe we must turn around the ideology underpinning terrorism          Strategies with respect to all of the problems we face require a mix of both and each requires building that consensus approach that we then have to do the hard work of bringing others to our side  We cannot achieve any of the solutions that we need to be pursuing without American leadership  and we cannot achieve any of them alone          American foreign policy exists to maintain our security and serve our national interests  In an increasingly interdependent world  it is in our interest to stand for the human rights to promote religious freedom  democracy  women s rights  social justice and economic empowerment  But reality informs us we cannot force others  nations and people  to accept those values    we have to support those who embrace them and lead by example           At our best  Americans have always lived in a creative tension between idealism and realism  between our clear eyed insistence on seeing the world as it actually is and our deeply held desire to remake the world as it ought to be          This Administration has abandoned that tension for a simplistic division of the world into good and evil  They ve refused to talk to anyone on the  evil  side  And some have called that idealistic  I call it dangerously unrealistic          At the end of the day  you have to question whether this administration has led with our values or used our values as a cloak to justify its ideology and unilateralism  Something is wrong when our pursuit of idealistic goals has turned a good portion of the world against us          Earlier this year a progressive and a conservative  Anatol Lieven and John Hulsman  wrote a book together and called it Ethical Realism  You don t have to accept all of their policy proposals to learn something from the common ground they found  They remind us of a time when America s leading Protestant theologian  Reinhold Niebuhr  cautioned us against believing that God was on our side  of a time when President Dwight David Eisenhower rejected rhetoric about a preemptive attack on the Soviet Union by asking  among other things  the practical question of how we would occupy the vast country if we won  Of a time when the editor of Foreign Affairs invited a little known diplomat named George Kennan to publish an article    an anonymous article that established the bipartisan foundation of our Cold War foreign policy           In every era we wrestle with how to reconcile the pragmatic with the moral elements of our strength  and what we choose to do with both  We got it right  mostly  during the Cold War when realists and idealists together built institutions and policies serving our interests and our values  We got it drastically wrong when a small group of ideologues decided we didn t need those institutions  or alliances  or diplomacy or even the respect of other nations          These principles would force a sea change from the current Administration s policies  If you look at the dangerous situations we are facing today in Iraq  Afghanistan  Iran  North Korea  the proliferation of deadly weapons  the prosecution of the war on terror    you will see the same mistakes repeated over and over  The mistaken belief that alliances  international institutions  all of that is irrelevant to American interests  The mistaken belief that diplomacy even if backed by force is synonymous with weakness  The mistaken belief that our military s experience in war planning  our intelligence community s objective analysis  and our diplomats  experience in negotiations could be dismissed and replaced with ideological wishful thinking  And  in Iraq  the mistake of waging a pre emptive war based on faulty intelligence  fanciful scenarios and bluster has turned out to be a one time only doctrine with no deterrent effect          We need to return to patient diplomacy  backed by military strength and informed by American values          Let me start with Iraq because in human terms this has been a horrible month  we mourn the loss of American servicemembers and many hundreds more Iraqis  In political terms  we have finally reached a point of complete absurdity  The Administration announces it will propose timetables or benchmarks and the Iraqi Prime Minister denounces them  President Bush says we are adjusting tactics but Secretary Rumsfeld insists we are staying the course  The Administration tells Iran and Syria they re responsible for helping keep the peace but won t talk with them about how to do it  We continue to deny evident reality  proceeding with few or no allies and precious little direct communication with people who matter  No wonder the American people think that we are adrift          We need a fundamental change in course and I believe there are three basic parts to that  First  we need to press consistently  privately and publicly the Iraqis to become serious about achieving an internal reconciliation and political solution  and present real consequences for their failing to do so           Only the Iraqi government can take action to create the conditions for a political settlement  Instead  the government in recent days seems to be going out of its way to rebuff our efforts to move in that direction  American credibility is held hostage by an Iraqi government that will not fulfill its pledge to seek a political resolution of the rights and role of the Sunni minority and to determine how oil revenue is allocated  For several years  actually since the summer of 2003  I have pushed the idea that we should establish in Iraq an oil trust guaranteeing that every individual Iraqi would share part of the country s oil wealth every year           Instead  the oil distribution remains unsettled  Sunnis have no incentive to stop fighting  Kurds have no incentive to operate within Iraq and Shiites have no incentive to stop participating in militias and internecine conflict  Guaranteeing every Iraqi a share of the oil revenues at the individual level is one way to try to begin to move beyond the impasse    and to give Iraqis some reason to believe number one  we aren t there for oil  we aren t there to support big oil  we aren t there to line the pockets of the new Iraqi elite and fatten their Swiss bank accounts  and to give the Iraqis also some reason to feel positive about their national government           Second  we do need what many of us have been calling for now for months even years at some point    a public international conference of the parties in the region    the Turks  the Saudis  the Egyptians  the Emirates  the Jordanians but also the Syrians and Iranians  We need to put everybody on the record to whether they will make public commitments to respect Iraq s sovereignty and to further the task of Iraq s stability  Instead of fearing to negotiate  we should fear what happens if we never attempt to negotiate a regional commitment to a stable  unified Iraq  And also  Iraq s neighbors should fear that as well  They would bear the brunt of an all out civil war  including millions of fleeing refugees and new bases for regional terrorist operations          And thirdly  we do need to begin  I had hoped by the end of this year  a phased redeployment  I joined Senators Levin and Reed  and the Democratic leadership in the Senate and House  in proposing a phased redeployment of U S  troops from Iraq during this year  2006  That would include a change in the mission of US forces to one of training and supporting Iraqi troops and targeting counter terrorism as well as protection American operations and personnel and facilities  You know  Richard Holbrooke in his recent article was right  we really have three choices  We muddle along not necessarily going forward but  as my Chairman on the Armed Services Committee  John Warner  has said  moving sideways  We begin some kind of sensible  prudent de escalation  or we escalate  And we can t do any of those in the absence of the full hearted attempt on the political reconciliation front  the oil allocation front  and the regional parties being involved           But however we proceed  it is time to insist that the Iraqis to take the lead and demonstrate to the Iraqi people that the U S  will not be in Iraq permanently and that American troops will not be put in the crossfire of a civil war  Phased redeployment will get the attention of the Iraqi leadership  In my meetings with members of that leadership there has been a mixed message at best  We are a sovereign nation  they tell me  we make decisions now  and by the way we re not ready for you to leave  It is time for us to force the Iraqi government to face up to that contradiction and to begin to do more to resolve their own political situation and make it clear that American forces will not be there to prop up their denials and refusal to deal with the problems at hand           Now  we talk a great deal about Iraq and not enough about Afghanistan  where our failures have squandered much of what our military accomplished and limited the reach and positive impact of President Karzai s moderate  democratic government  Three years ago  when I was here  I told the Council about meeting a soldier in Afghanistan who greeted me with these words   Welcome to the forgotten front line in the war on terror   Well today  we have senior NATO military officials predicting that the country could fall back to the Taliban in six months  Use of suicide bombings and other terror tactics is on the rise  Afghanistan is now responsible for 87 percent of the world s opium production  And a quote making the rounds in Kabul sums the situation up nicely  a Taliban commander supposedly boasted to his captors that  you have watches  but we have time           To prove him wrong  we need to give our Afghan allies time  yet all we seem to do is check our own watches  Convinced first that we had all the answers  and then that we could sub contract out counterinsurgency to our allies  we seem to have gone on auto pilot  Inattention and false optimism are not only endangering all that we accomplished there  they are costing lives          It is a great and brave thing that our allies from Canada  Britain  the Netherlands and other NATO countries have done by sending troops to Afghanistan  But Afghanistan and NATO need us as a leading partner  to help with security  to root out corruption  to find alternatives to opium  to improve the situation with Pakistan  We know the general area where the leaders of the Taliban and probably the leaders of Al Qaeda are  It is a failure of our policies on all fronts that five years later they are sending waves of fighters into Afghanistan from their safe havens  The stakes are unbearably high  for Afghanistan  for Pakistan  for the country s northern neighbors in Central Asia  for the reach of Al Qaeda  and for our own credibility and leadership          We should begin by responding to our NATO commander s call for more troops in Afghanistan  where on a per capita basis we have spent 25 times less than we spent in Bosnia  and deployed one fiftieth as many troops          In Iran as well  this Administration outsourced its policy to the British  the French and the Germans  Meanwhile  the Iranian so called moderates we ignored were pushed out of power and the extremists went merrily forward  now we are left hoping that those same moderates we wouldn t talk to can regain control  Hope is not a policy          U S  policy must be unequivocal  Iran must not build or acquire nuclear weapons  Iran s President has made a series of incendiary  outrageous comments  questioning the Holocaust  calling for Israel to be wiped off the map  We know that a nuclear Iran poses a direct threat to its neighbors in the region  with Israel as its chief target  It also poses a significant threat to the United States by combining access to nuclear materials and technology with support for terrorists whose aim is to attack and kill Americans          We have to keep all options on the table  including being ready to talk directly to Iranians should the right opportunity present itself  Direct talks  if they do nothing else  lets you assess who s making the decisions    what their stated and unstated goals might be  And willingness to talk sends two very important messages  First  to the Iranian people  that our quarrel is with their leaders  not with them  and second  to the international community  that we are pursuing every available peaceful avenue to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power          We also need to be willing to use the tools available to us in working with the Israelis and the Palestinians  In part because the Administration chose to disengage at crucial moments  we are now at a very discouraging place  There is no reliable partner on the Palestinian side  and still no willingness to take a clear stand of acceptance toward Israel  In the aftermath of the Palestinian elections that gave rise to Hamas  we need to continue to insist that any Palestinian government recognize Israel s right to exist and cease terrorism  However  there are reports from the region of discussions between the Israeli government and President Abbas    and of the possible dissolution of the Hamas government by President Abbas  As events unfold  we need to be prepared  in close coordination with our Israeli ally  to resume America s indispensable role in finding a just and lasting resolution           In North Korea  we got potentially good news this morning  This Administration has adopted a narrow and  you know  sort of  self reinforcing worldview that doesn t look at the facts  and that rules out some of our best tools for defusing threats before they threaten us          We had six years of a policy with no carrots  no sticks  and only bad results  And we basically left negotiations to the Chinese and left Kim Jong Il home alone with no inspectors watching his plutonium           Now we have fewer options and a much more difficult task  We have UN sanctions  Though they are not as tough as I would want  we need to enforce them  We have the Six Party talks    and apparently based on what we heard this morning after intensive discussions that included direct talks between Ambassador Chris Hill and the North Koreans  we are going to revive the six party process  We cannot take anything off the table  we ve had troops in South Korea for fifty years for a reason          But I have thought for a long time we made a mistake not talking directly to North Korea  North Korea s neighbors have long supported direct U S    North Korea talks on security matters  In the past  such engagements have prevented the development of plutonium bombs and the testing of long range missiles  Kim Jong Il needs to hear a single  unified message  choose between nuclear weapons and aid from South Korea  China  and the international community  You cannot have both  Right now  we seem to be relying too much for my taste on China s good will to restrain North Korea  But at the end of the day  Pyongyang will have to hear this message directly from us          The common strand that draws these crises together is the threat that sophisticated terrorists operating out of Afghanistan or Iraq  or somewhere else  will be able to acquire nuclear weapons or materials  For 40 years the US provided bipartisan leadership in building a network of treaties and expectations that kept global nuclear ambitions in check  Countries like Brazil  Argentina  and South Africa  and Kazakhstan  Ukraine and Belarus elected not to develop nuclear weapons or even gave up weapons they had giving terrorists fewer opportunities as a result          Today we face intense extremist efforts to buy or steal either a bomb or the material to make one and it doesn t have to be very big  We are also seeing increased interest in peaceful uses of nuclear power on the part of many legitimate states  In response  we need to modernize the non proliferation treaties and related agreements  Last year  we had the chance to start talking about what a stronger regime would look like at the Non Proliferation Treaty review conference  But while other countries sent foreign ministers or senior ambassadors  the Administration sent a mid level official    a clear signal it just wasn t interested  Our influence has already been eroded by our abandonment of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the administration s interest in developing two new small nuclear weapons  including the robust nuclear earth penetrator  the so called bunker buster  The wholesale abandonment of non proliferation efforts is a dangerous mistake  The more countries that have fissile material  the more opportunities there are for terrorists to acquire it           American experts  some of them working here at the Council  have made innovative proposals for a 21st century NPT  When the Senate resumes  I ll be asking my colleagues who chair the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees to hold joint hearings on the future of our non proliferation policy with the aim of creating a new blueprint for our shared security          And we have to increase our efforts on preventing terrorist groups from obtaining nuclear weapons or materials  You know  Sam Nunn and Ted Turner  through the Nuclear Threat Initiative  have said over and over again that we aren t doing enough to get every last bit of weapons usable material under safeguard  I will be introducing a bill based on their ideas  which would create a senior White House advisor for countering nuclear terrorism  require a yearly report that would specify every site with nuclear material or weapons  And we would do what we have to do  working in concert with other nations  to try to make that material as safe as it can be           Here in New York  nobody needs to tell us that we are in a war against terrorists who seek to do us harm  Strategically  it is also true that the world is watching us  we are unlikely to make headway facing the challenges that I ve discussed    or many others    if we are seen as losing ground to the terrorists           On September 12  2001  when the Bush Administration could count on the goodwill of the entire world  they had strong support from both parties  and the determination of the American people to sacrifice for a common cause  That call to sacrifice never came           Five years later  the Administration has failed to transform our national security institutions  The people who promised less government have instead given us the largest and least competent government we have ever had  As a result  our front line fighters in the war against terrorists often lack the tools they need          The Administration has ordered our military to fulfill missions for which it is not sized  equipped or funded  I have joined other Democrats and Republicans in proposing that we expand the Army by 80 000 troops  that we move faster to expand the Special Forces  and do a better job of training and equipping the National Guard and Reserves          The Administration has failed embarrassingly when it comes to homeland security  Last week  the Council s own Stephen Flynn awarded them three Ds or Fs and four Cs out of nine grades on homeland security  That s not good enough          The Administration has failed to create a culture of prevention within the FBI  Last December  the 9 11 Commission gave Administration efforts at the FBI a  C  and said   Unless there is improvement within a reasonable period of time  Congress will have to look at alternatives   The FBI still has only 33 Arabic speaking agents  and none is assigned to counter terrorism  The agency s top counter terrorism job has turned over six times in five years           And we have yet to see the completion of reform in the intelligence community and the restoration of morale  The 9 11 Commission reform package envisioned a Director of National Intelligence who actually directed the intelligence community  We don t have that  We are still living in a  need to know  culture instead of a  need to share  one  The Administration s supposed new standards on interrogation and torture have left our CIA personnel and even our military unsure of what is legal to do  what they are authorized to do  what their country wants them to do           Now during the Cuban missile crisis  President Kennedy had at his side Llewellyn Thompson  former Ambassador to Moscow who understood the Soviets and even lived with Soviet Premier Khrushchev  We don t have that expertise any longer inside our government when it comes to the threat we face from Islamic extremism  We need to look beyond our intelligence community  as we did during the Cold War  we challenged a generation of universities and students to serve their country    we should do the same today  Learn the languages that we need  understand the cultures of the societies where our biggest threats are incubating           Our military commanders make a point of telling us we cannot win the war against terrorism through military means alone  As the new Army and Marine manual on counter insurgency puts it   the best weapons for counter insurgency do not shoot           Pete said when he introduced me that I worked as a member of the U S  Joint Forces Command Transformation Advisory Group  One of the common themes of our work there is that we don t have enough civilian capacity to manage pre  and post  crisis situations           The world has changed  but our civilian institutions and preparation for public service has not kept up  I recently introduced legislation along with Senator Specter to create a public service academy    a West Point for public service   that would send a message about the importance of civilian preparedness and response  at home and abroad  It could become a place where we teach critical languages and put a high priority on learning about the cultures we so poorly understand today           You know finally it comes down to whether we can win the war on terror  not just the battles  and that requires we face squarely our longer term challenge of putting the US on the side of dignity and progress and making it clear we do oppose tyranny and violations of human rights           And in that fight  our only realistic weapons are our values and ideals           We need to start by addressing the troubled conditions terrorists seek out          I have focused on support for global education because I believe it provides an alternative in places where the only schools are also incubators of religiously fueled extremism  And it returns immediate health and social gains and reinforces our basic value of equality  I introduced legislation for our country to take the lead in Education for All to aim at giving every child in the world access at least to primary education by 2015           We ve done a good job talking about democracy but we sure haven t done a comparable good job in promoting the long term efforts that actually build institutions after the elections are over and the international monitors have gone home  We have to give citizens more tools and we should be talking more about the successes of this administration    you know  the relief efforts after the tsunami and the earthquake in Pakistan  the global AIDS program  the Millennium Challenge grants  They re seldom emphasized and they often seem to run counter to the basic ideological arguments the administration is making           This month  I was one of 34 members of the United States Senate to vote against President Bush s military commissions act  On the floor of the Senate  I recounted a choice General George Washington made 230 years ago  New York City and Long Island had been captured  and Washington and the Continental Army had retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania  suffering tremendous casualties  Here in New York  American prisoners often held in the hulls of boats  anchored in the harbor off of Brooklyn  were suffering unspeakably at the hands of the British  The cause of American independence was in doubt  Then Washington won the Battle of Trenton  capturing nearly 1000 prisoners of war  and he had to decide what to do with them          The order he gave should still speak to us  Treat them with humanity  and Let them have no reason to Complain of our Copying the brutal example of the British army in their Treatment of our unfortunate brethren           America was born out of faith in certain basic principles  and out of an understanding that it matters deeply    in fact  it matters for our survival    that we hew to those principles at home and in the eyes of the world          There could be no mercy for those who perpetrated 9 11 and other crimes against humanity  But we have to pursue justice in a way that lifts up our values  the rule of law  and sets an example that we could point to with pride  not shame          That is an utterly realistic brand of idealism that has been with us since our beginnings          The Administration s experiment has failed  we cannot go backwards  we must go forward building that new consensus and risking a new bipartisanship  I cannot speak  of course  for the Administration  but I know my Democratic colleagues are ready to do so           Thank you         Related content    Senator Clinton Calls for New American Consensus to Meet Foreign Policy Challenges   Statements and remarks by Senator Clinton
