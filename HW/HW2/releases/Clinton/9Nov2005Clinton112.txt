November 9  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Oil Company CEOs Testimony Before a Joint Session of the Energy and Commerce Committees                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   Washington  DC  Two weeks ago  I challenged our nation  s oil industry to become part of our energy solution    Flush with cash from record profits  oil companies need to reinvest in our energy future              I am disappointed that the oil CEOs did not come to the table today armed with ideas to help consumers and move our nation forward   We need to stop playing defense and start playing offense   We need to develop an energy strategy that protects consumers  prohibits profiteering and promotes energy alternatives   The American people are tired of rhetoric  they want action           I have proposed a plan that asks energy companies to invest a portion of their enormous profits in increased refining capacity and renewable  clean energy   Those companies that choose not to would pay a temporary fee out of their profits to capitalize a Strategic Energy Fund that would help consumers cope with spiraling energy costs  promote adoption of existing clean energy and conservation technologies and stimulate research             Americans also deserve to know that the prices they pay for gas and oil are fair   It is time to take some of the mystery out of gas pricing  Oil companies should tell us what the mark up on gasoline is and who is getting it  By adding more information to the marketplace  we can make it more competitive
