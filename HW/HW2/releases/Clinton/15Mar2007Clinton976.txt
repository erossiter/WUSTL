March 15  2007 Excerpt of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Bloomberg News Regarding the Comments Made By General Peter Pace                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Well I ve heard from a number of my friends and I ve certainly clarified with them any misunderstanding that anyone had  because I disagree with General Pace completely  I do not think homosexuality is immoral  But the point I was trying to make is that this policy of Don t Ask  Don t Tell is not working  I have been against it for many years because I think it does a grave injustice to patriotic Americans who want to serve their country  And so I have called for its repeal and I d like to follow the lead of our allies like  Great Britain and Israel and let people who wish to serve their country be able to join and do so  And then let the uniform code of military justice determine if conduct is inappropriate or unbecoming  That s fine  That s what we do with everybody  But let s not be eliminating people because of who they are or who they love
