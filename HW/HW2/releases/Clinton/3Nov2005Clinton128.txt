November 3  2005 Senate Approved Clinton Amendment to Provide Medicaid Funding For HIV Treatment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    The Senate today approved a measure introduced by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Senator Gordon Smith  OR  to correct a fundamental flaw in Medicaid eligibility requirements that prevents low income people with HIV from qualifying for Medicaid coverage   Senator Clinton  s measure  offered as an amendment to the Budget Reconciliation bill  would establish a demonstration program that would provide federal funding to expand Medicaid eligibility to people living with HIV  allowing them to access critical medical services before they develop symptoms              It is unconscionable that New Yorkers with HIV are missing the chance for early treatment that would help them live longer and reduce the need for more expensive care and costly hospital stays   That  s why I am working in the Senate to make sure New York gets the funding necessary to provide treatment to those who need it     said Senator Clinton          Currently  Medicaid provides access to care only after HIV positive individuals have been disabled by AIDS  ultimately raising healthcare costs and preventing early treatment that would delay the onset of AIDS   New York and many other states struggle to provide treatment to low income people with HIV   States have been unable to provide adequate medical services to all who need them  leading to the need for more expensive care and further squeezing already limited treatment resources   The additional federal funding provided by Senator Clinton  s amendment will allow states to provide needed medical services to more people living with HIV         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  estimates that there are more than one million people living with HIV in the United States  about 100 000 in New York alone   Pricewaterhouse Coopers has estimated that expanding early treatment to Medicaid recipients nationwide would save approximately  1 5 billion in healthcare costs over 10 years        Senator Clinton has long been a champion of ensuring adequate prevention and treatment of HIV AIDS  domestically and globally   Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined Senator Gordon Smith in introducing the Early Treatment for HIV Act to extend Medicaid eligibility to HIV positive low income individuals   It would also give states the option of providing a full spectrum of preventive health care and treatment to low income individuals as soon as they are diagnosed with HIV  before they develop symptoms
