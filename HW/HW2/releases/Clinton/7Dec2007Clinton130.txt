December 7  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton on the Energy Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  Today  I was proud to cast my vote for an energy bill that would start America on a path to greater energy independence  reduce energy costs for American consumers  reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and create new clean energy jobs   The bill would raise fuel auto fuel economy standards for the first time in over 30 years  to 35 miles per gallon by 2020   It would require utilities to generate 15 percent of our electricity from wind  solar and other renewable sources by 2020   It would raise the production of biofuels to 36 billion gallons by 2022   And it would begin to fix our broken energy tax system by repealing tax breaks for big oil companies and putting those funds towards clean energy   Unfortunately  President Bush threatened to veto the bill and Senate Republicans fell in line and voted the bill down   With heating prices and gasoline prices skyrocketing  it s time for President Bush and Senate Republicans to stand with consumers instead of defending the record profits of oil companies
