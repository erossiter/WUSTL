January 22  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton Marking the 34th Anniversary of Roe v  Wade                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC     As we mark the 34th anniversary of Roe v  Wade  we are at a critical moment for women s health  Women s right to make choices about their reproductive health has been systematically challenged and family planning and contraception are under attack  All women must be able to make their own choices about their reproductive health  At the same time  we must work for the day when abortions are truly rare   That means preventing unwanted pregnancies and doing everything we can to ensure that all women have access to family planning  contraception and the medically accurate information they need and deserve              I was proud to help launch the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy  which has helped reduce teen pregnancy by one third  Together with Senator Patty Murray  I pressed the FDA for a long overdue decision on Plan B  making emergency contraception available over the counter for millions of women    a real victory for women s health  I have also introduced the Prevention First Act  which increases funding for family planning services  ensures that health plans that cover prescription drugs cover contraceptives  improves education about emergency contraception  ensures that hospital emergency rooms offer emergency contraception to victims of sexual assault and strengthens Medicaid coverage of family planning services so family planning and contraception are accessible and affordable for low income women  These are common sense policies on which we can find common ground  By taking these steps  we can realize the goal of making abortion safe  legal and rare
