September 2  2005 Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Upstate New York Today on the Situation in New Orleans and the Gulf States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Syracuse  NY     This is a national crisis and a national tragedy  So many people    we don  t even know what the final death toll will be    have been lost to first the storm and then the flooding  lost to problems we  ve encountered evacuating people  even evacuating huge hospitals  even Charity Hospital in New Orleans   The full extent of the loss of human life is not yet known   Certainly we have seen enough to realize that this is one of the most horrific tragedies that we have seen on our shores as a nation   We are seeing children  elderly people without water  without food  without economic means of any sort   They are the most vulnerable and they are being left behind            As the President said this morning  this is unacceptable  and I could not agree more   This is absolutely unacceptable  This is something that we must move on more quickly and more effectively  to immediately respond and limit the damage and the loss of life that is still going on as we meet and enjoy this beautiful day at the state fair   There will be time enough to figure out what we could have or should have done to try and avoid some of what has happened   But right now  we have got to focus on doing everything possible to get aid to the people who are suffering           I appreciate the great outpouring of support that has come from every corner of New York    I remember it very well    after we were attacked on 9 11  the entire country rallied behind us    Nobody in a position of responsibility said    Lets not rebuild Lower Manhattan      Everybody said    Let  s get to work  roll up our sleeves  and do what it takes to help New York recover      We have to and I  m sure we will have the same approach with New Orleans  all of Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama  and those places that were also affected in Georgia and Florida   So I join Bill in urging that everyone do what you can            I am particularly impressed and grateful  and I want to mention them today because they are both here   Abe Lackman from the Independent College Association and our wonderful chancellor here from SU  Nancy Cantor is here   And Abe  on behalf of the Association and Nancy on behalf of SU  have sent out the word that New York universities and colleges  will take in  free of tuition  free of costs  people who have been flooded out of their dormitories  classrooms   This is a wonderful example of how New York colleges and universities are responding   In fact  Nancy  I have a young man who is an intern for me who is a student at the law school  His brother has lost his chance to go to college this year and he is going to drive down and find his brother and bring him up and he is going to be one of your students at Syracuse     We are going to be sending whatever help we can   We will be looking for ways we can be creative   As Bill said  this is going to be with us for quite some time   I hope we can follow the lead that many of our charitable organizations like the Red Cross and the Catholic Charities  Salvation Army are doing for us   There will be a lot of work for months and months ahead
