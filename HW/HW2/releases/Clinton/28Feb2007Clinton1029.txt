February 28  2007 Senator Clinton Leads Bipartisan Effort to Fund Family Caregiver Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton led a bipartisan coalition of Senators in calling for funding of the Lifespan Respite Care Act   The legislation  introduced by Senator Clinton and signed into law last year  authorized almost  300 million over five years for competitive grants at the state and local levels to increase the availability of respite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs regardless of age   However  the funding has not been appropriated   In a letter to the Senate Budget Committee Chairman and Ranking Member  Senator Clinton and Senator Warner joined with 22 Senators on both sides of the aisle in emphasizing the need for full funding for this critical legislation           Millions of Americans struggle everyday to provide care for a family member with a chronic illness or disability so they may remain at home and out of more expensive institutional care   Funding the Lifespan Respite Care Act will not only provide relief to these caregivers and their families  it will provide significant savings to the healthcare system and taxpayers   said Senator Clinton        The full text of the letter sent to Senators Conrad and Gregg follows       The Honorable Kent Conrad  Senate Budget Committee                624 Dirksen Senate Office Building                                            Washington  DC  20510      The Honorable Judd Gregg  Senate Budget Committee  624 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510      Dear Chairman Conrad   Ranking Member Gregg       On behalf of the more than 50 million family caregivers in our nation  we ask you to include the full authorization amount of  30 million in FY 2008   40 million for FY 2009   53 3 million for FY 2010   71 1 million for FY 2011  and  94 8 million for FY 2012 in budget authority for the Lifespan Respite Care Act in the Fiscal Year 2008 budget resolution          Chronic illnesses are the fastest growing illnesses in our country today  and older adults are the fastest growing population  Consequently  long term care is increasingly important for our nation s health and constitutes a significant portion of Medicaid and Medicare spending  In 2004  approximately  160 billion was spent on formal long term care services  42 percent paid for by Medicaid and 20 percent paid by Medicare  This is compared to the  137 billion spent on formal long term care in 2000           However  a substantial amount of our nation s long term care is voluntarily provided by family caregivers and is often unpaid  Family caregiving accounts for 80 percent of the long term care provided in the U S  at a value of more than  300 billion annually  Respite care services provide temporary relief for caregivers and decrease the likelihood of formal long term care  thereby resulting in significant savings for the healthcare system and taxpayers          In addition  respite care has positive impacts on caregivers  professional lives and the U S  economy  The majority of caregivers have outside employment in addition to their caregiving responsibilities at home  Research tells us that  because of the lack of support services  most caregivers either miss work or quit their jobs in order to meet the health needs of their family members  The consequent decrease in productivity results in a total estimated cost to U S  employers of  34 billion per year           Last December  Congress and the Administration sent a clear message of support to family caregivers with enactment of the Lifespan Respite Care Act  Through competitive grants  the Lifespan Respite Care Act will expand access to respite care  improve local coordination of services  and help families obtain information on respite provider options and payment plans          Enactment of this legislation is the culmination of many years of bipartisan effort and will have a significant impact on our nation s caregivers  We appreciate your commitment to family caregivers and ask that you continue to support them by including the full authorized amount in the FY 2008 budget resolution          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY
