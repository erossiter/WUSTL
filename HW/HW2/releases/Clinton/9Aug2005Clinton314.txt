             Jamestown  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today highlighted passage of several bills she championed that will provide billions in funding for clean diesel technologies during a visit to Cummins Inc   s Jamestown Engine Plant   Senator Clinton Cummins   to celebrate the production of the plant  s 750 000th engine and to discuss her recently launched Senate Manufacturing Caucus          I am proud to have worked to pass strong  bipartisan legislation to fund clean diesel technologies     said Senator Clinton     The legislation provides access to billions of dollars to retrofit  repower and replace diesel engines   It will reduce pollution and create manufacturing jobs at clean diesel technology leaders like Cummins             We are delighted that Senator Clinton could be here today to help us celebrate the success of the Jamestown Engine Plant     said Joe Loughrey  Cummins President and Chief Operating Officer    She has been a key supporter of our efforts to grow our business while maintaining our commitment to the environment             Senator Clinton highlighted passage of three recent clean diesel bills during her visit                  An amendment to the transportation bill sponsored by Senator Clinton and Senator James Inhofe  R OK  which enables states and local governments to tap into an  8 6 billion clean air program to fund technologies to reduce pollution from construction equipment used on federal highway projects in areas with poor air quality   The transportation bill will be signed into law tomorrow                  A transportation bill amendment co sponsored by Senator Clinton that authorizes  110 million to expand the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  s   Clean School Bus U S A     program   With help from Congressmen Walsh and Houghton  Senator Clinton has successfully pushed to increase funding for this pilot program  by which EPA makes grants to school districts to help pay to retrofit old buses or purchase new ones to reduce pollution  This program was funded at  10 million for FY 2006   7 5 million for FY 2005  and  5 million for FY 2003 and FY 2004                  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005  which was signed into law yesterday as part of the energy bill   Senator Clinton cosponsored this legislation offered by Senator Voinovich  R OH  to authorize a five year   1 billion program to enable EPA  states  and localities to fund diesel pollution reduction technologies for trucks  trains  vessels and other diesel powered equipment            Senator Clinton also discussed the recent launch of the bipartisan Senate Manufacturing Caucus to spearhead Congressional efforts to address the root causes of the problems facing American manufacturing and opportunities for Congressional action to create and keep manufacturing jobs  Senator Clinton serves a co chair of the caucus  which will bring together business and labor leaders  economists  and other stakeholders  commission academic studies and other inquiries and champion legislation to address challenges facing our country s manufacturing sector            The goal of the caucus is not only to focus on the challenges facing the manufacturing sector  but also to identify what many manufacturers are doing right  Cummins is an example of just how much can go right when a company makes wise investments in R   D and continues to innovate with the commitment to remaining the best in the field     said Senator Clinton        At Cummins  Senator Clinton had an opportunity to highlight the benefits of clean diesel technology   The next generation of diesel engines  such as model year 2007 engines Cummins will make at the Jamestown plant  will reduce pollution by 95 percent   In addition  adding pollution control technologies to the existing diesel fleet can reduce emissions by more than 90 percent            According to the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   studies have shown a significant association between exposure to fine particle pollution and premature death  Other health impacts of exposure to fine particulates include aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease  decreased lung function  asthma attacks  and certain cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and irregular heart beat   Children  the elderly  and people with heart and lung disease are particularly vulnerable to these health effects   The U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  estimates that the health benefits of reducing these emissions outweigh the cost of the pollution control technologies by a ratio of up to 13 1
