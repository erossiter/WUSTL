February 2  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on President to Fund Early Childhood Programs in FY 08 Budget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Programs Such as Head Start  Child Care and Development Block Grants  CCDBG   and Even Start Programs May Once Again Face Funding Cuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    In a letter sent today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on President Bush to include funding for early childhood programs such as Head Start  Child Care and Development Block Grants  CCDBG   and Even Start Programs in his budget proposal for fiscal year 2008  These programs have suffered funding cuts in past years  which has left thousands of children and families behind educationally and economically            There is nothing more important to our nation  s future than our children  There should be no question when it comes to investing in these programs because it means investing in our children  Our children will be short changed if funding for these vital childhood programs is not included in the President  s proposed FY 08 budget     said Senator Clinton          Since their inception  these three programs have enabled millions of America  s most vulnerable children to be better prepared to learn and succeed in the classroom  Despite stagnant or decreased federal funding these programs continue to face increasing operational costs  At the same time  low income families are depending more and more on the comprehensive services provided through these programs  In New York State alone  Head Start funding was cut by over  3 3 million between FY 2005 and FY 2006  Funding for the Even Start Program in New York State went from being funded  22 6 million for FY 2003 to being cut out completely from the President  s FY 2007 budget request           Senator Clinton has worked tirelessly to ensure that all children are provided with the necessary tools and support they need to succeed in school  When President Bush  s budget called for the elimination of the Even Start program for fiscal year 2007  Senator Clinton sponsored an amendment to restore  225 million in funding to the program  Senator Clinton also cosponsored an amendment to increase funding for the CCDBG program by  540 million and the Head Start program by  520 million last year            The CCDBG program provides funding for child care and early learning programs  It also offers assistance to states and low income working families to improve the quality of these services  Head Start integrates education  health  nutrition  social and family engagement needs into one standard based comprehensive program  The Even Start program aims to break the cycles of poverty and illiteracy by targeting low income families and children who are most behind in reading proficiency          The full text of the letter sent to the President follows       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC 20500      Dear Mr  President        Investing in early childhood programs and services is the most effective way to ensure that our children enter kindergarten prepared to learn  Despite this important fact  early childhood programs have endured funding cuts in recent years  I write to urge you to include funding for the Head Start  Child Care   Development Block Grant  CCDBG   and Even Start programs in the fiscal year 2008 budget proposal you will soon summit to Congress          The Head Start and CCDBG programs have prepared millions of America  s most vulnerable children for success in kindergarten and later in life  Head Start has served over 20 million children nationwide  integrating the education  health  nutrition  social  and family engagement needs of its children into a standards based  comprehensive program  The CCDBG program  which provides funding for child care and early learning programs  offers assistance to low income working families and states to improve the quality of these services           However  funding for Head Start and CCDBG have remained stagnant and have fallen behind the rising costs these programs face  Low income families depend more and more on the comprehensive services that they provide  We need to invest in our children  not short change them          Early childhood programs make the greatest impact in reducing the achievement gap  Research has proven that children enrolled in Head Start and CCDBG programs are better prepared for school than their peers who do not receive the benefit of these comprehensive  standards based programs           Additionally  the Even Start program targets families who are most economically behind    84 percent of participating families are at or below Federal poverty levels  with nearly half of the families earning an annual income of under  6 000  I truly believe that the goals of No Child Left Behind can not be achieved if we leave our parents behind           The Even Start program helps to break the cycles of poverty and illiteracy by building the reading proficiency of both parents and their children  Funding for this program would provide grants to states to integrate early childhood education  adult literacy  and parenting education into one family literacy program    offering participating parents the opportunity to acquire skills to be their child  s first and most important teacher          Eliminating or reducing funding for this program would also leave thousands of families behind economically  A recent Texas A study found that parents participating in Even Start were more often and better employed as a result of the program    citing employment rates up 34 percent and wages up more than 25 percent among parents who completed this program           There is nothing more important to our nation  s future than our children  Despite this fact  New York continues to suffer a decrease in funding for these critical programs  I urge you to increase funding for Head Start  CCDBG  and Even Start to ensure that our children do not arrive at school already behind their more affluent peers  I thank you for your serious consideration of this request          Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton
