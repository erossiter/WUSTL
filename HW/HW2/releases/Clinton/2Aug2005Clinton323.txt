August 2  2005 Senators Schumer and Clinton Call on Bush Administration to Defend Glassware Producers in Upcoming Trade Negotiations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senators Urge United States Trade Representative to Maintain Sensitive Sector Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton are urging United States Trade Representative Robert Portman to stand up for American glassware producers in upcoming trade negotiations and maintain the current tariff structure that has allowed the United States to preserve our glassware production capability   Syracuse is a leading center of glassware production  with more than 400 workers employed in the industry            It is critical that we do everything we can to make sure that Syracuse can continue to be a leader in glassware production     said Senator Clinton     Ending import sensitive sector status would pull the rug out from under our glassware industry               Syracuse has been a leader in glassware manufacturing for decades     Senator Schumer said    We must fight to protect our local industries from unfair trading practices  The bottom line is we cannot afford to lose any more jobs             In a letter to Ambassador Portman  the Senators underscored that foreign penetration of the American glassware market continues to rise  growing by nearly eight percent per year   Unless the industry  s import sensitive sector designation is maintained  trade agreements under negotiation could undermine the American glassware industry by reducing tariffs on glassware imports            Despite continuing efforts to remain competitive  backed up by enormous and continuing investments in plant and equipment  new technology and training  foreign producers have continued to erode U S  manufacturers   market position     the Senators wrote in their letter     We believe that the glassware sector must continue to receive this designation and receive special and differential treatment in upcoming trade negotiations               Foreign producing interests in the glassware sector have shown  through their increasing penetration of market  their ability to compete   Maintaining the glassware industry  s import sensitive designation in current trade provisions is vital     the Senators added          Text of the letter appears below          The Honorable Robert J  Portman  United States Trade Representative  600 17th Street  N W   Washington  D C   20508        Dear Ambassador Portman          We are writing to you to highlight some of the challenges facing the U S  glassware production industry and its workers regarding our nation  s trade agenda   Each of us comes from a state that has significant glassware production facilities          Glassware is an important U S  industry   It was America  s first industry    its roots can be traced back to the settlement at Jamestown   In the last 30 years glass tableware manufacturing operations and employment have declined significantly   Factories continue to shut down            Foreign penetration of our market continues to rise   Between 1996 and last year  China  s share of our market in one important category  rose from 9 percent to 38 percent    a more than 400 percent increase   Turkey  s import share rose by 500 percent during this same period  skyrocketing from an import share of 3 percent to 15 percent   Overall  foreign import penetration of our market has risen at an annual compound growth rate of almost 8 percent per year          Glassware has traditionally been treated as an import sensitive sector and the above figures continue to support this view   Despite continuing efforts to remain competitive  backed up by enormous and continuing investments in plant and equipment  new technology and training  foreign producers have continued to erode U S  manufacturers   market position   We believe that the glassware sector must continue to receive this designation and receive special and differential treatment in upcoming trade negotiations          There are a number of negotiations currently underway which could have an enormous and devastating impact on the glassware industry and its workers in our states               The United States is engaged in free trade agreement negotiations with the United Arab Emirates   A French company located a glassware manufacturing facility in the UAE which benefits from natural gas supplies that cost roughly one twelfth the amount of the U S  price   Also  labor costs    from mostly non UAE workers    are a fraction of the cost of labor here in the United States   Lowering U S  tariffs  when foreign interests have already shown their ability to compete in our market  is unwise and unwarranted               In the Doha Round  negotiators are seeking to replace the   request for offer    approach to non agricultural market access with a formula approach   This approach could have a devastating impact on the glassware sector through dramatic cuts in U S  tariffs for an already import sensitive sector   Our negotiators should seek to maintain the current tariff structure as it relates to the glassware sector   Our high and rising trade deficit demands that other nation  s desires for additional market access be carefully tempered against the state of our industry   The Doha Round must not be a vehicle for undermining the interests of this important sector of our economy               Also in the Doha Round  U S  negotiators have shown their willingness to discuss potential changes in our domestic trade laws   Congress has spoken out forcefully on this issue and has indicated that our trade laws must be maintained   Foreign predatory trade practices must not be allowed to damage our economic interests          The United States must continue to be a leader in the world trade community   But support for trade agreements depends on the support of the American people   Foreign producing interests in the glassware sector have shown  through their increasing penetration of market  their ability to compete   Maintaining the glassware industry  s import sensitive designation in current trade provisions is vital          We look forward to working with you on this important issue          Sincerely          Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles E  Schumer     Mary L  Landrieu
