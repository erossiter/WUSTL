June 9  2006 Senator Clinton Applauds Syracuse MDA for Securing Ford Foundation Grant to Help Grow   Creative Communities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SYRACUSE  NY    Today  at an event in downtown Syracuse  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton applauded the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York  MDA  for securing a  350 000 Ford Foundation grant that will enable the MDA and a host of community partners to develop a strategic plan aimed at transforming the region  s urban centers   Using Syracuse as a pilot city  the Ford Foundation hopes to use Syracuse as a model for other cities across the nation            The Ford Foundation  s pledge of support for this community and this initiative is a strong sign that Syracuse and Central New York are thinking creatively about their future  Increasingly  our community  s leadership is aligning behind common goals    like the redevelopment of vacant buildings in our urban core     said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton    We  re seeing that when we work together we can attract the interest and support of partners like Ford    partners that can help us complete the transformation of our region  s economic and social fabric             The  350 000 grant from the Ford Foundation will enable the MDA and a host of community partners to develop a strategic plan to convert the city  s stock of vacant and under utilized historic and industrial buildings into mixed use  mixed income   creative communities     These neighborhood based communities would serve as magnets to attract residents back into the city and provide employment opportunities for people of different socio economic and professional backgrounds            Community leaders across the country are looking for new and creative approaches to urban development     said Susan V  Berresford  president of the Ford Foundation    Our hope is that the MDA  s plan will serve as an effective and practical model to attract diverse populations back to our inner cities               In order to ensure the long term health and success of this city and this region  we must repopulate our urban core     said William Davis  president and CEO of the Metropolitan Development Foundation  MDF   which will receive and administer the grant for the MDA    Our goal is to work with residents and developers alike to rebuild center city neighborhoods in a way that will encourage sustainability and creativity  The focus of this project will be to promote diverse groups of people living in close proximity  provide residential options for people of varying incomes  create attractive public spaces for congregation  offer easy access to the arts and entertainment  and generate opportunities for neighborhood based entrepreneurship             The Senator helped secure  350 000 in Fiscal Year 2004 VA HUD Appropriations funding on behalf of the MDA to update and revise the region  s economic development strategy as well as help to determine the best economic path for the Central Upstate New York region   Furthermore  last year  Senator Clinton and representatives from her office worked with MDA President and CEO  Irwin L  Davis  on the   Creative Communities   initiative   The Senator was thrilled to tell the Ford Foundation about the work of the MDA and this project in particular            I was proud to speak to the Ford Foundation about the important work being done by the Metropolitan Development Foundation and while thrilled  I m not the least bit surprised by the outcome  Under the leadership of Irwin Davis  the MDA continues to prove that they know how to get things done and are an integral force behind key economic development initiatives throughout the region   said Senator Clinton   This announcement represents a significant achievement for Syracuse and Central New York    to capture the interest of the Ford Foundation and to engage them in a relationship to rebuild this community   I look forward to working with all of the community stakeholders to see that this project reaches its full potential             Syracuse  s urban fabric is rich with large commercial and industrial properties which hold a key to successful revitalization     said Irwin L  Davis  President and CEO of the MDA    The Ford Foundation is encouraging us to look at these properties as sources of opportunity rather than signs of blight  and to expand the investment we are seeing in our downtown into our inner ring neighborhoods             To do so  the MDA and its partners will               Identify concentrations of vacant properties in the urban core             Document existing impediments to redevelopment             Identify existing and needed financial incentives to facilitate this redevelopment             Work with neighborhood residents and developers to identify preferred development alternatives for target properties             Develop a sustainable economic model for the implementation of resulting projects             Identify   new infrastructure    amenities    such as WiFi access    that are critical components of successful   creative communities    and incorporate those amenities into a series of design standards
