December 19  2005 Clinton  Schumer  Congressional Panel Restores  125 Million For Injured 9 11 Responders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    U S  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer today announced that the joint House and Senate Conference Committee has restored  125 million for injured 9 11 workers in the FY06 Defense Department Appropriations bill   The  125 million had been appropriated as part of the emergency 9 11 recovery aid  but President Bush proposed to take it back in his FY06 budget              This was money promised to New York by President Bush and never should have been taken away     said Senator Schumer     It is good that it is being restored   it was the only right thing to do               Today we realize a great victory in our fight to secure  125 million previously appropriated to New York as a result of the September 11th attacks   I am proud to have worked with my colleagues in the New York delegation to get this accomplished  and I commend everyone from New York who came to Washington  D C  to fight for this critical funding   Thankfully  through our joint efforts  the Appropriations Committee restored the money so that it can be made available for worker  s compensation claims and to address the ongoing medical and mental health needs of our firefighters  police officers  first responders  workers  and others who volunteered at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills   I am glad that we won this struggle to help New York  s heroes who put their health and lives on the line in the days  weeks and months after September 11th     said Senator Clinton           Senators Clinton and Schumer have worked on all fronts to restore this critical funding  along with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and Congressman Vito Fossella and others in the New York delegation   Throughout this fight  Senators Clinton and Schumer have noted the need to restore the funding for three key reasons   First  there has never been a study of how much aid will be needed to pay current recipients of 9 11 workers compensation   Second  there has been no analysis of what resources will be needed for future payments to hundreds of 9 11 claims that are still pending   Medical research shows that respiratory illness from 9 11 can be long term and debilitating over time   If even a fraction of pending claims are approved in the months ahead  annual 9 11 workers compensation payments could reach multiple millions of dollars            Third  it is important that the broader purpose of supporting the health and recovery of 9 11 responders continue to be a priority   More than half of some 12 000 responders screened through a national medical monitoring program coordinated by the Mount Sinai Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine are estimated to still experience 9 11 related illnesses   That is why  75 million of the aid will be used to support medical and mental health monitoring and treatment for 9 11 responders who do not have health insurance or adequate coverage for 9 11 injuries   These funds could be used to extend the national World Trade Center medical monitoring and health effects treatment programs past the current five years of funding to track and adequately diagnose long term illness from the disaster          The bill has been approved by the House   The bill must also be approved by the Senate before being sent to the President and signed into law
