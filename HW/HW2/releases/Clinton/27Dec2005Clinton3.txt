December 27  2005 Senator Clinton  Hope Still Alive in Push to Save Purple Heart Stamp                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator Welcomes News that U S  Postal Service May Continue Printing Stamp and Calls for Continued Pressure        Over 750 Names Already Sent to Postmaster General Through Clinton  s Petition  Calling for Stamp to Remain                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Continuing her support for the Purple Heart Stamp  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed news that the U S  Postal Service may change its mind and continue reissuing the stamp  In a recent letter to Military Order of the Purple Heart National Commander Jim Randles  the Postal Service indicated that because of the interest being shown in the stamp  it may consider continuing its production  While this latest news was welcomed by Senator Clinton  who has been an unwavering champion in the fight to recognize the heroism of those who have received the Purple Heart  the Senator again urged the Postmaster General to continue issuing the stamp  Last week  in a letter to the Postmaster General  Senator Clinton delivered a list of over 750 names of individuals who have signed onto her petition to save the stamp         We are all very encouraged by the tremendous response to saving the Purple Heart Stamp and this news gives us even more hope  There is no question that there is considerable public support for keeping this stamp in circulation  so I am glad to hear that the Postal Service is getting the message     Senator Clinton said    This stamp honors those men and women in uniform who have made tremendous sacrifices in the defense of our nation  The Purple Heart Stamp is a tribute to the tremendous heroism of our brave soldiers    both past and present   and I would urge the Postal Service to reissue it         With the United States Postal Service expected to increase postal rates in the coming year  supporters of the stamp  including members of Military Order of the Purple Heart  are concerned that the Postal Service might discontinue the stamp which honors the heroes who have received the Purple Heart Medal      Earlier this month Senator Clinton launched a petition on her website to urge the Postmaster General to continue issuing the Purple Heart Stamp honoring the heroes who have received this medal  http   www

signed onto her petition  Senator Clinton has invited those who agree with the effort to save the Purple Heart Stamp to add their name to her letter to the Postmaster General  posted on her website at http   clinton senate gov issues veterans index cfm topic purpleheart       Senator Clinton cosponsored legislation  S  Con  Res  56  during the 107th Congress expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued to honor members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Purple Heart  Senator Clinton wrote to the U S  Postmaster General urging support for a commemorative stamp to pay tribute to the Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit  And in May 2003  Senator Clinton attended the ceremony to launch the first issue of the Purple Heart Stamp in Newburgh  NY   The Senate also has approved legislation  sponsored by Senator Clinton and Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE   supporting a   National Purple Heart Recognition Day    and honoring all soldiers who were severely injured while serving their country and who were awarded a Purple Heart        The Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit  commonly known as the Purple Heart  is the oldest military decoration in the world in present use  The Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to members of the Armed Forces who are wounded in conflict with an enemy force  or while held by an enemy force as a prisoner of war  and posthumously to the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces who are killed in conflict with an enemy force  or who die of a wound received in conflict with an enemy force  There are over 1 535 000 recipients of the Purple Heart Medal  approximately 550 000 of whom are still living      The Purple Heart was established on August 7  1782 during the Revolutionary War  when General George Washington issued an order establishing the Honorary Badge of Distinction  otherwise known as the Badge of Military Merit  or the Decoration of the Purple Heart       The text of U S  Postal Service letter to the National Commander of the Military Order of the Purple Heart follows       December 16  2005     Mr  James R  Randles National Commander Military Order of the Purple Heart 5413 B Backlick Road Springfield VA 22151 3960     Dear Mr  Randles      Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us regarding the 37 cent Purple Heart postage stamp  The Postal Service has received a number of inquiries like yours asking us to consider reprinting the stamp at the new 39 cent rate to be enacted on January 8th       Traditionally we do not reprint a definitive stamp with new rates go into effect  Because of the interest being shown in the Purple Heart stamp  we are evaluating the impact a reprint would have on our overall stamp program  A decision will be made shortly      We appreciate your interest in our stamp program and thank you for your past and future support      Sincerely      David E  Failor Executive Director
