                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York State Economy and National Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  25 million in the FY06 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for projects to benefit the Southern Tier  including  1 million for the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center at Binghamton University   17 million for Schweizer Aircraft  s RQ 8B Fire Scout VTUAV   3 million for Rockwell Collins   GATM for the KC 135 project and Soldier Mobility and Rifle Targeting System  SMaRTS  projects   3 million for the Gunner Crew Chief Station Trainer at L 3 Communications  and  1 million for Lockheed Martin Owego  s Communication High Accuracy Locations Systems  CHALS   The bill also includes  935 9 million which was included in the President  s Budget for Lockheed Martin Owego  s VXX Marine One Program   The House has approved the bill   The Senate is expected to work on the Defense Appropriations bill this week   If the bill is passed  it will be sent to the President for his signature          This is great news for the Southern Tier   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Southern Tier and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Southern Tier defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge              New York  s Southern Tier has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support               1 million in federal funds will go to Binghamton University for the expansion of the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center  Over time  federal funding will allow the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center to become an engine for economic growth and innovation in the Southern Tier by spurring the creation of high tech regional companies to partner with the center and by driving the creation of a significant number of new jobs            The funding will also create new opportunities to improve and enhance national security  In the past there has been considerable interest in emerging technologies such as micro electromechanical systems and nanostructured materials and interconnects  however  the emphasis has been focused mainly on devices and components rather than systems  The Small Scale Systems Packaging Center meets the critical packaging challenges in the development of small scale systems and as a result  creates new opportunities for national security  The work done at the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center is focused on developing new lightweight electronics and materials for aviation systems  military clothing capable of sensing a soldier  s health and environmental and future unmanned systems  and sensor systems integration for use in harsh environments  In FY 05  the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center received  1 million  The Senators continued support of this facility in FY 06 is critical for the New York economy            3 million of the federal funding will also go to L 3 Communications for the Gunner Crew Chief Station  The money will be used to develop a Helicopter Door Gunner and Crew Chief Trainer allowing for the training of crewmembers in operating weapons systems on helicopters  The project responds to an urgent request established by Commanding General  101st Airborne Air Assault Division in preparation for deployment of air assault forces to Iraq  The funding will allow for better technology and better training for soldiers in combat            17 million in federal funds will go to Schweizer Aircraft to help support the development of the Fire Scout RQ 8 Vertical Takeoff and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  VTUAV  to be used by the US Navy and Marine Corps  The Fire Scout VTUAV is in the final stages of development  Its primary role will be to provide Navy and Marine personnel with information about combat situations and precision targeting on the sea and ashore  The Fire Scout s long endurance  excellent performance  sophisticated payloads  ability to take off and land vertically  and autonomous operating capability make it uniquely able to provide long range surveillance and targeting under the most demanding of tactical conditions            The Fire Scout s dynamic system is derived Schweizer s Model 333 turbine helicopter  which has been proven by over 20 million flight hours  With vehicle endurance greater than six hours  Fire Scout is capable of extended continuous operations  The Fire Scout will be able to fly 110 nautical miles from launch site  stay aloft for three hours  and then return   Over 5700 sailplanes  helicopters  agricultural aircraft  and reconnaissance aircraft  designed and manufactured by Schweizer Aircraft  are operated in more than 70 countries around the world             2 million of federal funds will go to Rockwell Collins   GATM for the KC 135 development  The Air Force has embarked on a program referred to as Global Air Traffic Management  GATM  to equip its applicable aircraft with a capability to comply with the new mandated FAA regulations  Aircraft that do not possess these new capabilities will be denied access to airspace where such capabilities are mandated  or be severely restricted in such areas  Restrictions may include outright denial of access to selected airspace  or assignment of limited and inefficient flight altitudes  or assignment of inefficient routes of flight  and extensive flight authorization delays           Rockwell Collins will work with the Air Force  s premier GATM program in equipping its existing fleet of KC 135 air refueling tankers with the capabilities required by these new regulations  Aircraft equipped with the required systems will have the operational advantage of choosing the most efficient and economical routes of flight  as well as continued access to airspace that is now regularly used in DOD world wide operations  While operational access to airspace has been important to address the  far flung  military commitments of the 1990  s  it has now reached a critical status as the government continues to fight the War on Terror  It is imperative that the United States is capable of projecting airpower to any location via the most direct route  This is fundamental to having combat crews reach the target area with the most fuel and in the least fatigued condition possible            1 million in federal funds will go to Rockwell Collins for the Soldier Mobility and Rifle Targeting System  SMaRTS    SMaRTS was developed for Special Operations Forces to improve night  limited and zero visibility operations  Current operations have determined that night vision goggles alone do not provide the soldier with the capability to operate and survive in many environmental conditions and mission scenarios  As the enemy gets smarter in defeating night vision goggles and continues to gain this capability themselves US soldiers are finding their technological advantage deteriorating  SMaRTS provides soldiers with a lightweight  low power  helmet mounted thermal and visible sensor with a helmet mounted display and thermal weapon sight  The system is powered by a man portable battery pack  SMaRTS is applicable to the US Army Land Warrior and is also considered an emerging capability with an associated formal requirement from the Counter Terrorism Technology Task Force and is a baseline technology for the Urban Cave Assault Advance Concept Technology Demonstration which is a Special Operations Sponsored Program            1 million in federal funds will also go to Lockheed Martin Owego for Communication High Accuracy Locations Systems  CHALS    The Communication High Accuracy Locations Systems  CHALS  provides precision location of communication signals for tactical use   The next generation CHALS system   CHALS XC provides significant improvements by expanding the frequency domain and the signal types currently supported by the legacy CHALS systems   This expanded capability would be beneficial to operational units in the war on terrorism by assisting in the precision location of enemy and terrorist cells  Additional funding will provide the benefits of the improved CHALS XC into current tactical  anti terror and homeland security operations            935 9 million in federal funds  requested in the President  s budget  will go to the Lockheed Martin led Team  s US101 project  to provide the next generation VH 71 presidential helicopter to the White House as a safe and secure  Oval Office in the Sky  for America s Commander in Chief  The US101    the name given to the American variant of the highly successful EH101 medium lift helicopter    was designed as a highly agile and maneuverable military aircraft  Three engines ensure maximum safety  payload and range at altitudes up to 15 000 feet  The US101 will have such reserves of power and built in capacity to accommodate additional mission technologies and payload
