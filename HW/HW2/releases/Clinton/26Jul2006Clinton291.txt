July 26  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Introducing the Screening for Health of Infants and Newborns  SHINE  Act of 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mr  President  today I am pleased to introduce the SHINE Act of 2006 with my colleague Senator George Allen   This legislation is critical for the health of newborns and children            Each year in our nation  at least 4 million newborns are screened and severe disorders are detected in 5 000 of them   Although these numbers may seem small  these disorders are often life threatening and can cause mental and physical disabilities if left untreated   Early detection by newborn screening can lessen side effects or completely prevent progression of many of these disorders if medical intervention is started early enough           I am proud to say that New York has been a leader in newborn screening since 1960 when Dr  Robert Guthrie developed the first newborn screening test   Since then  more than ten million babies have been tested   In 2004  New York expanded their newborn screening panel from 11 to 44 conditions   These improvements were a concerted effort by state officials and parent advocacy groups like the Save Babies through Screening Foundation and Hunter  s Hope Foundation   They share a common goal that every child born with a treatable disease should receive early diagnosis and lifesaving treatment so that they can grow up happy and healthy   Today  we want to ensure that the great strides made by New York can be a model for all states and that New York can continue to make advancements that will benefit the children of New York and around the nation             Newborn screening experts suggest States should test for a minimum of 29 treatable core conditions   However  as of today  some states only screen for 7 conditions   Every child should have access to tests that may prevent them from a life threatening disease   Parents should not have to drive across state lines to improve the health of their baby   This bill establishes grant programs so that states can increase their capacity to screen for all the core conditions   Grant funds are also available for states like New York to expand newborn screening panels above and beyond the core conditions by developing additional newborn screening tests           We should expect equity within newborn screening so that it does not matter where your baby is born   This legislation will establish recommended guidelines for states for newborn screening tests  reporting  and data standards   Our goal should be that affected babies be identified quickly  babies who have the diseases should not be missed  and the number of newborns falsely identified as sick should be minimized   By tracking the prevalence of diseases identified by newborn screening within states  we will be able to meet these goals and improve the long term health of our children           I hear from many parents how scary it is to have a sick child and to not have a diagnosis   Many parents spend years trying to find out what is wrong with their child and feel helpless   This legislation will make sure that current information on newborn screening is available and accessible to health providers and parents   The SHINE Act will provide interactive formats so that parents and providers can ask questions and receive answers about newborn screening test  diagnosis  follow up and treatment             Early treatment can prevent negative and irreversible health outcomes for affected newborns   We should be doing all we can to give every child born in our country the opportunity for a happy and healthy life            I would ask unanimous consent that the following letters in support of this legislation from the March of Dimes  Hunter  s Hope Foundation  Save Babies through Screening Foundation  Blythedale Children  s Hospital  and Pediatrix Medical Group and its subsidiary  Pediatrix Screening be included in the record                        Read letters of support for SHINE from    Blythedal Children s Hospital Hunter s Hope Foundation March of Dimes Pediatrix Medical Group Save Babies Through Screening Foundation
