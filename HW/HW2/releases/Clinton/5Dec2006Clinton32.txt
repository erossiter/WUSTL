December 5  2006 Senator Clinton Questions Defense Secretary Nominee Robert Gates at the Senate Armed Services Committee Confirmation Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              SENATOR CLINTON   Thank you  Mr  Chairman           And Mr  Chairman  it has been a privilege to serve on this committee under your leadership   I m very grateful to you           And Dr  Gates  thank you for your candor  That s something that has been sorely lacking from the current occupant in the position that you seek to hold           Your candor to this committee  to the American people  and especially to our men and women in uniform  is crucial to our success  We need a strong secretary of defense    but that doesn t mean strong headed           And I appreciate your openness and willingness to engage with this committee today           Part of that candor was evident when you responded to Senator Levin s question about whether we are winning the war in Iraq  contrary to what your predecessor told us from that very chair and what the President has told the American people            Can you tell us when and how you came to the conclusion that you expressed in your testimony  that we were not winning  a conclusion different from the President s        DR  GATES  I think that  frankly  if the President thought that the current tactics and strategy that we were employing were successful  he wouldn t be looking for fresh eyes and looking for new approaches and new tactics in our situation in Iraq           I suppose that I came to that conclusion during my service on the Iraq Study Group  which was really the first time I d had the opportunity to look at some of these circumstances in detail        SENATOR CLINTON  Well  you know  Dr  Gates  since the president made a statement as recently as October 25 that we were absolutely winning  many of us believe that the outcome of the election has triggered the willingness of the President to perhaps look at other options           As you said in your testimony today  you don t believe there are any new ideas on Iraq  that we know what the options are  and it is incumbent upon us  our government  hopefully in consultation with the Congress  on a bipartisan basis  to find a path forward           Now  with respect to the path forward  have you reviewed Secretary Rumsfeld s memo regarding possible policy options for changing course in Iraq        DR  GATES  I just read the version of it in the newspaper        SENATOR CLINTON  Do you agree with the analysis that appeared in the article that contained a copy of the memo that you ve referred to        DR  GATES  It seemed to me that some of the options that Secretary Rumsfeld put forward are exactly among those that need to be considered in considering the path forward        SENATOR CLINTON  You know  Dr  Gates  I ve been honored to serve on this committee now for nearly four years   Many of the options that Secretary Rumsfeld put forward in that memo have been discussed in our committee deliberations          They have been offered to administration witnesses as possible options   And yet there were no changes           That strikes me as being very troubling  because now we re looking at the potential for a thorough review that will lead to changes that will be in America s interest  be in the interests of our men and women in uniform and  we hope  in the interests of the people of Iraq and the region           Based on your experience  which goes back quite a ways in this town  do you believe the President  the Vice President and the existing Secretary of Defense are intelligent men        DR  GATES  Yes  ma am        SENATOR CLINTON  Are they patriotic          DR  GATES  Absolutely        SENATOR CLINTON  Do they care about our men and women in uniform        DR  GATES  Absolutely        SENATOR CLINTON  Do they believe the decisions they have made for the last five years have been in America s best interests        DR  GATES  I have not had that discussion with any of them  Senator        SENATOR CLINTON  Well if we          DR  GATES  I m sure that they believe that they were in the country s best interests          SENATOR CLINTON  So  therefore  we have this conundrum   We have a President and a Vice President who will ultimately decide    as the President is fond of saying  he is the decider    about the direction to pursue going forward in Iraq   And it is quite frustrating to many of us to see the mistakes that have been made    some of which you have enumerated    and to wonder whether there is any change that will be pursued by the President             Do you have an opinion as to how and when the process will occur that might lead to some changes in options and strategies        DR  GATES  My sense  Senator Clinton   is that this process is going to proceed with considerable urgency                 I would tell you that  if I m confirmed  as soon as I m sworn I intend to actually move very quickly in terms of the consultations with the commanders in the field and with the Chiefs and with others in terms of formulating my recommendations           So I would say  certainly from my standpoint and  I think  also from the administration s  with considerable urgency          SENATOR CLINTON  Finally  let me ask you  Dr  Gates  In an oral history of the  91 Gulf War produced by the PBS program  Frontline   you made some very definite points about how the military often overstate  or even  in your words  exaggerates the level of forces required to accomplish a specific objective           I m concerned that s precisely the attitude that we ve heard from Secretary Rumsfeld  former Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz and others  with regard to General Shinseki s recommendation and many in the uniform military  and civilian experts  who have consistently beat the drum that we don t have enough troops  we never had enough troops           Therefore  how will you take that set of recommendations from your uniform military on board and figure out how you re going to assess it  given your previously stated position that it s often exaggerated when we look at missions to accomplish        DR  GATES  Senator  that statement was made in the context of the bureaucratic wars in Washington and the decision making process  or the process of considering contingency planning in the Situation Room           I would tell you that CIA also  in those same meetings  often would describe  very pessimistically  the prospects for covert actions that were being considered by an administration           And  frankly  it s my experience that both the military and CIA take that kind of approach   Because sometimes they hear  as one of the earlier senators was    I think it was perhaps Senator Warner  the chairman    they hear some awfully strange ideas in the Situation Room  sometimes  from members of the National Security Council staff           It was always my experience that  contrary to the conventional wisdom  it was the State Department that most often wanted to use force and the Department of Defense that most often wanted to use diplomacy   And CIA never wanted to use covert action  Everybody wanted everybody else to take the actions           I think that  when the actual decisions came  though  the recommendations of the military were taken very seriously             And I remember when President Bush  the first President Bush  was asking about the offensive strategy  once we had 200 000 troops in Saudi Arabia   And we were at a meeting in the Situation Room in the fall of 1990   And the military came in and briefed on what they felt they needed to eject Saddam and the Republican Guard from Iraq  from Kuwait            And they went through a long list of things   moving the 7th Corps to the Middle East  six carrier battle groups  activating the Guard and Reserve   And I ll never forget  the President stood up and said   You ve got it   Let me know if you need more            And I think that that kind of deference  when you get past the debate about what the policy should be  the great deference should be extended to the professionals who are going to have to carry out the action   And I think the first President Bush did that in the Gulf War  and that certainly would be my instincts if I m confirmed as secretary of defense        SENATOR CLINTON  That would certainly be welcome            Read More of Senator Clinton s Statements and Remarks on National Security
