May 9  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Medical Malpractice Reform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Senate has rightfully defeated legislation masquerading as medical malpractice reform  Senator Barack Obama and I have introduced the National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation or MEDiC Act to bridge the gap between the medical liability and patient safety systems for the benefit of both patients and physicians   Through better communication  more cooperation and protection from liability within the context of the program  our bill gives doctors and patients an avenue to find solutions outside of the courtroom  which the vast majority of patients say is what they want   This model is already showing positive results at a number of hospital systems and private liability insurance companies around the country  including the University of Michigan Health System      Patients and physicians are paying the price for a health care system that discourages the kind of communication needed to find and correct the conditions that lead to medical errors   We need to do everything we can to put patient safety first and bring a fresh approach to the table   Our legislation will provide incentives for doctors  hospitals and health systems to create a culture of safety that will reduce medical errors and lower malpractice costs   For the sake of patients  physicians and the quality of our health care system  we will continue to call on our colleagues to consider this critical legislation
