                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senate Today Votes 79 14 to Override Presidential Veto of Water Resources Development Act  Authorizing Funding for Improvements to New York s Waterways   Projects Include Improvements to Orchard Beach  Disposal of Dredged Material  Restoration of Hudson River Park  and Studies on Rehabilitating Newton Creek and Shoreline Protection in Brooklyn                                                Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate has voted to override the Presidents veto of the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   joining the House to authorize  28 2 million for projects to improve New Yorks waterways  including  18 2 million for Orchard Beach and  10 million for Hudson River Park  The bill also includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility  and authorizes a number of studies  The vote today sends the president a clear message that critical projects like these cannot and will not be sacrificed  said Senator Schumer  Overriding his veto is a huge boost for New Yorks waterways  which are not only vital to our citys commerce and transportation  but also offer New Yorkers enjoyment through exploring everything from our bustling harbors to our waterfront parks to our gorgeous beaches    Throughout our history  New Yorks waterways have welcomed visitors and newcomers to our great City  spurred prosperity  and provided stunning natural beauty  The vote today reaffirms our commitment to preserve and maintain New Yorks vital natural assets  from Orchard Beach and Hudson River Park to our famous Harbor  Senator Clinton said  I am pleased that a strong bipartisan majority in the Congress voted to override the Presidents veto and joined us in supporting these important projects  The Senators announced that the bill passed today includes the following authorizations  Orchard Beach The bill modifies an existing authorization for Orchard Beach in the Bronx  New York  to increase the authorization to  18 2 million  Orchard Beach is visited by more than two million people each year  but the beach is suffering from severe erosion and the sand needs to be replenished  The purpose of this project is to restore and stabilize this heavily utilized public recreational beach  The Water Resources Development Acts of 1992 and 1996 authorized a total of  5 6 million for the study and execution of an Orchard Beach shoreline protection project  The current WRDA would increase that authorization to  18 2 million  New York Harbor Dredged Material Management Facility The bill includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility  The disposal of sediments dredged from New York Harbor has become increasingly more costly over the past decade due to the Environmental Protection Agency s promulgation of more stringent rules governing the disposal of these materials at sea  This has led to efforts in both New York and New Jersey to find beneficial uses for dredged materials  Most of these efforts to date have focused on using dredged materials that have been processed with additives such as Portland Cement or incinerator ash to create a stable  construction material that have been successfully used as a grading material at landfills and brownfields  Development of the facility will enable more flexibility in matching the timing of the availability of dredge material with the needs of end users  which will encourage competition and reduce the costs of upland dredge material disposal  The facility would accept dredged material from both federal channels and private berthing facilities  Hudson River Park The bill includes a  10 million authorization to allow the Army Corps to participate with the State of New York  New York City  and the Hudson River Park Trust in carrying out activities to restore critical marine habitat  improve safety  and protect and rehabilitate critical infrastructure  Studies The bill also authorizes a feasibility study of ecosystem restoration improvements on Newtown Creek  Brooklyn and Queens  New York  and a feasibility study of shoreline protection at the confluence of the Narrows and Gravesend Bay  Upper New York Bay  Shore Parkway Greenway  Brooklyn  NY  The Water Resources Development Act authorizes Corps of Engineers civil works projects  including navigation  ecosystem restoration and shoreline protection projects  Under the authorizations  the Corps partners with local sponsors to conduct the project  A project authorization in WRDA is a necessary first step towards securing funding in an appropriations bill at a later date
