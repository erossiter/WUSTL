June 20  2006 Senator Clinton Calls on Republican Leadership to Join Efforts to Increase the Minimum Wage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Senate and House Democrats in underscoring the urgent need to increase the federal minimum wage and to discuss their efforts to get an increase passed this year   Senator Clinton also reiterated her call to tie the minimum wage to increases in Congressional pay             It is unacceptable that Americans working full time are living in poverty   Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value and working families fall further behind   It is past time to stand up for working families and raise the minimum wage     said Senator Clinton     I also believe we should tie the minimum wage to Congressional pay raises   If we in Congress can give ourselves a raise  surely we can raise the pay of working families struggling to make ends meet             The minimum wage is currently  5 15 an hour   Senator Clinton is an original co sponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Representative George Miller  D CA  to increase the minimum wage to  7 25 that has bipartisan support in Congress and overwhelming support across the country  However  the Republican leadership is pulling out all the stops to keep this plan from becoming law by blocking it from coming to the floor in the House and attaching poison pills to it in the Senate            Last week  the House Appropriations Committee voted 32 to 27 to attach the Kennedy Miller plan to increase the minimum wage to the FY 2007 Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill   The House was expected to consider the annual funding bill this week  but House Republican Leadership has put it on hold as they scramble to find a way to kill the measure          Senator Clinton is working with Senator Kennedy and other Senate colleagues to attach the minimum wage increase to the Defense Authorization bill          Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation  the Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act  to link Congressional pay increases to increases in the federal minimum wage  In addition to gradually raising the federal minimum wage  the bill would also require the minimum wage to be increased by the same percentage amount as Congressional salaries every year             In 1989  Congress passed legislation that provided for an automatic salary increase for its Members every year tied to an inflation adjusted cost of living allowance  COLA   Congress can decline to accept the pay raise and has done so five times since the automatic increase was put into effect  Pursuant to this new law  Congress in 1991 also gave itself a 25 percent salary increase to make up for past years when its salary remained unchanged           In 1991  the minimum wage was  3 80 per hour   It is currently  5 15 per hour and was last increased in 1997   If the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as Congressional salaries  it would now be  6 51 per hour  If the minimum wage had also received a 25 percent bump in 1991  it would now be  7 48 per hour           A single mother with two children who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earns just  10 700 per year    almost  6 000 below the federal poverty line for a family of three   The minimum wage in New York is currently  6 75 per hour and will increase to  7 15 per hour in January 2007  If the federal minimum wage ever exceeds New York  s wage  New York law stipulates that the federal law would prevail
