November 18  2005 Senator Clinton Introduces Legislation To Increase Number Of Children Adopted Out Of Foster Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Saturday Marks National Adoption Day  November is National Adoption Month                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    As the nation prepares to mark National Adoption Day on Saturday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced legislation to help reduce barriers that are keeping tens of thousands of children in foster care from being adopted by willing parents   The legislation creates a pilot program to help make the adoption process easier to navigate for prospective parents   Senator Clinton also recently co sponsored a Senate resolution marking November as National Adoption Month          Children in foster care are our children   We have taken responsibility for them and it is a tragedy that every year many foster children lose the chance to find a permanent  loving home because potential adoptive parents give up in the face of a daunting and often frustrating process   While we must do everything we can to protect foster children  we also need to welcome and guide prospective parents through the adoption process   That  s why I have introduced the Adoption Process Improvement Act and I will fight to pass this bill into law             Despite the dramatic increase in the number of adoptions out of foster care since enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997  which Senator Clinton championed and helped pass  there are still 80 000 adoption ready children in foster care   At the same time  in a given year  240 000 Americans will call for information about adopting a child from foster care          New research indicates that at least part of the problem is that child welfare agencies  concerned primarily    and appropriately    with the safety and well being of children in foster care  focus less attention on serving prospective parents   As a result  prospective adoptive parents  themselves often daunted by the process and frustrated by years of trying to have a child of their own  become discouraged   Only a very small fraction of parents interested in adopting children in foster care end up doing so   As a result  thousands of needy children will remain in foster care and thousands more willing parents remain childless        Senator Clinton  s legislation creates a pilot program to enable states  metropolitan areas or tribes to implement practices shown to help make the adoption process more attentive to the needs of potential adoptive parents   The bill provides  50 million for a minimum of five grants        For more than 30 years  Senator Clinton has been a champion of efforts to help children in foster care and those aging out of the foster care system  As First Lady of the United States  Senator Clinton led numerous efforts to increase awareness about and support for youth aging out of foster care  and to increase the number of children who are adopted out of foster care  Senator Clinton worked towards passage of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997  which has more than doubled the number of children adopted out of foster care  and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999  which doubled funding for the Federal Independent Living Program and helps older foster care children earn a high school diploma  participate in vocational training or education  and learn daily living skills  The legislation also requires states to serve youth up to 21 years old  which enables more young people to obtain a college education and allows states to provide financial assistance to these youth as they learn skills to enter the workforce  Finally  the bill allows states to extend health insurance coverage under Medicaid for foster care youth to age 21         In the Senate  Clinton has worked to further increase the number of adoptions out of foster care by providing additional incentives for adopting older children and those with special needs and increasing the Adoption Tax Credit   She also has introduced legislation with Senator Olympia Snowe  R ME  that would support relative caregivers who often offer stable  loving homes to children who would otherwise be in foster care          The following is a fact sheet on the Adoption Process Improvement Act of 2005       Fact Sheet        The Adoption Process Improvement Act of 2005       The Need to Make the Adoption Process More   Parent Friendly            According to a recent study conducted by Harvard University and the Urban Institute in collaboration with the Evan B  Donaldson Adoption Institute  a full 78 percent of adults who call for more information about becoming adoptive parents will not fill out an application or attend an orientation meeting   Only six percent of those who call for information actually complete the adoption home study  a requirement for all prospective parents               Prospective adoptive parents often face a number of barriers that discourage them from adopting children out of foster care  including difficulty in accessing the child welfare agency and unpleasant initial contacts with it  which are critical  as well as ongoing frustration with the agency or aspects of the process             The two primary ways people learn about the adoption from foster care are the media and word of mouth   Negative experiences with the adoption process have resounding effects as one parents   frustration is expressed to friends  families and acquaintances       The Bill    This legislation establishes a demonstration project in at least five major metropolitan areas that agree to the following conditions             Improving the first contact prospective adoptive parents have with a public child welfare agency by         o Establishing a specialized adoption hotline and tracking every incoming call to better understand the attrition rate and the reasons for it          o Hiring only employees with a background in counseling and providing specialized adoption training so these employees answer callers   requests sensitively and efficiently  and         o Establishing a process to solicit and incorporate feedback from all prospective parents  including those who exit the process early on  in designing and improving the adoption process             Striking a balance between the recruitment of new adoptive parents and screening prospective parents by          o Emphasizing recruitment at the start of the process by providing prospective parents with clear  written guidelines about qualifications and grounds for being screened out  and         o Separating the two processes  so as to avoid the inherent conflict agencies are faced with when dealing with applicants             Providing families with an explicit explanation of the adoption process  including the roles that various workers play  relationships among the different agencies  and the   roadmap    necessary to navigate through the process             Increasing parental involvement in the process of matching children and families by providing clear information about the matching process and taking into consideration the expectations of prospective parents             Providing applicants with a balanced perspective of the adoption process by presenting both the rewards and challenges of the process             Involving successful adoptive parents in every aspect of the adoption process from designing recruitment strategies to training and matching             Establishing an Adoption Committee for matching waiting children with adoptive parents  The Committee must be composed of objective adoption professionals and dedicated to assessing the child s needs  in conjunction with the strengths and abilities of the candidate families  Once a family and their adoption worker have declared a formal and mutual interest in a waiting child  the adoption committee must consider their application             Developing a buddy system between prospective and established adoptive parents to provide the support prospective families need without depleting the agency  s resources             Coordinating all adoption sources to afford prospective parents immediate access to all children available for adoption    as opposed to only those from a particular agency        In awarding grants  the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  shall take into consideration the quality of each application  the demonstrated commitment of each applicant to achieving the goals of the program  and the geographic diversity of the applicant  In exchange for receiving funding  grantees shall subcontract their program design  implementation and evaluation to independent  legitimate marketing and research firms so that business and consumer product marketing techniques inform the design and follow up process
