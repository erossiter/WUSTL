August 22  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Release of Haleh Esfandiari from Prison                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  I welcome the news that Dr  Haleh Esfandiari  director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars  has been released from prison in Iran  following four months of unjust detention  I commend Dr  Esfandiari for her courage during this trying time and my thoughts remain with her and her family  Yet while this development is promising  the Iranian government should heed the calls heard around the world to immediately allow Dr  Esfandiari to return to the United States    I continue to call on the Iranian government to also free the three other Iranian Americans currently being detained in the country  Development consultant Dr  Kian Tajbakhsh and Ali Shakeri  founder and board member of the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding  are still unjustly imprisoned  while journalist Parnaz Azima cannot leave the country    All four of these individuals have worked to foster understanding between the Iranian people and the international community  and this egregious violation of their rights remains a blight upon the Iranian regime    Dr  Esfandiaris release from prison represents a step forward  and I urge the Iranian government to continue this progress and allow all four individuals to return to their homes unharmed I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to secure their safety and freedom
