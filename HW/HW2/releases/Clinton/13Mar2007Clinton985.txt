March 13  2007 Crowley  Clinton  Schumer Call on President Bush to Support Risk Based Homeland Security Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Senate Homeland Security Bill Would Help New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Today  US Congressman Joseph Crowley  D Queens   the Bronx  and Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer sent a letter to President George W  Bush  urging him to support funding measures in the Homeland Security legislation that would provide adequate anti terror assistance for New York and other areas at greatest risk of attack   The letter  which 25 lawmakers cosigned  calls for the final version of the Senate Homeland Security omnibus to include a  risk based  funding formula that would allocate federal anti terror funds to regions based on assessed threat            Congressman Crowley said   The call to make sure that New York City receives enough resources to protect itself should not be a recurring theme   Congress needs to pass a homeland security bill that offers adequate assistance to New York  which remains terrorist target No  1   If responsibly allocated  these federal resources will help ensure New York s first responders get the sufficient training and equipment to save lives           Senator Clinton said   With our Homeland Security resources limited  we need to be smart about how we distribute funding to guard against terrorism   Sadly  all too often  funding decisions have been made based on politics in Washington instead of the reality in our cities and neighborhoods  I have long supported the 9 11 Commission s recommendation that  homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities             By establishing a risk based funding scheme for homeland security dollars  this bill fixes a glaring mistake in our national defense legislation   Schumer said   New York is the prime terrorist target  and we can not afford to leave it vulnerable to attack because faulty funding formulas send precious resources to low threat areas  I applaud the passage of this provision in the House and will fight to get it passed in the Senate           Last week  Rep  Crowley  and Sens  Clinton and Schumer met with New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and discussed the need for the New York to receive sufficient assistance to ensure that first responders receive the necessary resources to safeguard against another terrorist attack   Once it passes  the Senate Homeland Security bill will be reconciled with the House version  which was approved in January   The House version of the Homeland Security bill includes a funding formula that would disburse a greater percentage of homeland security funds according to risk            The text of the letter follows below       March 6  2007      The Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500      Dear President Bush       We are all in agreement that the most pressing issue facing our nation is the need to keep our homeland safe from terrorism   It was in a bipartisan way that we created the Department of Homeland Security and worked to develop unique programs to proactively keep our country safe and prepared   As both the House and Senate debate their respective 9 11 Commission bills  we respectfully urge you to weigh in and encourage the Senate to adopt several provisions contained in the House passed package  H R  1    In our estimation  H R  1 s funding formulas for the distribution of Homeland Security grants best represents the recommendations and intent of the 9 11 Commission          While we commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their diligent work in drafting the  Senate bill  S  4    we believe the House passed version of this legislation  which makes our homeland security funding more  risk based   is far more representative of the needs of our country   especially those locations  facing the greatest risk  such as New York   Specifically  we are concerned about language in the Senate measure that provides state minimum funding levels that are far too high and ignore the more pressing needs of those states  cities  and localities at greatest threat of attack          We believe the House measure  which provides lower minimum thresholds for Federal Homeland Security grants than its Senate counterpart  ensures that all states will be able to fund their specific needs while still allocating a majority of our limited resources to those states and localities facing the greatest risk of an attack          As you know  H R  1 holds the distinction of being the first piece of legislation passed by the 110th Congress   Its prompt passage reflects the urgency the Congress and the American people have placed on enacting these important reforms   H R  1 s common sense approach to Homeland Security grant funding not only acknowledges the realities of dangers we face  it is in keeping with the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission   Therefore  we urge you to encourage both Democratic and Republican Senators to support H R  1 s funding formulas during consideration and debate of the Senate bill          We appreciate your leadership on this important issue and look forward to working with you as both chambers negotiate a conference report that meets the best interests of our nation s Homeland Security needs                                                                    Sincerely       Joseph Crowley                                                                        Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer
