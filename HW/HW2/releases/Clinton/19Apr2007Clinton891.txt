April 19  2007 Clinton Presses Bush Pentagon on Contracting Abuses in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Pentagon Officials Admit They Have No Idea when Accountability Measures will be in Place       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  at today s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  pressed Bush Pentagon officials on the Administration s lax and inadequate oversight of contractors in Iraq  which has cost taxpayers billions in over payments  fraud and waste   Senator Clinton cited specific examples of contractors openly defying Pentagon attempts to control costs and limit spending but failing to be held accountable   Senator Clinton also questioned Army officials about their efforts to develop monitoring of contractors and when monitoring would be in place   none were able to reply            Following her questioning  Senator Clinton emphasized that  we just cannot let this go on  It s not fair to the people in the field  it s not fair to the people in the Defense Department  who are frankly outmanned    Senator Clinton emphasized that currently  the contractors have so much more capacity to be able to manipulate the system  and the end loser is the soldier in the field and frankly all the rest of us           The following is a transcript of Senator Clinton s questioning at today s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing          Senator Clinton   It is especially important to get to the bottom of the questions that we are asking today   And Mr  Chairman  I would respectfully request that you perhaps consider either charging one of our existing subcommittees or creating a special subcommittee to delve more deeply into the issues that are being raised here   The seriousness of these allegations and frankly the waste and fraud that is so evident from so much of the what we ve heard merits that  but in addition we ve to got to figure out what we re going to do going forward   We cannot afford to continue this            Over the last four years  we have paid KBR  20 billion to provide logistic support in Iraq   I thought when we enter into a contract we were in charge of telling the contractor what to do  but some of the reports that we have seen on this committee make it sound as though the contractor s in charge of telling the United States military  the United States government what to do           Here are a few excerpts from some of the DoD documents from July 2005                 There were concerns as to  the contractors  reluctance to down size the labor force after the transfer or support missions to the sustainment contractor                  Also  July 2005   The use of self directed work added additional cost to the task order with no visible benefit to the government                 March 2006   There was no effort to coordinate with the contracting officer to de scope changes based on the reduction requirements and to establish a new definite price                 April 2006   Command personnel advised us that the contractor wouldn t move idle personnel or equipment assigned from one task order to another task order to accomplish needed work   When we brought this situation to the attention of top contractor operational personnel  they informed us this was a company policy            Secretary Bolton  why is the contractor permitted to be reluctant to down size the labor force   Why are they adding self directed work to the contract   Why aren t they coordinating with government officials in order to reduce requirements and costs   And how can they have a company policy that requires the United States tax payer to pay for idle workers   Who s in charge of this contract  DoD or the contractor       Secretary Claude M  Bolton  Jr   Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition  Logistics and Technology   Well  I would hope that the DoD is  Senator Clinton   In response to allegations such as those  what we ve done is put together several panels run by the government  run by the Army   One is to look at requirements   These are requirements that come on a regular basis from the commanders to make sure that the commander is getting what he or she really wants   Sometimes those requirements are inflated   We also have a group whose job it is  once we have those requirements  to actually figure out how much it s going to cost and then negotiate that with the contractor who s already put in a bid   And many times those bids are a lot larger and higher than we d like them to be  so we put people in place to correct some of the things that you ve just mentioned   Are we there yet   Are we perfect yet   No   I ll take your allegations and anybody else s that I get from the auditors here  which we ve done over the years and we will correct those   I think we re getting better  but we are not there yet       Senator Clinton   Well  of course one of the problems has been the extraordinary increase in the outsourcing of government functions to private contractors   I think the latest figures I saw is that we now have three times more private contract employees then we do military and civilian employees   There is no evidence that these contract employees perform better than government employees or that they do it more cost effectively   And there has been no database or system of accountability to keep track of all of these contractors   Now in October 2005  DoD issued DoD instruction 302 42  which included the requirement that DoD develop or designate a joint database to maintain by name accountability of contractors deploying with the force and a summary of the services or capabilities they provide   GAO report 0714 entitled   Military Operations High Level DoD Action Needed to Address Longstanding Problems with Management and Oversight of Contractors Supporting Deployed Forces   provides great detail on these DoD instructions and the importance of having full accountability   May I ask  just starting with Secretary Bolton for a yes or no answer  if any of you have reviewed the GAO report 0714  Secretary Bolton       Secretary Bolton   Only at the summary level       Senator Clinton   Next please       William H  Reed  Director  Defense Contract Audit Agency  DCAA   No       Senator Clinton  Next       Keith D  Ernst  Acting Director  Defense Contract Management Agency   Yes Ma am       Patrick Fitzgerald  Auditor General of the U S  Army  Yes Senator        Major General Jerome Johnson  Commanding General  U S  Army Sustainment Command  Yes Senator       Senator Clinton   Okay  And the GAO report concluded that the Army was still in the process of implementing the database and that is uncertain when the process will be completed   So  this has been going on for now  two and a half years   I guess a little less than that   And we still don t have it   Does anyone know when the process will be completed   Can any witness answer that   Does anyone know when our deployed senior leaders and commanders will have a grasp of the accountability problem with all these contractors           I ll let the record show that to both questions  all the witnesses shook their heads  no          Chairman Levin   The record will indicate that  unless the witnesses indicate right now otherwise       Secretary Bolton   Only to talk about the database   We do have a SPOT report that we provide to commanders   That s still in the emergency database  That does account for the contractors   The problem that the commander has is more than just the people that I have on contract   Since that commander is responsible for the entire battle space  it s not only my contractors  it s the contractors from the coalition forces  it s the contractor from private companies  but he also has to be concerned   The database that you referenced earlier  is still maturing  that s at the DoD level  we re part of that   I cannot answer your question in terms of when it will be complete and how we ll keep it updated       Senator Clinton   Secretary Bolton  which Army staff agency is responsible for the implementation of this database       Secretary Bolton   That will fall under me   If we re talking about contracting and contractors  once I have that  I ll issue a policy on that       Senator Clinton   Well  there was a disagreement reported in the GAO report as to whether this falls under logistics or personnel   Has that disagreement been resolved       Secretary Bolton   I don t know if it s been resolved yet or not   General Johnson       General Johnson   No  it has not been resolved   I m a bit reluctant in answering this because I don t know the current status   I m in the field now versus the building   There was a system and a team established as we moved into the war fight   We called it Triple C  which is Contract Control Cell   It was established by the Army material command  operated under my command  to make an effort to contract to account for contractors on the battle field   Frankly  it was bigger than us   That s when we got the help of DoD  the logistics management readiness crew  and they came up with a SPOT report   We have taken that to the field commanders   They have looked at it  In many cases it does not provide some of data points that they want so that they can manage these contractors and it s going to require some  inaudible  procedures as Mr  Bolton has outlined  that we currently just don t have   We have  so in some cases  we have some accountability   We don t have what we need           LOGCAP s a bit different   We probably have pretty close to  I d be  in the 90 percent range confident that I know how many LOGCAP contractors I have on the battle field and where   But  when we open up the scope to all the contractors on the battle field  we have contractors who perform what we call field service representatives  who follow particular systems that are in the field that require contractor repair and we have numerous other contractors  supporting contractors   So  that s kind of the complexity of the problem   Doesn t answer and doesn t give an excuse for not having the capability  We re working very hard at it  but we re just not there yet       Secretary Bolton   Senator Clinton  if I could just add  on the note that I was handed  on the SPOT that stands for Synchronized Pre deployment Operational Tracker   That s the tracking of the contractors   That is in the office of Secretary of Defense Business Transformation office and it s still under development         Senator Clinton   Well Mr  Chairman  I think that the issues that this hearing has raised are such serious ones   This whole question about contracting out services where the chain of command either doesn t exist or it s essentially outsourced as well to the contractor  or whether it s certainly confused  and where people cannot be held accountable  The failure to have adequate databases  and that s on top of the testimony from our colleague Senator Dorgan  about just outright fraud and abuse and just heartbreaking waste in the system   So  I think that this certainly is an issue that demands our attention and perhaps an effort to try to sort out all of these various problems of accountability   Trying to get a better handle on what should or shouldn t be outsourced and I hope that this committee can take lead on trying to establish a strong foundation similar to what our colleague Senator McCaskill referred to with the groundbreaking work of then Senator Truman  because we just cannot let this go on  It s not fair to the people in the field  it s not fair to the people in the Defense Department  who are frankly outmanned  They have inadequate databases  It s like sending them into a battle with a pop gun against heavy artillery because the contractors have so much more capacity to be able to manipulate the system  and the end loser is the soldier in the field and frankly all the rest of us               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
