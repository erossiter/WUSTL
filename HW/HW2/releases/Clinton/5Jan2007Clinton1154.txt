January 5  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding The Department of Homeland Security  s Urban Area Security Initiative Announcement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The announcement that the Department of Homeland Security will provide Buffalo Niagara with FY 2007 Urban Area Security Initiative grant funds is welcome news   For months I have been emphasizing to DHS the unique national security threats faced by the Buffalo Niagara region and urging them to abandon any plan that would eliminate the region from this desperately needed risk based homeland security funding program   Today  s announcement is the right decision for the Buffalo Niagara region and Western New York      While I also applaud DHS  s decision to allow New York City to dedicate up to 25  of their UASI allocation towards personnel costs that will allow the city to maintain the NYPD  s unequaled counterterrorism unit  I am concerned that DHS  s decision to combine New York City and northern New Jersey into a single region for purposes of UASI grants could pose significant problems  not the least of which is less total funding for the region   Homeland Security funding needs to reflect the threats our vulnerable cities face  any grant calculation that further cuts vital homeland security funding for New York City is unacceptable
