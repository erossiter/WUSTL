April 12  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Death of NYPD Detective James Zadroga                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The saddening news that Detective James Zadroga s death was directly caused by his exposure to toxic fumes and dust at Ground Zero reminds all of us of our continuing obligation to do whatever is necessary to help those who sacrificed their lives and health on September 11  2001  and in the days and weeks afterwards   Last December  my colleagues and I restored  125 million to New York  that was rescinded by President Bush  to remain available for ongoing Worker s Compensations Claims and for baseline and follow up screening  clinical examination  long term health monitoring and treatment  and other care for these heroes   At our urging  the Secretary of Health and Human Services appointed a 9 11 Health Coordinator to continue monitoring the long term effects associated with Ground Zero   We now know that many first responders who worked at Ground Zero continue to suffer grave health effects long after the initial attacks  With this sad news  I plan to continue to work closely with Mayor Bloomberg  and ask Governor Pataki and the 9 11 Health Coordinator John Howard  to do whatever must be done immediately and in the long term to help these heroes   We must never forget the sacrifices made on that day and the sacrifices that continue to be made years later
