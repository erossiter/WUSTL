September 6  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Family Planning Provisions of the FY 2008 Foreign Operations Appropriations Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Today  I was pleased to see the Senate approve the Boxer Snowe amendment to repeal the global gag rule  This amendment  which I cosponsored  will end onerous restrictions on funding for foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide valuable health services  The global gag rule  also known as the Mexico City Policy  restricts United States funding from going to any foreign organizations that use their own funds  not U S  government funding   to provide counseling and information about abortion  lobby to change abortion laws  or provide legal abortion services in the countries in which they operate  This rule was suspended during the Clinton Administration  only to be re imposed by President Bush  The re instatement of the gag rule has resulted in the closure of multiple health clinics in the developing world  reductions in the number of community health workers providing outreach in rural areas  and contraceptive shortages in the countries most in need of family planning services  The repeal of this rule will result in better health outcomes for women and families around the world  increasing access to family planning  reproductive health  and outreach and education services  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this repeal is maintained in conference  I am disappointed  however  that the Senate also approved an amendment that removed language from the underlying bill to help direct funding towards the United Nations Population Fund  UNFPA   In countries around the world  UNFPA provides important health services that reduce maternal mortality  treat obstetric fistula  reduce female genital cutting  and reestablish maternal health services in countries where the medical infrastructure has been destroyed  I will continue to fight to restore funding for UNFPA  in order to better protect the health of women around the world
