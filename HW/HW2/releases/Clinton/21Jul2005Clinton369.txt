July 21  2005 Clinton  Chafee Amendment to Fund United Nations Program Approved by Senate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    U S  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Lincoln Chafee  RI  applauded today Senate action on their amendment to direct funding to specific United Nations Population Fund  UNFPA  projects in 150 countries           The amendment was accepted into the Senate passed Foreign Operations Appropriations bill and outlines six items to be funded with UNFPA money   They are                Providing and distributing equipment which would facilitate safe childbirth and emergency obstetric care              Preventing and treating cases of obstetric fistula  a severe medical condition which occurs in women after severe or failed childbirth  when proper medical care is not available              Making contraceptives available for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases  specifically HIV AIDS              Establishing maternal health services in areas when medical infrastructure and related services have been destroyed by natural disasters              Eliminating the practice of female genital mutilation             Increasing access of unaccompanied women and other vulnerable people  such as those in refugee camps  to vital services  such as water  sanitation facilities  food  and health care            For the past three years  UNFPA has gone unfunded due to language included within the Kemp Kasten amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill  which disallows funds to any organization or program that supports or participates in practices of coercive abortion   UNFPA does not support abortions and is working in countries around the world to help couples plan pregnancies   One of the countries where they are engaging in such efforts is China  which has a program of coercive abortion with severe fines and administrative penalties for giving birth to an unauthorized child   Despite a State Department financed report that found that UNFPA  s China programs did not participate in any coercive abortion or sterilization activities  the Administration has withheld funding for all of UNFPA s activities   This amendment would more narrowly define the programs funded by UNFPA and would not challenge the Kemp Kasten language   With this amendment  Senators Chafee and Clinton are raising awareness of UNFPA s work  and helping to remove objections to UNFPA financing by directing funding to essential women s health services             Every year  500 000 women worldwide die from mostly preventable pregnancy related causes  These women are not able to get to a doctor who can treat them with safe  sterile equipment   This amendment calls for the distribution of medical equipment  medicine and supplies for safe childbirth kits and emergency obstetric care  and helps fund UNFPA in the 89 countries where it works to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity     Senator Clinton said     I believe our government needs to support the efforts of UNFPA to aid in maintaining the health of millions of women in the developing world                   UNFPA plays an important role in helping pregnant mothers deliver healthy babies in some of the poorest nations  helps prevent the spread of HIV AIDS  provides voluntary family planning services  and assistance in times of humanitarian emergencies   It is disappointing that the U S  has withheld funds to UNFPA for the past three years  cutting off all U S  assistance through UNFPA in the 150 countries where it operates  based solely on concerns with family planning practices in China   I am asking that this year  s Foreign Operations Appropriations bill contain language directing the U S  Government to again provide funds to UNFPA   This appropriation would go a long way toward helping poor and disadvantaged women to gain access to valuable services and achieve proper reproductive health     Senator Chafee said
