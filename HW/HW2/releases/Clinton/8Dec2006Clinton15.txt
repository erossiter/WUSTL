December 8  2006 Clinton  McNulty  Announce  1 Million for SUNY Cobleskill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   As the 109th Congress comes to a close  U S  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Michael R  McNulty  D Green Island  have announced that the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes  1 000 000 for a Bio Waste to Bio Energy project at SUNY Cobleskill           I am always pleased to see federal funds return to my congressional district from Washington  but I am especially proud to secure this funding for SUNY Cobleskill and Schoharie County   McNulty said    This funding will be used to conduct research on a new process that creates clean energy through the conversion of organic waste   This new technology could significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills  reduce the costs of removing and handling solid biowaste  and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels            I am pleased to help SUNY Cobleskill move their clean energy research agenda forward   Converting waste to energy is a win for the economy  the environment  and our energy security   Senator Clinton said           SUNY Cobleskill is very grateful to both Congressman McNulty and Senator Clinton for their work in securing funding for this important project and for bringing it to New York State and our campus  The project may result in a unique method of producing clean renewable energy  which puts both the Congressman and the Senator on the front end of helping meet the energy needs of the future  at the same time  it will provide the military  the agricultural community and municipalities with a value added product from their waste streams  This project will also highlight SUNY Cobleskill s commitment to be on the forefront of the sustainability movement  while providing our faculty and students the opportunity to participate in cutting edge research  Bioenergy technology is the future  and working with Congressman McNulty and Senator Clinton  we at SUNY Cobleskill want to help develop the solutions for the next generation   said Dr  Anne C  Myers  Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs at SUNY Cobleskill           At a time when high energy costs are an enormous burden for many Americans  I am thrilled that SUNY Cobleskill is at the forefront of efforts to find alternative energy solutions   Not only does this technology have the potential to help those living in the United States  but it could also help our troops in the field   Much of the waste on military bases is organic   By converting food wastes to usable fuel on site  soldiers would save valuable time and energy that might otherwise be spent disposing this waste by burning  burying it  or transporting it off site   McNulty added
