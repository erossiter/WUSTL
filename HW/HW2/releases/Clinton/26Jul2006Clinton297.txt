                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bill inspired by Hunter Kelly  son of former Buffalo Bills Quarterback Jim Kelly  and his battle with Krabbe  s Disease                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced introduction of bipartisan legislation with Senator George Allen  R VA  inspired by the story of Hunter Kelly  the son of Jim and Jill Kelly  and his battle with Krabbe  s disease  The Screening for Health of Infants and Newborns or SHINE Act would help states increase their newborn screening capabilities so that all babies have the opportunity for early diagnosis and lifesaving treatment          Last week  Senator Clinton also secured  500 000 for the Hunter s Hope Foundation in the Fiscal Year 2007 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Bill             Hunter Kelly was a remarkable child  who bravely battled a fatal  nervous system disease that wasn  t caught by infant screening  His parents  Jim and Jill Kelly  have been tireless advocates for improving newborn screening to help spare other families from the struggle they experienced and to help find a cure for disorders that take the lives of children like Hunter     Senator Clinton said    This bill is a tribute to Hunter and to all those children and their families who have faced this kind of struggle and pain             Each year four million infants born in the United States are screened shortly after birth to detect a variety of diseases   In New York  11 million screening tests are done on the quarter of a million babies born in the state each year  Currently  with some federal guidance  each state determines which disorders newborns are tested for and in some states  it  s as few as seven   In New York  newborn screening advocates like the Kelly family through Hunter  s Hope Foundation in Buffalo and Jill Fisch through her Save Babies Through Screening Foundation in Scarsdale  have helped expand New York  s newborn screening capacity from 11 to 44 conditions            Although most of the disorders that are screened for are rare  some may be life threatening or impede mental and physical development if left untreated   However  early detection by newborn screening can often lessen the serious side effects of these diseases or completely prevent them if medical treatment is started early  The SHINE Act will expand use of newborn screening so that all babies have the opportunity for early diagnosis and lifesaving treatment     Senator Clinton said          The Screening for Health of Infants and Newborns or   SHINE    Act will build on New York  s work by helping states increase their newborn screening capabilities  In some states this will mean increasing the number of newborn screening tests  and in states like New York  this will mean developing new tests for diseases that are not currently tested for          As with the variability across states in the number and types of screenings  there is also little consistency with regard to the interpretation of test results  and how this information is reported and tracked   The SHINE Act will ensure that all babies are screened using the same standards so that their diseases are identified quickly and correctly so any necessary treatment can begin as soon as possible            The Clinton Allen legislation will make sure that current information on newborn screening is available and accessible to health providers and parents through an internet clearinghouse   This site will be interactive so that parents can ask questions and receive answers regarding newborn screening             Parents can spend years going to doctors trying to get a diagnosis and treatment for a sick child   They need to be able to access information about the benefits and potential risks of the tests and treatments involved in newborn screening  as well as information about the disorders themselves in order to best care for their child     Senator Clinton said            The SHINE Act is supported by               Save Babies Through Screening Foundation        March of Dimes        Hunter  s Hope Foundation        Blythedale Children  s Hospital          The  500 000 that Senator Clinton secured for the Hunter s Hope Foundation will help establish the technology infrastructure of the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute inside the University at Buffalo  s Center for Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences   This Institute will coordinate research initiatives into finding a cure for Krabbe  s disease and related genetic disorders   One in 100 000 live births in the United States are afflicted with Krabbe  s Disease  Approximately 2 million people  or one out of 125  in the United States are carriers of the genetic deficiency that causes Krabbe  s Disease
