September 3  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Senate s Ill Timed Consideration of the Estate Tax Repeal Measure in the Wake of Hurricane Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today issued the following statement on the Senate s ill timed consideration of the Estate Tax Repeal Measure in the wake of Hurricane Katrina          In the wake of one of the most devastating natural disasters in U S  history  it is unconscionable that the Republican leadership has chosen to focus its efforts on more tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy instead of helping our most vulnerable citizens whose lives have been shattered by Hurricane Katrina         Instead of ensuring that all necessary resources for the ongoing relief efforts in the Gulf Coast are in place  instead of ensuring that all the calls for assistance to families who have been left without food  shelter and clothing have been answered  the Republican leadership is planning a vote on an additional  290 billion of tax cuts for the richest people in the nation        Simply put  the Senate  s consideration of the estate tax repeal measure is exactly the wrong priority for our nation at this tragic time        If our consciences were not jolted by the Census Bureau  s latest report which indicated that 1 1 million more Americans fell into poverty last year  or the fact that the gulf between the haves and the have nothings has grown even larger  I would hope that those dictating the Senate  s schedule would be compelled to act by the dramatic images and reports of our fellow Americans dying and suffering in our streets          It is telling that before we had time to ensure that every possible step is being taken to care for the hundreds of thousands of our neighbors and fellow citizens in the Gulf States  the Republican leadership is finding the time to provide tax cuts for the wealthy who have already been the beneficiaries of this Administration  s economic policies            I call on Senator Frist to postpone action on this measure until all Senators have had an opportunity to be fully briefed on the latest damage assessments and relief efforts and we have a chance to enact a comprehensive relief and recovery package for the victims of Katrina   I want to work with my colleagues on providing any and every resource  such as further emergency assistance  emergency Medicaid  food stamps and cash assistance for the sake of the hundreds of thousands of our children  seniors and families that have been left behind in the Gulf        The values and spirit of community that Americans celebrate are like a barn raising where community members pull together to rebuild a farmhouse destroyed by wind or fire  not the act of the most privileged pulling away to first build another wing on their mansions while their neighbors are suffering   As I said during my visit to the Red Cross on Wednesday and throughout the last few days  I am heartened by the response of New Yorkers and all Americans to this tragedy   In the true American spirit  they are donating their time and their money   They are pulling together   It is my sincere hope that these values that Americans celebrate triumph over the shortsighted priorities of our Senate Republican leadership
