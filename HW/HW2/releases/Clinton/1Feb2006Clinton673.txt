                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Clinton Points to Dwindling Low Income Heating Assistance Program Funds throughout New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with Senate colleagues today in urging President Bush to support increased heating aid of  2 9 billion to help families in New York and throughout the country deal with rising heating costs   At a press conference today  and in a letter to President Bush  Clinton underscored the hardships facing many New Yorkers as a result of higher natural gas and heating oil prices               Last night  the President talked about working with Congress to solve the country  s problems  and I can  t think of a better first step than for him to join with Congress to provide additional heating aid of  2 9 billion to help Americans get through the winter     said Senator Clinton     It is also critical that the President put  5 1 billion in heating assistance funds for next year in the budget that he sends to Congress next week              Clinton noted that in spite of the mild winter  higher energy prices mean that many communities are already running out of federal heating aid funds  provided through the Low Income Heating Assistance Program  LIHEAP              Upstate New York utility National grid recently revised their estimates  and predicted that the average homeowner they serve will pay about  360 dollars more for natural gas this year   That  s a 35 percent increase over last year  and it is typical of what families are facing across New York State     said Clinton     We should not leave communities and families to fend for themselves                 The full text of the letter to the President follows          February 1  2006         The President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500         Dear President Bush           High energy prices continue to threaten the health and economic well being of households across the United States  but especially low income families   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by supporting an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in FY 2006  and requesting  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in your FY 2007 budget request  the level authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005            The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   Unfortunately  energy prices do not appear to be dropping falling in the near future   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation   Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education           Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted four times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate  s support   Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote   In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans    Your leadership on this issue will help ensure that low income families and seniors get the help they deserve from the federal government             We respectfully request that you support supplemental funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006  and full funding for the program in FY2007 at its authorized level of  5 1 billion   We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs   Thank you for your consideration for this essential request
