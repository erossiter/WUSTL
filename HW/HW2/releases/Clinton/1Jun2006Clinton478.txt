June 1  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the United Nations General Assembly 2006 High Level Meeting on Aids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC      This year marks the fifth anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on AIDS  UNGASS   during which time the UN adopted a Declaration of Commitment on HIV AIDS  This week  the UN gathers once again to evaluate its progress in meeting the goals set out in that Declaration           In our global fight against HIV and AIDS  tens of millions of lives hang in the balance  and whether those lives are saved or lost  whether coming generations inherit a future of hope or devastation  is up to us           We have made much progress    in 2005  we saw a decline in new infections in several  countries  including Cambodia  Kenya  and Zimbabwe  Since 2001  we have significantly increased the global commitment of resources to address this epidemic  And the vast majority of countries have developed a national AIDS strategy with which to address this epidemic  But we still have much work to do before we can truly say we are turning the tide against HIV and AIDS          Twenty five years into the epidemic  we know that we are falling short of our commitment to ensure that people have the information needed to allow them to protect themselves from this epidemic  In 2005  the UN estimates that 4 1 million people were infected with HIV  And yet in many countries  our youth do not have the basic facts about this virus  According to the UN  only one out of three young men  and one out of five young women in low to middle income countries can correctly identify ways to prevent HIV transmission  We must ensure that our young people around the world have access to scientifically based information about HIV and ways to prevent infection  If we cannot prevent infections  we will never be able to stop the progress of this virus          Women are increasingly affected by the epidemic  According to the UN  young women in parts of sub Saharan Africa are up to six times as likely to be infected with HIV than their male counterparts  Women in many countries face situations that make them especially vulnerable to HIV infection  We must increase our research into microbicides    female controlled prevention methods    to help women protect themselves against infection  and ensure that a viable microbicide is available to women as quickly as possible  We also must increase women  s access to treatment  While we have made gains in increasing access to antiretroviral treatment  only nine percent of pregnant women in low to middle income countries were offered access to services that could help prevent mother to child transmission  Because we do not have reliable data on distribution of antiretroviral therapies  we do not know how many women have access to treatment if and when they are not pregnant  By helping women gain access to prevention and treatment  we can ensure that they live longer  healthier lives    for themselves and for their families          We also need to increase people  s access to voluntary counseling and testing  According to the UN  only about 12 percent of people worldwide who want to know their status can get tested  Yet testing is so simple  and so important for everyone  If someone tests positive  we can help them access treatment and medical care before they become sick and we can teach them how they can prevent passing the virus to others   If someone tests negative  counselors can help them understand how they can remain negative and avoid infection  It is essential for us to lessen the stigma associated with testing and to get the necessary resources  like rapid test kits that don  t require laboratory analysis  to as many areas as possible           Although we do not yet have a medical cure for HIV AIDS  we know everything we need to know to prevent new infections  and we have the resources and technology needed to halt and reverse the spread of the disease in every corner of the world  The question is whether we will have the political and social courage to do what needs doing   I hope that this week  s meeting at the UN will help us recommit ourselves to the goals of the 2001 Declaration  and set out plans under which we can ensure progress against this disease in the near future
