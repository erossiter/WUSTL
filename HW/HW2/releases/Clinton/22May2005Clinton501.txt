May 22  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton Regarding NY State Comptroller s Audit of Medicaid Coverage of Viagra                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There is no doubt that the news of sexual offenders receiving Viagra under the Medicaid program is deeply disturbing and runs contrary to the purpose of Medicaid which is to provide health care coverage for uninsured  low income individuals  The notion that Level 3 sex offenders  those most likely to commit crimes again  have access to this drug  clearly poses safety concerns for the public  I join the calls for Secretary Leavitt to look into this matter as quickly as possible and will explore legislative options to address this issue
