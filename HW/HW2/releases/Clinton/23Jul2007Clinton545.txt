July 23  2007 Senators Clinton  Webb  Byrd   Bayh Call for Armed Services Hearing to Focus on Redeployment of U S  Forces from Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Comes in Light of Administration s Failure to Respond to Congressional Inquiry on Pentagon Planning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   In the wake of last week s unacceptable response from Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman regarding the Pentagon s planning for the redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Jim Webb  D VA   Robert Byrd  D WV   and Evan Bayh  D IN  are calling for a Senate Armed Services Committee  SASC  hearing to focus on this important national security issue affecting the safety of our troops   The primary purpose for such a hearing would be to have Administration witnesses testify on the status of withdrawal planning  but the hearing also could solicit the views of outside experts who have experience in the redeployment of large numbers of troops   If necessary  portions of the hearing could be held in closed session      In May  Senator Clinton called on Secretary Gates to brief the appropriate oversight committees in Congress  including the Senate Armed Services Committee on which Senators Clinton  Webb  Byrd  Bayh serve  on what current contingency plans exist for the future withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq   Alternatively  if no such plans exist  she asked for an explanation for the decision not to engage in such planning    In that letter  Senator Clinton wrote  the seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in Iraq were planted in the failure to adequately plan for the conflict and properly equip our men and women in uniform   Congress must be sure that we are prepared to withdraw our forces without any unnecessary danger     Last week  responding to this May inquiry on behalf of Secretary Gates  Defense Under Secretary Eric Edelman outrageously and dangerously claimed that congressional oversight emboldens our enemies   a direct contradiction to Secretary Gates himself  who stated in March during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee  I believe that the debate here on the Hill and the issues that have been raised have been helpful in bringing pressure to bear on the Maliki government and on the Iraqis in knowing that there is a very real limit to American patience in this entire enterprise   Secretary Gates reaffirmed his belief in the importance of Congressional oversight in a statement he issued this past Friday  saying  I have long been a staunch advocate of Congressional oversight  first at the CIA and now at the Defense Department  I have said on several occasions in recent months that I believe that congressional debate on Iraq has been constructive and appropriate    In their letter today  the Senators wrote  The need for the Committee to know the status of Department of Defense redeployment planning is clear  yet past efforts by individual members to obtain this information were rebuffed    The Senators noted the bipartisan call for such a hearing  writing  The importance of holding this hearing was underscored this month when Senators Warner and Lugar introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling for the Administration to present its redeployment plan to Congress by October 16  2007    They went on to write     the roots of the many problems facing our men and women serving in Iraq were planted by the failure of this Administration to develop sound  realistic plans  We cannot afford to repeat the same mistake when our forces redeploy   Congressional oversight will help to ensure that redeployment plans properly address the numerous challenges that our troops will face  including the resources and the diplomatic support required to ensure that any redeployment is safe and orderly    Senator Clinton s May letter to Secretary Gates  the response from Under Secretary Edelman  and the resulting letter to Secretary Gates can be found here        The full text of the Senators  letter today to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl M  Levin follows    July 23  2007   The Honorable Carl Levin  Chairman  Committee on Armed Services  United States Senate  R228  Washington  D C  20510   Dear Chairman Levin    We write to request that the Senate Committee on Armed Services hold a hearing on Department of Defense contingency planning for the redeployment of United States military forces from Iraq   Such a hearing could solicit the views of outside experts who have experience in the redeployment of large numbers of troops as well as administration witnesses   If necessary  portions of the hearing could be held in closed session    The importance of holding this hearing was underscored this month when Senators Warner and Lugar introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling for the Administration to present its redeployment plan to Congress by October 16  2007   As they noted  the safety and security of our military forces  as well as our nations credibility in the region  require that any military withdrawal or redeployment from Iraq be carefully planned and executed   A poorly planned withdrawal would compound the risks to our forces  coalition partners  and the government of Iraq    The need for the Committee to know the status of Department of Defense redeployment planning is clear  yet past efforts by individual members to obtain this information were rebuffed  Following reports that the Pentagon was not engaging in detailed planning while the Iraqi Defense Ministry was preparing its own plans in the event that the United States and its forces departed Iraq quickly  the Secretary of Defense was requested in May to provide the appropriate oversight committees in Congress with briefings on the current status of contingency planning for the withdrawal of U S  forces    Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman responded to this request on Secretary Gates behalf on July 16   A copy of his letter and other correspondence relating to this matter are enclosed for your reference   As you will see  Under Secretary Edelman raised spurious arguments to avoid discussing contingency planning and claimed that premature discussion of the withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda   His assertion that necessary congressional oversight emboldens our enemies is outrageous    As you are aware  the roots of the many problems facing our men and women serving in Iraq were planted by the failure of this Administration to develop sound  realistic plans   We cannot afford to repeat the same mistake when our forces redeploy   Congressional oversight will help to ensure that redeployment plans properly address the numerous challenges that our troops will face  including the resources and the diplomatic support required to ensure that any redeployment is safe and orderly    Thank you for considering this request    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton              Robert C  Byrd  Evan Bayh        Jim Webb   CC    The Honorable John McCain  Ranking Member  Committee on Armed Services     Read more statements
