July 7  2005 Clinton Signs Bipartisan Letter Protesting IRS Reductions in Taxpayer Service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton last week signed a bipartisan letter written to Senator Bond  Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee and Senator Murray  Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee to protest plans to reduce taxpayer services and to cut 68 Taxpayer Assistance Centers  TACs  across the country         We owe Americans this important service   The tax code is complex and prevents many honest and hardworking people from complying with the law   The TACs are necessary to give people the help they need filing their taxes     Senator Clinton said     People understand that though paying taxes is unpleasant  they are important and provide crucial funding to programs such as public schools and hospitals         The IRS argues that the TACs should be closed due to decreased usage  encouragement from the GAO  and that people other prefer methods of contacting the IRS  The letter refutes these claims stating that decreased usage of the TACs is a result of their reduced capacity over time and not out of peoples indifference  the GAO  s language has been taken out of context and implies that the IRS must make an accepted business case for any TAC closures  and that while the internet should be one available way to communicate with the IRS  it should not replace face to face interaction   The IRS reductions seem to be based on the theory that money spent on enforcement will promote more taxpayer compliance than money spent on outreach and assistance   The IRS lacks sufficient evidence to support this theory  so therefore it is just as likely that the TAC closures will only lead to less compliance
