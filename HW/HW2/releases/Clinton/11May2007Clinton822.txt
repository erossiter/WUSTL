May 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Dr  Haleh Esfandiari and Parnaz Azima                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I am deeply concerned about the inexplicable detention of renowned scholar Dr  Haleh Esfandiari by the Iranian government  Dr  Esfandiari currently serves as director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington  and has made significant contributions to the body of research on international women s issues  contemporary Iranian politics  and democratic developments in the Middle East  She returned to Iran to visit her 93 year old mother  and after being subjected to weeks of interrogations over her work with the Wilson Center  was jailed by officials earlier this week  This imprisonment contradicts the very essence of her work  which focuses on ensuring the promise of democracy and freedom to those who live under tyranny           In addition  respected journalist Parnaz Azima has had her passport seized by the Iranian government  and is unable to leave the country  Ms  Azima  a journalist for Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty  returned to Iran to visit her ailing mother  and has reportedly been told that she will not be able to leave the country for two to three years  separating her from her son and grandchildren           I urge the government of Iran to release Dr  Esfandiari and end any travel restrictions faced by both Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima and call upon the Administration to raise the plight of Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima with the international community
