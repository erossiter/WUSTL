September 22  2006 Senators Clinton  Schumer and Kennedy Introduce Legislation to Address 9 11 Health Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Charles Schumer  D NY  and Edward Kennedy  D MA  today introduced legislation  the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006  to provide  1 9 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment grants  available from 2007 2011  to firefighters  police officers  EMTs  paramedics  building and construction trades workers  volunteers  residents  and others whose health was directly impacted at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills as well as those who responded to the Pentagon attack   This funding would be administered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and would expand access to health monitoring and health care to all of those who served  lived and worked in the area in the aftermath of 9 11   Senator Clinton previously introduced a similar measure as an amendment to the Port Security bill but the Republican Senate leadership refused to allow a vote on the amendment            I will continue to fight for this funding because I believe we have a moral obligation as a nation to help those whose health was affected by 9 11   I have continually sounded the alarm that those who breathed the toxic air around Ground Zero in the days  weeks and months after 9 11 would suffer health effects and now our worst fears are being realized   I am working on all fronts with my colleagues to make sure that those suffering get the help they need and deserve     said Senator Clinton             Every day  we learn of another 9 11 first responder being stricken with this terrible illness     Schumer said    The ones who made it home safely now  five years later  have leaned that their lives may still be in danger and it is not the time to abandon the thousands that gave so much following that terrible day  Current programs and resources are not nearly enough to meet the growing need   The federal government must step up to the plate and ensure that our heroes receive the medical care they earned and deserve                The heroes of 9 11 deserve nothing less than our full support  yet sadly they  ve gotten too many empty promises from this Congress and the Administration   Our legislation will see that the brave Americans who rescued the victims of the terrorist attacks and helped rebuild our communities will get the health care they need to cope with the illnesses they face  They selflessly risked their lives for us  so this bill is the least we can do for them      said Senator Kennedy            A report released this month by Mt  Sinai shows conclusively that thousands of first responders  workers  volunteers  residents and others suffered mental and medical health problems as a direct result of 9 11   This report confirms the need to expand access to health monitoring and treatment to cover all of those whose health was affected by 9 11            The 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006 is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  on which Senator Clinton is a member and Senator Kennedy serves as Ranking member   Earlier this week  Senators Clinton and Kennedy wrote to Senator Mike Enzi  Chairman of the HELP Committee  and called on him to set a time for a hearing on 9 11 health effects and to mark up legislation authorizing grants for ongoing medical and mental health monitoring and treatment
