July 24  2006 Senator Clinton Hails National Academy of Sciences Study for Bringing Needed Attention to Environmental Health Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Report calls for increase in state and federal programs that measure exposure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton praised the release of a National Academy of Sciences  NAS  report that makes recommendations to help us evaluate the impact of environmental pollutants on the health of Americans  This report  entitled    Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals     outlines the need to expand our investment in biomonitoring  through which researchers can determine levels of human exposure to chemicals  in order to improve our ability to address possible links between the environment and disease and determine the effectiveness of initiatives to clean up our environment   Senator Clinton has long supported environmental health research  and has introduced legislation to expand our understanding of links between health and the environment  including the types of research highlighted by this NAS report             We have made great strides in identifying and raising awareness of environmental hazards  like the risk to children of lead paint exposure and the risk to women of consuming fish with high levels of mercury     But if we can  t measure exposure to pollutants through tools like biomonitoring  we can  t evaluate the gains we  ve made in improving public health   The tragic health problems our first responders and residents in New York are experiencing as a result of the toxic substances they were exposed to after 9 11 is a clear example of how and why this type of monitoring is so critical   Today s report sounds the alarm on the need to expand this critical research and I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure we make good on these recommendations   said Senator Clinton          The NAS study was requested by Congress in 2004 with goal of developing a long term research strategy and improve the application of biomonitoring techniques to respond to the emerging science in this area   As part of its recommendations  the NAS called for increased funding for state level biomonitoring programs  New York State is at the forefront of this type of research  with the state  s Department of Health engaging in pilot projects to determine the possible exposure of state residents to pollutants  Such projects have examined the levels of mercury exposure in New York City children  analyzed the effects of chemicals from secondhand smoke  and measured levels of cancer contributing chemicals in breast milk           Senator Clinton has been active in promoting environmental health initiatives   She has introduced the Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act  which would increase our ability to investigate environmental exposures that may lead to clusters of chronic disease and expand the biomonitoring activities of the CDC and states   She has also introduced  with Senator Barack Obama  D IL   the Healthy Communities Act  which would help translate scientific research in environmental health into information that can help communities understand and reduce their exposures to pollutants  Senator Clinton has led efforts to support the implementation of the National Children  s Study  a longitudinal study that will analyze the environmental risks faced by children  including a strong biomonitoring component   Senator Clinton has also worked to reduce exposure to known environmental pollutants  She has introduced the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act  which would provide tax incentives for the purpose of engaging in lead abatement activities for homes with children
