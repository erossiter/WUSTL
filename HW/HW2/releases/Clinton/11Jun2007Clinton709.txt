June 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Resolution Expressing No Confidence in Attorney General Alberto R  Gonzales                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Time and time again  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has placed the rule of President Bush ahead of the rule of law  I supported and cosponsored todays resolution expressing no confidence in Attorney General Gonzales and I renew my call for him to resign or be dismissed    Attorney General Gonzales put politics ahead of the rule of law when he fired U S  Attorneys who refused to participate in the Bush Administrations partisan witch hunts  When Congress called the Attorney General to account  the Department of Justice provided misleading  inconsistent  and deceptive responses to Congress    Unfortunately  these acts are part of a pattern of partisanship  scandal  and deception created by the Attorney General which casts a shadow over the entire Department of Justice  The Department allowed the FBI to abuse and to violate the Patriot Act by permitting the Bureau to obtain thousands of personal records without regard for proper legal procedures  The Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice has been overrun by political appointees who place ideology above enforcement of the Voting Rights Act  And I am deeply concerned by the Attorney Generals role in the creation of the Bush Administrations warrantless wiretapping program    The Department of Justice holds a special place in our government  The Departments hardworking attorneys  law enforcement officers  and staff are the defenders of our Constitution  not one political party  That trust is central to the sanctity of the rule of law and vitality of our democracy   Attorney General Gonzales violated the trust of the American people and should no longer hold the office
