September 8  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on NIOSH Ombudsman to Help Linde Ceramics in Preparing Claims for Former Linde Ceramics Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  In anticipation of todays meeting between the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  Ombudsman and former Linde Ceramics workers  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote to NIOSH Ombudsman Denise Brock to request that she provide guidance in preparing petitions for two Special Exposure Cohorts  SEC  for employees who were exposed to radiation during their employment at Linde Ceramics  Approval of these petitions would qualify the former nuclear workers to receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  EEOICPA     Linde workers have serious questions citing about the data used in the site profile and dose reconstruction processes  I believe that when the government does not have good information about exposure  then workers deserve the benefit of the doubt and should be compensated  The Special Exposure Cohort process would make that happen  and I urge the NIOSH Ombudsman to provide assistance in preparing the petitions   Approval of these petitions would finally provide Linde Ceramics workers and their families the long overdue financial and medical benefits they are entitled to  Senator Clinton said    Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 to compensate workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War   Under EEOICPA  former nuclear workers or their survivors were eligible to file claims with the US Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits   To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history      Claims are decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history   Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was likely to have caused the workers illness   Alternatively  workers may submit a special cohort petition for a class of workers if they believe that the available information does not allow dose reconstruction work to be done accurately      A copy of Senator Clintons letter is attached     September 7  2007   Ms  Denise Brock  Ombudsman  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  Office of Compensation Analysis and Support  OCAS   4676 Columbia Parkway  MS C 46  Cincinnati  OH 45226   Dear Ms  Brock    Thank you for meeting with former Linde Ceramics workers to assist them as they prepare to submit petitions for Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  status   As you know  workers plan to submit petitions for 1947 1954  when significant and highly dangerous uranium ore processing was conducted  and for 1954 1976  when residual radiation from the work of Manhattan Project continued to expose unwitting workers to dangerous levels of radiation      Linde Ceramics workers are pursuing SEC petitions because they believe that the site profile prepared by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  is based on inadequate  unreliable and incomplete monitoring of Linde workers   Workers allege that important monitoring documents are missing  and in some cases  were destroyed   This lack of data has led to a site profile and dose reconstructions that Linde Ceramics workers believe underestimates actual radiation doses received at the site   Some of these criticisms have been echoed in independent audits of both the site profile and a sample of dose reconstructions      Because of these flaws in the dose reconstruction process  Linde workers believe that they deserve SEC status   I believe that the law requires SECs to be established in cases where data is insufficient  and have introduced legislation that would clarify the conditions under which SEC status is granted   Based on what I know of the Linde site  it appears to be a worthy site   As a result  the petition process is extremely important  and I urge you to provide assistance to Linde workers as they move forward with their SEC petitions      Thank you again for meeting with the Linde workers    Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton
