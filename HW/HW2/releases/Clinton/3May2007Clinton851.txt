May 3  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Floor Statement of Senator Byrd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    Today  Senator Byrd announced on the Senate floor our intention to introduce legislation which proposes October 11  2007   the five year anniversary of the original resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq   as the expiration date for that resolution   As Senator Byrd pointed out  the October 11  2002 authorization to use force has run its course  and it is time to reverse the failed policies of President Bush and to end this war as soon as possible          Earlier this week  President Bush vetoed legislation reflecting the will of Congress and the American people that would have provided needed funding for our troops while also changing course in Iraq and beginning to bring our troops home          I believe that this fall is the time to review the Iraq war authorization and to have a full national debate so the people can be heard  I supported the Byrd amendment in 2002 which would have limited the original authorization to a year and I believe a full reconsideration of the terms and conditions of the authorization is overdue  This bill would require the president to do just that          The American people have called for change  the facts on the ground demand change  and the Congress has passed legislation that requires change  It is time to sunset the authorization for the war in Iraq  If the president will not bring himself to accept reality  it is time for Congress to bring reality to him          I urge my colleagues to join Senator Byrd and me in supporting this effort to require a new authorization resolution for these new times                Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
