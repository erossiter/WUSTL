June 15  2006 Statement of Senator Clinton on the 2006 Emergency Supplemental for the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Hurricane Relief                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC      Today  I voted for the Emergency Supplemental for the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and for hurricane relief for the Gulf Region   This bill will provide much needed funds for our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   However  the bill that passed the Senate floor addressed many more needs facing this nation than did the Conference Report that has emerged between the House and the Senate   One of the most egregious acts of this Conference  prodded by the Bush Administration  was the elimination of  648 million in port security funding   It is clear that our nation is unprepared to secure our nation  s ports and that additional funding is necessary given that we inspect only five percent of all cargo entering the United States   The Bush Administration  s failure of leadership on securing our ports was evident when the President threatened to veto a bill which contained critical port security funding and provided for other important needs
