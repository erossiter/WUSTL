                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Small Business Administration s Microloan Program is an Essential Tool for Small Business and Local Entrepreneurs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined a bi partisan effort to push Congress for  23 million for the Small Business Administration s  SBA  Microloan Program in the upcoming FY 2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act  In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee  the bipartisan coalition emphasized the importance of the SBA Microloan Program as the only federal program that provides funding for emerging businesses in the United States           The Microloan Program allows businesses that are just starting up to have a source of financial support so that they have a better chance at succeeding in the marketplace   Senator Clinton said   We need to do everything we can to support our small businesses and our local entrepreneurs and this program is a great source of funding for them  I hope that our colleagues will recognize the importance of this program and provide these much needed funds           The SBA Microloan Program was authorized in 1991  PL 102 140  with the mission of providing small loans and technical assistance  TA  to start up and emerging businesses that conventional banks are unable to serve  The program was designed with the idea that local non profit intermediaries  experienced as both lenders and technical assistance providers  can effectively reach and serve the needs of very small businesses and eventually move them into the economic mainstream as bankable enterprises        A copy of the letter to the Chairman is below       The Honorable Richard Durbin  Chairman  Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510      The Honorable Sam Brownback  Ranking Member  Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510      Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Brownback       We are writing to request that the FY 2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act provide  23 million for the Small Business Administration s  SBA  Microloan Program          The federal budget recognizes the effectiveness of microenterprise initiatives overseas by providing more than  200 million annually to support microenterprise programs in developing and transitioning countries  The SBA Microloan Program is the only federal program with the sole mission of providing financial and technical assistance to microenterprises in the United States          The SBA Microloan Program was authorized in 1991  PL 102 140  with the mission of providing small loans and technical assistance  TA  to start up and emerging businesses that conventional banks are unable to serve  The program was designed with the idea that local non profit intermediaries  experienced as both lenders and technical assistance providers  can effectively reach and serve the needs of very small businesses and eventually move them into the economic mainstream as bankable enterprises          Sixteen years later  the SBA Microloan Program has demonstrated that combining lending and technical assistance can bolster the success rate of microbusinesses  as demonstrated by the low loss rates that Microloan Intermediaries have experienced  It is this fusion of loans and ongoing TA  something no other SBA program provides   that is the linchpin of the program s success  The SBA Microloan Program has created or retained more than 64 000 jobs since it began at a cost of approximately  4 700 per job          With the support of the SBA  Microloan Intermediaries have financed more than 26 000 loans worth approximately  328 million to small entrepreneurs  with an average loan size of  11 500  Participating Microloan Intermediaries receive two streams of funding from the SBA  direct loans to capitalize revolving loan funds through which an intermediary makes loans of less that  35 000 to qualified small and disadvantaged businesses  and grant funds to support the ongoing technical assistance that an intermediary provides to its business borrowers          Already in FY07  Microloan Intermediaries have closed approximately 750 loans for a total of  10 5 million in loan volume  In FY 2006  33 percent of the loans went to rural businesses 37 percent went to start ups  45 percent went to women  28 percent went to Blacks or African Americans  and 19 percent went to Hispanics          We are requesting that  23 million be provided for the SBA Microloan Program in the coming year   20 million to support technical assistance grants and  3 million in Budget Authority to support  31 million in new loans  This funding level will not only enable the non profit lending intermediaries currently participating in the program to continue and expand their work but also allow the SBA to fund new intermediaries in communities that currently lack access to the SBA Microloan Program          We appreciate your consideration of our request and hope that we can work together to support this important program          Sincerely       Carl Levin  Norm Coleman  John Kerry  Olympia Snowe  Patrick Leahy  Susan Collins  Edward Kennedy  Joseph Lieberman  Christopher Dodd  Mary Landrieu  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Benjamin Cardin  Debbie Stabenow  Sherrod
