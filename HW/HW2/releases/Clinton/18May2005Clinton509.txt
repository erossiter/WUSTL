May 18  2005 Clinton  Efforts To Derail The Hudson River Cleanup Must Be Stopped                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator Moves to Block Contaminated Sediment Study    Calls on Senate Appropriations Committee to Reject GE requested Language Included in the House Interior Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    Concerned about efforts that could derail the Hudson River cleanup  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on her Senate colleagues to add language to the Senate version of the FY 2006 Interior Appropriations bill which would nullify a provision in the House version of the bill requiring the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  to begin a new study of contaminated sediments   The study requirement was included in the House Interior Appropriations bill last week at the request of General Electric        In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee  Senator Clinton expressed her concern that a new and largely duplicative NAS study could mean further delays in the Hudson cleanup  as well as at other sites with contaminated sediment across the country   Senator Clinton called on Senators Burns and Dorgan to include language opposing the House study provision when their committee acts on the Senate version of the Interior Appropriations bill next week          I am extremely concerned that the study has the potential to delay the Hudson cleanup     Senator Clinton said    The study provision inserted into the House Interior Appropriations bill at the request of General Electric should not be included in the Senate version and should not become law           Among her concerns  Senator Clinton said that the NAS study requirement included in the House bill focuses only on cleanup costs  rather than on the full range of contaminated sediment issues recommended for further study by the NAS in 2001   In addition  the Senator is concerned that the study language could be interpreted as requiring a protracted review of the EPA  s cleanup decisions at all contaminated sediment sites  ignoring the fact that EPA has recently put a detailed review process for contaminated sediment sites in place          The language included in the House bill focuses almost exclusively on remedial costs and would re open many of the issues surrounding the Hudson river that were decided by EPA in 2002 after more than a decade of study     Senator Clinton said    The cleanup should go forward as planned  and I call on my Congressional colleagues to ensure that it does            A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached        May 18  2005       The Honorable Conrad Burns  Chairman       The Honorable Byron L  Dorgan  Ranking Member       Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies  Committee on Appropriations     United States Senate  Washington  D C   20510       Dear Chairman Burns and Ranking Member Dorgan        As you prepare to markup the FY 2006 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  I write to urge you to include language in the Senate report disagreeing with language added to the House report last week regarding contaminated sediments   Page 115 of the House report directs the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to contract with the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  to answer a number of questions associated with EPA  s efforts to clean up contaminated sediments   This language was inserted at the request of General Electric        Although the House language purports to build on the recommendations of a recent National Research Council study entitled   A Risk Management Strategy for PCB Contaminated Sediments     the questions that the report directs the NAS to focus on have little to do with those recommendations   The NAS recommended assessing the human health and ecological risks of single chlorobiphenyls in particular environments  a range of risks presented by sites contaminated with PCBs and other pollutants  the fate and transport of PCBs in sediments  improvement of remedial technologies  the impact of continuing PCB releases and the global cycling of PCBs   By contrast  most of the questions in the House report focus on cost considerations relevant primarily to potentially responsible parties        The last question in the House report asks the NAS to review the EPA  s decisions at contaminated sediment sites to determine whether EPA regions are following agency sediment remediation guidance and   recommendations made by the  NAS  in its 2001 report     This could be interpreted to ask for a protracted review of the EPA  s cleanup decisions at all contaminated sediment sites  and ignores the fact that EPA has recently put a detailed review process for contaminated sediment sites in place   Key stakeholders are already integrated early on in this review process to help inform the EPA  s remedial decisions        With all of these factors in mind  I believe that requiring a new NAS study would do more harm than good  and could stall decisions and action on cleanup of contaminated sediments at sites across the country   I am especially concerned that this study could be used by General Electric to stall cleanup of the Hudson River   In 2002  after more than a decade of scientific investigation and analysis    including considerable governmental scrutiny and an extensive peer review process that provides the foundation for the agency  s proposed clean up plan    the EPA finalized its decision to require General Electric to cleanup PCB contaminated sediments from hot spots in the Hudson River   The EPA decision reflected the agency  s scientific conclusion that dredging hotspots was the best way to eliminate the continuing health and environmental impacts caused by the estimated 1 3 million pounds of PCBs that General Electric released into the Hudson   After years of additional work since the EPA decision was finalized in 2002  cleanup work is set to begin in 2006   Yet the study language included in the House bill is clearly intended to revisit many of the issues that were decided in 2002 by EPA after extensive study   The Hudson River cleanup should not be delayed by further study   I urge you to include language in the FY 2006 Senate Interior Appropriations report disagreeing with the House requirement for an NAS study of contaminated sediments         Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
