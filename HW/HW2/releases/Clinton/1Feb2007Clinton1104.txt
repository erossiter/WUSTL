February 1  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton on Exxon Mobil  s Announcement of Record  39 5 Billion Profit for 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC     Exxon Mobil today posted the highest corporate profit in history  but American consumers continue to struggle to pay higher energy costs   Instead of lining the pockets of big oil  we need a new direction in energy policy that rewards innovation  creates jobs  and reduces our dependence on foreign oil  What I have proposed is that we eliminate oil company tax breaks and use that money to create a Strategic Energy Fund to speed development of biofuels  get more efficient cars on the road  and fund research into cutting edge energy technologies  By taking these steps  we can finally get on the path to energy independence
