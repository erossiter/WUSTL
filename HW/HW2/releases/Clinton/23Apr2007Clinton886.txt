                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Funding Included in Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer and Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler announced today that they have secured  50 million for 9 11 health needs in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  The funding secured by Senators Clinton and Schumer and Reps  Maloney and Nadler will be used to help meet New York s and the country s mounting 9 11 health needs   This funding will not only help in providing treatment to those affected in the New York metro area  but responders from all over the country who are suffering from 9 11 health related issues           As we heard time and time again at the recent Senate hearing into 9 11 health effects  while the problem continues to grow so does the need for funds to give those who lived  worked and volunteered in the Ground Zero and Fresh Kills area the treatment that they so desperately need   This critical funding will address many of the immediate 9 11 health needs and keep treatment programs operating in the near term   However  we still have a long way to go to fully address the needs of those who were exposed to toxins   I will keep fighting until we have the necessary and long term funds in place to prevent these vital programs from having to go cap in hand to government as the money dries up            Many of the brave men and women who worked at Ground Zero in the aftermath of 9 11 continue to suffer from devastating health problems caused by their heroic work   said Senator Schumer   At the very least  the federal government must make sure they receive the best medical treatment and monitoring available  Today  this  50 million is a terrific first step toward fulfilling this obligation and ensuring the services these programs currently offer continue uninterrupted            Again  the New York area delegation had to step forward and get the funds needed because the Administration wouldn t  We continue to need a comprehensive plan to make sure everyone exposed gets medically monitored and everyone who is sick gets treated   said Representative Maloney           This funding is a great victory for the brave heroes and victims of Ground Zero who were unnecessarily exposed to a horrifying mixture of environmental toxins   said Representative Nadler    The money will provide critical immediate help for the key programs struggling to provide ongoing medical monitoring and treatment   However  in order to ensure that Federal government properly pays its debt  we will need to continue to fight for funding on every available front  and ultimately devise a long term  comprehensive solution that is not subject to the vagaries of these annual budgeting battles           Senators Clinton and Schumer  and Representatives Maloney and Nadler have succeeded in making sure New York maintains the funding promised by the Administration in the aftermath of 9 11   Senators Clinton and Schumer worked with members of the New York Congressional delegation to successfully restore  125 million in emergency 9 11 recovery aid that President Bush proposed to take back in his FY06 budget and succeeded in making that funding available for worker s compensation claims and to address the ongoing medical and mental health needs of firefighters  police officers  first responders  workers  and others who worked at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills          The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill now awaits consideration on the Senate floor  which is expected to take place this week  When the bill is approved by Congress and signed into law  the funding secured by the Senators and Representatives will ensure that programs remain open and can expand these needed services              This was a true collaborative effort on the part of the New York delegation and we are grateful for the support of the Appropriations Committee  especially Senator Robert Byrd  Senator Tom Harkin  Senator Arlen Specter and Representatives David Obey and James Walsh   Without their help  the  50 million in this legislation would not have been possible  added Senator Clinton          The Senators and Representatives are working on all fronts to secure additional funding for the next fiscal year and to secure a federal commitment to ensure funding is dedicated to meet 9 11 health needs in the long term               Read more statements by
