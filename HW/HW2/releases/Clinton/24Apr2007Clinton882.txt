April 24  2007 Harkin  Clinton Call on GAO to Investigate Gender Gap in Federal Employment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senators Also Highlight New Report Crystallizing Wage Gap Among Men and Women   Today is Equal Pay Day       Washington  DC   As Americans across the country mark Equal Pay Day  Senators Tom Harkin  D IA   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Edward Kennedy  D MA  called for the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to investigate the role the federal government has and can play to remedy pay inequities in the workplace   Senators Harkin and Clinton will join key national women s organizations on the west lawn of the U S  Capitol today to rally in support of equal pay for women              Despite the progress that has been made  women are still making only 77  of the salaries enjoyed by their male counterparts  women of color fare far worse   There is still a great deal to be done   the Senators wrote to the GAO    It is critical that the laws already on the books be fully and proactively enforced to remedy the wage gaps that persist for men and women performing the same jobs           The Senators asked GAO to investigate whether laws are being enforced to remedy the wage gaps that persist for men and women performing the same jobs   Specifically  Harkin and Clinton asked GAO to look into the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission s  EEOC  and the Department of Labor s  DOL  enforcement of current anti discrimination laws with regard to gender based differentials in pay  They also requested a review  similar to the one GAO recently conducted into pay discrepancies at the Department of Energy which investigated compensation patterns at other federal agencies           Another report  Behind the Pay Gap  released yesterday by the American Association of University Women  AAUW  revealed that women s clear educational achievements have not resulted in equal pay  even when they have the same college major and work in the same field as their male counterparts   It shows that just one year after college graduation  women earn only 80 percent of what their male counterparts earn           Women fall further behind ten years after graduation  earning only 69 percent of what men earn  After controlling for factors known to affect earnings  including education and training  parenthood and hours worked  the AAUW research found that a portion of this pay gap remains unexplained  These findings suggest that sex discrimination not only continues to be a problem in the workplace  but that it affects the earnings of even the most educated women           Earlier this year  Senator Harkin introduced the Fair Pay Act  legislation that would address the historic pattern of undervaluing and underpaying women  Specifically  the bill addresses the reality that men and women are often clustered in different industries and occupations  and requires employers to provide equal pay for work of equal value  whether or not the jobs are identical             The Paycheck Fairness Act  introduced by Senator Clinton  would close critical loopholes under current law  This legislation would take concrete steps forward to empower women to negotiate for equal pay  create better incentives for employers to follow existing law  and strengthen federal outreach and enforcement efforts           The following is the text of the Senators  letter to the GAO calling on the Government Accountability Office to examine the role the federal government can play to remedy the wage gap      April 24  2007      The Honorable David Walker  Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548      Dear Mr  Walker       In the four decades since passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964  the pay gap between men and women has narrowed considerably for numerous reasons  including the law itself  various judicial precedents such as Shultz v  Wheaton Glass and Corning Glass Works v  Brennan  and an evolving consciousness that women make valuable contributions to the workplace   But despite the progress that has been made  women are still making only 77  of the salaries enjoyed by their male counterparts  women of color fare far worse   There is still a great deal to be done          As you pointed out in an October  2003 report  even when accounting for all of the other variables that are often used to justify the pay gap  such as time out of the workforce to care for children or part time work  women still earn significantly less than men   That report concluded that 20  of the wage gap could not be explained by factors other than discrimination   In addition  the impact of these wage disparities is compounded over time  since women receive significantly less than men in pension income          We would like to take a closer look at pay disparity issues and  in particular  at the roles that the federal government has played and can play to remedy the wage gap   While   many in Congress recognize that true equity will demand equalizing the wages paid in traditionally male dominated and traditionally female dominated jobs that require similar qualifications  it is critical that the laws already on the books be fully and proactively enforced to remedy the wage gaps that persist for men and women performing the same jobs          To that end  it would be helpful to Congress to have a better understanding of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission s  EEOC  and the Department of Labor s enforcement of current anti discrimination law with regard to gender based differentials in pay  We would also appreciate a review  similar to the one you recently conducted into pay discrepancies at the Department of Energy  of compensation patterns of at other federal agencies          It would be helpful if the GAO review could include the following                Enforcement activities by the EEOC and the DOL with regard to cases of potential wage discrimination  We would like to learn more about the number of complaints the EEOC and DOL receive  the time it takes to process them  and the action taken to resolve such complaints   We are also interested in compliance reviews initiated by the DOL and commissioner s charges filed by the EEOC to investigate pay disparities   What proactive enforcement steps have been recently initiated by these agencies               Outreach and technical assistance activities by the EEOC and the DOL  In 2000  the previous administration established the Equal Pay Matters Initiative to fund coordination and outreach efforts at DOL and EEOC   The Administration eliminated this program in 2002   Since then  what kinds of efforts have been put forth toward this effort                Treatment of the Equal Opportunity Survey  In 2000  DOL adopted a regulation to require the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs  OFCCP  to distribute an Equal Opportunity Survey to all Federal contractors to obtain compliance data divided by gender on employment and compensation practices   The regulation specified that the data should be used  in part  to inform OFCCP s selection of contractors for compliance reviews  In the 6 years since the regulation s adoption  OFCCP has only distributed the survey one time and to a small percentage of contractors   In addition  the collected data was not analyzed nor was it used for compliance reviews  as required by the regulations of 2000   This survey has now been eliminated   It would be helpful for the GAO to examine the data that was collected to determine if any discrimination occurred                 Federal pay disparities  Recently  the GAO found pay disparities between women and men of two to four percent at several Department of Energy laboratories   In addition  the GAO examined employee complaints and discovered a pattern of complaints about under representation of women and minorities in higher level positions   It would be helpful for the GAO to perform similar reviews at other federal agencies               Disparities between job categories   It is often reported that employers who understand they are not allowed to discriminate within the same job category will still discriminate between job categories within their firms   If it is possible  it would be helpful to obtain better data from some large employers about how job categories that are highly correlated to specific genders compare to one another in house           Sincerely       Tom Harkin  Edward M  Kennedy  Hillary Rodham Clinton
