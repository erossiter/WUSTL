March 6  2007 Senator Clinton  Representative DeLauro Reintroduce Paycheck Fairness Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    As America marks Women s History Month  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Representative Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today announced they are reintroducing legislation in both chambers of Congress to address the continuing pay gap between men and women  The Paycheck Fairness Act would take critical steps to help empower women to negotiate for equal pay  to create strong incentives for employers to obey the laws that are in place and to strengthen federal outreach and enforcement efforts           As we celebrate Women s History Month  it s important that we not only take pride in how far women have come in our lifetime  but also recognize the work we must continue to achieve true pay equity in America  Research still shows that pay discrimination continues to result in women earning less than men for performing the same job   said Senator Clinton                Evening the playing field for women workers is a matter of fairness and with women now providing a significant share of their family s income  it is a family issue   It is hard to believe that it has been almost a decade since I first introduced the Paycheck Fairness bill and the time has come for Congress to strengthen America s equal pay laws and correct practices that undervalue women and minority women workers    said Congresswoman DeLauro           Forty four years after the Equal Pay Act was signed into law  pay discrimination still exists in the workplace  Today  women working full time  year round  still make only 77 cents for every dollar made by a man  As a result  millions of American families lose out because equal pay is still not a reality  According to the National Committee on Pay Equity  working women stand to lose  250 000 over the course of their career because of unequal pay practices   According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data  the wage gap continues to persist even though women posted a greater net increase in jobs paying above the median salary than men from 2000 to 2005   In 2005  the median weekly pay for men was  663 compared to 73 percent of that for women  who earned  486 a week on average            The Paycheck Fairness Act would address this reality by preventing  regulating and reducing pay discrimination for women across the country   The Paycheck Fairness Act would create a training program to help women strengthen their negotiation skills  enforce equal pay laws for federal contractors and require the Department of Labor to work with employers to eliminate pay disparities by enhancing outreach and training efforts   Also  the bill would prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their co workers and allow women to sue for punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages now available under the Equal Pay Act              In addition to sponsoring the Paycheck Fairness Act  Senator Clinton last year co hosted a  Pay Equity for Women  seminar with Stony Brook University that drew hundreds of students as well as leading educators and experts in gender equity business issues  At the seminar  Senator Clinton unveiled a resource guide titled     Know What to Ask   Know Your Rights  A Pay Equity Guide on How to Help Yourself in the Workplace   The guide is an informative tool for young women entering the workforce and can be found on Senator Clinton s web site  here
