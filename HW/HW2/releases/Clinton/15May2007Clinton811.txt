May 15  2007 Senator Clinton Welcomes Announcement that Beechnut Foods to Stay in Montgomery County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed the announcement by Beechnut Foods that they would be expanding their operations in Montgomery County and keeping all 356 jobs locally            This is wonderful news for a community that has really been dealt its fair share of adversity in recent months  I am thrilled that Beechnut has decided to stay in the county despite the terrible damage that they were faced with as a result of the floods  When I visited the factory last year to see the damage firsthand and to meet with the workers  I knew that they were anxious to stay in the area and I was very happy to encourage them to do so  This is a victory for the community  for the State and for the agricultural industry on which Beechnut relies           Senator Clinton toured the flood impacted areas last year and visited with local elected officials and first responders to discuss efforts to commit federal resources to assist in the recovery and cleanup effort
