April 3  2006 Menendez  Clinton Lead Renewed Call For  1 Billion Increase In Port Security Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senators press for 100 percent cargo container inspections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Robert Menendez  NJ  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY   joined by eighteen senators  today called on Congressional leaders to honor last month  s Senate vote to budget  1 billion for increased ports security funding  In a letter to the chairman and ranking Democratic member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Senators Judd Gregg and Robert C  Byrd  the lawmakers pressed for the Senate to keep faith with their pledge to appropriate  1 billion for ports security and also called on the body to move closer to inspecting 100 percent of cargo container            The goal of the United States must be to inspect  using both physical and non invasive methods  100 percent of all cargo containers entering the United States     the lawmakers wrote    Currently  only 5 percent of cargo containers entering the U S  are either physically examined or x rayed               We ask that you target those        funds to increase the number of containers scanned at U S  ports and abroad  increase staff and funding under existing port security programs  increase specific funds for the port security grant program  and to increase research and development of new port security technology     the lawmakers wrote          Menendez and Clinton  s port security amendment  offered and voted down last month along party lines  would have provided  965 million for port security to fund technology capable of scanning containers for weapons of mass destruction  increased the number of inspectors available to physically review containers  helped developing countries scan and inspect containers  and tripled port security grants   During Senate Budget Committee proceedings last month  Republicans voted down a similar Menendez measure along party lines           With passage of Menendez and Clinton  s amendment appearing likely in the full Senate  however  Republicans reversed their position on ports security    contradicting their previous claims that the United States already spends enough money on ports security  Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell  R KY  offered a competing amendment that proposes a similar amount of funding for port security programs  with the notable difference being how the money is allocated  Menendez said even though his measure was unsuccessful  he is pleased that the outcome was the same  the Senate was forced to act and has moved one step closer to making U S  ports safer and more secure            Each day we debate this issue is another day when our ports are not as secure as they could be     Menendez said     The Senate took a major step in endorsing our call for  1 billion for ports security  Now we must ensure the money is actually spent on the programs that would make our country safer and more secure             Senator Clinton added    We must be absolutely vigilant in protecting the security of our ports and that means moving toward 100 percent of cargo adequately inspected   I will continue to fight for the adequate resources for port security needed to do the job right   These additional funds are targeted toward existing vulnerabilities in the current system and underscore that the status quo is unacceptable   Port security is homeland security and homeland security is port security
