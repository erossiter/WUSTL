July 16  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the President s Threat to Veto Bipartisan Agreement to Expand Children s Health Insurance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  There are 8 7 million uninsured children in America  over 300 000 in New York  and our number one priority should be doing everything we can to cover them   President Bush has had six years to take action to cover these children   Not only has he done nothing  but now threatens expansion of SCHIP with a veto   It is one of our most important national priorities to cover all Americans and that should start now with all of our children    SCHIP has been one of the most successful health care programs  with strong bipartisan support   We should build on this success by expanding the SCHIP program and working to cover every child   I have introduced legislation with Congressman John Dingell to cover all uninsured children        Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller worked together with Senators Grassley and Hatch  who have long been strong supporters of this program  to craft this bipartisan agreement to reauthorize and expand the program   It is unconscionable that this President would veto a bill that expands and improves coverage for kids
