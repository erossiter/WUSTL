July 14  2005 Senator Clinton Announces Legislation to Keep Inappropriate Video Games Out of the Hands Of Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Calls On FTC to Investigate Source of Sexually Explicit Content on Grand Theft Auto Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today announced that she will introduce legislation to help keep inappropriate video games out of the hands of children   She also called upon the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to take immediate action to determine the source of graphic pornographic and violent content appearing on the Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas video game   Recent reports have revealed that this graphic content can be unlocked by following instructions widely available on the Internet            The disturbing material in Grand Theft Auto and other games like it is stealing the innocence of our children and it  s making the difficult job of being a parent even harder     said Senator Clinton     I am announcing these measures today because I believe that the ability of our children to access pornographic and outrageously violent material on video games rated for adults is spiraling out of control             Senator Clinton announced that the legislation she will introduce will put some teeth into video game ratings by instituting a financial penalty for retailers who fail to enforce the rules   It will prohibit the sale of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors and put in place a  5000 penalty for those who violate the law         Recent research has confirmed links between exposure to violent video games and aggressive behavior in children and a groundbreaking new study by researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine show that playing violent video games triggers unusual brain activity among aggressive adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders  Senator Clinton noted that this is just the latest piece of evidence that confirms the potentially damaging impact of these games on children   Senator Clinton also noted that the current  industry enforced system is not yet working as it should and is not acting as a deterrent to kids accessing inappropriate video games  underscoring the need for today  s action        In calling for the FTC to launch an investigation  Senator Clinton urged the FTC to determine whether an Adults Only  AO  rating is more appropriate than the current Mature  M  rating for the Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas video game given this new  alarming content   She also requested that the FTC examine the adequacy of retailers   rating enforcement policies         According to research by the National Institute on Media and the Family  games rated M  which means they are appropriate only for people aged 17 or older  are relatively easy for teenagers and even children as young as age 7 to obtain   In the National Institute  s recent study  50 percent of boys between the ages of 7 and 14 successfully purchased M rated video games  and an astonishing 87 percent of boys play M rated games   Furthermore  nearly a quarter of retailers in the study don  t even understand the ratings they are supposed to enforce  and only half of the stores train employees in the use of the ratings            No wonder these games are falling into the hands of our children and no wonder so many parents feel everyday like they are fighting this battle with their hands tied behind their backs     said Senator Clinton     We need to do better   We need to do everything we can to make sure that parents have a line of defense against violent and graphic video games and other content that go against the values they are trying to instill in their children              The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to the FTC           Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairwoman  Federal Trade Commission  Washington  DC          Dear Chairwoman Majoras               Recent reports have revealed that the video game  Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  has graphic pornographic content which may be unlocked by following instructions widely available on the Internet    The Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB  has given this game a Mature  M  rating  which means it is appropriate only for people age17 or older   In all likelihood  this revelation means the game deserves an Adults Only  AO  rating               Alarmingly  it seems that no one yet knows the source of this content  The ESRB is investigating this matter and I am hopeful its investigation will be vigorous and thorough   But the public has a strong interest in learning the answer quickly   We should all be deeply disturbed that a game which now permits the simulation of lewd sexual acts in an interactive format with highly realistic graphics has fallen into the hands of young people across the country  I therefore urge you to take immediate action to determine the source of this content and the appropriateness of the M rating in light of its vast accessibility  and to make your findings public   Parents who rely on the ratings to make decisions to shield their children from influences that they believe could be harmful  should be informed right away if the system is broken   Parents face an uphill battle just understanding the ratings system   They cannot and should not be expected to second guess it                   I also ask that you conduct a careful examination of the adequacy of retailers  rating enforcement policies   According to research conducted by the National Institute on Media and the Family  M games are relatively easy for teenagers and even children as young as 7 to obtain   In the National Institute s recent study  50  of boys between the ages of 7 and 14 successfully purchased M rated video games   Furthermore  only 76  of retailers in the study said they understand the ratings they are supposed to enforce   And only half of the stores train employees in the use of the ratings   The National Institute has determined that 87  of boys play M rated games and 78  list an M rated game among their favorites        As a Senator  I hear from parents all the time about the frustration they feel as they try to pass their own values onto their children in a world where this type of material is readily accessible   There is no doubting the fact that the widespread availability of sexually explicit and graphically violent video games makes the challenge of parenting much harder   I will be exploring legislation to help parents with this challenge when it comes to purchasing video games soon and I hope you will work with me to ensure that the ratings system   the best tool parents have to filter this material   is meaningful       Sincerely          Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
