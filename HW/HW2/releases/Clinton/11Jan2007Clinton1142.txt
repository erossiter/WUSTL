January 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on House Vote on Stem Cell Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today issued the following statement on House approval of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   Senator Clinton is a cosponsor of the legislation in the Senate             Today  s vote brings hope to millions of Americans who could be helped by groundbreaking stem cell research    I will work with my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation quickly  putting us on the path to finally realizing the potential of stem cell research            Despite the enormous promise of stem cell research  the Administration has pursued ideology over innovation and continually restricted federal funding  limiting the ability of our scientists to aggressively pursue avenues that may lead to breakthroughs for many chronic  debilitating  and ultimately fatal diseases   We cannot afford any additional delay in supporting research that has the potential to save millions of lives           Restricting funding for stem cell research also hurts our ability to remain the world  s leader in medical research   It is critical that we increase federal support for stem cell research in order to maintain the ability of our nation  s scientists to remain at the forefront of biomedical innovation and attract and retain top notch scientific talent to its laboratories          I applaud the overwhelming House passage of this legislation and urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto this legislation
