February 15  2007 Senator Clinton Supports Governor Spitzer s Request for Federal Emergency Declaration Following Severe Snow Storms in Upstate New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   In support of Governor Spitzer s request for an emergency declaration for Jefferson  Lewis  Madison  Oneida  Onondaga  and Oswego Counties today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a letter to the President and placed a call to FEMA Director Paulison  urging them to heed the Governor s request and issue the appropriate declaration           The nation has watched with amazement the scenes of a snowstorm that dropped more than 10 feet in Central New York in just a few days   I  like many others  have been monitoring the situation very closely since it began and working closely with Governor Spitzer s office as well as with local leaders  The jurisdictions in the counties affected have done their best to deal with the historic snowfall but clearly they need help from the federal government   I wholeheartedly support the Governor s request for an emergency declaration and I urge FEMA and the President to promptly approve this request   Senator Clinton said        A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below       Dear Mr  President       As you may know  parts of Upstate of New York were recently hit with a severe winter storm that over the course of the past two weeks has dumped record amounts of snow throughout the area   Indeed  in Oswego County which borders Lake Ontario  over 11 feet of snow has fallen in the past 10 days alone            This storm has already caused significant disruption to essential services throughout the county and has imperiled thousands of citizens   While this record snowfall has already prompted Governor Spitzer to declare a State Disaster Emergency for this area  I am concerned that ongoing sever weather conditions could endanger continuing snow removal efforts and cause further strains on the state and local agencies already stressed from the scope and severity of the storm            It is my understanding that Governor Spitzer has made a formal request to you for a federal declaration of emergency for Jefferson  Lewis  Madison  Oneida  Onondaga and Oswego Counties which would thus trigger the critical support from the federal government for emergency services  aid and other relief    By all accounts  the Governor has taken every step to employ to resources of the State to meet this emergency head on including the deployment of the National Guard  the dispatch of essential State personnel to the affected areas and the coordination of all of the relevant state agencies    Nevertheless  a storm of this magnitude and the record snowfall that has accompanied it requires federal assistance for the affected areas to ensure against the loss of life  property and to ensure the provision of essential health and public safety services          The towns and cities in Upstate New York impacted by this record snow storm need this assistance immediately   I therefore urge you to support the Governor s request and declare a state of emergency for the counties outlined by the Governor          Thank you for your attention to this critical matter  and I stand ready to work with you and the appropriate federal agencies to ensure an expeditious and satisfactory response to this emergency            Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton    Cc   The Honorable R  David Paulison  Director  Federal Emergency Management Administration
