August 22  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Calling for Political Change in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  During my last visit to Iraq in January  I expressed my reservations about the ability of the Iraqi government  led by Prime Minister Maliki  to make the tough political decisions necessary for Iraq to resolve its sectarian divisions Since my visit  Iraqi leaders have not met their own political benchmarks to share power  modify the de Ba athification laws  pass an oil law  schedule provincial elections  and amend their constitution During his trip to Iraq last week  Senator Carl Levin  the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee on which I serve  confirmed that the Iraqi Governments failures have reinforced the widely held view that the Maliki government is nonfunctional and cannot produce a political settlement  because it is too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders I share Senator Levins hope that the Iraqi parliament will replace Prime Minister Maliki with a less divisive and more unifying figure when it returns in a few weeks   As I have said many times before  there is not a military solution in Iraq but progress will only come from political reconciliation and compromise from the Iraqis themselves Given that reality  the Presidents escalation strategy is not succeeding   Our military has performed magnificently in Iraq but ultimately the future of Iraq will be decided by the Iraqis themselves Rather than continue an escalation policy that is not fostering political progress in Iraq  we need to send a message to Iraq s leaders that the lack of political progress is unacceptable Our best hope of fostering political progress in Iraq is to begin the immediate withdrawal of U S  troops
