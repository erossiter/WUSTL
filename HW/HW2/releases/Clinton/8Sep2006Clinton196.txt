September 8  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Reported Comments by Former EPA Administrator Whitman                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             New York  NY     This morning  we heard heartbreaking testimony about the price that first responders and many others paid as a result of inhaling the toxic New York air after September 11th   Governor Whitman apparently wants to wash her hands of this tragedy  but her EPA told New Yorkers that the air was safe to breathe   The sad testimony of our first responders and the EPA s own Inspector General say otherwise   We know the air was not safe  and it is time to end that debate and get care to those who need it
