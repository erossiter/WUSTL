August 17  2006 Statement by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Sununu on Announcement of Voluntary Agreement by Auto Manufacturers to Install Brakeshift Locks in New Vehicles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC      Nearly every other day  a child dies in a non traffic vehicle accident  backed over by a driver who couldn  t see behind their vehicle  strangled in a power window or killed when an automobile inadvertently shifts into gear   Today  s announcement is an important step toward preventing tragic deaths that we know are preventable with existing technology at relatively low cost   We have introduced legislation to make brake locks mandatory in all new cars and we are pleased that automakers agree action is needed   However  there is more we need to do to make vehicles safer for kids and we will continue to press for enactment of our legislation  the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act          Every vehicle without backover prevention technology has a blind zone behind it  some as large as 51 feet long according to testing by Consumer Reports   Our bill would require all new cars to have a rearward visibility standard that will help alert drivers to the presence of a child behind a vehicle   In addition  our legislation would require that power windows reverse direction when they detect an obstruction to prevent children from being trapped  injured or killed by vehicle power windows   Our bill would also require that data on non traffic vehicle accidents be collected and would help raise awareness among parents of these dangers through a child safety information program            It is critical that we prevent these tragedies from happening to other families   By taking simple  cost effective  common sense steps we can have safer cars and safer kids across America
