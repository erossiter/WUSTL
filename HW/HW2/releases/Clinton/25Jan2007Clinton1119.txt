January 25  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Pentagon Decision to Extend the Combat Tour of Soldiers from 10th Mountain Division Brigade in Afghanistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The extension of the tour of duty of the 10th Mountain Division s Third Brigade in Afghanistan is obviously going to be disappointing for the families of the Third Brigade soldiers  I spoke to Defense Secretary Gates today about this announcement and he assured me that the Department of Defense will be utilizing all the resources at its disposal to support the families who will have to endure this additional time without their loved ones  However  during my recent trip to Afghanistan  this is something that commanders on the ground reported that they needed  This announcement is another indicator that our Army is stretched too thin and another reason why I have supported increasing the size of the Army
