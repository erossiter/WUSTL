November 16  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Extension                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Today the Senate passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act  and in doing so took a crucial step towards ensuring that our economy can move forward with the confidence in knowing that property and casualty insurance against terrorist attacks remains available and affordable     In addition to the terrible human suffering and the massive loss of life that occurred as a result of the September 11th attacks  the sobering reality was that in addition to its prohibitive cost  the lack of terrorism insurance in the private market created extreme uncertainty in nearly every sector of our economy  Economic recovery  especially in New York City  was contingent on a federal backstop to provide terrorism insurance in order to restore confidence to private insurers  investors  builders  workers  and all stakeholders in our economy     Five years after it was originally enacted  the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has proven to be a resounding success  and I am pleased that the Senate has approved this critical legislation that will extend the program  This bill is important not just to New York  but the entire nation  and I will continue to work toward its final passage and enactment
