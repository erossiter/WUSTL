July 28  2006 In the Wake of Continuing Evidence of the Negative Health Effects of 9 11 on Volunteers  Workers and First Responders  Senator Clinton Calls on Senate and FEMA to Address their Medical and Mental Health Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                 Senator Calls on FEMA to establish a coordinated long term recovery program for future disasters Washington  DC    In the wake of ongoing reports that volunteers and first responders who rushed down to Ground Zero following the 9 11 attacks are suffering from debilitating physical and mental health problems  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on her Senate colleagues  FEMA and other officials to address the medical and mental health needs of victims and first responders to disasters  natural or otherwise   At a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on possible changes to the Robert T  Stafford Act  Senator Clinton expressed her concern for the physical and mental health of the people impacted by these devastating events            Our firefighters  police officers  first responders  workers  and other volunteers who spent days and weeks on the pile at Ground Zero now find that many of those thousands of individuals are suffering debilitating health effects  When the Twin Towers fell in New York City there were thousands of firefighters  police officers  first responders  workers  and other volunteers who stood on the piles that were once buildings to look for any survivors  Thousands of these selfless heroes stayed for days  weeks and months as tons of debris continued to smolder and the air around them was filled with toxins  As a result today    nearly five years after those attacks    I have personally met with many individuals whose health continues to deteriorate   While I have called for and welcomed both the creation of the current World Trade Center Worker Health Monitoring Programs and the efforts of Dr  John Howard  Director of NIOSH  in his capacity as the federal coordinator for 9 11 health  the federal government has no plan to deal with this health crisis for the long term    Senator Clinton said following the hearing             There are so many individuals who can no longer perform their duty as firefighters and police officers because of diseases that have materialized  decrease breathing capacity  and other ailments that have emerged since 9 11  One thing is clear  we must determine what long term medical and mental health needs should be tracked  monitored  and treated after significant natural or manmade disasters  FEMA needs to create a long term recovery entity which can be available to states that are overwhelmed and to ensure that our police officers  firefighters  first responders  workers  or other volunteers whose medical and mental health is impacted in a disaster are not cast aside in the debris pile but rather that they are given the care they deserve     Senator Clinton said           Last year  the Administration proposed rescinding  125 million in aid to New York  Senator Clinton  and her colleagues from the New York Congressional delegation  were successful in getting that funding restored so that it can be used for worker  s compensation claims that have gone unpaid as well as medical and mental health assistance for these firefighters  police officers  first responders  workers  and others who responded in a time of crisis  Senator Clinton has also worked with Senator Voinovich to introduce the Disaster Area Health and Environmental Monitoring Act which would amend the Stafford Act to allow the President to set up monitoring programs in order to protect and track the health of first responders and residents  with a priority on tracking first responders with high degrees of exposure to known toxic substances  The Senator also recently asked the Department of Health and Human Services to appoint the Director of NIOSH  Dr  Howard  to monitor the situation ongoing with Ground Zero first responders  workers  and volunteers            At the hearing  Senator Clinton also raised several other critical issues with respect to the Stafford Act and its ability to deal with disasters  including               Ensuring the adequacy of grants and financial aid given to individuals and small businesses              The President  s ability to preposition assets and declare major disaster areas absent a request from a Governor              FEMA  s ability to manage large scale disasters and getting assistance to individuals in need while avoiding unnecessary waste and asset mismanagement              Eliminating no bid contracting and providing a mechanism for local individuals and companies to receive contracts from FEMA for clean up and rebuilding before large companies are awarded contracts              Appropriate funding levels for mitigation for communities to minimize the impact of certain disasters such as flood map modernization  earthquake proofing buildings  and other measures by coordinating with state and local officials              Coordination problems between state and local governments and FEMA  s existing capabilities  assets  and mission              Mass evacuation plans for New York City and Long Island in the event of a large scale storm or catastrophic event and flooding issues              Flood plain map modernization for areas prone to flooding as a result of severe storms
