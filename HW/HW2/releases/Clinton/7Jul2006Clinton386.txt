July 7  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on The Alleged Terrorist Plot to Bomb New York  s Transportation System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Today  s news that authorities in Lebanon arrested a man in connection with a plot to bomb New York  s transportation system is yet another dreadful reminder that New York remains our nation  s foremost terrorist target   Today  as we mark the tragic one year anniversary of the London transit bombings  we are painfully reminded that the Administration and Department of Homeland Security have not done enough to help our state and local governments provide improved subway  train and bus security            The Department of Homeland Security  s announcement last month that New York and other high threat targets would suffer significant cuts in Homeland Security Grant Program funds is further proof that this Administration has not heeded the many wakeup calls to provide adequate resources to our high threat states and cities   Next week  when the Senate considers the Homeland Security Appropriations bill  I along with others will introduce an amendment to restore some of these funds   As today  s news demonstrates  this is not the time to abandon our state and local governments facing the greatest terrorist threat as they struggle to protect our citizens
