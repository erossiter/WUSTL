October 12  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Closure in the Holocaust Survivors  Gold Train Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   I am pleased the United States issued a statement of regret to all Hungarian Holocaust survivors   While nothing can heal the wounds suffered by many of these survivors  I am grateful and relieved that our government is providing long overdue redress and care to these aging men and women          Over the last year and a half  I urged the Administration to act on this pressing issue  making contacts with then Attorney General John Ashcroft and  then  White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez calling for resolution of the matter with survivors   Additionally  I joined with Senator Arlen Specter and 15 other Senators in sending a letter to Attorney General Ashcroft to ask for immediate action on the   Gold Train    case  amid reports that officials at the United States Department of Justice were   dragging their feet    in resolving this matter   We fought to achieve the resolution deserved by the survivors who were literally dying as their case languished          Today marks the end of the half a century of silence and cover up in the Gold Train case and provides ailing and infirm Hungarian Holocaust survivors with the resolution they deserve   Finally  Hungarian Holocaust survivors have some measure of justice to account for the suffering they endured
