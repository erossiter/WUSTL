                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Clinton to Join in Introducing Legislation to Provide College Students with needed Federal Student Aid Rebate  Committed to Working to Restore Bush Administration Cuts to Critical Higher Education Programs and Funding Formula                                                                                                                                                                                Buffalo  NY    At a press conference today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with leaders from Princeton Review in announcing a new public private partnership that will give Buffalo s young people an academic edge in today s increasingly competitive world  Through a partnership created by Clinton s office with Princeton Review  State Senator Byron Brown  and the Buffalo Public Schools  Princeton Review has agreed to lower the cost of its ACT SAT trainings from over  1 000 to  350 for any Buffalo Public School student who would like to take the class  Additionally  Princeton Review has committed to set up a scholarship fund to cover the full cost for students who cannot afford the reduced rate          This is an important and inspiring example of how private sector companies can make an enormous contribution in helping our most disadvantaged students prepare for college and a brighter future   Senator Clinton said   We need more efforts like this one because as we all know  college is becoming less and less affordable          As federal financial aid has failed to keep up with the rising costs of tuition  initiatives such as this one are more important than ever  For families in the lowest income quartile  average public university costs now consume 62 percent of their income    compared to 42 percent in the early 1970 s        Unfortunately  these increased costs have been accompanied by the Bush Administration s proposed cuts to critical higher education programs that hundreds of thousands of students depend on each school year  In particular  the administration has implemented changes to the student financial aid funding formula that will prevent approximately 90 000 students from receiving Pell Grants  and will lower the grant award for thousands more         At the press conference  Clinton reiterated her commitment to restoring funds to programs critical to many potential college students and announced that she will be joining Senator Jon S  Corzine  D NJ  in introducing legislation that will force the U S  Department of Education to give every student who will lose aid under the Administration s formula change  a rebate on the aid he or she is due          The global marketplace is becoming increasingly competitive and unforgiving  If we are going to thrive as a nation  we must ensure that our young men and women have the tools they need to compete   Clinton said   This legislation is critical for New York because students here are faced with higher college costs to begin with and more students come to New York to attend our exceptional colleges and universities          A Government Accountability Office investigation estimates that under the Bush Administration s formula change  67  of New York students will have to pay more for college  On average  each student will lose an additional  639 annually in student financial aid  In New York  45  of students will experience a decrease in their Pell Grants         According to the American Council of Education  the new calculations would disqualify 89 000 low income students from the Pell Grant  An additional 1 3 million    including 95 000 in New York    would see a reduction in their student aid        Furthermore  the Administration has proposed harmful changes to programs such as TRIO and the Perkins loan program    both of which are depended on by well over 100 000 New York college students each year  Under the Perkins loan program  which the Administration has proposed eliminating all together  New York State disburses  8 6 million in loans each year  Without these funds hundreds of thousands of New York students would be losing out on a critical funding source for their futures         If the TRIO cuts proposed by the Administration are not restored  New York will lose  3 million in funding  More importantly  2 000 young people will lose the hope of a college education and the opportunity that education brings        Clinton is leading the charge with many of her colleagues in the New York Congressional delegation who have TRIO programs in their districts to protest these cuts  They have called on the Department of Education to conduct an external review of the New York applications and make sure they are aware that New York students are disproportionately going to suffer if these applications are not given a second look         At a time when families are struggling to send their children to college  the federal government should be doing all it can to support this investment  The United States has a long and proud tradition of investing in its children  and it is this tradition that has made us the leading nation in the world  To reverse that practice will hurt our young people  and will seriously weaken our standing and competitiveness in the global marketplace   Clinton said
