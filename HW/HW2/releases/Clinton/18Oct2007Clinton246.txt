October 18  2007 Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Submitted to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing on Lead and Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I would like to thank Chairman Boxer for convening today s hearing on lead poisoning  a problem which still impacts far too many children in the United States and countries around the world  This is an especially timely hearing  as next week is National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week  and I hope todays hearing will contribute to the discussions next week    We have made enormous strides in reducing exposure to lead since its use was phased out in gasoline and residential paint more than twenty years ago  From 1976 to 1994  we reduced the number of children from age 1 5 with elevated blood lead levels from more than 75 percent of the population to slightly over 4 percent of the population  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   And we continue to make progress  In my state  for example  Rochester and New York City are just two of the local areas that have innovative programs to reduce elevated blood lead levels in children  However  the CDC estimates that there are still hundreds of thousands of children under the age of five are at risk of lead poisoning     Many of these children are at risk due to existing lead based paint in their homes   Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still over 24 million housing units in the United States that have lead paint hazards  with nearly 1 2 million units in New York State alone   Current Federal lead abatement programs only have resources sufficient to make approximately 8 800 homes lead safe each year   We must do more to reduce these hazards   I have introduced legislation that would help to make over 80 000 homes safe from lead each year  almost 10 times the capacity of current Federal programs   My Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2007 offers much needed incentives for property owners to remediate and abate lead based hazards  ensuring homes are free of environmental dangers that can harm our children     However  in recent months  we have become all too aware of the threat of lead poisoning from other sources  Wave after wave of recent recalls has shown the dangers that exist from lead used in toys  a danger that has not been adequately addressed by the understaffed Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   the agency designated with ensuring the safety of the products used by American consumers   Hundreds of thousands of children have been needlessly exposed to lead contaminated products  and I have written to both President Bush and Acting CPSC Commissioner Nancy Nord urging them to undertake the reforms necessary to strengthen this agency    I believe we can and should be doing more to protect children from lead poisoning  In today s hearing  the need for increased coordination and cooperation between federal agencies was evident  I will soon introduce legislation that will improve coordination of federal agencies not only around reduction of lead exposures  but overall children s health protection  It will also provide funding to help carry out innovative interagency interventions at the local level  so that our housing  environmental  and public health experts can work together effectively to protect our children and families  Furthermore  this bill will take steps to ensure the abatement of lead based paint hazards when homes are rehabilitated    Our governments Healthy People 2010 Objectives includes the goal of eliminating elevated blood lead levels in children  The Environmental Protection Agencys Strategic Plan for 2006 2011 also sets the goal of eliminating elevated blood lead levels in American children by 2010  But if we keep along our current path  we will not attain those goals  We must increase our commitment at our federal agencies to address this issue  provide our state and local governments the tools to mobilize the multiple stakeholders involved in lead abatement and poisoning prevention  and increase our efforts to educate families about ways to protect their children from lead exposure     I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to reduce exposure to lead hazards and protect our children from lead poisoning
