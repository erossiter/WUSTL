

                 Washington  DCSenators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill signed into law by the President on Wednesday includes funding for projects in New York City  including the Second Avenue Subway and funding for renovations of North General Hospitals emergency department     I m pleased that the Senate has approved this vital funding for New York s infrastructure  community outreach programs  hospitals  educational programs and environment  Schumer said  Because of this investment  New Yorkers can look forward to improved transportation services  better health care  increased job training and cleaner natural environments that will not only strengthen the local economy  but ensure that all New Yorkers enjoy an improved quality of life    These funds are a wise investment in the future of New York City  and will greatly benefit the citys people  economy and infrastructure  said Senator Clinton  I am especially pleased that funding for the Second Avenue Subway has been included  This kind of federal investment is critical to helping keep the project on track  and it is a priority for a city that is in desperate need of another subway line on the East Side  The funding that was approved for North General Hospital will allow this vital medical center to continue to meet the growing demand for their services    The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has concluded that the Lexington Avenue  4 5 6  subway line is at capacity and that no additional trains can run on that line  With only one subway line serving the East Side  the Lexington Avenue line is the most overcrowded subway in the country  carrying 600 000 people each day  The federal funding for the Second Avenue Subway will go toward the new line which will significantly ease congestion on the Lexington Avenue line and provide approximately 400 000 rides per day      670 085 in funds will be used to expand and renovate the North General Hospitals Emergency Department to improve staff function  patient observation and security  as well as enhance the physical environment while minimizing service disruption  The plan calls for four additional treatment rooms  four additional asthma stations  one additional isolation room  pediatric emergency department treatment and waiting areas  the relocation of the psychiatry holding treatment area and the associated renovation of the Ambulatory Care medical  surgical and pediatric subspecialty areas    The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes
