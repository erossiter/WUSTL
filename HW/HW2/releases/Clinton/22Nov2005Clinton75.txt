November 22  2005 Clinton  Nadler and World Trade Center Expert Technical Panelists Press for Final Indoor Testing Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Letter to EPA Outlines Principles That Plan Should Incorporate and Asks for Meeting With EPA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    In response to what they see as slowing progress in the efforts to determine the extent of remaining indoor contamination following the September 11th attacks  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Jerrold Nadler wrote a letter to U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  Administrator Stephen Johnson to call for more action and to convene a meeting to develop a consensus plan   Clinton and Nadler were joined on the letter by four members of the World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel    WTC Panel      as well as the panel s community and labor liaisons             The primary task of the WTC Panel is to help the EPA to design a testing plan to determine the extent of existing indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center   The plan has been under development for 20 months by EPA and the WTC Panel            The letter notes that the WTC Panel has met only three times this year  and that progress has slowed in recent months   The letter also notes that a revised plan is needed because a  signature  that the EPA planned to use in the testing program to identify World Trade Center contamination was found by an EPA peer review panel to be insufficiently developed to be used as intended           This has gone on long enough  I am calling on the EPA to meet with panelists  community representatives  and my office to finalize a testing plan that we can all support   said Senator Clinton    We need to get this done before the next panel meeting          If the EPA wants to demonstrate that it is truly committed to a proper testing and cleanup plan  its next step must be to meet immediately with concerned parties to hammer out a scientifically sound and acceptable proposal   said Congressman Jerrold Nadler        The Bush Administration committed to the creation of the WTC Panel in October of 2003  in response to Senator Clinton s call to address remaining health concerns about indoor air quality resulting from the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center   These concerns followed an August  2003 report by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  Inspector General that criticized the EPA s response to the September 11th attacks           The full text of the letter follows          November 21  2005         The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  United States Environmental Protection Agency  Ariel Rios Building   1101A  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  D C   20460         Dear Mr  Johnson        For the last 20 months  the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has worked in conjunction with the World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel  WTC Panel  as well as community and labor representatives to develop a plan to determine the extent of remaining indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center   EPA  the panel members  and community and labor participants have all invested considerable time and energy in this process          Substantial progress has been made since the first WTC Panel meeting in March of 2004   However in recent months  development of the plan has drifted   Only two WTC Panel meetings have been held since February 2005  and the last meeting took place more than four months ago in July   We are dismayed by this lack of EPA focus at the most critical time in the development of the plan   It is critical that we refocus now to finalize and implement an appropriate plan        Until recently  the plan centered on the use of a WTC dust signature   EPA  s recent peer review of the WTC signature concluded that the signature concept had not been sufficiently developed to be used as intended   Given this development  the challenge before EPA and the WTC Panel is to develop a revised plan   We strongly believe that a new plan can and must be developed quickly  and should incorporate the following principles         The plan should recognize and be designed within the financial resources that EPA has available to implement Phase 1 of the sampling plan        The plan should include residential  commercial  and work places in expanded geographic areas  which has been supported by EPA in previous drafts         The plan should offer clean up for exceedances of benchmarks that have been developed for Contaminants of Potential Concern  COPC  as an incentive for participation in the program        The plan should provide for the continued development of a WTC signature  taking into consideration the recommendations of the peer reviewers without using the signature as a basis for clean up        We strongly believe that the hard work of the last 20 months provides a strong foundation of knowledge and ideas that can be drawn on to quickly develop a revised plan that is based on these principles and resolves outstanding methodological issues   As previously requested  we urge the agency to work with us to convene a working group to develop a revised plan in advance of the next WTC panel meeting   Developing a consensus plan in this manner would enable the next WTC panel meeting to focus on implementation rather than design          We ask for your immediate attention to this important matter  and continue to stand ready to work with EPA on this important and reachable goal
