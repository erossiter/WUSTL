August 16  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Detention of Iranian Americans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This week marked the 100th day of detention for Iranian American scholars Dr  Haleh Esfandiari  head of the Middle East Progam at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars  and development consultant Dr  Kian Tajbakhsh  They have been imprisoned in Tehran since May  Two other Iranian Americans are also being unjustly targeted  journalist Parnaz Azima cannot leave the country and Ali Shakeri  founder and board member of the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding  is being detained in a clear violation of human rights  These four individuals have sought to increase understanding between the Iranian people and the international community  and their continued detention is a blight upon the Iranian regime       It is unconscionable that Dr  Esfandiari  a grandmother who was in Iran to visit her ailing mother  has been detained for more than three months on baseless charges  and that Dr  Tajbakhsh and Mr  Shakeri are also being detained without just cause  Dr  Tajbakhsh  who received his doctorate in urban planning from Columbia University and was a sociology professor at The New School for Social Research  had worked on various projectsincluding helping the Iranian people after a devastating earthquakewith the full knowledge of the Iranian government  In addition  Ms  Azima is being prevented from leaving the country  after coming to Iran to visit her elderly and ill mother  The four Iranian Americans must be allowed without delay to return to their families and homes     I call upon the Iranian government to release Dr  Esfandiari  Ms Azima  Dr  Tajbakhsh  and Mr  Shakeri without delay  and I urge the Bush Administration to make their release a priority for our government  I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to draw attention to the plight of these individuals  and ensure that they are released unharmed
