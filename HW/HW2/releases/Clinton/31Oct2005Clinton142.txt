October 31  2005 Senator Clinton Announces Legislation to Protect Children in and Around Vehicles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Clinton Joins Congressman King  Long Island Parents Who Have Lost Children and Child Safety Advocates to Underscore Need to Improve Vehicle Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Garden City  NY    Following testimonials from parents who have lost children in tragic accidents that could be prevented with existing car safety technology  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she is introducing bipartisan legislation with Senator John Sununu  R NH  to improve the child safety features in new vehicles   She was joined by leadership of Consumers Union  who demonstrated the large blind zone behind vehicles that contributes to many of these horrific incidents  and Kids And Cars  an organization dedicated to improving the safety of children in and around parked vehicles   She was also joined by Representative Peter King  NY   who has introduced companion legislation in the U S  House of Representatives            These tragedies are heart wrenching  not only due to the unimaginable suffering these families endure  but also because they are preventable   The technology exists that can save children  s lives at relatively low cost and new innovations are being developed all the time   With modest  cost effective steps  we can prevent scores of terrible automobile accidents from occurring across our nation   That  s why I am introducing legislation to make sure child safety technology is implemented in new vehicles   With my bill  we can have safer cars and safer kids across America     said Senator Clinton             Even though the technology exists to protect families and children  the technology is not required to be installed  We have an obligation to resolve this as soon as possible  It is common sense   said Representative King        Almost every other day  a young child is killed in a non traffic automobile accident   Since 1999  almost 1000 children have died in non traffic  non crash incidents and this number has been steadily rising   According to Kids And Cars  this is already the deadliest year   As of October 15  2005  there have been 188 fatalities   New York State alone has suffered over 60 non traffic incidents  15 of which resulted in fatality   The technology exists to protect families and children from these tragedies  but currently neither Congress nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires the technology be installed   Such technology is only available on a select few vehicles  or as an after market product consumers have to purchase themselves        Senator Clinton  s bill  the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act of 2005  addresses issues surrounding vehicles and child safety  such as children being backed over  strangled by power windows or killed when they or someone else inadvertently knocks a vehicle into motion   The bill directs the U S  Secretary of Transportation to issue three regulations to decrease the incidence of child injury and death  The first regulation will ensure that power windows automatically reverse direction when they detect an obstruction to prevent children from being trapped  injured or killed   A second will provide drivers with a means of detecting the presence of a person or object behind their vehicle   And a third will provide for the vehicle service brake to be engaged to prevent vehicles from unintentionally rolling away   The bill also establishes a child safety information program administered by the Secretary of Transportation to collect non traffic  non crash incident data and disseminate information to parents about these hazards and ways to mitigate them             I commend Senator Clinton for introducing this lifesaving bill   Our children are being killed by preventable tragedies in unprecedented numbers     said Janette Fennell  Founder of Kids And Cars    We have recorded a dramatic spike in the number of children being killed and injured in non traffic events this year   Congress needs to end these unthinkable deaths   There is absolutely nothing worse than the death of a child  except when you are a parent who learns afterwards technology existed that would have prevented this nightmare from happening  All the parents I know would move Heaven and Earth to prevent the injury or death of their child               These tragedies have happened to too many families and will continue to happen at an alarming rate if something isn  t done   As a pediatrician and a father who lost a child  I can  t tell you how important it is to get these life saving technologies into all vehicles     said Dr  Greg Gulbransen of Long Island            How many more kids have to die before something is done  It shocked me when I realized that you rarely leave a car dealership without such standard devices as cruise control and cup holders  yet devices that will save countless children  s lives are not standard equipment     said Jamie Schaefer Wilson  a Westchester mother and child safety advocate             The time to act is now before another parent has to go through the agony that these parents have been forced to endure  These are preventable deaths   The technology is available that can prevent these tragedies  We urge auto makers and the federal government to address this critical public safety issue   said David Champion  senior director of automotive testing for Consumers Union  the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine          The technology exists that can save children  s lives at relatively low cost and new innovations are being developed all the time   Power window sensors  for example  cost only  8 12 a window   Brakeshift interlocks are already standard in most passenger vehicles  but where they aren  t  they cost only  5 a car   Backover warning systems cost a bit more in today  s market  approximately  300 a car  but if these or similar technologies were required  the market would create even more competition and drive down the price
