May 5  2006 Senator Clinton Announces Millions for Defense Projects to Benefit The Southern Tier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Funding for New York included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee      Bill also includes provisions to address continuing pay problems for wounded soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized millions in Defense projects that will benefit the Southern Tier including  3 million for SUNY Binghamton  s Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing Center    The bill also included an additional  112 million to purchase eight additional MH 60S Helicopters and  28 million to purchase one additional MH  60R Helicopter  both of which have Lockheed Martin Owego as the prime contractor for their   common cockpit     The bill also included authorization for full funding of  682 million from the President  s Budget for Lockheed Martin Owego  s VH 71A Project          The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2007 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill yesterday   The passage of the bill marks the first stage in the Department of Defense appropriations process  Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor before heading into the appropriations process  The House of Representatives passed their version of the bill Wednesday            This bill is important not only for our potential military capabilities  but for New York  s economy  In addition to enabling our soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines to have the best training  the best equipment and the best facilities in the world  it makes a number of significant investments in local technology and local companies  which is always welcome     Senator Clinton said    New York companies are already developing the cutting edge technology that will take our military into the future  I am pleased that we can continue to support them and the local economy with these kinds of meaningful investments              Senator Clinton announced that the bill contained a number of highlights for New York  including            The preservation of over  200 million in funding military construction projects for New York which were included in the President  s Budget and which Senator Clinton fought hard to maintain           The preservation of funding for the VH 71A Presidential Helicopter Program  Lockheed Martin Owego is the prime contractor on the program  and          The inclusion of a provision  which Senator Clinton proposed  to name the new laboratory building at the Air Force Research Site in Rome  NY in honor of retiring Rep  Sherwood L  Boehlert  R New Hartford    Rep  John M  McHugh  R Pierrepont Manor  also secured a companion amendment in House defense authorization legislation              During his distinguished Congressional career  Sherry Boehlert has been the foremost champion in Congress of the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome   With his impending retirement from Congress  it is only fitting that we name the new laboratory building after Congressman Boehlert     said Senator Clinton          The bill also included two important amendments that Senator Clinton sponsored to force the Department of the Army to address serious concerns regarding pay issues of wounded soldiers and to analyze troop readiness          In a continuing effort to ensure that those who have given so much are not further burdened with resolving pay account issues  Senator Clinton  s wounded soldier pay audit amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a toll free call assistance center focused on providing wounded members of the Armed Forces  or their primary next of kin  with help relating to military pay issues   The Senator  s amendment also requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers   pay accounts and report back to Congress in 120 days   As recently as April 26  2006  a Government Accountability Office report found that nearly 1 300 battle injured soldiers and soldiers  killed in combat in the first 4 years of the Global War on Terror  had incurred a total of  1 5 million in debt   Press reports have also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness   totaling more than  600 000   on the basis that the debt was wrongly charged  This is just the latest in a series of actions taken by Senator Clinton on this significant issue as the treatment of wounded soldiers remains one of her top priorities   In the past  she has called on Congress to hold hearings  written to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army to investigate specific cases  and called for reviews of the broader problems with the pay process  particularly as it applies to those wounded in a combat zone            I am deeply troubled  as I think we all should be  about continuing reports of soldiers who have been withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues and have experienced payroll problems or have been wrongly charged for certain services or equipment   It is simply unacceptable that we should be billing our soldiers for debts wrongly incurred or exacerbated by bureaucratic pay and personnel systems     Senator Clinton said     We must do everything in our power to avoid placing wounded soldiers in the position of having to resolve payroll problems or to request debt forgiveness  These warriors are recovering from the injuries they sustained while they were fighting for our country and they should not have to deal with this kind of additional burden             Senator Clinton  s amendment addressing our military  s readiness is part of a continuing effort to study the current state of our ground forces and better highlight where Congress should focus its efforts to ensure the continued preparedness of our Army and Marine Corps            I am concerned about the strain on the ground forces of our Nation  s military and their ability to continue at the current pace in Iraq  Afghanistan  and other theaters of operation   We must continue to focus on recruiting and retaining our forces  training and equipping them in a manner that ensures they are able to meet today  s challenges and future requirements     Senator Clinton said            Local funding details include        3 million for SUNY Binghamton    Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing Center      The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  3 million in funding for the SUNY Binghamton Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing  CAMM    Over time  federal funding will allow the center to become an engine for economic growth and innovation in the Southern Tier by spurring the creation of high tech regional companies to partner with the center and by driving the creation of a significant number of new jobs   National debate is focusing on the United State  s ability to retain its technological edge and competitive manufacturing presence in an increasingly industrial global society            Microelectronics science and engineering represent a strategic area where investments made now can enhance U S  military and homeland security superiority  while strengthening our nation  s role as a global leader   The CAMM will address fundamental enabling technologies and sciences associated with the development of electronic products on flexible substrates    low cost  mass produced ubiquitous electronics   The expected result is conformable  rugged  lightweight electronic components and innovative products for commercial  consumer and military markets    The CAMM is a national microelectronics manufacturing R center established at Binghamton University in 2005   Founding partners include Endicott Interconnect Technologies  Inc   Cornell University and USDC  with support from the Army Research Lab  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  and New York State        28 million for one additional MH 60R Helicopter    Lockheed Martin    Owego is prime contractor for the   common cockpit         The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  28 million in funding for the Navy to purchase an additional MH  60R Helicopter   The MH 60R Multi Mission Helicopter Program will meet the increased war fighting needs of the tactical aircraft operating in the littoral environment  The MH 60R will be the fleet  s primary anti submarine and anti surface warfare platform  replacing aging aircrafts  The MH 60R will incorporate new sensors including Advanced Low Frequency Sonar  ALFS   Multi Mode Radar with Inverse Synthetic Aperture mode for target classification  improved Electronic Support Measures  and an Integrated Self Defense suite  A new cockpit with increased capabilities is also incorporated   The MH 60R is a key element to the success of the Navy  s Helo Master Plan  which is projected to save hundreds of millions of dollars in ownership costs   The MH 60R aircraft successfully completed Operational Evaluation in September 2005   Lockheed Martin    Owego is the prime contractor for the common cockpit for this program          112 million for eight additional MH 60S Helicopters    Lockheed Martin Owego is prime contractor for the   common cockpit         The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  112 million in funding to purchase eight additional MH 60S helicopters   The MH 60S helicopter is a multi mission platform the Navy will use to replace the HH 60H Seahawk helicopters  The MH 60S will provide future expeditionary strike group commanders with robust capability in the areas of organic combat search and rescue  maritime interdiction operations  surface warfare and carrier plane guard SAR  Lockheed Martin Owego is the prime contractor for the common cockpit for this program             682 million from the President  s Budget for Lockheed Martin Owego  s VH 71A Project  The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes the full presidential request of  682 6M for the Marine One Helicopter   Today  s security environment requires urgent upgrades to the presidential fleets security and defensive systems  The current VH 3D presidential helicopter fleet has been in service for thirty plus years and is now at the end of its useful life  and also has insufficient payload capacity that will not allow the installation of additional communication and defensive equipment  In late January 2005  the U S  Navy selected Lockheed Martin to build the new Marine One helicopter fleet  This program partners with numerous small and medium sized American companies statewide that creates and sustains thousands of jobs  The US101    VXX helicopter is technologically advanced with integrated avionics  navigation  communications  updated security systems and capable of operation in all weather conditions  It will provide an oval office in the sky with a larger cabin and low vibration to allow the President and the traveling staff to work in transit  The President will be transported in a proven  safe  secure  state of the art helicopter built to military specifications
