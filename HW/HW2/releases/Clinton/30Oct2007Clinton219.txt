October 30  2007 With the North Country and the Adirondacks Ripe for Economic Development  Schumer  Clinton Announce Bill to Promote Job Growth  Tourism  and Cross Border Commerce to Upstate NY Border Communities                                                                                                                                                                                                              Currently  Counties Across the North Country and Adirondacks are in Need of New Jobs and an Influx of Investment to Spur Local Economic Growth   Schumer  Clinton Announce Bill that Would Bring  40 Million per year for Four Years in Targeted Federal Grants to Northeast Border Communities from Maine to New York   Comprehensive  Regional Approach Would Bring Federal Resources and Expertise to Upstate Communities but Give Oversight for Economic Development to Local Authorities  Washington  DC   With Upstate New York counties dotting the states northern border ready for economic development  today  U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced new efforts to fuel economic growth across the region  The Senators are pushing the Northern Border Economic Development Act of 2007 which will bring economic grants and programs to targeted border communities across Upstate New York  The Senators stressed that while the bill will inject the region with federal grants to promote job growth  tourism and cross border commerce  it also gives local authorities oversight to manage the investment funds      The goal of the commission is to address economic distressed areas along the Northern Border  The following counties in Upstate NY are considered primary counties and will benefit under the bill  Cayuga  Clinton  Franklin  Jefferson  Oswego and St  Lawrence  Continuous counties that will also receive grants due to their close proximity to border counties are Essex  Hamilton  Herkimer  Lewis  Oneida and Seneca counties     New York States border communities have historically played a vital role in the Empire State into a national economic juggernaut and its essentially that we take every action to make sure they remain financially healthy and offer local citizens good paying jobs  said Senator Schumer  The bill provides targeted aid to border communities  giving local authorities on the ground the power to decide the best way to ignite economic growth across the region    I am proud to be a part of this important effort to promote economic development throughout the New Yorks border region  said Senator Clinton  I have seen how organizations such as the Appalachian Regional Commission have helped to develop initiatives in rural areas that have been the catalyst for growth and progress  and I look forward to seeing this key piece of legislation set the groundwork to assist the region in fulfilling its potential    In counties along the Northern border from Maine through New York  that are covered under the commission  13 1  of the population lives in poverty  median household income is  7 500 below the national average  unemployment is significantly higher than the national average   The population in this belt has actually decreased by 0 9  between 1990 and 2000  while the U S  population rose by 13 2    The region shares many common economic challenges stemming from relative geographic isolation  aging infrastructure  and a loss of natural resource based industry that has historically been an economic engine   However  the region also has a common set of assets  as well as historical and geographic ties with Canadian businesses and trading partners      Despite a national trend toward the creation of independent entities focused on regional economic development  i e   the Appalachian Regional Commission which has existed for 40 years  the Denali Commission  Delta Regional Authority  and Northern Great Plains Regional Authority   and despite comparative economic statistics that show equal or greater  need  in the Northern border in relation to other existing or proposed Commission areas  there is currently no single regional economic development entity focused on the needs of the Northeast border region    The Northern Border Economic Development Commission would invest in economically distressed communities   It would create and implement regional economic development plans to reduce poverty  address changing land use  and improve the quality of life for residents   The Commission would provide funding for projects that stimulate economic development and promote the historic character  sustainable development  and industries of the region  It would add to  but not supplant  existing institutions and programs such as the Economic Development Administration  the U S  Forest Service  state agencies  and local development organizations      Schumer and Clinton announced that key aspect of the Commission is that it is designed to give local authorities the lions share of power to decide how to utilize the financial grants to spur local development     The Commission utilizes the successful Appalachian Regional Commission model that facilitates a bottom up approach where local development districts  non profit organizations  and others bring project ideas and priorities to the Commission from the local level   This model helps foster improved collaboration and coordination within a sub state region and among federal and state agencies  while also serving as a vehicle to leverage additional public and private sector investments   Ultimately  this approach ensures that actions reflect both local needs and regional economic development and sustainability goals     The Commission will fund projects that both strengthen traditional sectors in the regions economy and lead to a more diversified economy   By taking a regional view  the Commission can promote projects that confer a broader benefit without states having to compete among themselves for scarce funds for the Northeast  The Commission would be an independent agency   It will not be subject to another Federal agencys mission requirements or shared goals with the rest of the country only a mandate to promote projects that truly benefit the Northeast border region     The Commission will be comprised of one Federal representative and the designee of the governors of the participating states  This structure requires the approval of both the federal representative and the governors  resulting in a joint policy making model  instead of a one way directive from Washington or an untargeted block grant structure   The program is designed to bring federal resources  expertise and oversight to the table  with states maintaining firm control of economic planning for their states    The Commission will be comprised of up to four state members  the governors or their designees from New York  Vermont  New Hampshire and Maine  and a Federal member   The Commission will take the following actions
