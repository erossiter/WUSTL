December 17  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton On Senate Vote to Extend The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC      I am extremely pleased that the Senate has taken action to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance program   The House is expected to vote soon on this critical extension and I urge the President  s quick approval of this legislation   Extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act  TRIA  is an issue of national economic security that has been one of my top priorities         Following the attacks of September 11th  nearly every sector of our economy faced extreme uncertainty   in New York and nationwide   Nearly  15 billion in real estate transactions and over 300 000 construction jobs were put on hold simply because there was no private market mechanism to provide insurance against future terrorist attacks   It goes without saying that this uncertainty had a profound impact on New York City  s economy         Fortunately  Congress and the Administration had the wisdom to enact TRIA and provide the stability and security for our economy   Indeed this step gave investors  insurers  developers and workers the economic confidence needed to ensure the continued stability of one of the most critical sectors of our economy         The renewal of the TRIA program will help ensure that this vital safety net for our economy is in place for New York and the entire country
