                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bill Now Goes to the President for Signature   Amendments Require Bush Administration to Develop Plan to Ease Congestion in NY NJ Philly Airspace                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  New Jersey  New York and Pennsylvanias U S  Senators announced today that the full Congress has approved two measures they authored to reduce flight delays and ease congestion in the New York New Jersey airspace as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill  One amendment would require the federal government to provide a plan to Congress to reduce flight delays in the New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Region  the nations most densely congested airspace  The other amendment requires the investigative arm of Congress  the Government Accountability Office  to investigate the Administrations Airspace Redesign Plan  as well as the effectiveness of a variety of approaches used nationwide to reduce flight delays    The Senators called for action after record airport delays this summer and amid major concerns that the Federal Aviation Administrations announced Airspace Redesign for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia area will increase aircraft noise while providing only minimal delay reductions    Having been approved by both chambers of Congress  the bill will now go before the House for final passage before being sent the President for signature    Even with the FAA thankfully becoming much more active on this issue recently  we need the type of detailed  well researched information these reports will produce regarding the best ways to cut down the excruciating delays  said Senator Menendez  Until delays have actually been minimized  we cannot stop searching for answers  I will also be eager to see the results of an independent review of the airspace redesign scheduled to be implemented this week  which promises to turn up the noise level for New Jersey residents but might only have a marginal effect on delays    We need real solutions to give travelers relief from the constant flight delays and cancellations that plague our region  said Senator Lautenberg   Our aviation system is a mess and the Bush Administrations proposed fixes continue to fall short   The Administrations plans would raise fares  create more aircraft noise in more neighborhoods and could even worsen delays   Our sensible legislation is a needed reality check to improve air travel in our region and nationwide    In light of todays announcement by Secretary Peters  it has become clear that the Bush Administration must be forced to take action to resolve the worsening problems in our skies   While American travelers face chronic delays  excessive noise  and dangerously overcrowded skies  the Administrations solution will increase costs  congestion  and frustration   This measure will require the FAA to provide a real plan to deal with this problem  said Senator Clinton    These amendments are an important step toward forcing the administration to take a long  hard look at the chaos in our skies  and to produce real recommendations to ensure that our congested aviation system receives some real relief  said Senator Schumer   Chronic flight delays in this region have serious economic and social consequences  and I am pleased my colleagues have adopted this provision aimed at addressing the congestion  Senator Specter said  I look forward to reviewing the Department of Transportations findings and intentions to tackle this problem      I am pleased that this legislation will force the Bush Administration to take a hard look at regional congestion problems   Anyone who has visited the Philadelphia International Airport knows that delays are a fact of life for air travelers   It doesnt need to be this way  and I will continue to support efforts to reduce flight delays in a responsible and reasonable way  said Senator Casey    Details of the FAA Plan amendment    Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to Congress a report detailing how the Federal Aviation Administration plans to alleviate air congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace by August 31  2008  The report would have to be submitted no later than 120 days after the enactment of the legislation    Details of the GAO amendment   The measure directs the GAO to conduct a study of the efficacy of various approaches used in the past by the FAA and the DOT to address delays at our nation s airports  Within 120 days of enactment  the GAO is to report which strategies have worked best to comprehensively reduce flight delays at an airport within 6 months or less  Specifically  the GAO is instructed to examine efforts by the FAA to induce voluntary schedule reductions at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  the FAA s mandatory flight reduction operations at LaGuardia International Airport and Reagan National Airport  the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area Airspace Redesign and any other significant efforts by the FAA or the DOT to reduce flight delays at a major U S  international airport
