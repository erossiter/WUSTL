January 24  2006 Clinton and Dingell Announce Legislation to Rescind Republican Giveaway to Insurance Companies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Representative John Dingell  MI  announced they will introduce legislation in both chambers of Congress if the Republican Congress passes and President Bush signs into law a giveaway to insurance companies inserted by Republicans behind closed doors into the budget reconciliation bill   The Clinton Dingell bill would roll back a Republican measure preserving a loophole in Medicare payment policy that allows insurance companies to receive excess payments from Medicare   The Clinton Dingell bill will also eliminate a slush fund for insurance companies in the law that created the Medicare prescription drug benefit            This Republican effort to protect a windfall for insurance companies came as Republicans in Congress drastically cut Medicaid benefits and took away medically necessary care for children and seniors to offset their budget   Clinton and Dingell announced that their bill will use the funding that would have gone to insurance companies to restore funding to children s health care and Medicaid cut by the Republican budget                       Republicans in Congress are cutting Medicaid for children and seniors so they can protect huge giveaways to insurance companies   This is just the latest example of Republicans in Congress taking care of special interests at the expense of the American people   We have to stop the Republican culture of corruption that is poisoning our legislative process and we have to make our health care system more accountable   We are going to stop this giveaway     said Senator Clinton             There are nearly 46 million uninsured in our nation  yet the Republican Congress is poised to pass legislation that would add more to that number  particularly vulnerable children and people with disabilities  in order to protect the insurance industry s ability to profit at the expense of Medicare  Once again  Republicans are moving forward with legislation that benefits a favored industry to the detriment of ordinary Americans   said Representative Dingell           The measure  included by the Republican only conference committee that reconciled the House and Senate budget reconciliation bills  allows insurance companies to game Medicare payments   This loophole had been eliminated in the Senate version of the bill but the Republican conference committee secretly struck the good government provision that would have kept insurance companies from bilking Medicare inappropriately  The Medicare Payment Advisory Committee  the independent group tasked by Congress to oversee and report on Medicare payments has called for the elimination of these excessive payments  calling them duplicative and excessive              In addition  the Republican conference committee struck a provision that would have eliminated a slush fund for insurance companies included in the law that created the Medicare prescription drug program   The slush fund provides  10 billion over 10 years to encourage participation in the Medicare program by insurance companies called Preferred Provider Organizations    The Senate version of the budget reconciliation bill would have eliminated this slush fund  but Republicans saved it in conference  again preserving an unnecessary windfall for insurance companies at a time when Republicans were slashing the health care safety net for our most vulnerable Americans   The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission also criticized this giveaway  calling it unnecessary and unwarranted
