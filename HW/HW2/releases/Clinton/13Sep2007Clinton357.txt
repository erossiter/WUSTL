September 13  2007 Senators Clinton  Boxer Call on GAO to Investigate EPA s Children s Health Activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barbara Boxer today called on the Government Accountability Office to investigate allegations of repeated failures by the Environmental Protection Agency to adequately protect childrens health  In a letter to Comptroller General of the United States  David Walker  the Senators asked the GAO to investigate the agencys apparent neglect of its childrens health obligations  including the adequacy of its response to key findings and recommendations of independent scientists and experts serving on EPAs Childrens Health Protection Advisory Committee  The Senators also asked for a review of EPA actions that apparently downplay the role of childrens health protection in agency decision making  Senator Boxer is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  and Senator Clinton chairs the EPW Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health    In their letter  the Senators point out that in 1997  the Environmental Protection Agency established the Office of Children s Health Protection to strengthen agency protections of children s health from environmental threats  However  in an April 2007 letter to EPA  the advisory committee stated  we are concerned that the focus on childrens environmental health at EPA has diminished  and cited cases in which EPA has not followed through on its initiatives to protect children  including a failure to implement guidelines to protect children from cancer    Environmental pollutants often have a disproportionate impact on children  leaving them even more vulnerable to respiratory and other ailments  We need to ensure that our efforts to protect the environment take into account just how vulnerable children can be to things like smog  fumes  pesticides and other pollutants  Senator Clinton said  The EPA needs to take more action to protect and prioritize childrens health and strengthen health and environmental standards    EPA is supposed to play a vital role in protecting children from harmful chemicals in their environment  said Senator Boxer   I am deeply concerned that the agency is not doing its job  and I am looking forward to working with Senator Clinton to hold EPAs feet to the fire    Senator Clinton has long been active in efforts to protect childrens health   During her time in the Senate  she has introduced the Family Asthma Act and the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act to help decrease exposures to the environmental pollutants linked to childhood illness  As Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committees Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  she recently convened the first ever Senate Hearing on Environmental Justice and is committed to improving the EPAs ability to protect populations at a disproportionate risk for adverse health impacts from environmental hazards    Senator Boxer has made protecting children one of her highest priorities throughout her career   Senator Boxer authored and led the effort to pass the Vulnerable Subpopulations amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act  requiring that EPA drinking water standards consider the health effects of contaminants on children and other vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and the elderly   Senator Boxer is a long time supporter of legislation which would protect children from the harmful effects of environmental pollutants      A copy of the letter sent to Mr  Walker follows    September 13  2007   The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C  20548   Dear Mr  Walker    In 1997  the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  established the Office of Children s Health Protection  OCHP  to support and facilitate agency activities with the goal of protecting children s health from environmental threats   The Children s Health Protection Advisory Committee  CHPAC  is the Federal Advisory Committee designed to provide recommendations to the OCHP as they work to ensure that children s health protection is incorporated into the agency s goals   CHPAC members come from industry  government  academia  and nonprofit backgrounds   These physicians  economists  scientists  and other experts are well qualified to help guide the development of policies related to children s health protection     EPAs Office of Childrens Health Protection was established to    In an April 2007 letter to EPA  CHPAC stated EPA has not maintained its focus on children s issues and has not capitalized on the opportunity to effectively tackle a number of significant existing and emerging environmental challenges    For example  CHPAC is concerned that EPA has not adequately addressed various key recommendations that the advisory committee has made to EPA  such as taking actions to strengthen health and environmental standards for air quality   CHPAC also has identified several critical areas for renewed leadership by EPA  in collaboration with other agencies  including recommending that they    The EPA Inspector General also raised concerns about EPAs lack of action in addressing its goal of protecting childrens health   In its 2004 report  the IG recommended that the Acting Deputy Administrator    Due to the wide range of concerns expressed by CHPAC  the Inspector General and others  we request that you investigate the following issues    We believe that EPA should do more to help the Office of Childrens Health Protection achieve its goal of protecting children s health    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton     Barbara Boxer
