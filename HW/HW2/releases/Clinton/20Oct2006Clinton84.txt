October 20  2006 Senator Clinton Calls on VA to Delay Removal of Psych Beds at Canandaigua                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Urges VA to Delay the Announced Removal of the Beds Until the Final Plan for the Hospital is Completed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Department of Veterans   Affairs  VA  to delay closing the acute psychiatric unit at the Canandaigua VA Hospital until the final plan for the hospital is completed  The decision to close the acute psychiatric unit was made in 2004 as part of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  decision but recent news reports indicate that the closure of the unit could happen as soon as November 30th            I was pleased when the Department of Veterans   Affairs announced its recent decision to keep the Canandaigua VA facility open and on the Canandaigua campus    where it belongs  But there are still too many unanswered questions for the VA to be moving forward so quickly and closing these psych beds  The VA has still not released its final plan for the facility and I think it is only fair that we see the final plans before any beds are removed     Senator Clinton said          In September  Senator Clinton wrote to the Department of Veterans Affairs  asking for an update on the planning for the Canandaigua VA because nothing had been done in over a year  Senator Clinton welcomed the VA  s recent announcement about the future of Canandaigua as a positive step  but expressed her concerns that as the CARES process moves forward in the months ahead  the VA must engage fully with the local community to understand the needs and concerns of veterans         A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is below       October 20  2006    The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington   D C  20420    Dear Mr  Secretary         I write with great interest regarding the future of the acute psychiatric unit at the Canandaigua Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC    According to recent news reports  the VA will close the Center  s acute psychiatric unit by moving the eight remaining inpatient psychiatric beds away from Canandaigua by November 30  2006   Yet  this decision will be made before the completion of the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  decision process for the Canandaigua VA site   With a final plan for the Canandaigua VAMC still pending  it is premature to remove the inpatient psychiatric beds from Canandaigua   Therefore  I urge you to delay any decision on the acute inpatient psychiatric beds at Canandaigua until a final  comprehensive CARES decision regarding the facility has been made          In coming to such a comprehensive final decision on the future of the Canandaigua VAMC  I am hopeful that you will take into account its designation as a   center of excellence    for mental health research   Providing central New York veterans with access to world class mental health care is one of Canandaigua  s critical capabilities  and it is becoming increasingly important as more service members return from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems           Further  while I welcome the announcement earlier this month that the Canandaigua VAMC will continue to provide services on the current campus  I believe that the VA needs to re commit to fully engaging local veterans and community leaders before finalizing the plan for the facility             Given the absence of a completed plan for Canandaigua  I urge you to delay any decision regarding the acute inpatient psychiatric beds at Canandaigua until a final  complete decision is made on the future of the facility   I look forward to continuing to work with you on this and other important issues that impact veterans in New York and around this Nation who are depending on us to keep the commitment we have made to them               Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours             Hillary Rodham Clinton
