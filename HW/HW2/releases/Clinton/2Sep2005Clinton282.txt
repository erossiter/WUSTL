                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Underscores Commitment to Fighting for Veterans and Our Men and Women in Uniform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Syracuse  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today met with Syracuse veterans   As the first New York Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  one of Senator Clinton  s top priorities is to uphold our nation  s commitment to provide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to do their jobs and to honor our obligation to support our nation  s veterans          We are free because of the work and sacrifice of all Americans who have served in the Armed Forces and we must remember that the job of securing and protecting freedom continues   Today  Americans in uniform are standing guard over us  fighting for our way of life and promoting democracy and freedom   We owe it to them to stand by their side as they perform their duties  and when they return home to civilian life    I pledge to continue to work to support the health and well being of all our veterans and to fight to ensure that our troops and our veterans get the resources and support they need     Senator Clinton said          In the world of the veterans we spend much of our time and efforts trying to find elected officials who will listen about our needs and problems and try to get them to do something about them  With Senator Clinton we have found both     said Dave Holihan  Director of the Onondaga County Veterans     She set up a meeting with veterans to listen to their issues without our request and we are grateful   She has shown her support as recently as this week by her successful efforts for our National Guard and Reserve units with her defense of our State in the battles with the BRAC representatives   The veterans of today and the veterans of tomorrow both appreciate her efforts            We would like to thank Senator Clinton for her continued support of Veterans Affairs and  particularly  for her concern for the Veterans of Central New York   said Mike LaNasa  a local veteran        Senator Clinton has fought for the health care benefits our veterans need and deserve  to provide guaranteed funding for VA health care to make sure it is adequately funded and to keep open VA hospitals in Canandaigua and across the state   Senator Clinton was proud to accept the  Unsung Hero  of the 108th Congress award from The American Legion for helping lead the way in securing a record increase in funding for veteran s health care for fiscal year 2004         Senator Clinton also has been an advocate of state veteran  s homes and for keeping in place per diem payments to enhance the quality of care and quality of life for veterans living in the homes   She has worked to ensure retirement pay for disabled veterans and led efforts to commemorate the sacrifices of our veterans  including co sponsoring legislation to support National Purple Heart Recognition Day and to grant a Federal Charter to the Korean War Veterans Association                A fact sheet with additional information on Senator Clinton  s work on behalf our nation  s veterans and men and women in uniform is attached    SENATOR CLINTON FIGHTING FOR OUR VETERANS AND OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM   VA Health Care       Senator Clinton believes there is no more important way of honoring our veterans than to ensure they receive quality health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs  Senator Clinton was proud to accept the  Unsung Hero  of the 108th Congress award from The American Legion for helping lead the way in securing a record increase in funding for veteran s health care for fiscal year 2004   Senator Clinton has also voted to dramatically increase the amount of funding budgeted for veterans   health care for fiscal year 2006   She is working on a variety of ways to maintain  enhance  and guarantee an adequate level of health care funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs   fighting to keep New York VA hospitals open  to provide more funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs  and to help guarantee VA health care funding          Reserve and Guard Benefits    We are all proud of the magnificent performance of our military and our Guard and Reserve who have played a major role in the success of our efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan  not to mention the incredible work they ve performed on Homeland Security missions   In July  Senator Clinton was proud to accept the Reserve Officers Association  s President  s Award for her support on issues affecting the Guard and Reserve   Senator Clinton has joined with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  and a bipartisan group of senators  to back legislation that would allow greatly improved access to the military family health insurance program known as TRICARE for members of the National Guard and Reserves who have been called up for active duty status   The Senate recently unanimously passed a Clinton Graham measure to expand access to healthcare benefits for members of the National Guard and Reserve   The expansion  which passed as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill pending in the Senate  extends TRICARE to all drilling members of the Guard and Reserve regardless of whether they are on active duty or not  Reservists would be required to pay modest monthly premiums   In October 2004  Senators Graham and Clinton co sponsored legislation that was part of the approved Department of Defense Authorization bill  which provided an extension of one additional year of TRICARE eligibility to Guard and Reserve members for every 90 days the Reservist or Guardsman serves  This expanded eligibility program went into effect in April 2005  These efforts build upon legislation introduced by Senator Clinton and Senator Graham known as the National Guard and Reserves Reform Act for the 21st Century          Armed Forces Medical Readiness and Tracking    With American troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere  we need to make sure that our men and women in uniform get the best possible health care  Senator Clinton has joined with Senator James Talent of Missouri to set out a comprehensive approach to tracking the health of our soldiers before and after an overseas deployment so that we have adequate information if medical problems develop   The Medical Readiness and Tracking Act of 2004 is designed to address two issues that are critically important to our men and women in uniform  First  it develops better policies and information in order to track the health of soldiers before and after a deployment overseas  Second  it takes steps to improve the medical and dental readiness of our National Guard members and Reservists   A version of the Clinton Talent legislation was included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Department of Defense authorization bill that was signed into law by President Bush             Korean War Veterans       Senator Clinton has paid tribute in her Senate work to the importance of the Korean War   sometimes known as the Forgotten War   and has paid tribute to the contributions of our Korean War veterans   In 2001  she was designated a Commemoration Partner of the Department of Defense  s 50th Anniversary of the Korean War Commemoration Committee   As a commemoration partner  she joined with the Department of Defense and other partners to honor Korean War veterans during a special 50th anniversary commemoration period that ran through 2003   As part of that effort  in the fall of 2003  Senator Clinton proudly co hosted with the Department of Defense a moving commemoration event for New York  s Korean War veterans in Syracuse  New York   She is a co sponsor of a bipartisan bill that would grant a Federal Charter to the Korean War Veterans Association   She also introduced the Korean War Veterans Recognition Act in the 108th Congress and plans to reintroduce it in the 109th Congress  The legislation would include National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day among the days when Americans should make a special effort to display the American flag             Purple Heart    American troops bravely serving their nation in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere are making sacrifices on our behalf  and follow in the long line of courageous service by previous generations of Americans who risked or gave their lives for the freedom we all enjoy today   Senator Clinton has worked hard in the Senate to honor recipients of the Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit   She joined with Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska    a Purple Heart Recipient    in introducing S  Con  Res  39  a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Purple Heart Recognition Day   This resolution passed the Senate on July 28th   The Senators  legislation encourages all Americans to learn about the history of the Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit and to honor its recipients  The legislation also requests that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to conduct appropriate ceremonies  activities and programs to demonstrate support for people who have been awarded the Purple Heart   In July 2004  the Senate passed legislation sponsored by Senators Clinton and Hagel that supports the goals and ideals of  National Purple Heart Recognition Day  in honoring the American veterans who have earned the military tribute by virtue of their bravery and sacrifice  Senator Clinton also cosponsored legislation  S  Con  Res  56  during the 107th Congress expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued to honor members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Purple Heart  Senator Clinton wrote to the U S  Postmaster General urging support for a commemorative stamp to pay tribute to the Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit  And in May 2003  Senator Clinton attended the ceremony to launch the first issue of the Purple Heart Stamp in Newburgh  NY          Concurrent Receipt       As it stands now  the law deals a blow of injustice to our disabled veterans by not allowing them to receive the retirement benefits to which they are entitled   Senator Clinton is a proud co sponsor of the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2005   This bipartisan bill would provide fair retirement benefits to America s disabled veterans by helping to fix a more than a century old law that prevents disabled veterans from receiving both retirement pay and disability pay at the same time   Building on hard won improvements to the original law that have been enacted in recent years  the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2005 would immediately end the prohibition on concurrent receipt for many more disabled veterans   Senator Clinton will continue to work hard with her colleagues to implement concurrent receipt  because that is what our veterans have earned
