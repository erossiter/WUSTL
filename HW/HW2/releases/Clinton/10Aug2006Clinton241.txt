August 10  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Reported Terrorist Plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton made the following remarks this morning at the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce Legislative Breakfast in Staten Island  NY  regarding the reported terrorist plot       Click here for an audio recording         We  re just learning the details  but thank God  what looks like a very diabolical plot that could have been even bigger in terms of the impact  than the tragedy that we suffered on 9 11  has been disrupted by British authorities   And we appreciate the swift action by the British  because the plot centered on airlines flying between Britain and the United States  which obviously means between Heathrow and JFK  between Heathrow and Newark  And without a doubt we have learned  once again  how important it is that we remain vigilant  that we work closely with our friends and allies and like minded civilized people around the world  because as we approach the fifth anniversary of 9 11  we can breathe a collective sigh of relief that we haven  t been attacked again  but we cannot  in any way  relax our guard   There is some evidence that this plot may have been directed by al Qaeda and Bin Laden  who in his periodic video and audio tapes  not only puts forth his perverted philosophy  but we believe sends messages to people either directly or indirectly under his authority or influence and a few months ago there was such a point made in one of his audio tapes about more airlines being attacked            Now many of the people who put their lives on the line for our country were from Staten Island   Staten Island has a well deserved reputation for providing this city with some of the finest firefighters and police officers  and EMS  and paramedics  in the entire world   The extraordinary rescue mission that they undertook on September 11th saved tens of thousands of lives   And in the course of it  we know that many of them lost their lives  others suffered debilitating injuries   some are still suffering from the exposures that they experienced from the collapse of the buildings  and from the burning of the pile  and even from the work they did at Fresh Kills           Today  s events underscore once again the need for threat based funding of homeland security   We have to have the best  most humanly possible system of security   in our airports  in our transit systems  in our ports  in our borders   and we  re still working to make that happen   So  this is to me  yet another wake up call as to why New York   our airports  our transit systems  our ferries  our ports  our bridges  our tunnels    why we need the help that I and the rest of our Congressional Delegation have been seeking for the last five years   We  ll learn more about this disrupted attack in the hours and days ahead  but let no one let down their guard  and let no one feel some sense of accomplishment   we still have a lot of work to do
