May 4  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the United Nations Working Group III Report on Climate Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Today s report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change only underscores that it s time to get to work tackling global warming   The IPCC reports released earlier this year make clear that global warming is already happening and that if we do not take steps to address it  we are likely to see increased droughts and floods  more intense hurricanes  changes in agricultural systems  increased coastal flooding due to sea level rise  and human health impacts ranging from more widespread hunger in the developing world to more deaths from heat waves in North America  Today s report shows that we have the technologies to reduce global warming pollution  such as greater efficiency  clean coal technologies that capture and store carbon dioxide  renewable energy sources  and improved agricultural practices   That s why I have proposed a  50 billion Strategic Energy Fund to speed deployment of these technologies  and why I have cosponsored the  Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act   which would establish a market based framework to ensure cost effective emissions reductions in the coming decades
