November 30  2006 Clinton Calls for Chertoff to Explain Mistakes in DHS Funding Decisions Leading to Cuts in New York  s Homeland Security Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Call Comes in Light of Chertoff  s Admission that there was   A Little Too Much Bean Counting    and Not Enough   Common Sense                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    In light of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  s admission that mistakes were made by his department in distributing Homeland Security Grant Programs  HSGP  funds to New York for Fiscal Year 2006  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for him to explain the errors that were made by the Department in its funding allocations and inform the Congress what procedures DHS plans to implement to ensure that similar mistakes are not repeated in the future            Secretary Chertoff  s acknowledgement that the Department of Homeland Security erred in its disbursement of our limited homeland security funds confirms what many of us have said for months    that DHS  s decision to drastically slash threat based funding for some of our highest risk cities demonstrates a complete lack of understanding for the unique security threats faced by our most vulnerable cities     said Clinton     As I have said repeatedly  DHS needs to ensure that our limited homeland security funds get to where they are needed most and that our American cities and states living under the greatest threat receive the funding they need to protect themselves from harm   My hope is that the lesson learned by DHS    while too late for this year    will not be forgotten when next year  s funding decisions are made   For that reason  I renewed my call on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to hold hearings at the earliest possible date to thoroughly examine the errors that were made by the Department in its funding allocations   The American people deserve more than a cursory acknowledgement that mistakes were made   Congress needs to be informed what procedures DHS plans to implement to ensure that similar mistakes are not repeated in the future             This summer  Senator Clinton and Rep  Pete King pressed Secretary Cherotff to justify the massive cuts to homeland security funding for New York despite the fact that no state has been more affected by terrorism or is a greater target of terrorist attack  Read more       The full text of Senator Clinton  s letter follows          November 29  2006      The Honorable Susan Collins  Chair  Committee on Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security  United States Senate  SD 340  Washington  DC  20510      The Honorable Joseph Lieberman  Ranking Member  Committee on Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security  United States Senate  SH 604  Washington  DC  20510      Dear Chairwoman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman       The Department of Homeland Security should ensure that our limited homeland security funds get to where they are needed most   American cities and states living under the greatest threat should receive the funding they need to protect themselves from harm   For this reason  I was joined by several elected officials from across the country in decrying the Department of Homeland Security  s funding allocations under the Fiscal Year 2006 Homeland Security Grant Programs  HSGP    Among other things  I was disturbed to learn that the Department had decided that New York should receive more than  106 5 million less in HSGP funds than it did the previous year   As you know  funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  alone was cut in New York City by more than 40 percent and in Buffalo by 48 5 percent   Additionally  the Administration slashed funding for other high risk areas as well  incredibly  Washington  DC  s total funding was cut by 43 percent   At the time  we pressed Secretary Chertoff to explain DHS  s rationale for these substantial cuts   The justifications we received were unsatisfactory            Earlier this week  Secretary Chertoff  s acknowledged that the Department of Homeland Security erred in its disbursement of these crucial homeland security funds  confirming what many of us have said for months    that DHS  s decision to drastically slash threat based funding for some of our highest risk cities demonstrates a complete lack of understanding for the unique security threats faced by our most vulnerable cities          In light of the Secretary  s admission that mistakes were made in distributing our Fiscal Year 2006 HSGP funds  I renew my call on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to hold hearings at the earliest possible date to thoroughly examine the errors that were made by the Department in its funding allocations   The American people deserve more than a cursory acknowledgement that mistakes were made   Congress needs to be informed what procedures DHS plans to implement to ensure that similar mistakes are not repeated in the future          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
