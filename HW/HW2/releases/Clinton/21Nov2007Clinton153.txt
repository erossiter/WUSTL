November 21  2007 Senator Clinton Fights for Buffalo Communities in FEMA Flood Plain Map Redrawing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 FEMA s Changes to Flood Plain Map Shift Burden to Thousands of Property Owners in Buffalo s Old First Ward  Cobblestone District  Inner Harbor  and Waterfront Village   Clinton  FEMA Must Consider Concerns of Erie County Residents and Local Officials Before Moving Forward                                                                                                                         Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is again pushing the Federal Emergency Management Agencys  FEMA  to reexamine their preliminary changes to the Buffalo flood plain maps  which once again may force thousands of Erie County residents to pay hundreds of dollars a year in unnecessary flood insurance  In a letter sent today to FEMA Administrator R  David Paulison  Senator Clinton expressed her concerns that the agency has simply shifted the map to expand the 100 year flood plain to areas in Buffalos Old First Ward  Cobblestone District  Inner Harbor  and Waterfront Village    While it is encouraging that FEMA has resolved the issues with the flood plain maps for Cazenovia Creek  it would seem that they are simply shifting the burden to the Old First Ward and other communities along the Buffalo River  said Senator Clinton  If FEMA is going to mandate that homeowners pay for flood coverage  they must ensure that any decisions made are based on an accurate assessment of the actual risks faced by these communities  I strongly urge FEMA to consider the concerns of Erie County officials and residents before any final decisions are made which would place an undue financial burden on the areas homeowners    In July  Senator Clinton called on FEMA Administrator Paulison to update their floodplain data for the Cazenovia Creek area to present a more accurate picture of the geographical area and its risk for flood  The Senator also said she would be making the modernization of flood maps a priority as measures to reform the National Flood Insurance Program  NFIP  are debated in Congress      A copy of the letter to Administrator Paulison follows     November 21  2007   The Honorable R  David Paulison  Administrator  Federal Emergency Management Agency  United States Department of Homeland Security  500 C Street  S W   Washington  D C  20472    Dear Mr  Paulison    I am writing to express my very strong concern regarding the Federal Emergency Management Agencys  FEMA  preliminary changes to the Buffalo flood plain maps   Once again  the proposal will severely impact thousands of Erie County residents who may be unnecessarily forced to pay hundreds of dollars each year for flood insurance   While I support FEMAs efforts to ensure that homeowners in high risk areas will have proper coverage in the event of a natural disaster  such a mandate requires an accurate assessment of the risks faced by the communities   It is not clear if these preliminary changes to the Buffalo maps meet that burden     I am encouraged that FEMA took my concerns and those of the residents of Cazenovia Creek seriously  resulting in a revised map with an approximately 90  reduction in flood plain size for South Buffalo   However it appears that FEMA has simply shifted the map to expand the 100 year flood plain in Buffalos Old First Ward  Cobblestone District  Inner Harbor  and Waterfront Village   These concerns must be addressed in an open and deliberative process   As this is the first major redrawing of Buffalos flood plain maps since 1999  it is critically important during this time that FEMA keep an open line of communication with the legislators  community leaders  and residents who are most impacted by this plan     I look forward to working with FEMA to resolve this issue  and I would also like to be updated as the process moves forward as to what steps FEMA is taking to ensure that residents that reside in low risk areas or areas that may have been designated as flood plain areas using outdated information are not being unduly burdened by a flood insurance mandate   During this period of public comment I strongly urge you to take into serious consideration the concerns raised by the residents of Erie County who would be most affected by this recent flood plain redesign      Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
