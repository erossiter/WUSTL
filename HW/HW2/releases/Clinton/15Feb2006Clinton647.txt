                Washington  DC    At yesterday  s Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton pressed Secretary of the Army Francis Harvey on the issues of providing enhanced body armor to our troops  and on continuing financial problems experienced by our wounded troops   This follows a letter Senator Clinton sent to Secretary Harvey last week urging to him to act to address the financial issues wounded troops are facing             At the hearing  Senator Clinton questioned Army officials on delays in providing improved body armor to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan   to watch Senator Clinton  s questioning of the Army Secretary on body armor  click here  http   www clinton senate gov audio clinton021406p1 rm          And Senator Clinton also continued her campaign to hold the Army accountable for financial problems experienced by wounded soldiers   to watch Senator Clinton  s questioning of the Army Secretary on continuing financial

Financial Services Committee   Congressman Richard Baker  Chairman of the House Capital Markets Subcommittee  Senator Clinton and Senator Daniel Akaka of the Senate Armed Services Committee and other Members of Congress  will announce a new  multi million dollar initiative to deliver financial education tools and training to United States military servicemembers and their spouses    Joining them will be David S C  Chu  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and SEC Commissioner Cynthia Glassman   The initiative comes in the wake of a number of high profile cases in which servicemembers were taken advantage of when making financial decisions   It is being paid for by fines assessed by NASD against a brokerage firm involved in one of those cases           In response to press reports saying that had more extensive body armor been supplied to our troops in Iraq  lives of US troops could have been saved  Senator Clinton last month called for a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing to investigate these reports  a GAO  Government Accountability Office  investigation to focus on how the Pentagon  s procurement decisions were made for this equipment  and for the Army to make every effort to provide additional body armor in the most expeditious manner possible to our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 250317              And in response to press reports last month revealing that the body armor reimbursement program may not be reaching all servicemembers eligible to apply  Senator Clinton called for the Inspector General of the US Department of Defense to investigate this program  http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 250881                  Below is the text of the letter Senator Clinton sent to Army Secretary Harvey              February 9  2006          The Honorable Francis J  Harvey  Secretary  Department of the Army  The Pentagon  Washington  D C   20310       Dear Mr  Secretary           I write to follow up on my earlier inquiries regarding wounded soldier pay issues   A recent television news report indicates that  according to the Army  s own figures  more than 5 500 soldiers withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues have later experienced payroll problems   A recent article reports that the Army required a soldier who had received serious shrapnel wounds in Iraq to pay  700 to cover the cost of his body armor that had been removed as he was being medically evacuated   This comes on top of a news report in October 2005 that the Army had found more than 330 soldiers who were wounded and then faced with military debt  and the Army had begun the process of forgiving debts claimed from 99 of these soldiers  A press report has also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness  totaling more than  600 000  in cases in which the request was made on the basis that the debt has been wrongly charged            As you know  I have focused on the pay problems of wounded soldiers on the Senate Armed Services Committee   As you may recall  I worked with the Army to resolve pay issues for one of my constituents  Specialist Robert Loria   Soon after these issues were resolved  I wrote to you in order to raise several concerns about wounded soldier pay issues that might affect SPC Loria but went beyond his case as well   I also raised the issue during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing at which Vice Chief of Staff General Richard Cody testified   In response  General Cody wrote to me in February 2005 informing me that the Army had identified 129 wounded soldiers who had been billed in error and whose debts would be forgiven  and had established an audit team to recommend solutions            Just prior to a March 2005 committee hearing at which you testified  I also received a letter from Army Deputy Chief of Staff G 1 Lieutenant General F  L  Hagenbeck   His letter informed me that the Army was coordinating with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service  DFAS  on corporate changes needed to protect wounded soldiers from payroll problems  that DFAS had established a team to systematize the process of gathering wounded soldiers   information in a central location  and that DFAS intended to provide oversight of support finance office decisions at DFAS Indianapolis           When you testified in March 2005 before the committee  I asked you for more information                           I asked whether the figure of 129 soldiers reflected soldiers at Fort Hood  or more broadly throughout the Army              I asked whether the Army planned to audit the treatment of all wounded soldiers to determine whether they had experienced pay problems              I asked the Army to provide the committee with the status of all audits of pay problems of wounded soldiers and an update on all soldiers identified as having such problems          At the March hearing  you said you hoped that when you testified next year  we would not have heard of any problems for several months   In a subsequent Army briefing  my staff was told that no other problems were identified             Therefore  the recent press report that more than 5 500 soldiers withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues have later experienced payroll issues is troubling  as is the reported number of instances of wounded soldiers experiencing pay problems and meriting debt forgiveness   I am certain you agree the Army should make a special effort to avoid placing wounded soldiers in the position of having to resolve payroll problems or to request debt forgiveness  and that it is essential there be no delay in implementing lessons learned           Based on these reports  I would like an expedited briefing which would focus on                        how many wounded soldiers have been affected by these pay problems to date                 what safeguards are now in place to prevent the Army from mistakenly overpaying wounded soldiers and from wrongfully claiming debts                 what oversight is being conducted of the debt forgiveness process to ensure fair results for wounded soldiers are reached   what assistance currently is being provided to wounded soldiers in making these requests                 what benchmarks have been established to measure progress in correcting the pay problems  and what ongoing review the Army is conducting of its efforts to improve the system           I would also like to know what steps we in the Senate can take this year to aid the Army in its effort to better serve the payroll needs of its wounded soldiers           I know that the Army cares deeply about its soldiers and would like to make sure that wounded and disabled soldiers do not face bureaucratic complications after they have given so much on behalf of our Nation           I look forward to your prompt response               Sincerely yours           Hillary Rodham Clinton
