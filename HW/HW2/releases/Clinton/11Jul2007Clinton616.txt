July 11  2007 Clinton Calls on Senate Leaders to Implement Country of Origin Labeling as Food Safety Scares Continue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Senator Says Recent Food Import Scares and FDA Ban on Chinese Fish Imports Mean Country of Origin Labeling Must be Mandated Immediately                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  In the wake of recent scares about imported food and feed products  and the Food and Drug Administrations  FDA  alert concerning imports of certain seafood from China  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on her Senate colleagues to implement Country of Origin Labeling  COOL  as soon as possible    Funding for the full implementation of COOL has been delayed multiple times in recent Republican Congresses  despite its capacity to ensure greater consumer confidence and increase food safety protocol in America  The 2002 Farm Bill mandated a County of Origin labeling effort but to date  the program has only been put in place for seafood   Consideration of the 2007 Farm Bill is set to take place in Congress soon    The recent scares about food and feed products from overseas make Country of Origin labels more important than ever  Congress mandated that we impose County of Origin Labeling over five years ago  It is about time we had a system in place that allows consumers to know exactly where their food and produce is coming from and helps our local farmers promote their own home grown products  Senator Clinton said  Country of Origin Labeling makes sense from both a food safety and an economic perspective and consumers like it  It should be implemented immediately in the same way for meats  fruits  vegetables and peanuts as the 2002 Farm Bill intended    Senator Clinton also recently outlined her priorities for the 2007 Farm Bill and called for action to force the USDA to properly implement COOL  The Senator also called for oversight hearings to ensure that the true letter of the law is expressed in its final implementation     Following the recent food and feed product import scares  Senator Clinton urged the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to account for their apparent failures to test  track and monitor food and feed materials coming from overseas and called on them to develop and implement a national food safety strategy  In a letter to the heads of the FDA and the USDA  Senator Clinton called for a comprehensive and integrated monitoring and regulation plan to ensure the safety of the nations food supply    Senator Clinton has also joined with Senator Frank R  Lautenberg to call for creation of a multi agency food safety task force to report to Congress what changes in law and regulations are needed to ensure the safety of our food supply     A copy of Senator Clintons letter follows    The Honorable Harry Reid  Majority Leader  United States Senate  S 221  Washington  D C   20510   The Honorable Mitch McConnell       Minority Leader  United States Senate       S 230  Washington  D C   20510       The Honorable Tom Harkin      Chairman   Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  United States Senate       R 328A     Washington  D C   20510   The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry   United States Senate      R 328A      Washington  D C   20510   Dear Majority Leader Reid  Minority Leader McConnell  Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss    Recent headlines have focused the attention of the nation on our increasing reliance on worldwide sources for our consumer products   The United States import and export markets have worked to increase an already growing global market for products of all varieties including electronics  automobiles  clothing and very significantly  agriculture and food products    As the United States approaches a trade deficit in total agricultural products and in the light of recent imported food supply scares  I ask for a greater commitment by Congress to establish final and appropriate implementation of mandatory country of origin labeling  COOL     Clear designations and easy access to information regarding the origin of our food supply are essential to American consumers when making the important decisions on the food that our families eat   An ever increasing supply of imported food products and the failure of the government to adequately inspect food products leave the consumer with little or no information on which to make these critical decisions on food safety   COOL can provide American consumers with sound information on which to base their food choices     Although consumers already receive country of origin information for many domestic and international products  food products  with the exception of seafood  are not among them   The 2002 Farm Bill mandated the establishment of COOL for food products   The burdensome  complicated and expensive implementation rules written by the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  reflect the agencys opposition to COOL   USDA is the agency obligated to implement the law and has unfortunately failed to do so      Recent consumer polls and surveys repeatedly report that more than 3 of every 4 respondents want country of origin labeling   Many say they would be willing to pay more for food products if that information was provided   Given that American consumers want to know where their food comes from and domestic producers want to differentiate their products from imports  COOL should be a priority and its implementation endorsed by Congress as soon as possible    I ask that you support full funding for USDA to move forward in drafting a proposed rule and that you urge USDA to cease in its obstruction of COOL so that a workable implementation rule will be crafted by the department   The rule should be manageable and affordable for producers and should aim to follow the original intent of Congress     Additionally  I ask that you move to encourage the immediate implementation of COOL and that the Senate address the broader issue of food safety in the time remaining in the 110th Congress    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
