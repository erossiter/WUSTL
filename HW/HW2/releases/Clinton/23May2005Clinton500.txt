           Newburgh  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Maurice Hinchey  NY 22  today highlighted their efforts to secure funding to establish the 225th Anniversary of the American Revolution Commemoration program  This initiative has tremendous economic development potential and will promote the celebration of the 225th anniversary of the American Revolution while attracting visitors to New York to learn about the state s significant history and heritage  They announced their work standing before Washington s Headquarters Historic Site  the first publicly operated historic site in the United States         This program will honor New York s history  attracting visitors from across the country and around the world to learn about our heritage   said Senator Clinton   It will also open new doors of opportunity for economic growth and development           The 225th anniversary of the American Revolution presents us with a great opportunity  especially here in the Hudson Valley  to help the public learn about the extraordinary historical events leading up to and culminating in the Revolutionary War   Hinchey said   It also gives us an opportunity to spur the interest of a whole new generation of Americans who may not be aware that these events literally took place in their own backyards  I look forward to working closely with Senator Clinton to secure federal funding for our American Revolution Commemoration Act  which will help countless New Yorkers and Americans learn more about this critical period of time in which our country was born         The program was established by the 225th Anniversary of the American Revolution Commemoration Act  legislation introduced by Senator Clinton in the Senate and Congressman Hinchey in the House  The legislation  which was approved by the Senate and House in November  authorizes  500 000 a year through fiscal year 2009 to improve stewardship of Revolutionary War sites and treasures through improved interpretation  education  outreach and protection  Senator Clinton and Congressman Hinchey emphasized that they will work in the appropriations process this Congress to secure these funds         The Commemoration Program will involve the participation of all National Park Service units and programs relevant to the American Revolution as well as other governmental and nongovernmental sites and facilities that are documented to be directly related to the American Revolution        The program allows NPS to link historic structures and sites  routes  activities  community projects  exhibits and multimedia materials  improve and update educational programs and connections with local and regional educators and expand the research base for Revolutionary War interpretation and education by seeking out and enhancing partnerships with scholars and educators  Specifically  the program requires the Secretary of the Interior to              Produce and distribute educational materials relating to the anniversary             Enter into agreements to provide technical assistance to other Federal agencies  States  local governments  private entities and partner with the governments of the United Kingdom  France  the Netherlands  Spain  and Canada              Assist in the protection of resources associated with the American Revolution             Enhance communications  connections  and collaboration among the National Park Service units and programs relating to the American Revolution              Expand the research base for interpretation of and education on the American Revolution  and             Adopt an official symbol or device for the theme  Lighting Freedom s Flame  American Revolution  225th Anniversary         The National Park Service administers battlefields  historical parks  and programs related to the Revolutionary War  However  due to a lack of resources  NPS faces many challenges administering these sites and programs  The funding Senator Clinton and Congressman Hinchey are working to secure will help meet these needs        Among the National Park Service sites that the Clinton and Hinchey measure seeks to help is the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area  HRVNHA   The purpose of the Heritage Area  which was established by legislation Hinchey introduced and passed into law in 1996  is to recognize the nationally significant history and resources of the Hudson Valley and to assist in preserving and interpreting those resources  The region s role in the American Revolution is one of the primary themes recognized by the Heritage Area designation  To date  this program has brought nearly  5 million to the Hudson River Valley to assist and promote the Heritage Area  The program will also help focus attention on a number of Revolutionary War sites in and around the Mohawk Valley  including Saratoga National Historical Park and the Fort Stanwix National Monument
