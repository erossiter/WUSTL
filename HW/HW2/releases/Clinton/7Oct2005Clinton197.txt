October 7  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Action on Funding for the Gulf Coast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Mr  President  there has been a lot of activity on this floor over the last 24 hours and it has been focused on how best to help the people along the Gulf Coast who ve been devastated by twin natural disasters  Katrina and Rita  And there has been an ongoing debate that took up the night in trying to determine how best to provide the funding that the cities and parishes in Louisiana and in Mississippi and Alabama and Texas need in order to be able to begin to deal with their pressing  urgent needs         Now  I rise today because I well remember the feelings that I had on this floor in the aftermath of the attacks we suffered on September the 11  2001  It was an uncertain and tragic time in our country  We were attacked and we lost nearly 3 000 people  Eighteen acres in the heart of the financial capital of the world were destroyed  Hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs  Businesses were shuttered  and there was great doubt as to how we were going to obtain the resources to begin the recovery process         I am very grateful that in New York  s hour of need  we had strong support in this chamber  I  m looking at my dear friend  the senior Senator from West Virginia  who came to our aid immediately  In fact  he said he would be the third Senator from New York  And I have never forgotten that and I am so grateful because he helped to shepherd through the Congress the money New York needed immediately to meet the needs that we were facing         And I am someone who believes that in a time of natural or manmade disaster  Americans rally around each other and we take care of each other   We provided funds from all over the country to help New York rebuild  just like we did after the Northridge earthquake in California  just like we did after hurricanes in Florida  just like we did after forest fires in the West  just like we did after the great floods in the Midwest         Now  there has never been a disaster of the dimension of what we are facing along the Gulf Coast  And I believe I have just a small bit of understanding and empathy because of what we went through in New York for what my colleagues  Senator Vitter and Senator Landrieu are going through and facing  But what is becoming clear to me is that there is an effort underway to make the recovery along the Gulf Coast much more difficult than it needs to be  I have been stunned at some of the demands that I hear coming from some of those in the Congress about what is expected from the people along the Gulf Coast and what kinds of funds can be made available to them   Like many people  I have been touched  moved  and impressed by the passion and eloquence of my friend and colleague  the senior Senator from Louisiana  Senator Landrieu  She has valiantly fought for the people who placed their trust in her to come to this Capitol and represent them in good times and in bad  We are in a bad time  And the people in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast need champions         But no matter how eloquent a single Senator is or even two Senators might be from a single state  they need support on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the Capitol  We are about to be presented with legislation that for the life of me I cannot understand  This legislation in law discriminates against the Gulf Coast  It says for the first time ever  we will put conditions on the federal money that goes through FEMA to the people and businesses of the Gulf Coast  We will require that the money be repaid  Now  as Senator Landrieu has said on the floor  it s a little bit of a catch 22  isn t it    You say to hard pressed sheriff s offices and parishes  to municipal governments and towns and cities along the Gulf Coast  you must repay this money  So before you borrow it to keep your police and your fire departments up and going  before you borrow it to have your public utility departments begin to do the work that they need  to get the reimbursement they require  you must have a plan in place to repay it         And so  I  m just bewildered  I don t understand why we are turning the people of the Gulf Coast into second class citizens  You know  after 9 11  in addition to the normal disaster relief funds provided in the wake of that tragedy  the federal government designated  20 billion to assist the New York City area  This was the first time that FEMA received authority of this type to reimburse the city and the state for associated costs that could not otherwise have received money under the Stafford Act  This was an unusual action taken in an unusual time  and we had the strong support at that time of our chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Jeffords  because 9 11 happened in that window when the Democrats were in the majority in the Senate   Chairman Jeffords stood with us to make sure we got what we needed without discriminating against New York City  without telling New Yorkers that we re just going to have to figure out how we re going to repay when we re not even sure there s another attack coming or what s going to be occurring in the future         We are again facing an unusual time  Hurricane Katrina and then  of course  Rita devastated New Orleans and the surrounding areas  The people of this region deserve our full support  Instead of offering support and helping these communities meet their needs  the proposal before us actually restricts their access to funds by preventing them from using principal forgiveness loans that are part of current law  I know that this has been presented apparently by the leadership in the House as a take it or leave it deal  And I know what a difficult position that puts our two Senators from Louisiana in  They re basically being told  you can leave here with  750 million with discriminatory conditions on it  that make your constituents second class citizens compared to everybody else  or you can leave with nothing  Well  that s a Hobson  s choice  if there ever was one  Bring nothing home or bring something that is not going to help your hospitals  not going to even be available to many communities because they re not going to be able to borrow it in the first place because they cannot repay it         I just came from a meeting where a number of business executives from along the Gulf Coast are trying to figure out what they re going to do now  Entergy in New Orleans has filed for bankruptcy  They said if they have to put the costs that they re accruing into the rate base    which they have to do  under the circumstances    rates are going to rise 200   We won t even give them unemployment compensation extension  We won t pass the Medicaid emergency application process  which we used in New York  We had a one page Medicaid eligibility program that got people back into a position where they could get their health needs met  We re not doing any of that for the people along the Gulf         So  I have the deepest sympathy for my colleagues from Louisiana  They re between a rock and a hard place  Go home with nothing or go home with a bad deal  A deal that has never been inflicted on any other city  state  or region in our country         Now  this is all being done in the name of the deficit  I know  I read the papers  You know  we have a lot of people who have discovered the deficit up here  Well  there are a lot of other alternatives than imposing discriminatory conditions on the people along the Gulf Coast         Mr  President  together we can do better than this  You know  a strong America begins at home  and we should owe our highest allegiance to the people who are in this country  And before we extend  100 billion more in tax cuts and before we continue to run up this deficit by funding the war and all of the other associated expenses  let s get some responsibility back here and let s treat the people of the Gulf Coast with the respect and dignity they deserve  Thank you
