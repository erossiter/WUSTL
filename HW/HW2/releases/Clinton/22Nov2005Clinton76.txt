                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congressman Maurice Hinchey  D NY  announced that they have introduced companion legislation on Friday in the Senate and the House of Representatives to establish a Hudson Fulton Champlain Commemoration Commission to promote national observance of the historic voyages of Henry Hudson  Samuel de Champlain  and Robert Fulton   The Hudson Fulton Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission Act of 2005 is similar to legislation that was introduced in the last Congress  Senators Charles Schumer  D NY   Patrick Leahy  D VT  and James Jeffords  I VT  are original cosponsors   And Congressman Bernie Sanders  I VT  is an original cosponsor in the House           The Hudson Fulton Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission represents a unique opportunity to celebrate New York  s and America s glorious past and is a wonderful opportunity to bring visitors to our State to learn about our history and heritage   Senator Clinton said   The 400th Commemoration Commission will facilitate Hudson Fulton Champlain related activities in New York and the United States  With a focus on heritage tourism and appropriate economic development  the Commission will ensure that we provide a first class visitor experience as well as a long term public benefit to the communities involved              This measure will establish a commission to commemorate three men who in their individual accomplishments changed the course of New York  American  and world history   Hinchey said   The discovery of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain was critical to the Revolutionary War and critical for the industrial development of the United States   Fulton s invention was the first major innovative industrial breakthrough in the world   These events were such critical parts of our history and in order to celebrate them properly we want to bring together the best experts on these historical events so they can work together to develop the best ways to celebrate and educate the public about them and promote tourism for the region as well           The legislation is intended to assist efforts to celebrate the upcoming 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson s first exploratory sail up what is now called the Hudson River in 1609  the 400th anniversary of Samuel de Champlain s first exploration in 1609 of what is now called Lake Champlain  as well as the 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton s Hudson River voyage in 1807 in which he introduced steam navigation on a commercial basis          In 2002  New York State enacted legislation creating a state commemoration commission  The federal Hudson Fulton Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission will be established to coordinate educational  cultural and historical projects while cooperating with and assisting the programs and activities conceived by New York and Vermont  The Commission will also be responsible for facilitating nation wide and international celebration efforts  It is also hoped that the Commission will support and facilitate marketing efforts for a commemorative coin  commemorative stamp and other related activities          The first European exploration of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain  and the introduction of steam navigation to maritime commerce are celebrated both in the United States and abroad  In 1909  Americans celebrated the 300th anniversaries of these events with maritime celebrations and art exhibitions  The Dutch built the first replica of Hudson s ship  the Half Moon  and sent it up the Hudson River for the observance  Congress recognized the 350th anniversary by establishing a similar commission to coordinate federal participation in the 1959 celebrations           Hinchey is the author of the legislation that created the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area  the first federal action formally recognizing the fundamentally significant role the people of the Hudson Valley played in the early development of America and its institutions   Both Hinchey and Clinton have worked to secure funding for the heritage area and both said they intended the federal commission to coordinate its commemorative efforts with the work of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area
