September 5  2007 Statement from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Starrett City Tenants Association                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              September 5  2007   Ms  Mary Purneill  President  Starrett City Tenants Association   Dear Ms  Purneill    I hope you will convey my thanks to the thousands of tenants who have made it abundantly clear that affordability at Starrett City is not for sale   I did the same several months ago when I initially spoke to Secretary Jackson of the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development regarding the  1 3 billion dollar bid to purchase Starrett City   I asked that HUD apply an affordability test to any proposal before approving the sale of Starrett City  and a  1 3 billion sale price clearly failed this test      I strongly believe Starrett City s incredible diversity makes this community a success story worth fighting to preserve   I will continue to stand with you and the 14 000 seniors and working families who call Starrett City home as we make it clear that all hard working New Yorkers deserve an affordable place to live    It is my understanding that Starrett Citys owners have filed notice with state housing authorities detailing their intention to leave the Michell Lama housing program   The use of Mitchell Lama housing subsidies and mortgage interest tax deductions have succeeded in making housing more affordable at developments like Starrett City for over three decades  The owners and tenants of Starrett City have each benefited from this unique public private partnership  as it has produced considerable profits for the owners and affordable rents for tenants   Our challenge is to find a way of maintaining this important balance  so the working families of this community will not become the victims of sky rocketing rents and evictions    Affordable housing options for working families are disappearing at an alarming rate  and it is important we make every effort to maintain long term affordability at one of our nations most successful working and middle class communities   To this end  I am encouraged to learn that the owners of Starrett City have made no final determination as to whether or not they will actually opt out of the Mitchell Lama program  but instead are only exploring their options   I am further encouraged by their willingness to continue negotiating with tenants and local officials in a good faith effort to develop a proposal that will allow the future owner of this property to keep Starrett City affordable    Again  thank you for standing up on behalf of New Yorks working families  and I look forward to continue working with you all    Sincerely     Hillary Rodham Clinton
