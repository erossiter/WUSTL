                       Washington  DC    Continuing their fight to secure adequate funds to assist with the treatment and monitoring of the firefighters  police officers  paramedics  first responders  building and construction trades workers  students  residents  volunteers  and others whose health is suffering because of the September 11th attacks in New York  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  and Edward M  Kennedy called on the President to include funds in his upcoming Fiscal Year 2008 Budget  The President  s Budget is due to be released in February          In a letter to the President today  the Senators also asked that the Department of Health and Human Services be prepared to provide funding for any gap between funding currently flowing to existing programs for medical and mental health monitoring and treatment until such time as Congress passes legislation to address the long term needs  The Senators have introduced legislation called the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006 and will reintroduce legislation next year when the 110th Congress convenes calling for  1 9 billion in funding to address these ongoing needs          A five year study conducted by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Ground Zero first responders found that almost 70 percent of WTC responders had new or substantially worsened respiratory symptoms following their work at the WTC site   Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9 11  61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC site  Studies published by the New York City Fire Department  FDNY  also show that over 90  of FDNY rescue workers had new respiratory symptoms following their work at WTC  over 30  continue to have respiratory and or mental health symptomatology  the average decrease in pulmonary function in the first year after WTC was 372ml  12 times the annual decline in the five years pre WTC   25  of those tested who were present during the morning of the attack have objective evidence for airway hyper reactivity consistent with asthma  and nearly 700  5  of exposed workforce  have qualified for respiratory disability pensions            These are alarming statistics and it is because of the severity of the problem that we want your Administration  s full commitment to ensure that our nation will not abandon those who responded in our time of need or who were victims of the attacks     the Senators said in their letter    Therefore  we ask that you and your Administration pledge full cooperation and support to find a solution to this problem by including funds in next year  s budget and to work with Congress on legislation           A copy of the Senators   letter follows       December 1  2006  The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States of America  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC 20500      Dear Mr  President       In anticipation of the 2008 budget we write to ensure that you make a significant commitment to the men and women who risked their lives and health in responding to the attacks of September 11  2001   It is clear that many different people were exposed to toxins at Ground Zero  Fresh Kills  and in the surrounding areas as a result of the collapse of the Twin Towers   Now  many are feeling the impact of that exposure through medical and mental health problems and our nation must provide a mechanism to treat these individuals now and into the future                      Funding for medical monitoring and treatment has been inadequate to date   As you know  Congress restored funding that was to be eliminated by last year  s budget to provide some initial funding for medical treatment and for ongoing monitoring   We have met with Secretary of Health and Human Services Leavitt and he assured us that HHS is working to find a solution to this problem and to get a handle on the true population suffering from exposure to toxins and other pulverized material which has directly impacted individual lung capacity   From our initial investigation  we know that police officers  firefighters  paramedics  first responders  building and construction trades workers  students  residents  volunteers  and others represent those individuals suffering because of the attacks   Unfortunately  their suffering is likely to worsen and their ability to do their work is threatened                      A five year study conducted by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Ground Zero first responders confirmed suspicions about the effects of having worked at the World Trade Center  WTC  site   According to the findings  almost 70 percent of WTC responders had new or substantially worsened respiratory symptoms following their work at the WTC site   Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9 11  61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC site                      Reports published by the New York City Fire Department  FDNY  show that over 90  of FDNY rescue workers had new respiratory symptoms following their work at WTC  over 30  continue to have respiratory and or mental health symptomatology  the average decrease in pulmonary function in the first year after WTC was 372ml  12 times the annual decline in the five years pre WTC   25  of those tested who were present during the morning of the attack have objective evidence for airway hyper reactivity consistent with asthma  and nearly 700  5  of exposed workforce  have qualified for respiratory disability pensions                      These are alarming statistics and it is because of the severity of the problem that we want your Administration  s full commitment to ensure that our nation will not abandon those who responded in our time of need or who were victims of the attacks   People from all across the United States came to assist New York and we know that some of those Americans were likely exposed as well   We are grateful for the work of Dr  John Howard of NIOSH who has been instrumental in helping Congress ascertain the true extent of this health crisis   However  it is clear from our initial understanding of the problem that significant  dedicated funding is needed in the short and long term                      We have introduced legislation called the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006 and will reintroduce that legislation next year when the 110th Congress convenes   This bill would provide  1 9 billion in grants for ongoing medical and mental health treatment and monitoring   In addition  the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee plans to hold hearings on this problem  and we will work with our colleagues to move this or other legislation through the Committee to address the problem                        Therefore  we ask that you and your Administration pledge full cooperation and support to find a solution to this problem by including funds in next year  s budget and to work with Congress on legislation   Further  we ask that the Department of Health and Human Services be prepared to provide funding for any gap between funding currently flowing to existing programs for medical monitoring and treatment until such time as Congress passes legislation that you can sign to address the long term needs                      We thank you for your attention to this matter and look forward to working with you          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles E  Schumer                                                            Edward M  Kennedy    Cc              Joshua Bolten  Chief of Staff  Rob Portman  Director  Office of Management and Budget  Michael Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services
