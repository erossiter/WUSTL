February 27  2007 Senator Clinton Questions Vice Admiral John M  McConnell  USN  ret   Director of National Intelligence and Lieutenant General Michael Maples  USA  the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at a Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on Worldwide Threats                                                                                                                                                        Chairman Levin  Senator Clinton       Senator Clinton  Thank you Mr  Chairman  I appreciate that   Admiral McConnell the Annual Threat Estimate characterizes Iran as determined to obtain nuclear weapons   In response to the series of questions from my colleague Senator Graham  you obliviously agree with that assessment   I want to ask it a little bit differently   What is the best estimate of the U S  intelligence community for how long it would take for Iran to develop nuclear weapons and the capacity to deliver them and what degree of confidence do you have in that estimate       Admiral McConnell   The earliest they could produce a nuclear weapon would be early next decade  more likely mid next decade         Senator Clinton  And by mid next decade  are we talking 2015       Admiral McConnell   We would be talking 2015       Senator Clinton  And when that date is reached  2015  which is the earliest that they could produce a nuclear weapon  would they then have the capacity to deliver that nuclear weapon       Admiral McConnell   It depends on how they develop their program   If they were to start the program for delivery  consistent with the development of a nuclear weapon  they could match and marry up in the same time frame   Normally  it would take a little longer to have a delivery capability        Senator Clinton   Thank you Admiral McConnell   General Maples  in 2005 Admiral Jacoby told me in testimony before this committee that North Korea had the ability to arm a missile with a nuclear device   I think it was the first time that testimony had ever been given in public   And last year  General Maples  you told me that North Korea is and I quote   in the process of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead  but they have not done so yet  nor have they tested it    Given the July 2006 missile test  would you revise your assessment of whether North Korea has developed an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the United States  If not  how many more years before North Korea has this capability       General Maples   I believe they have the technical capability as we saw by the Tapo Dong  but they have not successfully tested it yet         Senator Clinton  I just want to be clear that when we re talking about the technical capability  we re talking about a missile launched from North Korea that could reach California       General Maples   That s correct       Senator Clinton   And with your assessment  do you have any best estimate as to how many more years before they would have a deliverable capability         General Maples   I would probably estimate it s not a matter of years that in fact they will have learned from the Tapo Dong launch of this last summer and gone back to make corrections to whatever the failure was and apply that to the missile systems that they already have         Senator Clinton  I d to ask Doctor Fingar because I understand you have an expertise in China  and also General Maples   In your written statement that was submitted to the committee regarding China s military modernization  you state that you assess China s aspirations for great power status  threat perceptions  and security strategy would drive China s modernization efforts even if the Taiwan problem were resolved   Is that correct       General Maples   That is correct       Senator Clinton   Your written statement  however  fails to mention China s January 11 anti satellite test   So  perhaps this goes more to General Maples  but obliviously I d be pleased to hear from anyone on the panel   Given China s recent anti satellite test and the Chinese Government s professed opposition to the weaponization of space  what explains  in the opinion of any of you  the Government s decision to permit the military to conduct such a test   Do you believe that the leadership  either civilian or military  was aware of the potential negative implications in terms of U S  diplomatic and potential military response or was there some other motive at work  General Maples  Dr  Fingar       General Maples  No  I just heard that I believe that the Chinese and the Russians  to some extent  will continue to pursue space and counter space capabilities as they demonstrated by the launch of the SC 19       Senator Clinton   And do you see that as fitting into your assessment that they re going to continue to modernize regardless of any other factor that is going on  including the status of Taiwan       General Maples   I believe that they will continue to modernize  yes ma am       Senator Clinton   Let me ask each of you to briefly respond  In your opinion  under what circumstances would China become a military threat to the United States         Admiral McConnell  China today could be a military threat   They have intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads and so on   So it s a matter of  they re building their military  in my view  to reach some state of parity with the United States  So  in a threat sense  it becomes intentions  so they re a threat today  they would become an increasing threat over time         Senator Clinton   Dr  Fingar       Dr  Fingar   Well  they ve certainly had the capability for decades   But  they have appeared to have decided that we are not an enemy   That they require a peaceful international environment in order to proceed with their own efforts for economic modernization in order to address their very severe social problems   But they are a country with a history of  in their view  having been victimized by stronger external powers and they take national defense  including lessons learned out of Desert Shield and Desert Storm  forward defense to heart         Senator Clinton   I appreciate your commenting and perhaps this is an issue that we can explore further because obviously both within their government  as well as within ours  there is a debate occurring as how to view each other and I personally think it s one of the most important debates for us to get right   And finally Dr  Fingar  in your response to a series of questions about the NIE on Iraq  do you have an opinion about the impact on Iraq s potential for stability and security of a phased re deployment versus a rapid withdrawal       Dr  Fingar   Senator  I do not   It s not a question that I have looked at or that we have looked at         Senator Clinton   I think that s important and I appreciate your candor on that issue  because clearly the conclusion some are drawing from the NIE would suggest that there was an opinion and that you has such an opinion and I appreciate your response to my question  Thank you Mr  Chairman         Chairman Levin   Thank you Senator Warner   Senator Clinton      Second Round of Questions               Senator Clinton   Thank you  Mr  Chairman   Mr  Chairman  I think it would be useful to have the committee staff look into the chronology of the activity surrounding our statement back in 2002 about North Korea s highly enriched uranium program   My recollection was that we stopped sending fuel oil before North Korea pulled out of the NPT and dismissed the IAEA inspectors  but I think this is very important because we ve learned some lessons   I think we ve learned some lessons about what not to do in dealing with serious threats such as that posed by a nation like North Korea and others obtaining nuclear weapons  but if we could get that chronology       Chairman Levin   The committee staff will do that and by the way  my recollection is the same as yours and we did stop sending the heavy fuel oil to North Korea before they withdrew from the framework and left the IAEA   But  we will have the staff double check that       Senator Clinton  Thank you   Vice President Cheney was in Pakistan yesterday and from the news report it appears that he delivered  what is referred to as a stiff message  a stiff private message  to the Pakistani Government to crack down more effectively on the Taliban and Al Qaeda inside Pakistan   I assume  Admiral McConnell  that Vice President Cheney was briefed in an up to date way in whatever intelligence assessments were attributed to our understanding of Pakistan before he went   Is that correct       Admiral McConnell   That is correct and in fact he was accompanied by the Deputy Director of CIA and I m sure that he had all the current information       Senator Clinton  So I just want to ask you  therefore  based on that and based on Vice President Cheney s apparent mission there  is it the assessment of our intelligence community  number one that Pakistan is capable of doing more with respect to the Taliban and Al Qaeda then they are currently doing  And number two  that President Musharraf s hold on power within Pakistan  is firm enough for him to take such additional steps       Admiral McConnell  One  we believe they could do more  And the issue of being elected for the next term is the issue that  in my view  President of Pakistan is wrestling with   He signed the agreement with the tribal leaders in the frontier area  as you are aware last fall  and the question was  he was taking causalities for going into those areas attempting to chase Al Qaeda  He believed  he being the President of Pakistan  believed that he could be more effective by signing this peace agreement and from our point of view  capabilities of Al Qaeda for training and so on  increased   Therefore  the Vice President visit and others visit to make the case that we have to be more aggressive in going after Al Qaeda in Pakistan   The balancing act  of course is the President s standing in that country with an election coming up this fall        Senator Clinton  Thank you
