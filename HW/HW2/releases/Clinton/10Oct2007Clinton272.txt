October 10  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on EPA to Better Protect the Health of Our Nation s Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to take the necessary steps to better protect the health of our nations children   In a letter to the EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson  Senator Clinton urged the agency to examine the areas where it has failed to make improvements to protect childrens health  identify the opportunities to make additional gains  and ensure that achievements are not lost due to complacency and lack of commitment   Senator Clinton s letter follows release by the EPA of a report outlining its efforts to address children s environmental health  including an overview of the agency s work in the ten years since the Clinton Administration implemented a landmark executive order to protect children from environmental health and safety risks       The EPA and this administration have failed to continue the progress made during the Clinton Administration in protecting the health of our nations children  Despite efforts during the Clinton Administration to create a sustained framework for addressing childrens environmental health issues  the EPA has not followed through on this commitment  It is critical for the agency to ensure our childrens health is protected  said Senator Clinton     In 1997  the Clinton Administration released Executive Order 13045  Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks  which called for federal agencies to identify and assess environmental health risks and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children and carry out activities to address such risks  While gains have been made in the decade since this order was promulgated  the EPA  s actions have raised concerns about the commitment of the current Administration to childrens health protection    Senator Clinton has been active in working to improve childrens environmental health  As Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  she has worked to ensure that the EPA address the health impacts of those disproportionately burdened by environmental pollutants  Last month  she requested  along with Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigate the extent to which EPA incorporates and utilizes the recommendations of the Childrens Health Protection Advisory Committee   the body of experts designed to help EPA ensure that the interests of children are represented in the agencys activities   Senator Clinton has also introduced the Family Asthma Act and the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act to help decrease exposures to the environmental pollutants linked to childhood illness     The letter sent to Administrator Johnson follows    The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  United States Environmental Protection Agency  Ariel Rios Building   1101A  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20460   Dear Administrator Johnson    Last week  the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  released a report entitled  Childrens Environmental Health  2007 Highlights   This report contained an overview of the work that the EPA has done to address childrens health issues in the ten years since the release of Executive Order 13045  entitled Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks    Yet in the decade since the release of that Executive Order  I believe that we have failed to continue our progress in protecting the health of our nations children   The EPA has taken several actions that indicate a lack of concern for childrens health  including the merging of the Childrens Health Protection and Environmental Education offices and the approval of the Childrens Environmental Exposure Research Study  CHEERS   which raised concerns about industry influence over the agencys scientific activities   In an April 2007 letter to you  the Childrens Health Protection Advisory Committee  CHPAC   the experts convened by the EPA to advise the agency  expressed concern that the focus on childrens environmental health at the EPA has diminished     I am particularly concerned that some of the initiatives that you highlight in this report are not as strong as they could be in protecting childrens health   For example  you highlight the work of the EPA in raising awareness about mercury in fish   Yet despite independent testing noting that additional risks may be present in fish labeled as lower risk  your agency has not updated the 2004 EPA FDA Joint Advisory on mercury in fish and shellfish     You cite the work of the Centers for Childrens Environmental Health and Disease Prevention  yet fail to address concerns about the potential restructuring of the community based participatory research components of these programs  despite the findings of a joint report from the EPAs Board of Scientific Counselors and CHPAC that found that Centers that were most active in utilizing community members as research partners seemed better able to inform local policy makers   And while you praise the work of the Americas Children and the Environment  ACE  reports  the EPA has not released one of these reports since 2003   Indeed  the data from the ACE website notes that the percentage of children that did not meet drinking water standards for lead  coliforms  and nitrates actually increased from 2003 to 2005  with reductions of health based violations in drinking water made since 1997 virtually eradicated by 2005    The tenth anniversary of Executive Order 13045 gives us the opportunity to reevaluate the EPAs activities and redouble our commitment to childrens health protection   I would urge you to examine the areas where we have failed to make improvements  identify the opportunities to make additional gains  and ensure that our achievements are not lost due to complacency and lack of commitment   I would also ask that you provide me with a plan for concrete action in response to the April 10  2007 letter from the CHPAC   I would also appreciate learning the timeline for the review of their recommendations from the relevant EPA offices  which you committed to carrying out in your June 13 response to the CHPAC letter    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
