March 16  2006 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Calls on President Bush to do More to End the Genocide in Darfur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    Deeply concerned by the continuing genocide in Darfur  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has sent a letter to President Bush  urging him to take steps to protect civilians and address the crisis in Darfur   Senator Clinton  s letter emphasized her concern regarding continued violence against civilians and aid workers in Darfur  recent accounts of sexual violence against children  and escalating tensions between Sudan and Chad   Her letter reiterated the importance of a durable peace agreement between the conflicting parties  but emphasized that peace talks should not forestall efforts to ensure the safety of the people of Darfur            Earlier this month  Senator Clinton co sponsored a resolution that passed the Senate  which called on President Bush to arrange for increased NATO assistance in Darfur   In January  Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter to President Bush calling his attention to the crisis in Darfur          The full text of Senator Clinton s letter to President Bush follows          The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President          I write with great concern about the crisis in Sudan   Despite the work of the African Union  violence against civilians and aid workers in Darfur is increasing and spilling across the border into Chad   Between 200 000 and 400 000 people have been killed  and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and other credible experts continue to warn that three million civilians are displaced and at risk in Darfur and in eastern Chad   The situation in eastern Sudan is also of concern          The United States and United Nations  U N   now possess extensive  official accounts of the violence and  through a U N  Panel of Experts and other sources  we also know who may be responsible   The Government of Sudan    reported by the U S  State Department on March 8  2006 to be responsible for the genocide in Darfur    continues to deny the existence of a crisis   It continues to threaten retaliation against an international intervention  and  according to a U N  report dated January 30  2006  it continues to introduce additional military aircraft into Darfur  The United States can and must do more   Below are 13 ways in which you can take action       Convene a meeting of world leaders to address the crisis in Darfur  For 100 weeks  the international community has watched  with little meaningful response  as the first genocide of this millennium has been carried out by the Government of Sudan against the people of Darfur   I urge you to convene  without delay  a meeting between leaders of the United Nations  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  and the African Union  and other interested world leaders  to map out an action plan for Darfur   The millions of displaced victims in Darfur deserve at least this much       Appoint a Presidential Envoy to Sudan   To promote lasting peace in both Darfur and eastern Sudan  and to demonstrate U S  commitment to peace negotiations and agreements  I urge you to consider the appointment of a Presidential Envoy to Sudan  Like Senator Danforth  your previous Envoy to Sudan  a new Envoy should participate personally in peace talks  oversee and coordinate U S  engagement in Sudan  and report directly to you on these efforts       Lead the U N  Security Council in authorizing a peacekeeping mission in Darfur  To protect civilians from continued violence    much of which is documented explicitly in a 42 page U N  report published on January 27 and the U N  Secretary General  s monthly reports to the Security Council    I urge you to push the U N  Security Council to authorize  under Chapter VII  a U N  peacekeeping mission in Darfur         On January 12 and March 10  2006  the African Union endorsed this mission in principle   U N  Secretary General Kofi Annan has begun planning this mission  in accordance with the U N  Security Council  s Presidential Statement of February 3  2006        Efforts to broker a peace agreement for Darfur must not forestall efforts to protect civilians   Our continued inaction will enable the killings to continue  This fact cannot be ignored        A U N  mission in Darfur must now be authorized with a clear and robust mandate to protect civilians  and be supplied with the troops  air  and ground mobility  and communications network required to fully implement that mandate        The Government of Sudan must either cooperate with this mission or face sanctions  in accordance with the existing U N  Security Council Resolutions that are described below       Support the African Union   According to U N  officials  deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur may take six to nine months   To protect civilians in the interim  I urge you to support the African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur in two ways   First  I urge you to support the funding needs of the African Union mission for the next nine months   As you know  the United States   share of these costs is estimated at         10 million per month        Second  in accordance with United States Senate Resolution 383  which I co sponsored  I urge you to lead NATO in providing assistance to the A U  peacekeepers in Darfur  particularly in the areas of command and control  logistics  intelligence  and airlift   I called for NATO assistance in Darfur more than 12 months ago  at the Munich Conference on Security   Since then  NATO has been helpful  particularly with airlift  but it can and should do more        Third  to improve the ability of the existing African Union peacekeepers to deter violence  I urge you to explore mechanisms that would provide African Union commanders in Darfur with specific  timely  standardized information about imminent attacks against civilians in Darfur       Enforce the no fly zone that has been established by the U N  Security Council and endorsed by the U S  Congress   Despite the enactment of a no fly zone by the U N  Security Council in March 2005    nearly one year ago    the Government of Sudan continues its aerial assaults against civilians in Darfur   This is unacceptable  and I urge you to work with members of NATO  the U N  Security Council  and the African Union to immediately enforce the ban on offensive overhead flights in Darfur that was established by Security Council Resolution 1591        On March 2  2006  the U S  Senate adopted Resolution 383 calling on you to take steps to enforce the no fly zone in Darfur   Senator Biden and others have suggested that enforcement of the flight ban would require no more than 12 to 18 fighter planes and a handful of AWACs   I urge you to work other countries to mobilize these resources  and to ensure that the Government of Sudan ceases its overhead assaults   Our continued failure on this issue is unacceptable        Similarly  I urge you to raise with Khartoum the findings of a U N  report dated January 30  2006  which suggest that the Government of Sudan continues to introduce additional offensive military aircraft into Darfur       Lead the U N  Security Council in enforcing Resolution 1591  to freeze the assets and travel of certain dangerous individuals   I urge you to work with other members of the U N  Security Council to fully implement Resolution 1591  which authorized the Security Council to impose travel bans and asset freezes on any individuals believed by a Panel of Experts to constitute a threat to stability  to violate international human rights law  to impede the peace process  or to conduct offensive overhead military flights        The Panel of Experts has identified several individuals who have perpetrated such violations of international law  and these individuals must be prevented from organizing or perpetrating additional violence  and be sanctioned in full accordance with Resolution 1591   At the very least  the Security Council should call the named individuals to the United Nations for dialogue and questioning        Lead the U N  Security Council in enforcing Resolution 1564  to hold accountable the Government of Sudan for its documented failure to meet its international obligations to end violence and protect civilians in Darfur   I urge you to work with the U N  Security Council to fully implement Resolution 1564  which calls on the Security Council to consider   additional measures as contemplated in Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations  such as actions to affect Sudan  s petroleum sector and the Government of Sudan or individual members of the Government of Sudan     if the Government of Sudan fails its previous obligations under international law  including U N  Security Council Resolution 1556 and the Joint Communiqu     dated July 3  2004        Several official reports  including a U N  report published on January 27  2006  demonstrate unequivocally that the Government of Sudan has failed its obligations   It has failed to protect civilians in Darfur  and it has failed to punish members of the military and the Janjaweed for violations of international human rights law   These realities and Resolution 1564 should now compel the Security Council to consider Article 41 measures against the Government of Sudan       Ensure that the U N  Security Council listens to the experts   I urge you to convene a briefing for members of the Security Council by experts who can describe the situation in Darfur  eastern Chad  and eastern Sudan   The Security Council should hear testimony from Juan Mendez  Special Advisor to the Secretary General on the Prevention of Genocide   As you know  the Security Council did not allow Mr  Mendez to present his observations in October 2005       Stop the violence from spreading into Chad   I urge you to monitor tensions along the Chad Sudan border and to focus the U N  Security Council on this important issue   The U N  Secretary General noted in his January 30 report to the Security Council that   there has been a worrying build up of armed forces of the two States and local militias on both sides of the border     and that   it is vitally important that the situation in the border areas of Chad and the conflicts in the Sudan do not combine to propel the two countries and the whole region towards confrontation and conflict           More specifically  I urge you to work with the Security Council and the African Union to monitor implementation of the February 8  2006 accord between the Presidents of Chad and Sudan  and to deter all parties from escalating the conflict   The safety of at least three million civilians along the Chad Sudan border depends on your attention to this issue       Call publicly for better behavior from Khartoum   Using Resolutions 1591 and 1564 and other points of leverage  I urge you to call on the Government of Sudan    particularly the National Congress Party in Khartoum    to immediately desist from violence against civilians  protect safe passage for aid workers  cooperate fully with international peacekeepers  engage constructively in the peace talks in Abuja  diffuse tensions along the Chad Sudan border  and disarm and punish the Janjaweed and other groups responsible for genocidal violence in Darfur        I urge you to call similarly on the Government of Sudan to implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement without delay and in full consultation with the Government of Southern Sudan  and to protect civilians and peacefully address the situation in eastern Sudan       Work with the U N  Security Council to address attacks by rebel groups in Darfur   I urge you to work with the Security Council to make it clear to all rebels and perpetrators of violence in Sudan and Chad that attacks against civilians and aid workers are violations of international law  and that continued international consideration of their grievances depends directly upon their immediate cessation of violence against civilians        Plan for reconstruction in Darfur   Through a new Presidential Envoy or other U S  officials  I urge you to begin working with the World Bank and other stakeholders on a Joint Assessment Mission to plan for reconstruction in Darfur   This may help to accelerate the peace process by demonstrating to the Darfur rebels and the Government of Sudan that peace can bring financial dividends  and  once peace has been established  it will help to speed reconstruction and promote stability       Support reconstruction in southern Sudan   I urge you to provide strong  material support to the Government of Southern Sudan as it builds a stable state  economy  and society in the wake of decades of conflict  Similarly  I urge you to encourage the Government of Southern Sudan to engage constructively in the Darfur peace negotiations        During the last century  in Nazi Europe  Cambodia  and elsewhere  the international community failed to protect millions of innocent people from genocide and horrific crimes  We look back and wonder how the world allowed those killings to continue   We must find a way to protect civilians in Darfur  without further delay        As you know  I and other members of the U S  Congress recognized the genocide in Darfur in July 2004   In September 2004  then Secretary of State Colin Powell did the same   A few months later  in January 2005  a U N  International Commission of Inquiry established by U N  Security Council Resolution 1564 also found strong evidence of genocide in Darfur   In February 2006  Secretary of State Rice said that   genocide was committed and in fact continues in Darfur      Even so  international agreement on the existence of genocide has little connection to the need or basis for action        Hundreds of acts of violence in Darfur  many constituting crimes against humanity and war crimes    along with specific descriptions of the perpetrators    have been recorded in detail by the U S  State Department  the United Nations  the African Union  the NGO community  and other organizations   I urge you to read these gruesome accounts  and to also review the list of individuals who have been identified by the U N  Panel of Experts established by U N  Security Council Resolution 1591   In the case of Darfur  we are now obligated by the U N  Charter  the Responsibility to Protect  several statutes of international human rights law  and existing U N  Security Council resolutions to transform our awareness into action        Therefore  I urge you  as President of the United States  to remind the international community of its commitments and to work urgently with the United Nations  the African Union  and NATO to protect civilians and address the growing crises in Darfur  eastern Chad  and eastern Sudan   Thank you for your attention to these urgent matters        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton         CC  John R  Bolton         United States Permanent Representative           to the United Nations
