                  Washington  DC   U S  Senators today requested the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to examine the hiring practices of the Pentagon following reports charging that partisan affiliations shaped the personnel decision for the Bush Administration in Iraq          According to media reports  qualified applicants with language skills and experience in post conflict reconstruction were rejected in favor of unqualified Republican Party loyalists   Individuals with political connections and little or no professional experience were placed in key positions to rebuild Iraq  including a 24 year old who had never worked in finance  but was assigned to reopen the Baghdad stock exchange           Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  joined Assistant Democratic

year of the occupation of Iraq are having a very direct impact on the situation that our troops confront in Iraq today   This matter demands attention and accountability   With 147 000 troops in Iraq after three years of fighting  we face rising sectarian violence  a continuing insurgency  and an Iraqi government that has not yet risen to the immense task before it                 In order to move forward  we must understand how we arrived at this point  therefore  we are asking you to examine the hiring practices and actions of the Department of Defense in 2003 and 2004 in staffing the CPA during that critical period and the consequences of those decisions     they concluded            The full text of the letter to GAO follows          September 21  2006      The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States Government Accountability Office  441 G St   NW  Washington  DC 20548      Dear Mr  Walker       We write to you as members of Congress who are deeply concerned about our nation  s involvement in the war in Iraq   We believe that the seeds of today  s troubles were planted in 2002 and 2003 when the Administration failed to engage in planning for what could follow the conclusion of   major combat operations     when it failed to send sufficient troops or properly equip them  when it failed to take the necessary steps to secure the peace  when it made the disastrous decision to disband the Iraqi Army  and when it apparently failed to ensure that we had the civilian personnel we needed on the ground in Iraq    On this last point  recent books and media accounts paint a highly disturbing picture about the hiring practices of the Department of Defense in staffing the Coalition Provisional Authority  CPA   the personnel choices made  and the designation of a number of positions as political rather than civil service slots   We would like to request a Government Accountability Office study to review and assess hiring practices of the Department of Defense for the CPA          Specifically  we ask you to examine               What were the criteria for hiring decisions and who had input into those decisions               How were positions advertised               Which positions were designated as political appointments and which as civil service and why               Were qualified personnel  e g   Middle East experts or those with Arabic language skills or post conflict reconstruction experience  passed over in favor of less qualified  less experienced personnel               What was the statistical breakdown of new hires by experience level in their field of CPA employment               Do you see a pattern in which political leanings swayed hiring outcomes at the expense of qualifications               Were opportunities to establish a more stable and secure Iraqi government and to launch a more successful reconstruction effort during the CPA  s tenure from 2003 to 2004 undermined by personnel decisions               In your estimate  if opportunities to establish security and stability were undermined during this period  what have the long term consequences been               What lessons can we draw from the practices and policies surrounding staffing decisions and actions involving the CPA               Do patterns of hiring involving political considerations continue to influence the staffing for United States government funded positions in Iraq today          We believe that decisions made in the first year of the occupation of Iraq are having a very direct impact on the situation that our troops confront in Iraq today   This matter demands attention and accountability   With 147 000 troops in Iraq after three years of fighting  we face rising sectarian violence  a continuing insurgency  and an Iraqi government that has not yet risen to the immense task before it   In order to move forward  we must understand how we arrived at this point  therefore  we are asking you to examine the hiring practices and actions of the Department of Defense in 2003 and 2004 in staffing the CPA during that critical period and the consequences of those decisions          Sincerely
