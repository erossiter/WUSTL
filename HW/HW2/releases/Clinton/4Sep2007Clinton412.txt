September 4  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Vote on OMB Director Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   The Presidents stewardship of the economy has resulted in a 55 percent increase of our national debt  inherited surpluses that were turned into long term deficits  a nearly 14 percent growth in the number of Americans without health insurance  five million more Americans falling into poverty  falling incomes for working families and the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else growing larger and larger     Indeed  Americas middle class and working families have borne the fallout of President Bushs fiscal mismanagement and it is clear that his economic agenda is inconsistent with the priorities of the American people  While the number of American kids without health insurance has grown by more than 250 000 under his watch  the President has threatened to veto the modest proposals to expand CHIP that enjoy broad bipartisan support     The President should be signaling a willingness to work with Congress to right our fiscal ship and to make the right investments in our infrastructure  in our schools  in our health care system  and for strengthening our middle class which have been ignored for far too long  Instead he has chosen a budget director that I fear will only serve to defend the Administrations failed economic policies  Unfortunately  Mr  Nussles record doesnt reflect an understanding of the challenges being faced by Americas middle class  nor does his background suggest any particular ability to accommodate views or priorities that differ from the Presidents     Our vote today should have reflected the American peoples dissatisfaction with the economic policies and misplaced priorities of this President and that is why I voted no
