                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Continuing their bipartisan support of Magen David Adom  s  MDA  bid to gain full entry into the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Elizabeth Dole  NC   Chuck Hagel  NE  and Joseph Lieberman  CT  sent a letter today to the Swiss government supporting the recent announcement of its intention to convene a conference for the purpose of adopting the additional protocol necessary for the establishment and use of a third neutral symbol for humanitarian purposes  a crucial stepping stone to MDA gaining full entry into the ICRC    Though the Red Shield of David has been unofficially recognized as the emblem of the medical and first aid services society in Israel  MDA does not have voting rights in the ICRC Movement or equal status with other emergency relief societies under the organization  s rules             For 75 years  Magen David Adom has given the gift of life at home and abroad     said Senator Clinton     MDA truly embodies the principles upon which the Red Cross Movement was founded in 1864   Humanity  Impartiality  Neutrality  Unity  and Universality  It is high time for MDA to be admitted as a full voting member to the Movement and recognized internationally             Since taking office in 2001  Senator Clinton has steadfastly supported MDA in its goal of gaining entry into the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC    In August 2001  Senator Clinton and Senator Peter Fitzgerald announced their leading a group of senators in urging Secretary of State Colin Powell and Red Cross officials to push for full and immediate Magen David Adom membership in the ICRC  They sent letters to Powell  Jakob Kellenberger  President of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent  and Dr  Astrid Hieberg  President of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society  urging swift recognition and full membership for MDA    http   clinton senate gov news

International Red Cross should immediately recognize MDA  The Sense of Congress also declared that the Red Shield of David should be accorded the same protections under international law as the Red Cross and the Red Crescent and that the United States should continue to press for full membership for the MDA in the ICRC            In January 2003  Senator Clinton  along with Senators Dole and Fitzgerald  offered an amendment to withhold the United States   contributions to the International Committee of the Red Cross until MDA is no longer denied participation in the activities of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent  IRC  Movement  The amendment passed the Senate on January 23  2003   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 235903         Senator Clinton

vital life saving work that MDA has performed for 75 years  and will reiterate her commitment to ensuring that the MDA gains entry into the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC           The full text of the letter follows             November 3  2005         Micheline Calmy Rey  Foreign Minister  Government of Switzerland      Dear Minister Calmy Rey          We write to express the strongest possible support for your government  s recent announcement of its intention to convene the states parties of the Geneva Convention fro the purpose of adopting the additional protocol necessary for the establishment and use of a third neutral symbol for humanitarian purposes  We understand that you confirmed this intention to Israel  s Foreign Minister this week   The impact of this change will be to allow Israel  s Magen David Adom  MDA  to become a member of the International Red Cross Movement   As long time champions of the goal of allowing MDA to join the International Red Cross movement  we want to applaud and encourage the reversal of this injustice          Magen David Adom saves lives and provides emergency assistance and blood supplies to people in many countries  regardless of ethnicity or religion  yet it is the only national emergency relief society to be excluded from the world s largest humanitarian network   Though the Red Shield of David has been unofficially recognized as the emblem of the medical and first aid services society in Israel since 1930  the organization does not have voting rights in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement or equal status with other emergency relief societies under the organization  s rules          Despite its exclusion from the Red Cross Movement  MDA plays an active role in disaster assistance worldwide  MDA sent a team to help Tsunami survivors in India and Sri Lanka earlier this year   From the Balkans to Africa to India  MDA employees and volunteers have dedicated themselves to helping others who have been affected by war or natural disaster around the world for more than 50 years          As you may know  in 2001  53 U S  Senators sent letters to then Secretary of State Colin Powell  Jakob Kellenberger  President of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent  ICRC   and Dr  Astrid Heiberg  then President of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  urging swift recognition and full membership for MDA  which has been excluded from the Movement for more than 50 years  The senators said MDA should be admitted to the Federation and the Movement as a whole as a full and equal member without having to give up or diminish use of its emblem  the Red Shield of David          Adoption of the protocol would allow the movement to admit MDA and for MDA to continue use of its symbol  Further  the adoption of a neutral symbol also offers the ability of the Red Cross movement to reach even more broadly   A third neutral symbol provides equality to all nations and serves the needs of Red Cross movement in circumstances where the presence of a Red Cross or a Red Crescent might conflict with purely humanitarian objectives            There may be efforts by some to oppose holding a conference and adoption of the additional protocol by attempting to link the fate of MDA to the Israeli Palestinian conflict   MDA has an ongoing and strong working relationship with the Palestinian Red Crescent  This cooperation is symbolic of what the Red Cross movement means for all of us   We cannot emphasize strongly enough that the Israeli Palestinian conflict should not be used as a rationale for blocking a change that will provide humanitarian benefits worldwide           We strongly support Switzerland  s efforts  as the depositary state for the Geneva conventions  to remedy the injustice regarding Magen David Adom and to convene the states party conference to adopt the neutral symbol   You have our strong support as you continue your efforts to insure a just result            Sincerely          Senator Clinton       Senator Dole       Senator Hagel       Senator Lieberman
