September 20  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on Appropriations Committee to Increase Funding for Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Also Announces Introduction of Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Ac                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   In the wake of new U S  Department of Energy projections of staggering price increases for home heating oil and natural gas due to Hurricane Katrina  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined forty of her Senate colleagues today in calling on the Committee on Appropriations to request  1 276 billion in emergency funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    This letter is follow ups the Senator  s September 9th letter to President Bush urging him to take action to increase funding   Senator Clinton also introduced today with Senator Cantwell  WA  the   Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Act     which would create new federal authorities to combat gasoline price gouging             LIHEAP   which offers federal funds to help low income households meet their home heating needs  will be critical to enabling thousands of New Yorkers deal the soaring cost and diminishing availability of home heating fuel as fall and winter approach   Last year  an estimated 800 000 New Yorkers received LIHEAP assistance              The average New York family will need to spend at least  400 more this winter to pay their heating bills   This could spell disaster for seniors  low income families  and the disabled across New York who are struggling to make ends meet   That  s why I am calling on the Senate Appropriations Committee and President Bush to support emergency funds for LIHEAP as part of the next Hurricane Katrina relief package     said Senator Clinton     Unless we take action now  thousands of New Yorkers will be left out in the cold              According to a recent report by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA     Hurricane Katrina caused significant direct damage to offshore rigs  refineries  pipelines and ports in the Gulf of Mexico  with wide scale electricity outages and flooding exacerbating the already devastated infrastructure  compounded by the evacuation of thousands of employees      As a result of this damage  the EIA projects that home heating oil will hit  2 49 per gallon this December and that natural gas prices will also be higher than expected    See table below for analysis of the projected cost increase per New York family             Senator Clinton and her colleagues urged the Appropriations Committee to approve an additional  1 276 billion in funding to enable LIHEAP to have the same purchasing power as last year   This would provide  150 million in additional funding to New York so that New York can provide the same level of service to seniors  disabled and low income families as last winter             Senator Clinton also announced the introduction of the   Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Act     a bill she is sponsoring with Senator Cantwell that would give the President the authority to declare a   national energy emergency     and create a national prohibition on price gouging for gasoline and other petroleum products during that emergency   In addition  it requires the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to put new measures in place to ensure greater transparency in gasoline pricing             This bill will help to protect New Yorkers and all Americans from being victims of price gouging during a national emergency like Katrina     said Senator Clinton     No one should be allowed to profiteer from a tragedy               Introduction of the   Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Act    follows earlier efforts by Senator Clinton to address high gas prices   On August 18th  Senator Clinton sent a letter to President Bush urging him to  direct the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to investigate whether oil companies are engaging in anti competitive practices  release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  and pressure our OPEC allies to increase production   Senator Clinton joined lead sponsor Senator Mark Pryor  D AR  and others on an amendment to force action  which passed the Senate last week   The amendment requires the FTC to conduct an immediate investigation to determine if and where gas price gouging is occurring throughout the supply chain and distribution markets and the impact on consumers   Senator Clinton also supports a temporary suspension of the gas tax if savings are passed on to consumers and there is no negative impact on New York jobs or projects             I will continue to fight to ensure that oil companies aren  t profiting at the expense of consumers and that the federal government takes the short term steps that we can to get gas prices under control   The fact is that this Administration needs to take control and tell the oil companies that they should be taking some of their profits and passing them onto consumers who are struggling to pay for gas to get to work  and  soon  heat their homes     said Senator Clinton             On September 9th  Senator Clinton called on the President to provide emergency funding for programs to reduce demand for energy  urging the President to request that the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP  be fully funded   The program was reauthorized at  500 million in the energy bill recently approved in Congress   Through this program  weatherization service providers install energy efficient measures in homes of qualifying homeowners free of charge   According to the U S  Department of Energy  the program reduces energy use by approximately 31 percent in each home it serves and saves the average homeowner about  300 per year   It also produces  1 83 in energy savings for every federal dollar invested   Senator Clinton also underscored the need for a conservation plan for the Northeast Region so that we are prepared for possible supply disruptions  particularly of heating oil              Last year  New York received  20 3 million in WAP funds  which enabled the state to serve approximately 11 000 families   If overall WAP funding were raised to  500 million  New York  s share would increase by  24 1 million and the number of homes served would increase by 13 000  or an overall increase of 55             The text of Senator Clinton  s letter to President Bush follows           September 20  2005         The Honorable Thad Cochran   Chairman      Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  DC  20510         The Honorable Robert C  Byrd  Ranking Member  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510         Dear Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd          Hurricane Katrina upset the lives of millions  displacing families from their homes and inflicting severe economic damage   Without question  the people of the Gulf region deserve our support  and we stand ready to help    As the Appropriations Committee considers an urgently needed comprehensive supplemental appropriations bill to address Hurricane Katrina  s devastation as well as its economic and energy impacts on the nation  we urge you to include  1 276 billion in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funds   With this additional funding  the LIHEAP program will be able to provide the same level of purchasing power as last year   This funding is critical to avoid a looming  but preventable  crisis for millions of additional Americans caused by the soaring cost and diminishing affordability of home heating fuel as winter approaches          The effects of Hurricane Katrina are being felt by Americans outside of the Gulf Region as gasoline  heating oil  and natural gas prices rise in the wake of this disaster   Indeed  there is an imminent emergency confronting millions of low income Americans unable to afford the cost of rising energy prices  The current skyrocketing in energy prices coupled with energy debt remaining from last winter and this summer are leading to increased disconnections and arrears among consumers as the winter heating season begins    threatening the well being of low income families and seniors   This situation warrants the provision of emergency LIHEAP funding in the comprehensive supplemental request          Prior to Hurricane Katrina  s devastation in the Gulf region  Americans were facing record prices for oil  natural gas  and propane   Hurricane Katrina damaged platforms and ports and curtailed production at refineries in the Gulf of Mexico  the source of almost a third of U S  oil output    Crude oil for October delivery stands at over  66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange   Heating oil prices increased dramatically after Hurricane Katrina   Prices averaged  1 70 per gallon in July  but now stand over  2 per gallon   Before Hurricane Katrina struck  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  predicted a 16 percent increase in heating oil costs   This increase comes on top of the 34 percent increase during the 2003 2004 winter   Natural gas prices also rose dramatically after Hurricane Katrina  and now stand over  12  more than 140 percent increase compared to last year at this time   EIA  s Short term Energy Outlook reports    The ranges for expected heating fuel expenditure increases this winter are 69 percent to 77 percent for natural gas in the Midwest  17 percent to 18 percent for electricity in the South  29 percent to 33 percent for heating oil in the Northeast  and 39 percent to 43 percent for propane in the Midwest      Heating costs for the average family using heating oil are projected to hit  1 666 during the upcoming winter   This represents an increase of  403 over last winter  s prices and  714 over the winter heating season of 2003 04   For families using natural gas  prices are projected to hit  1 568  representing an increase of  611 over last year  s prices and  643 over 2003 04   States need additional funding immediately to help low income families and seniors to ensure they can afford to heat their homes   States are bracing for potentially crisis conditions caused by the lack of affordable heating sources  particularly for seniors and the disabled           Almost daily  newspapers are reporting on the impacts of higher energy costs for consumers   Hurricane Katrina  s impact on energy markets comes on top of soaring energy prices over the past several years   Utilities from New England to Florida to Oregon are seeking rate increases   In addition to rising energy prices  the economic devastation in the Gulf region is likely to impact the national economy   Many more Americans will need LIHEAP assistance than the 5 million households that received aid during FY 2005   State LIHEAP programs are expecting a major increase in applications due to the rapid increase in home energy prices and this additional funding will allow them to address the need for assistance          Residents and business affected by Hurricane Katrina deserve the nation  s full support and financial assistance  and we stand ready and willing to do everything we can to help    We recognize that the Committee is still working to assess the needs wrought by Hurricane Katrina and will face difficult priorities in determining emergency funding   We feel that preventing hardship for millions of Americans by acting to provide LIHEAP emergency funds before we have another crisis on our hands is an important priority   Thank you for your serious consideration of our request               Sincerely
