September 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Vote to Defund the Mexican Trucking Pilot Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Earlier this year  I wrote a letter to Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters voicing my grave concern over the administration s plan to press forward with its pilot program to allow 100 long haul Mexican trucking companies into the country   In the letter  I noted that the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation had issued a report concluding that the program raised a number of safety and security concerns   I called on the administration to halt the program until the issues that had been raised about the program had been fairly addressed    Months later  a number of serious safety  security and environmental concerns remain   According to the most recent Inspector General report  issued only last week  the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  has not developed and implemented complete  coordinate plans for checking trucks and drivers participating in the demonstration project as they cross the border   Likewise  the Inspector General concluded that information pertaining to vehicle inspections  accident reports  and driver violations maintained by Mexican authorities       were not available from the Mexican authorities or the databases containing such information were still under development     There are also a number of unanswered questions with the program relating to insurance  equipment defects  driving time  and environmental impact   Due to these concerns  the program has drawn the strong opposition of the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety  Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways  Parents Against Tired Truckers  and Public Citizen  as well as numerous other groups   Earlier this year  the House of Representatives voted by an overwhelming margin to deny funding to the program     And yet despite these concerns  the Bush administration has raced to implement the pilot program  just one hour after the Inspector General issued its most recent report   We should not rush to start an initiative that is incomplete and lacking essential protections and where there remain numerous serious and legitimate safety and security concerns   That is why  I cosponsored Senator Dorgan and Senator Specter s amendment to block funding for the program  and why I voted for the amendment this evening
