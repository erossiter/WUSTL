September 4  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Passing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chief Justice William Rehnquist s more than thirty years on the bench were marked by dedication and perseverance even in the face of serious illness   My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time        The Chief Justice s passing leaves the nation with the unique challenge of having to fill two vacancies to the highest court of our land   As I have previously stated  it is incumbent upon the President to consult with the Senate and nominate candidates who are truly guardians of the rule of law who put fairness and justice before ideology
