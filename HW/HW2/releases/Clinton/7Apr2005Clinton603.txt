April 7  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Congressional Attempts to Undo Presidential Helicopter Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I am very glad we were able to stop the back door attempt yesterday in the Senate to undo the Marine One contract for the Greater Binghamton area  Lockheed Martin won it fair and square and the people at the Owego plant worked their hearts out for this project  I think that everybody who worked on this and who will work on it really deserves the opportunity to build the next Presidential helicopter and I am going to do everything I can to make sure we build it right here in the Southern Tier
