                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    Following the recess appointment of Ellen Sauerbrey to head the State Department  s Bureau of Population  Refugees and Migration  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to ensure that this new appointment serves as an opportunity for the United States to sustain its commitment to the health and safety of displaced populations   The recess appointment bypassed the Senate  s confirmation process   In a letter to Secretary Rice  Senator Clinton expressed hope that Ms  Sauerbrey will use her new position to ensure our government provides support for the health needs of displaced women    including reproductive health needs    and increase our cooperation with the United Nations Population Fund  UNFPA              I understand that Ms  Sauerbrey has indicated her interest in reaching out to the many nongovernmental organizations that provide service and support to refugee populations  and I look forward to learning more about the discussions that result from these meetings  Despite my concerns about Ms  Sauerbrey  s statements and history of personal opposition to UNFPA  I remain hopeful that she will use this appointment to reaffirm the commitment of the State Department to providing medically necessary services to refugees and other vulnerable populations rather than using the office to advance a politically motivated agenda     Senator Clinton wrote            The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to Secretary Rice          The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  United States Department of State  2201 C Street  N W   Washington  D C   20520         Dear Madam Secretary          Earlier this week  Ellen Sauerbrey was named as the head of the State Department  s Bureau of Population  Refugees and Migration in a recess appointment  bypassing the Senate  s confirmation process   I urge you to ensure that this new appointment provides the opportunity for the United States to uphold its commitment to the health and safety of displaced populations             In a September 2005 speech before the Heritage Foundation  Ms  Sauerbrey outlined some of the pressing issues faced by vulnerable populations  including trafficking  HIV AIDS  and violence against women   She specifically called for a greater focus on women  s health needs in the developing world   I would hope that in her new position  Ms  Sauerbrey is able to ensure that our government provides support for the health needs of displaced women  an essential part of which are reproductive health needs   In post conflict and emergency situations  where women may be at high risk of violence  rape and sexual assault  it is imperative that they have access to safe childbirth kits  gynecological care  and contraception   Their health needs in these tragedies should not be sacrificed to ideological concerns about birth control          I would also urge Ms  Sauerbrey to use her new position to increase our cooperation with the United Nations Population Fund  UNFPA    While serving as the United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women  Sauerbrey made several statements mischaracterizing the work of the United Nations and the United Nations Population Fund  claiming that it was discouraging childbearing and devaluing the role of parenthood   Despite ample evidence to the contrary  including a 2002 State Department report  Ms  Sauerbrey has also publicly stated that the UNFPA engages in coercive abortion practices in China  when it has instead established non coercive family planning programs in several Chinese counties  Considering that both the United States government and UNFPA engage in vital work to help refugees in post conflict situations  I urge you to correct these misconceptions and use this appointment as the opportunity to reestablish funding for UNFPA programs that would complement the State Department  s efforts to assist displaced persons           I understand that Ms  Sauerbrey has indicated her interest in reaching out to the many nongovernmental organizations that provide service and support to refugee populations  and I look forward to learning more about the discussions that result from these meetings   Despite my concerns about Ms  Sauerbrey  s statements and history of personal opposition to UNFPA  I remain hopeful that she will use this appointment to reaffirm the commitment of the State Department to providing medically necessary services to refugees and other vulnerable populations rather than using the office to advance a politically motivated agenda           Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
