December 11  2006 Clinton Applauds Unanimous Senate Passage of Resolution Calling for Action in Darfur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton hailed the unanimous Senate passage of a resolution she co sponsored to press for the deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur   Senator Clinton also submitted a statement to the Congressional Record underscoring the need for stronger Presidential leadership to address this crisis             The continued violence in Darfur  eastern Chad  and the Central African Republic threatens the lives of millions of civilians and it threatens regional security  The deployment of a robust U N  peacekeeping mission is essential  but a handful of leaders in Khartoum continue to stand in the way   I will continue to press the Bush Administration to take an active role in putting pressure on the leaders in Khartoum   said Senator Clinton          The resolution approved by the Senate underscores that the Government of Sudan has failed its responsibility to protect many peoples of Darfur    It emphasizes that U N  peacekeepers should be urgently deployed to Darfur in accordance with U N  Security Council Resolution 1706    It makes clear that the Presidential Envoy for Sudan has issued a December 31  2006 deadline for Sudan to cooperate with U N  deployment to Darfur  or face serious consequences    The resolution states that strong sanctions should be imposed against those who commit crimes against humanity in Darfur and against the Government of Sudan if it continues to obstruct deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur  the African Union mission in Sudan should be strengthened  and the violence in eastern Chad in the Central African Republic threatens regional security and should be urgently addressed            Senator Clinton has repeatedly called for action to address the crisis in Darfur  Senator Clinton authored legislation that has been enacted into law requiring the President to report regularly on Darfur   Senator Clinton also joined with Senate colleagues to secure additional assistance to the African Union Mission in Sudan   Senator Clinton also has called on the Arab League and African leaders  to increase engagement on Darfur          Click here for additional information on Senator Clinton  s efforts to protect civilians in Darfur        Below is the text of Senator Clinton s statement on Darfur for the Congressional Record       The crisis in Darfur demands a more robust response  In July 2004  more than two years ago  the United States Senate declared genocide in Darfur  As the crisis has continued  as the death toll has mounted  it was hard to believe that the situation on the ground could deteriorate further  Unfortunately  it has  and the realities today are even worse than they were in July 2004          As many as four million civilians have been uprooted from their homes  and by some accounts 400 000 people have been killed  Countless women and young girls are being violently and sexually abused  Escalating violence is forcing the evacuation of many vital relief workers  These realities are well documented  We have U N  reports  State Department reports  reports from our colleagues who have traveled to the region  and countless other reports that tell us what has happened  what is happening  and who may be responsible          In the face of this crisis  the response of many citizens  officials  relief workers  and journalists has been impressive and inspiring  Their courageous efforts are testimony to the great work that can be done by individuals who act on their moral duty to end atrocities          The Senate also has taken important steps  We have provided funding to African Union peacekeepers and to humanitarian workers  we have urged NATO assistance  we have encouraged the establishment of a no fly zone  we have supported sanctions against the perpetrators of violence  we have established Presidential accountability by requiring regular reports on Darfur  and we have demanded the appointment of a Presidential Envoy to Sudan  We must continue to shine a spotlight and to take action wherever possible          But  like many of my constituents  I am disturbed that the killings and rapes and violence continue  I fear that our efforts and those of many Americans are not being complemented by equal efforts from our President  I again urge the Administration to be more proactive  and to turn the tables on Khartoum           Khartoum repeatedly has committed to disarm the Janjaweed  In fact  the Government of Sudan committed to do so long ago  in the summer of 2004  To date  this promise remains unfulfilled  And this Spring  Sudanese officials said that U N  peacekeepers would be allowed into Darfur once a peace deal was agreed  This commitment has been broken also  These abandoned promises may not be surprising in light of Khartoum  s long history of intransigence  What  s astonishing is that Khartoum has faced few consequences for these massive failures  and worse  that Khartoum still is being allowed to dictate the terms of peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in Darfur          I implore the Administration to learn from this grim history  and to get one step ahead of the leaders in Khartoum  We must prepare for all scenarios  not just those we seek          Going forward  our agreements with Khartoum must include some   teeth    to incentivize compliance  We should remind Khartoum that we already have good records of the crimes committed in Darfur and of the suspected perpetrators  We also should pursue without delay all points of pressure that have been authorized by the U N  Security Council  We must demonstrate to Khartoum that continued intransigence will be more painful than cooperation          As we pursue these measures with Khartoum  we should remind rebel groups that they will be held accountable for violations of international law  In addition  we should work urgently with partners to stabilize eastern Chad and the Central African Republic          I suspect that history will pass exacting judgment on all parties who have acted insufficiently to end the suffering in Darfur  But history is a long way off for the people of Darfur  and I will continue to work urgently with colleagues towards peace in Sudan and the region  I urge the President to work more proactively to end this unconscionable crisis
