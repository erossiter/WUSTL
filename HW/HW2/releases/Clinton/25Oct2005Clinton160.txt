October 25  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the 15th Anniversary of the Children  s Television Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC     The Children  s Television Act marked an important step forward in the fight to ensure that parents and children have access to positive educational programming   I was proud to host the first White House Children  s Television Summit and to help pass this landmark legislation   In the fifteen years since passage of the Act  television channels have multiplied  but the challenge facing parents of creating a positive media environment for their children has only increased   We need to make sure that as television outlets increase  we uphold our commitment to providing quality programming for our children   That  s why it  s critical that the unanimous decision by the Federal Communications Commission to expand the Act to digital television effective January 1  2006 proceed on schedule and not be derailed by objections from media companies   By remaining vigilant  the FCC can ensure we mark yet another milestone for our children as we ring in the New Year
