November 2  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Secretary Leavitt  s Release of Bush Pandemic Flu Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC     There is a major flaw in the President  s flu plan    the Administration has once again failed to tell the American people how it will adequately track and deliver vaccines to the people who need it the most   Having faced a flu vaccine shortage in three of the last five years  our nation is simply not prepared to handle a major flu outbreak  let alone a pandemic  Stockpiling is not a public health solution   What good will it be to stockpile vaccines and antivirals if we have no reliable means to make sure we can get vaccines to those who need them most          We need to establish a tracking and communications system  like the one called for in the Influenza Vaccine Security Act I introduced with Senator Pat Roberts  that would allow the federal government  working with state and local health departments  to track vaccine from the factory to the clinic   We need to make sure that healthcare providers  public health officials and all Americans know where local vaccine supplies are  particularly when a pandemic hits          I urge Secretary Leavitt to immediately support our legislation to fix the vaccine delivery system  If we are truly to be prepared for the worst  we need a system that works
