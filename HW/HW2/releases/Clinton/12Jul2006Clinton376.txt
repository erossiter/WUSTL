            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today secured support for Nassau County  s   Get REAL    program and the Hagedorn Hempstead Initiative  with approval by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee of the Fiscal Year 2007 Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations Bill          The Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations bill  is expected to be approved by the Full Appropriations Committee tomorrow  and will proceed to the Senate floor for consideration   Following consideration and passage on the Senate floor  the bill will head into a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between the two bills   At that time  the Conference Committee will provide specific dollar amounts for the projects that received approval today              The most important thing we can give our younger generations is the opportunity to succeed in life  Project Get REAL and the Hagedorn Hempstead Initiative are helping young people see the alternatives to joining a gang or getting involved in violent behavior  These programs are working hard to give young people a chance and I am pleased that we can support them in this way     Senator Clinton said          Get REAL  Redirection Enforcement and Learning  is a three phase approach designed to reduce gang activity and violence in Nassau County   The funding will enhance the opportunities of young people to avoid gangs  provide law enforcement with modern tools to combat gangs and teach students  educators and parents about the nature and danger of gangs and educate them on how to combat gang influence in their communities  To combat gang recruitment and present alternatives to vulnerable young people  the project will provide recreational programs and job opportunities  Get REAL will also provide alternative sentencing programs aimed at rehabilitating young people already charged with gang related crimes  By developing opportunities for in patient treatment  residential educational programs and community service projects  the program will give young people facing sentencing with a chance to forsake their gang life style and avoid the debilitating effects incarceration can inflict on them          Project Get REAL will also involve the assignment of a District Attorney investigator to serve with the New York New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force and the acquisition of sufficient equipment to conduct sophisticated and efficient investigations and to develop and analyze gang related intelligence  It will also involve the acquisition of undercover vehicles to allow more investigators to gather more gang intelligence by conducting surveillances and the utilization of a criminal analyst who will apply the computer resources acquired to delve into the intelligence  The District Attorney  s office will also make presentations to the schools in at risk communities on the dangers of gangs and the consequences of membership and make presentations to parent groups and communities to educate parents about the dangers their children face each day   The final aspect is the creation and maintenance of a web site offering information and training for parents  students and educators on gang activity and the resources available to combat gang influence in their families and community          The Family and Children  s Association will use their funds for capacity building for the Hagedorn Hempstead Initiative to retain full time community outreach specialists at the Hagedorn Family Resource Center  develop and distribute bilingual outreach materials for public awareness  fully establish the Hagedorn Hempstead Advisory Board  solidify a formal relationship with all community stakeholders to ensure a continuum of care for all children and teens in need of services in the Village of Hempstead  expand program services for aging out teenagers who are at risk of gang involvement  drug alcohol use  dropping out of school  pregnancies  and incarceration  and sustain capacity to apply for competitive government grants and research grants from private foundations to address the needs of children  teens and families          The Hagedorn Hempstead Initiative is a unique collaboration between a municipality  school district and private  non profit human service agency   It has already been able to win support from major donors and a healthcare organization to share a common vision   The Hagedorn Center works to reduce violent crimes among children and adolescents   The Center targets academically underachieving children in pre K and elementary school grades and provides effective and early interventions to help divert these children from later involvement in the juvenile justice system  These efforts are helping to reduce and or break the cycles of underachievement among Village of Hempstead children and youth
