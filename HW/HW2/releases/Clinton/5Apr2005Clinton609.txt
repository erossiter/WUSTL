April 5  2005 Statement by Senator Clinton on Head Start                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement following today  s hearing of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee on accountability in the Head Start program          For 40 years  Head Start has improved the lives of children and families in New York and across the country   Unfortunately  some want to undermine this success under the cover of calls for increased accountability   While I strongly believe that we should look for every opportunity to strengthen the program  make it more efficient and more responsive to the families it serves  we must do so from the same point of agreement  Head Start works             The bottom line is that all of the research points in the same direction  Head Start is a success story   It is a cost effective  long term investment for our society and it improves outcomes for poor children and their families             Building on this record of success  the Clinton administration set the standard for accountability in the program  bolstering an already extensive monitoring system   Local Head Start providers are required to meet rigorous standards and the small proportion that fail to achieve these standards are held accountable   We must continue to build on this partnership with local providers by making sure they have the support  training and technical assistance they need to be effective               I remain deeply concerned about the Bush administration  s position on Head Start   The administration has proposed that Head Start be converted from the model that has succeeded for 40 years    direct grants to service providers    and instead create a block grant to states    And despite talk about strengthening performance  the administration has cut in half the very training and technical assistance funds it is supposed to use to help programs succeed               The FY 2006 budget is the second budget in a row in which the administration has proposed a block grant program   As a member of the Senate HELP committee  I helped pass a bill last Congress that rejected the administration  s block grant approach   I will continue to fight the efforts to block grant the program this Congress
