May 25  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Approval of the Head Start Improvement for School Readiness Act Markup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC     Today  the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee unanimously approved a bill to continue the Head Start program  This bill is not perfect  and I am committed to improving it before it becomes law  but I believe it represents a step forward for 49 500 children and families participating in Head Start programs throughout New York         For more than forty years  Head Start has provided comprehensive services to poor families    health  nutrition  academic skills  family literacy and more  Yet  since he took office  President Bush has sought to undermine the program by giving the funds to Governors through a block grant  I am thrilled that the bi partisan bill passed by the HELP Committee today rejects the block grant approach and retains local control of Head Start programs         I am also pleased that this bill dramatically expands Early Head Start  a program created in the Clinton Administration to reach children from birth to age three  We have decades of research about the importance of this stage of development  yet Early Head Start is reaching less than five percent of eligible infants and toddlers         The Head Start Improvement for School Readiness Act continues down a path of strengthening the performance standards and the academic components of the program developed by the Clinton Administration to help make sure children enter school ready to learn  It ensures that every teacher in Head Start will receive 15 hours of professional development annually  and it allows for talented college graduates to serve as mentors and reading coaches for children in Head Start  This is a model that is working effectively in seven sites across New York State  engaging 250 college students  and in 57 sites around the country engaging 2100 students        I do have a number of concerns about this bill  which the HELP Committee has agreed to address before the bill becomes law  First  I remain deeply concerned about the National Reporting System  NRS   Last week  the Government Accountability Office produced a report that calls into question the validity and reliability of the NRS  Specifically  the report says the Head Start Bureau needs to  validat e  component tests and determine e  the reliability and validity of the NRS results across time     and the potential exists that the NRS will produce results that are not useful for program evaluation   I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that the serious concerns unveiled in the GAO report are addressed        Finally  I am concerned about the teacher requirements  which I know are very ambitious and some say unachievable  In New York  where we set high standards for our pre K teachers  the new requirements in the bill would be exceptionally challenging to meet because the bill requires Head Start teachers to meet the same requirements as teachers in state run pre K programs  I think it is critical that we encourage all Head Start teachers to be well trained and have specialized knowledge of early childhood development  but this costs money  Today  too many Head Start teachers earn less than parking attendants  So  I am going to continue to fight for the necessary resources to make these teacher requirements attainable  Taking care of children is vitally important work  I hope we will find support on both sides of the aisle for more funding  Without additional funding  it will be very difficult for Head Start agencies to meet the mandates imposed by this measure        So  I am pleased that we were able to move this bill forward today in a bi partisan fashion and I look forward to continuing to work towards a final bill that is good for New York families
