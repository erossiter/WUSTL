               Washington  DC  Citing a September 23 New York Times article that reviewed more than 15 000 nursing homes across the country  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for a Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation to examine the nation s long term care infrastructure  In a letter to Comptroller General of the United States  David M  Walker  Senator Clinton expressed her concern over accountability and the ability of the states and federal government to provide appropriate oversight and sanctions  and highlighted the decline in the quality of care related to the purchase of nursing home facilities by private investment groups      I am deeply concerned that these new ownership structures may allow private investment firms to effectively control  and profit from  the operations of nursing homes without taking a formal ownership or management stake in the nursing home itself  As a result  these hybrid structures may make it difficult  if not impossible  for federal and state regulators to identify and effectively penalize repeat offenders  Senator Clinton wrote  The vast majority of the nations nursing homes provide quality care to their residents  Clinton emphasized   But the abuses cited in the story are intolerable and we must do all that we can to weed them out and shut them down        A copy of Senator Clintons letter to the GAO follows    The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C  20548   Dear Mr  Walker    An article in the September 23rd edition of The New York Times on the abhorrent conditions in a number of nursing homes across the country reinforces my concern that we are not doing enough to protect and care for our seniors living in long term care facilities   The article documented a troubling trend that facilities which are purchased by private investment groups experience marked declines in the quality of care  alongside cuts in nursing staff and other resources   A review of more than 15 000 nursing homes since 2000 revealed that despite sub standard conditions  these nursing homes and the private investment firms that purchased them have gone largely unsanctioned by federal and state regulators because they have employed complex hybrid ownership structures       I am deeply concerned that these new ownership structures may allow private investment firms to effectively control  and profit from  the operations of nursing homes without taking a formal ownership or management stake in the nursing home itself   As a result  these hybrid structures may make it difficult  if not impossible  for federal and state regulators to identify and effectively penalize repeat offenders   As The New York Times analysis highlighted  regulators may be unaware that the same private investment firm is responsible for many seemingly unconnected nursing home operations   In addition  such ownership structures may obscure how Medicare and Medicaid dollars are being used  enabling nursing homes to inflate their own profits at the taxpayers expense      These revelations come at a time of crisis in our nations long term care infrastructure   Just last year  nearly one in every five nursing homes that received federal funds was cited for serious deficiencies in care   And earlier this year  we learned that  over the past five years  nearly half of the nursing homes that regulators had identified as having an established history of serious medical deficiencies continued to repeatedly fail federal requirements and still receive federal funds     The vast majority of the nations nursing homes provide quality care to their residents   I believe the bad apple practices cited in The New York Times story are the exception  not the norm   Having said this  the abuses cited in the story are intolerable and we must do all we can to weed them out and shut them down       I am confident that the long term care industry can continue to flourish while ensuring our seniors receive the care they deserve   Private investment firms can have a constructive role to play in this market  helping restructure  retool and improve profitability at struggling nursing homes   However  this newly released data linking hybrid ownership structures with serious quality of care deficiencies in our nations nursing homes raises important questions about accountability and the effectiveness of our existing regulatory framework   It also raises the critical issue of how inadequate staffing and a substandard commitment to health professional and paraprofessional recruitment and retention can decrease quality as well as patient and family confidence in the nation s nursing home industry    For this reason  I would ask that you investigate the link between hybrid ownership structures of federally funded nursing homes and poor quality of care   In particular  I would appreciate an assessment of the ownership structures of the 63 nursing homes that the GAO identified in March 2007 as having a history of serious deficiencies in care   Finally  I would ask that you make recommendations on any needed changes to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulatory framework or other federal laws to bring greater transparency and accountability to federally funded nursing homes    I thank you for your attention to this matter   Please keep me apprised of the status of this request    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
