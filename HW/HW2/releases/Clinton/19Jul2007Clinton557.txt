July 19  2007 Clinton Calls on FEMA to Reconsider Its Refusal to Provide Individual Assistance for Delaware County in the Wake of Last Month s Floods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today expressed her disappointment with an announcement by FEMA that they would not be providing Individual Assistance to those affected by the devastating floods in Delaware County  Earlier this month  Senator Clinton had called on President Bush to provide Individual Assistance to those affected in Delaware County     I am very disappointed that FEMA has denied this critical assistance for individuals in Delaware County  The cost of this flooding is not only being felt by the counties and towns  it is also being felt by families and individuals  Senator Clinton said  Public Assistance from FEMA is a good start  but alone it will not provide the needed funding for impacted individuals and families to put their lives back together  Individual Assistance is absolutely essential to helping those affected get back on their feet    According to an announcement from FEMA today  the private sector damage was not of the severity and magnitude to warrant designation of the Individual Assistance Program  FEMA has provided 30 days for an appeal of their decision    Senator Clinton had written to President Bush  asking him to provide the County with Individual Assistance  based in part on the fact that the Town of Colchester is now working under five disaster declarations  and is being forced to absorb the costs of two other floods for which they did not receive disaster declarations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency   The Senator argued that the combined financial burden of these floods is overwhelming for the residents  and Individual Assistance is absolutely critical in helping Colchester residents recover from this disaster
