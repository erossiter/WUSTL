                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator Questions the Move at a Time When Department of Homeland Security is Warning of Possible Terrorist Attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today criticized the Transportation Safety Administration  TSA  for their decision to allow disposable butane lighters on board air flights starting next month  Starting August 4th  air travelers will be allowed to carry on disposable butane lighters  such as Bics  and refillable lighters  including Zippos  In a letter to the TSA today  Senator Clinton questioned the decision and asked why  at a time of heightened security  the agency would be relaxing their ban on flammable cigarette lighters  Senator Clinton expressed her serious concerns about the decision and called on the TSA to reconsider it immediately    The TSAs decision today is extremely disturbing and confusing  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  concluded earlier this year that it is not clear that lifting the ban on items like small knives and scissors would free up more time on the part of screeners  and yet such a decision has the potential to place everyone at risk  Senator Clinton said  The decision by the TSA to lift the ban on lighters while continuing to ban certain liquids  gels  and aerosols is also contradictory and fails to provide the flying public with the security it deserves  The TSAs decision is even more disturbing because it comes at the same time as the Department of Homeland Security is warning about the increased possibility of a terrorist attack this summer    Last year  Senator Clinton successfully sponsored an amendment that required the Comptroller General of the GAO to investigate the impact on public safety and the effectiveness of screening operations resulting from the TSAs decision to allow four inch scissors  six inch tools  and other items back onboard aircraft that were banned after the attacks of September 11  2001   TSAs stated purpose in removing these items was to shift Transportation Security Officers  TSO  to focus on items that TSA felt were are higher threat   The Association of Flight Attendants  the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association  and some airlines expressed their disapproval of these changes  The Amendment was approved as part of the FY 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill that unanimously passed the Senate    As a result of its investigation  the GAO concluded that TSOs spent on average  less than 1 percent of their time searching for those items that they had removed from the list and it may not have been accurate for the TSA to assume that lifting the ban would significantly free up TSOs resources   The GAO report also stated that it was not clear whether the change had any impact on the ability of TSOs to detect explosives  the key and stated goal of TSAs policy change    A copy of Senator Clintons letter is attached    July 20  2007   The Honorable Kip Hawley  Transportation Security Administration  TSA 1  601 South 12th Street  Washington  D C    Dear Mr  Hawley    I write about disturbing reports regarding the Transportation Security Administrations  TSA  decision to lift the ban on disposable butane lighters on August 4  2007      The explanation provided by TSA for lifting this ban is to concentrate resources on detecting explosive threats   I certainly support focusing our resources on detecting explosives threats  but we cannot ignore simple security measures that you have dismissed as security theater      I am certain that I do not have to remind you that the 9 11 hijackers used box cutters and Richard Reid  known as the shoe bomber  tried to ignite a bomb in his shoe on a flight from Paris to Miami   While Mr  Reid was using matches  he may very well have been successful had he used a lighter   As I am also sure you are aware  a recent National Intelligence Estimate  NIE  reports that our homeland is still under heightened threat and our vigilance against this threat remains evermore critical   In addition to the NIE  recent threats and attacks in London and Glasgow indicate that the threat of attack is still ever present    TSAs decision today presents what appears to be a disturbing pattern on the part of the agency   In December 2005  the TSA revised its prohibited items list to allow passengers to carry 1  metal scissors with pointed tips and a blade 4 inches or less in length as measured from the fulcrum  and 2  tools  such as pliers  screwdrivers  and wrenches  7 inches or less in length   The TSAs stated purpose in removing these things from the prohibited items list was to concentrate resources on items considered to pose a higher threat  which is also the explanation given for lifting the ban on lighters   However  a Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation published April 25  2007  found that  it may not have been accurate for TSA to assume that no longer requiring Transportation Security Officers  TSO  to search for small scissors and tools would significantly contribute to TSAs efforts to free up TSO resources that could be used to implement other security measures   The GAOs investigation concluded that it is unclear whether TSAs decision to lift the ban  had any impact on TSOs ability to detect explosives  a key goal for the change      As you know  we must remain ever vigilant when it comes to the security of our homeland   The decision by the TSA to lift the ban on disposable butane lighters while continuing to ban certain liquids  gels  and aerosols is contradictory and fails to provide the flying public with the security it deserves   In light of GAOs investigation  the continued threat facing our homeland  and a travel season that is becoming more and more congested  I urge you to reconsider this decision as soon as possible    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
