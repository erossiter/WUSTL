September 7  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               As General Petraeus prepares to testify before Congress next week  it is clear that the increase in U S  troops in Iraq has simply not led to political reconciliation in Iraq   Rather than continuing the escalation  we must begin the immediate redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq  in order to end this war as soon as possible   I continue to support legislative efforts requiring the Administration to begin to withdraw our troops and to complete the redeployment of combat troops in 2008  and I encourage the Congressional leadership to ensure that we will have an opportunity to vote for such legislation     The President continues to reject the findings of the National Intelligence Estimate  the Government Accountability Office report and the Jones Commission report  refuses to work with Congress to develop a strategy that will enable our troops to start coming home  and stubbornly denies the reality on the ground and the will of the American people  We will continue to press him to follow the will of the people  I will continue to do everything in my power to convince the President to change course and to work with my colleagues in the Senate to bring an end to this war as soon as possible   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
