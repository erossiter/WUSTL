October 12  2007 Congressional Delegation Calls on FEMA to Accept Buffalo s Appeal for Reimbursement of Stump Removal from October Snow Storm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Federal Assistance is Needed to Aid Local Communities Overwhelmed by Costs of Tree Stump Removal from 2006 Storm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  along with Senator Charles Schumer  and Representatives Louise Slaughter  Thomas Reynolds  and Brian Higgins  urged Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Administrator R  David Paulison  to accept the appeal by the City of Buffalo for reimbursement for the removal of tree stumps left behind from the October 12 13  2006 snowstorm  In a letter  the lawmakers expressed their concerns that the thousands of tree stumps that still remain pose a clear hazard to the health  safety and property to the community  However  cities like Buffalo have been overwhelmed by the costs involved with full removal  and federal aid is necessary as they continue on the road to recovery     Instead of marking the anniversary of last years snow storm by celebrating a successful recovery in the wake of the destruction  the citizens of Buffalo are still looking at thousands of tree stumps and we are appealing yet again to FEMA for federal aid  said Senator Clinton  Cities like Buffalo took action following the snowstorm to protect their residents and property by removing hazardous tree limbs and clearing debris  and while there is still much work to be done  it should not be left to the city to shoulder the incredible financial burden  This is why I am urging FEMA to accept the appeal submitted by the City of Buffalo for reimbursement of removal of the tree stumps left behind by last years severe snow storm    FEMAs self proclaimed mission is to assist with response and recovery  yet in Buffalos case  one year after last Octobers devastating snowstorm  this federal agency continues to shrug off accountability  sticking Buffalo residents with the bill to remove these unsightly tree stumps  said Senator Schumer  FEMA should overturn their foolhardy decision and give Buffalo the funding it needs to finish the job  Plain and simple  FEMA cannot wipe its hands and walk away from Buffalo and its residents    Although FEMA provided relief for the City of Buffalo immediately following the storm  there is still much to be done to fully recover nearly a year after the storm  said Rep  Louise Slaughter   These tree stumps littered throughout the city are a problem  and FEMA needs to provide the proper assistance for their removal     Over a year ago  Western New York experienced one of the worst storms in our history  said Rep  Tom Reynolds  Clarence     The city of good neighbors worked together to over come the many challenges we faced  We are still fighting together for what Western New York deserves  While FEMA s response was helpful  there are still a number of issues unresolved and we need answers and solutions not more bureaucratic talk     Stump removal is a significant expense directly related to October Storm and should be reimbursed by FEMA  said Congressman Higgins   While I understand the need for policies that protect against abuses and fraud  I urge FEMA to be flexible in considering the unique circumstances and valid needs resulting from this natural disaster in Buffalo     The snow storm that hit Western New York last October destroyed entire neighborhoods of trees  leaving local communities to clean up debris caused when the trees collapsed under the weight of the snow  While FEMA has been extremely helpful to the City of Buffalo and other cities impacted by the storm  their current stump removal policy does not meet the needs of the region in its effort to fully recover  As a result of the removal of thousands of storm damaged trees throughout Western New York  thousands of tree stumps remain in public rights of way  creating an immediate threat to public health and the safety of the community  The costs for the full removal of these stumps have overwhelmed state and local governments  which is why it is critical that FEMA accept the appeal by the City of Buffalo to provide the necessary federal assistance to the City for the removal of hazardous stumps    A Copy of the letter to FEMA Administrator Paulison is attached    October 11  2007   The Honorable R  David Paulison  Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  United States Department of Homeland Security  500 C Street  S W   Washington  D C  20472   Dear Administrator Paulison    We are writing in regards to the appeal that has been submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  by the City of Buffalo for reimbursement for the removal of tree stumps left behind from the October 12 13  2006 snowstorm   The President issued a major disaster declaration  FEMA NY DR1665  for the area on October 15 and federal aid was made available to the state and local governments to assist in recovery efforts   While FEMA has been extremely helpful to the City of Buffalo and other cities impacted by the storm  the City of Buffalo and others continues to face an extremely large obstacle in its road to recovery as a result of the number of tree stumps left behind from the storm    FEMAs current stump removal policy RP9523 11  Hazardous Stump Extraction and Removal Eligibility  does not meet the needs of the region in its effort to fully recover from the October 2006 snowstorm   As a result of the removal of thousands of storm damaged trees throughout Western New York  thousands of tree stumps remain in public rights of way   These stumps  whether cut flush to grade or left a few inches above grade  pose an immediate threat to the public health and safety of the community   The location of many of these stumps  within the public right of way and primarily between the curb and sidewalk  creates a hazardous condition   During times of light snow cover or when it is dark  it is difficult to see a stump creating a tripping or slip and fall hazard   Additionally  tree stumps left in the ground will rot and create dangerous and unhealthy conditions as they are often infested by rodents and insects   It is in the public interest to remove these stumps pursuant to Sections 403  407  and 503 of the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act      As a result of these stumps and the hazardous conditions that remain  lawsuits stemming from these hazardous stumps have been numerous and costly   New York courts have consistently held that tree stumps located within public rights of way are inherently dangerous   The City of Buffalo has already settled a number of claims for damage to cars and property from tree stumps stemming from the October 2006 snowstorm      The thousands of tree stumps that resulted from the October 2006 snowstorm are not only unsightly  but are clearly dangerous to the health  safety and property to the community   Federal assistance is necessary in order to eliminate or at least reduce immediate threats   The costs for the full removal of these stumps have overwhelmed state and local governments and federal assistance is needed   Therefore we respectfully request that FEMA accept the appeal by the City of Buffalo and provide the necessary federal assistance to the City for the removal of hazardous stumps     Sincerely yours
