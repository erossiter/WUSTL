February 27  2007 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Outlines Plan to Create Strategic Energy Fund to Invest in Clean Energy Technology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   In remarks today to the Apollo Alliance  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for a Strategic Energy Fund to jumpstart research and investment in clean energy technologies to promote job growth  energy independence and a cleaner environment   Senator Clinton announced that today she is reintroducing legislation to help achieve these goals   Senator Clinton s announcement comes on heels of her tour yesterday highlighting innovative energy initiatives underway in New York that serve as a model for investing in an energy independent future           We have a big decision to make  We have two paths we can pursue  We can continue to allow our energy needs to hamstring our national security  We can continue to watch as the impacts of global warming mount  We can sit back and wait for the terrible potential of a terrorist attack to hit a pipeline  to hit a terminal  wreaking havoc on the economy and increasing energy costs for families and businesses   Or we can choose a different  better path based on performance and the facts   not partisanship and ideology   We can choose a path based on a long term strategy to secure our economy  to free our hand to protect our security  and to keep faith with our values   Senator Clinton said           We can and we must meet this challenge head on   Senator Clinton emphasized    As a nation  it is time we take the giant leap in energy innovation we desperately need and that is exactly what the Strategic Energy Fund will do            Senator Clinton s legislation will create a Strategic Energy Fund to help pay for the clean energy transition   The legislation eliminates oil company tax breaks and ensures that they pay their fair share of royalties for drilling on public lands   The legislation also places a temporary fee on major oil company profits that exceed a 2000 2004 profit baseline  The fee would be in place for two years  and companies could offset their fee by investing in alternative energy technologies such as ethanol and wind power   The Strategic Energy Fund would raise  50 billion to fund research  development and deployment of energy technologies that will reduce America s oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions   The Strategic Energy Fund will                Deliver Clean Coal Technology    3 5 billion in tax incentives and grants to build 5 clean coal plants that can capture and store carbon dioxide and reduce global warming                Invest in Renewable Energy  Move America towards the goal of producing 25 percent of electricity from renewable sources by extending the production tax credit for generating electricity from wind and other renewable sources for five years               Transform America s Vehicles  Put more efficient vehicles on the road by quadrupling consumer tax breaks for hybrids  clean diesel  and other advanced vehicles  creating incentives for auto manufacturers to retool their facilities  and putting  500 million towards advanced battery research to speed development of  plug in  hybrid vehicles                 Accelerate Homegrown Biofuels  Extend the ethanol tax credit until 2012  and speed the development of cellulosic ethanol by providing loan guarantees for the first billion gallons of commercial production capacity  and providing  2 billion for research               Improve Efficiency  Increase incentives to make homes and offices more comfortable and cheaper to operate by improving energy efficiency                 Unleash American Ingenuity   Accelerate energy research by creating a  9 billion  Advanced Research Projects Agency  for energy          Senator Clinton s announcement comes on heels of her tour yesterday highlighting innovative energy initiatives underway in New York   In spotlighting these initiatives  Senator Clinton emphasized that the federal government should step forward to help expand and jumpstart efforts to pursue cleaner forms of energy             What we are proving in New York is that the energy challenge is not a zero sum game   said Senator Clinton    By pursuing these opportunities  we can grow the economy and shrink our dependence on foreign oil  We can slow global warming and speed the creation of good new jobs  We can protect our security and protect our environment           In Rochester  New York  Senator Clinton unveiled a  Greenprint  developed by local leaders and the U S  Green Building Council   The Greenprint is a roadmap for Rochester to become a leader in energy efficiency and green design  and to continue creating jobs in energy technologies like fuel cells   Senator Clinton toured a facility in Tonawanda  New York  where plans are underway to make it the first coal plant in the United States to use next generation clean coal technology to sequester and store carbon dioxide   She also visited a biofuels facility in Volney  New York  which is turning an old shuttered brewery into New York s first ethanol plant   The plant will be the largest in the Northeast  delivering 100 permanent new jobs  hundreds of opportunities in construction  and countless more new jobs indirectly  all the while helping us make the switch from foreign oil to homegrown  farm grown energy               Read   the full text of Senator Clinton s remarks    Listen to Senator Clinton discuss her plan on a
