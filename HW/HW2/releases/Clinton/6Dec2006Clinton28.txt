December 6  2006 Clinton  Markey  Scientists  Advocates Call for Action to Increase Research on Risk Factors for Alzheimer  s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   who co chairs the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer s Disease with Senator Susan Collins  R ME   today joined with Representative Edward Markey  D MA   scientists and advocates to highlight research on risk factors for Alzheimer  s disease  Senator Clinton spoke of the need for increased research funding to determine causal links between lifestyle measures and Alzheimer  s  The Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer  s Disease briefing highlighted what is currently known about brain health and reviewed how lifestyle measures including diet and exercise may relate to risk of developing Alzheimer  s               Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the U S  population  with the third largest population of older Americans residing in New York   As the Baby Boom generation ages we will see a dramatic increase in the number of Alzheimer  s cases in New York and across the country     Senator Clinton said    It is critical that we take steps now to lessen the future burden and improve the quality of life for our nation  s seniors               People who are struggling with Alzheimer s disease and their families are heroes  but even heroes need help  That is where the Alzheimer s Association and researchers come in to give those families help and to give them hope for a cure and a better future  When Alzheimer s strikes  families feel powerless to stop the inevitable progression of the disease   Making changes to our diets and exercising can keep our brains healthier and preserve our health   It will also empower families and combat those feelings of helplessness that Alzheimer s creates  Let us all continue to work together to reach that day when children will have to turn to their history books to find out what Alzheimer s Disease was   Representative Markey said           While scientists do not know exactly what causes Alzheimer  s  they have identified certain risk factors including age  family history and genetics that increase the likelihood of developing the disease   More recently  a growing body of evidence suggests that lifestyle measures aimed at improving the health of one s brain may also play a role in reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer   disease  a progressive brain disorder that affects 4 5 million Americans over age 65 today          Although additional research is needed  several recent studies strongly support previous findings that mid life physical activity and diet affect an individual  s intellectual performance as well as their chance of developing Alzheimer  s later in life   In addition  preliminary evidence suggests that a combination of physical  mental  and social activity may help protect against dementia            At the briefing  attendees heard from Richard Mayeux  M D   Gertrude H  Sergievsky  Professor of Neurology  Psychiatry and Epidemiology  and the Director of the Gertrude H  Sergievsky Center at Columbia University  and Marilyn Albert  Ph D   Director of the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience in the Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Co Director of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer  s Disease Research Center   Dr  Mayeux is one of the lead researchers on a recent study that shows the Mediterranean diet  MeDi  reduced the risk of Alzheimer  s in study subjects   Dr  Mayeux discussed the findings of the MeDi study  as well as the effects of genetics and environmental factors on the risk of Alzheimer  s   Dr  Albert  who co authored the book   Keep Your Brain Young    with her husband  discussed diagnoses and treatments for Alzheimer  s  how exercise impacts brain health  and the National Institute of Health  s  NIH  recent contributions to research on the relationship between emotional health and cognition              There are 4 5 million Americans over the age of 65 living with Alzheimer  s today and that number is expected to soar to as many as 16 million by 2050     says Harry Johns  President and CEO of the Alzheimer  s Association    If we don  t take steps to stop this disease  it will overwhelm the nation  s Medicare system in less than 25 years   The Alzheimer  s Association applauds the Congressional Task Force for helping to make Alzheimer  s a priority and educating members of congress about the impact that mid life physical activity and diet can have on overall brain health               The existing data about the beneficial effects of diet and exercise interventions on brain health is extremely promising but  we must remain focused to ensure we fully explore the potential for prevention  treatment and cure     said Senator Clinton     Providing scientists with the resources they need to identify all of the factors that contribute to Alzheimer  s will allow us to delay the onset of this disease  slow its progression and minimize the human toll on families and the great strain on our health care system             Since joining the Senate  Senator Clinton has worked tirelessly on behalf of senior  s programs and Alzheimer  s research   This past September  her efforts to strengthen the Older Americans Act were successful when the legislation passed the Senate and was signed into law   Senator Clinton  s interest in helping all individuals affected by Alzheimer  s led to her leadership as lead sponsor of the Lifespan Respite Care Act  which would improve caregiver health services   Senator Clinton has also secured a budget amendment to restore funding for critical seniors programs and Alzheimer  s research at NIH
