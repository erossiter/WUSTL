September 25  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Port Security Grant Funding Announced Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC      It is encouraging that the Department of Homeland Security grants announced today boost port security funding for the New York region   New York continues to be a top target for terrorist attack and port security is a vulnerability that must be addressed   However  the funds are no where near what is needed to truly address our port security needs   Port security is being shortchanged by this administration   Earlier this year the Senate supported an increase of  1 billion in the budget for port security funding and the President ought to include this funding in next year  s budget   Homeland security continues to be full of gaping holes   It is past time for the Administration to dedicate the resources needed for homeland security
