July 26  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Exxon Mobil s Announcement of  10 3 Billion in Second Quarter Profits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Exxon Mobil has yet again posted quarterly profits of more than  10 billion   American consumers continue to struggle to pay higher energy costs because the oil companies have refused to invest in refinery capacity or alternative energy sources  Instead of lining the pockets of big oil  we need a new direction in energy policy that rewards innovation  creates jobs  and reduces our dependence on foreign oil  What I have proposed is that we eliminate oil company tax breaks and use that money to create a Strategic Energy Fund to speed development of biofuels  get more efficient cars on the road  and fund research into cutting edge energy technologies  By taking these steps  we can finally get on the path to energy independence
