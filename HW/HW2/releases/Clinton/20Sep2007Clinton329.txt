September 20  2007 Letter to Constituents from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Iraq Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Dear Constituent    Thank you for contacting me with your concerns regarding Iraq  As you indicate  the situation there is very serious and is a major and constant focus of mine   I believe that the President should abandon his escalation of the war in Iraq and offer a change in course to his failing strategy  In January  the President announced his surge strategy to create space for Iraqi political reconciliation  This has not happened  Unfortunately  rather than changing course in Iraq  it seems that the President intends to portray an unavoidable reduction in U S  troops  who have done everything we have asked of them and more  to pre surge levels as a marker of progress  Redeploying over the next year five of the twenty combat brigades currently deployed in Iraq will mean that one year from now  there will be the same number of troops in Iraq as there were one year ago  That is simply too little  too late  and unacceptable to the Congress and the American people  As Commander in Chief  the President has the authority to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq  to bring so many more of our troops home much faster   In the Senate  I will continue to seek responsible ways to force the President to change course and begin to bring our troops home  In May  I announced that I would join with Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia in co sponsoring legislation to set an expiration date of October 11  2007 for the authorization for the use of force in Iraq  I believe that a full reconsideration of the terms and conditions of that authorization is overdue  This bill would do just that by requiring the President to ask Congress for a new authorization if the Administration seeks to continue the war  Also in May  I voted against a second version of the supplemental appropriations bill because it failed to compel the President to give our troops a new strategy in Iraq  I fully support our troops  and wish that the President had followed the will of the American people and signed the original bill Congress sent to the White House in April  which would have both funded the troops and set us on a new course of phased redeployment   I have also called on both Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Peter Pace to brief Congress on any existing contingency plans for the withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq  or to provide an explanation as to why such plans have not been properly created  In August  I followed up on this request by introducing legislation to require that the Pentagon prepare a report and briefing for Congress on this issue that is critical to the safety of our troops  Congress must be sure that we are fully prepared to withdraw our forces without any unnecessary danger  We cannot afford to repeat past failures  such as not planning adequately for the conflict and failing to properly equip our men and women in uniform   As you may know  I most recently traveled to Iraq in January to assess the situation there firsthand  I expressed my gratitude to our troops on the ground and met with Iraqi leaders and U S  commanders  I came back from the trip more determined then ever to stop the President s escalation  and to start the long overdue redeployment of troops  One month after returning from that trip  I introduced the Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act to halt the President s escalation policy and to provide an alternative strategy to stabilize the country  a strategy that would enable the President to end the war before he leaves office    Specifically  my bill would cap the number of troops in Iraq at the level before the Presidents escalation  It would be against the law to send more  The legislation also sets out to protect our troops  who are performing heroically  by prohibiting the use of funds to send them to Iraq unless they have the proper equipment and training  This is critical in light of Februarys Department of Defense Inspector General report  which concluded that the U S  military is still failing to adequately equip our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan    My bill also aims at putting real pressure on the Iraqi government  requiring them to make political progress on key issues  such as ensuring that the Iraqi security forces are free of militia or sectarian influence  or lose funding for their military and reconstruction  Such provisions would increase our leverage with the Iraqi government and send the message that there are consequences for continued inaction    Finally  my legislation would require the Bush Administration to both begin a phased redeployment  which I have been advocating for almost two years  and convene an international conference of Iraqs neighbors  to reduce regional interference in internal Iraqi affairs and encourage more countries to contribute to Iraqs extensive needs  within 90 days  If the administration fails to meet these requirements  a new Congressional authorization would be required to remain in Iraq    Thank you again for sharing your concerns regarding the extraordinarily difficult situation in Iraq  As New Yorks first Senator to serve on the Armed Services Committee  you can be sure that I will continue to address the war with the utmost attention and concern  For more information on this and other issues being discussed before the United States Senate  please visit http   clinton senate gov  I am most appreciative that you took the time to be in touch about a topic as important as Iraq      Sincerely Yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton    Thank you for contacting me with your concerns regarding Iraq  As you indicate  the situation there is very serious and is a major and constant focus of mine   I believe that the
