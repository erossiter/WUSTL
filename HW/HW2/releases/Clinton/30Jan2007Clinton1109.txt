January 30  2007 Senator Clinton Questions Admiral William J  Fallon  Nominee for Commander  United States Central Command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Senator Clinton  Thank you Mr  Chairman  Welcome Adirmal and welcome to your family  We are very pleased to have you before this committee and I thank you for your years of distinguish service to our country           I know that you  re in the process of confirmation and that it may be difficult to give specific answers to some of these questions because you are not yet confirmed and you haven  t had the opportunity to really get a first hand view for yourself   But if I could Admiral  one of the issues that concerns me and I think other members of this committee  regards the lack of unity of command for the Iraqi and US forces that will be operating in and around Baghdad  In fact  we  ve heard from both Retired General Jack Keane and General Petraeus  their concerns about what this means and I  m having trouble getting to the bottom of this because General Petraeus sounded somewhat surprised about it and reflected some of his concerns  And General Keane  who apparently was very active in helping to devise the plan the President has put forth  also said that it was very dangerous and frustrating not to have unity of command  Can you shed any light on this decision for our committee       Admiral Fallon   Senator  not yet   But this is clearly a very significant  critical item  We  ve gotta know exactly who  s reporting to whom  for what purposes  and I would expect that General Petraeus will have this at the top of his list out there  There are ways to do this  as you well know  but we have got to make sure that the lines are straight if we  re going to be effective         Senator Clinton  I would appreciate that and I welcome the openness that both you and General Petraeus have exhibited to the committee and I hope that we can hear from both of you in short order about this  I hope we can hear that it  s been fixed because some of the stories coming out of the fighting on Haifa Street  the recent large engagement near Najaf have certainly raised serious questions about the Iraqi military  s capacity to take actions which we thought they were capable of and certainly we don  t want to put our young men and woman into harm  s way with that level of confusion           Secondly Admiral  I asked General Petraeus  which was really more of a plea  some characterize as a prayer  that we not send our new troops into Baghdad without being fully equipped and ready   There have been a number of articles in the last week and there  s one today in the Washington Post about how equipment for the added troops is lacking  We are short thousands of vehicles  armored kits and other equipment   We do not have the capacity to quickly turn around that equipment  and in fact   Lieutenant General Speakes has said that we  re gonna have to be pretty much improvising  trying to share equipment  which I find deeply troubling   I  m also concerned that the United States has agreed to sell 600 up armored Humvees to Iraq this year for security forces and again quoting General Speakes  saying that    Such sales better not be at the expense of the American soldier or Marine     Again Admiral  do you know anything yet about whether or not we are going to have the equipment for these additional combat brigades       Admiral Fallon   Senator  I do not know the details of that  I can tell you that in the Pacific Command there has been a request made for us to look at the equipment that we have in this region and to send some of this to the Middle East  equipment that might be appropriate to the soldiers and marines that are heading in that direction            I know from my experience that the units are not all equipped in the same manner  particularly the army units  which have diverse background  some are light infantry  some are heavier and they have different types and varieties of vehicles   I found it interesting  from a professional side when I was in Iraq  as I traveled around the country recently  to note the differences between the units  And the question thought occurred to me that it would be interesting  and I  d like to find out the answers  of just how one goes about using these different equipment sets in different situations as we rotate troops from one area to another  how effective they are and so forth  So I have it in my mind  and would like to take this up with General Petreaus  to do an assessment of what essential things are necessary to put our people in the best possible position   So we  ll do that as soon as we can       Senator Clinton  I appreciate that Admiral and I would hope that perhaps the committee would send a very clear message to Secretary Gates and the Pentagon that we want that assessment done as quickly as possible and that whatever actions need to be taken in order to provide the necessary equipment be done so  I don  t want  and I know everyone of us doesn  t want  to hear stories about continuing lack of equipment costing American lives and injuries such as those we saw yesterday when we were both at San Antonio           Finally Admiral  this question about the diplomatic aspect of this assignment that you have undertaken is one that I  m very interested in because we all know that there  s no military solution  there  s no military solution in Iraq  there  s no military solution in Afghanistan   How do you see your role and what tools do we have at our disposal  on the one hand to try to assess and reign in Iranian influence in the region  and on the other end of your area of responsibility  to create better relations and working conditions between Pakistan and Afghanistan  Could you just briefly respond those please       Admiral Fallon  Senator  very interesting area  wouldn  t presume to dive too deeply into this pool yet because I don  t know enough detail  but a couple of observations from the outside            There  s a lot that isn  t being done  In fact  I see an awful lot of sitting  watching by the neighborhood and it  s high time that changed  So I  d be very anxious to try to engage and intend to engage with our Department of State  Secretary Rice and her folks  to have a full understanding of this and then maybe we can figure out collectively how to proceed            Regarding Pakistan Afghanistan   having been operating on the other side of the boundary if you would  between theaters   I  ve had a chance to watch the Indian Pakistan dynamic now for a couple of years and I see change and it  s for the better and I believe that this change could potentially be very helpful to the situation in Afghanistan and perhaps even in Iraq  As Pakistan and India slowly are taking steps to reduce tension along the boarder in Kashmir  by the way  it  s pretty fascinating and a shame for the world  I believe to note  there are almost a million and a half troops facing each other along this boarder  But steps are being taken in the right direction and I think the potential to have tensions continue to ease ought to give us some opportunities to  perhaps have the Paks do even more than they  re doing  and they  ve done a phenomenal amount on this War on Terror  but I think things could be done that would be additionally helpful in Afghanistan  And the Indian ties to Iran and their energy needs  and ties in other places in the region  I think could potentially be exploited  So I  d be anxious to talk with our State Department colleagues and to see what might be done in this area   Thank you Senator          Read more statements by Senator
