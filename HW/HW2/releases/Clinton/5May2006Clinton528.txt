May 5  2006 Senator Clinton Announces  14 6 Million for Defense Projects to Benefit Central New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Funding for New York included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee      Bill also includes provisions to address continuing pay problems for wounded soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized  14 6 million in Defense and Military Construction projects that will benefit Central New York  including  6 6 million in Military Construction funding for NEADS Support Facility  s Phase II construction   5 million for Lockheed Martin Radar System  s AN TPS 59 Low Earth Orbit Satellite  LEOS  Tracking System   1 5 million for Rome ITT    MASINT Warfighter Tools Project and  1 5 million for Source Sentinel  s Detection of Biological Agents in Water Project   The bill also contains a provision to name the new laboratory building at the Air Force Research Site in Rome  NY in honor of retiring Rep  Sherwood L  Boehlert  R New Hartford             The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2007 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill yesterday   The passage of the bill marks the first stage in the Department of Defense appropriations process  Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor before heading into the appropriations process  The House of Representatives passed their version of the bill Wednesday            This bill is important not only for our potential military capabilities  but for New York  s economy  In addition to enabling our soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines to have the best training  the best equipment and the best facilities in the world  it makes a number of significant investments in local technology and local companies  which is always welcome     Senator Clinton said    New York companies are already developing the cutting edge technology that will take our military into the future  I am pleased that we can continue to support them and the local economy with these kinds of meaningful investments              Senator Clinton also announced that the bill contained a number of highlights for New York  including            The preservation of over  200 million in funding military construction projects for New York which were included in the President  s Budget and which Senator Clinton fought hard to maintain           The preservation of funding for the VH 71A Presidential Helicopter Program  Lockheed Martin Owego is the prime contractor on the program  and          The inclusion of a provision  which Senator Clinton proposed  to name the new laboratory building at the Air Force Research Site in Rome  NY in honor of retiring Rep  Sherwood L  Boehlert  R New Hartford    Rep  John M  McHugh  R Pierrepont Manor  also secured a companion amendment in House defense authorization legislation              During his distinguished Congressional career  Sherry Boehlert has been the foremost champion in Congress of the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome   With his impending retirement from Congress  it is only fitting that we name the new laboratory building after Congressman Boehlert     said Senator Clinton          The bill also included two important amendments that Senator Clinton sponsored to force the Department of the Army to address serious concerns regarding pay issues of wounded soldiers and to analyze troop readiness          In a continuing effort to ensure that those who have given so much are not further burdened with resolving pay account issues  Senator Clinton  s wounded soldier pay audit amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a toll free call assistance center focused on providing wounded members of the Armed Forces  or their primary next of kin  with help relating to military pay issues   The Senator  s amendment also requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers   pay accounts and report back to Congress in 120 days   As recently as April 26  2006  a Government Accountability Office report found that nearly 1 300 battle injured soldiers and soldiers killed in combat in the first 4 years of the Global War on Terror  had incurred a total of  1 5 million in debt   Press reports have also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness   totaling more than  600 000   on the basis that the debt was wrongly charged  This is just the latest in a series of actions taken by Senator Clinton on this significant issue as the treatment of wounded soldiers remains one of her top priorities   In the past  she has called on Congress to hold hearings  written to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army to investigate specific cases  and called for reviews of the broader problems with the pay process  particularly as it applies to those wounded in a combat zone            I am deeply troubled  as I think we all should be  about continuing reports of soldiers who have been withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues and have experienced payroll problems or have been wrongly charged for certain services or equipment   It is simply unacceptable that we should be billing our soldiers for debts wrongly incurred or exacerbated by bureaucratic pay and personnel systems     Senator Clinton said     We must do everything in our power to avoid placing wounded soldiers in the position of having to resolve payroll problems or to request debt forgiveness  These warriors are recovering from the injuries they sustained while they were fighting for our country and they should not have to deal with this kind of additional burden             Senator Clinton  s amendment addressing our military  s readiness is part of a continuing effort to study the current state of our ground forces and better highlight where Congress should focus its efforts to ensure the continued preparedness of our Army and Marine Corps            I am concerned about the strain on the ground forces of our Nation  s military and their ability to continue at the current pace in Iraq  Afghanistan  and other theaters of operation   We must continue to focus on recruiting and retaining our forces  training and equipping them in a manner that ensures they are able to meet today  s challenges and future requirements     Senator Clinton said          Local funding details include        1 5 million for Source Sentinel    Detection of Biological Agents in Water      The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  1 5 million in funding for Source Sentinel to further their project on Detection of Biological Agents in Water   This project will support the research  development  application and commercialization of basic and applied research to deploy biosensors to protect water and air systems against man made natural toxin incursion with near real time alert  information fusion and automatic manual response reaction in order to assure protection of municipal water supplies   If implemented successfully  the project has the potential to provide detection and alert capability for the over 4 000 uncovered reservoirs and 15 000 water treatment facilities nationwide   Designed to be deployed on a buoy  on a submerged fixture or in a potable water pump station  the device provides continuous real time monitoring via air and water quality sensors that are able to detect and provide ample near real time warning of the presence of agents that are potential biological terrorism agents  These technologies will be able to provide ample near real time warning of the presence of inorganic and organic chemicals and specific bacteria in air or water  and will provide an integrated response system that aids an alerted operator in the conduct of the correct emergency action plan measures and procedures in the event of a toxin incursion into the air and water supply from before or at the intake        1 5 million for Rome ITT    Masint Warfighter Tools      The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  1 5 million in funding for Air Force Research Laboratory  AFRL  Rome Research Labs and ITT Space Systems Division to further their Measurement and Signals Intelligence  MASINT  project   MASINT offers huge benefits in identifying obscured and hidden targets  but the near term challenge is to integrate MASINT into existing and future information processing systems in a way that enables users to manage and display the information in time to take action   MASINT gathers measurements from unintentional radiation  effluent and debris sampling  acoustic signals  non visible imaging and other sources and then subjects that data to specialized processing in order to transform it into actionable intelligence for both national command and tactical users   This funding would allow the AFRL Rome Research Site to build upon the initial success of the MASINT Visualization Tools Program and allow an expansion into newer less mature techniques such as hyperspectral  acoustic and overhead non imaging infrared   It will also expedite the integration of MASINT into the information architectures of other national security agencies         5 million for Lockheed Martin Syracuse   AN TPS 59 Low Earth Orbit Satellite  LEOS  Tracking      The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  5 million in funding for Lockheed Martin    Syracuse to continue their work on the AN TPS 59 Low Earth Orbit Satellite  LEOS  Tracking system   The U S  Marine Corps AN TPS 59 is a 360 degree  tactically mobile missile defense radar   To improve the protection of U S  Forces  the U S  Marine Corps will build upon this performance in air and missile defense by extending its capability further into the Joint environment   The Joint environment will have a network of many different sensors from all service branches observing the battle space   Low Earth Orbiting Satellites  LEOS  provide an additional reference point that improves track identification and registration accuracy   In the network centric environment  this capability improves performance and reduces the risk of track misidentification and fratricide   The AN TPS 59 has shown in experiments that it has the capability to detect and track Low Earth Orbiting Satellites  however this capability has not been integrated into the AN TPS 59s in the field   Successful development and deployment of AN TPS 59 LEOS tracking capability will allow the AN TPS 59 to keep pace with the rapidly evolving Joint warfighting environment essential to the future of our Armed Forces        6 6 million in Military Construction funding for NEADS Support Facility  s Phase II construction      The Armed Services Committee bill includes  6 600 000 above the President  s budget to complete Phase II construction of the Northeast Air Defense Sector Support Facility   This facility requires a new Support facility to replace aging facilities  which are currently not co located  and improve force protection of assigned resources   This is a two phase construction project with Phase I having been approved and supported with  3 million in FY 06 military construction funding   The Northeast Air Defense Sector is located on the former Griffiss Air Force Base   Unit personnel are housed in three different locations   Relocating the Headquarters building inside the SOCC Compound and moving personnel from Depot 1 to this building will improve protection of NEADS personnel and facilities
