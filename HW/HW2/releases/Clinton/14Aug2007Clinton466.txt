August 14  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Today s Recall of Toys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  I am dismayed to learn of yet another recall of toys containing lead based paint  the second in this month alone   These recalls are evidence of lapses in our system of safeguards that have allowed millions of children to be exposed to these hazards  and jeopardize the gains we have made in reducing lead poisoning in the United States   Earlier this month  I asked the President to appoint a qualified  unbiased individual to act as the Chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   a post that has been vacant for more than a year   In order to protect our children  we need to have a strong and active CPSC  not an agency that is understaffed and without permanent leadership   I also believe that we need to take greater action to protect our children  and tighten lead safety standards to ensure that our children will not be exposed to this hazardous substance in their toys   Todays recall should be a wake up call to all of us  and I urge the President to take immediate action to ensure the safety of our consumer goods and bring peace of mind to parents around the country    The following is the text of Senator Clintons recent letter to the President     August 2  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC 20500    Dear President Bush    I am writing to express my concern over several recent cases of unsafe levels of lead detected in childrens toys  These discoveries have resulted in the recall of approximately three million toys worldwide  and have caused great uncertainty and anxiety among American parents  While the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  has worked with the companies involved to announce recalls of these toys  I believe the CPSC needs to be strengthened to adequately protect American children from lead paint hazards    Lead poisoning is a serious  persistent  and entirely preventable threat to a childs health   Childhood lead poisoning has been linked to impaired growth and function of vital organs and problems with intellectual and behavioral development   At very high levels  lead poisoning can cause seizures  comas  and even death  robbing a child of his or her future   Furthermore  a recent well publicized study has linked lead hazard exposure in childhood to violent behavior later in life     Since 1978  when lead was banned from house paint  our country has made gains in reducing lead exposures  Yet more than 300 000 children in our nation are estimated to have elevated blood lead levels  and these toys put millions more children at risk   Furthermore  many of these toys include familiar characters  including those from the popular Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer television programs  aimed at young children  who often learn by putting things in their mouths   We must take all necessary measures to ensure that the products we buy for our children are free of lead contamination     The CPSC should have three commissioners to carry out the agencys important consumer protection activities  with one of them acting as the chair  For over a year  the agency has been operating without the leadership of a permanent chairman  and is trying to carry out its activities with only two of the three commissioner positions filled  After waiting roughly eight months to nominate a commissioner  your nominee was forced to withdraw his name from consideration after concerns were raised about possible conflicts of interest that would limit his ability to act in the American consumers best interest  We must give the CPSC the authority and resources needed to protect our children and families  and I would urge you to appoint a qualified  unbiased commissioner to act as the Chair of CPSC as soon as possible    It is shocking to me that the gains we have made in reducing lead hazard exposure are in danger of being overturned due to these unsafe toys  and I believe we cannot let this public health danger remain unchallenged   I look forward to working with you to ensure the CPSC has every tool necessary to reduce and prevent exposure to all products that pose threats to our children    Thank you    Hillary Rodham Clinton
