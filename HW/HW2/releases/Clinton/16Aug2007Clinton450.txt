August 16  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Department of Homeland Security Announcement of Anti Terrorism Funding for New York City                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clinton Welcomes  52 Million for New York Area but Says DHS Must Do More to Ensure Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The  52 million in anti terrorism grant funds for the New York City area is a positive step for a region that continues to be a high risk target for terrorism  but unfortunately the Department of Homeland Security has yet to allocate the resources the city requires to keep New Yorkers safe   The findings in the most recent National Intelligence Estimate said that our homeland is under a heightened threat environment and Al Qaeda is undiminished in its goal in attacking us here at home   The threat towards large urban areas like New York City continues to be high and it is critical that we remain vigilant   As recommendation number 25 of the 9 11 Commission report stated  it is imperative that we direct our homeland security resources to those areas that are most vulnerable and most at risk
