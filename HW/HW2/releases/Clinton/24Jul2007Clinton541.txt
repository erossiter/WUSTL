July 24  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Increase in the Minimum Wage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  Today  the federal minimum wage will increase for the first time in a decade    This is a real and momentous victory for millions of working families who are struggling to make ends meet    Under legislation the Democratic Congress passed earlier this year  the minimum wage will rise 70 cents to  5 85 an hour today  and then again each year until it reaches  7 25 an hour in 2009   This pay increase will make a tangible difference in the lives of millions of hard working Americans   Women in particular will benefit from the increase   Nine million women earn the minimum wage    59 percent of all minimum wage earners    many of them struggling to support families   Today s increase provides workers an extra  1 400 a year to help pay for groceries  housing  energy costs  health care and all of the other necessities of every day life    However  this must be only the first step toward lifting up working families who have been falling behind for too long   Even with a  7 25 minimum wage  a family of five with a full time  minimum wage earner that receives food stamps and the refundable tax credits would fall  1 139 below the poverty line   I am eager to work with my colleagues on new legislation that indexes the minimum wage  so that working families do not need to wait ten long years for another increase   And I look forward to continuing to work with them on a broader Democratic agenda that invests in our workers and creates opportunity again for all of our families   Today s wage increase is a critical first step towards that goal
