                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator Offering an Amendment to Stop the Cuts from Going Forward   Proposed Staff Cuts would Affect New York Facilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  Following reports of cutbacks to the Federal Protective Service  FPS  Senator Clinton announced today that she has filed amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill  which is on the Senate floor this week  to prevent further cutbacks and restore the number of officers to a minimum of 1 200 in service Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors  and Special Agents  Senator Clinton also sent a letter to Department of Homeland  DHS  Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  expressing her concerns about the current plan to significantly reduce the size of the Service     The proposed downsizing plan would affect the security at government buildings in New York State  many of which are considered high risk facilities  In New York  the FPS is responsible for many sites including Federal Buildings like 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan and local air control facilities    These proposed staff cuts are clearly inconsistent with the ongoing threat that New York faces  said Senator Clinton   It is confusing at best that at the very same time that the Department of Homeland Security is warning us about the growth of al Qaeda and a possible terrorist attack on American soil this summer  they are also cutting staff for the only federal agency that is tasked with protecting the thousands of non military federal buildings throughout the United States   The Deputy Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security said that further reductions in the FPS could lead to uneven effects across the nation  perhaps place some facilities at risk   We are all tragically and painfully aware that our federal facilities have been the target of attacks before and we must do everything we can to protect them for the future    The Department of Homeland Security s  DHS  Federal Protective Service  FPS  provides law enforcement and security services to over one million tenants and daily visitors to federally owned and leased facilities nationwide  The FPS oversees approximately 15 000 contract security guards   The DHS plans to reduce the size of their federal police officers and staff from 1 150 to 950     Senator Clintons amendment to the DHS Appropriations Bill would halt the DHSs attempt to further downsize the Federal Protective Service   It requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the workforce of the FPS includes no fewer than 1 200 Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors and Special Agents engaged on a daily basis in protecting federal buildings  The amendment also requires the Office of Management and Budget and DHS to adjust security fees as necessary to ensure full funding of not fewer than 1 200 in service Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors  and Special Agents at the Federal Protective Service     The full text of Senator Clinton s letter appears below    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C  20528   Dear Mr  Secretary    I write to express my strong concerns regarding the Department of Homeland Securitys  DHS  ongoing plan to reduce the size of the Federal Protective Service  FPS     As you are aware  the FPS is the only federal agency that is tasked with protecting the thousands of non military federal buildings throughout the United States   A substantial number of these federal buildings are located in New York  including 26 Federal Plaza  the federal court complexes in lower Manhattan  and Plum Island Animal Disease Center  a level 3 biohazard site    Following two hearings on the future of the FPS  the House of Representatives recently included a provision in the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 that halts the reduction of personnel of the FPS pending the completion of a report by the Comptroller General on the proposed reduction  as well as Senate and House hearings on the report    Notwithstanding these developments  the Administration continues to press forward with its plan to eliminate and reassign hundreds of FPS personnel   After the 1995 terrorist bombing at the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City  the General Service Administration and Congress concluded that FPS required 1 480 field personnel   This year  DHS reduced FPS personnel to less than 1 200  and will reduce it further to 950 for 2008   I understand that the Department of Homeland Security is planning to eliminate almost all of the FPS police officer positions throughout the country  and has already begun to end night and weekend shifts and    24 hour patrols in New York City and other areas throughout the nation      I am deeply concerned that the DHS s rash and unnecessary steps will seriously jeopardize our nations security   The recent terror plots at Fort Dix and John F  Kennedy International Airport  JFK  demonstrate that the threat of a terrorist attack in this country  and particularly in New York  continues to be very real   Now is not the time to be substantially reducing the size of our essential federal security agencies    I look forward to hearing from you about this very important matter     Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
