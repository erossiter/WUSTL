which was approved by the House on December 18  2005  was approved unanimously by the Senate today and will now head to the President for his signature          The bill calls on the Joint House Senate Committee on the Library to accept a donation of a bust of Sojourner Truth  no later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of the bill  to be displayed in a suitable permanent location in the U S  Capitol Building            It is past time that we honor a woman who  despite all of the hardships she faced  was a tireless advocate for women  s rights  Sojourner Truth deserves to be represented in the United States Capitol Building along with others who have been recognized for their work in the women  s suffrage movement     said Senator Clinton    I am very pleased that the House and now the Senate have approved this legislation so that we can establish a permanent memorial in the U S  Capital to this true American hero and role model               Sojourner Truth was a leader in the abolitionist movement and a groundbreaking speaker on behalf of equality for women     Senator Specter said    I am pleased to see her honored for her contributions to the women  s suffrage movement with a monument in the United States Capitol Building                The recognition by the Congress that Sojourner Truth  one of the nation s greatest women s rights leaders  should be honored in the Capitol is both well deserved and long overdue  Her great advocacy on behalf of women  despite all the hardships she faced  makes Sojourner Truth truly deserving of representation along side the other the great suffragists depicted in the Portrait Monument  So speaks the Congress of the United States  Passage of this important measure also is a fitting tribute the late Dr  C  Delores Tucker  past President of the NCBW  whose efforts helped make this achievement possible     stated Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee          Isabella Baumfree was born into slavery in New York  s Hudson Valley in 1797  After gaining her freedom in 1826 she moved to New York City and by 1843 had changed her name to Sojourner Truth   For much of her adult life she traveled the country preaching for human rights   After attending the 1850 National Woman s Rights Convention  Truth made women  s suffrage a focal point of her speeches  portraying women as powerful  independent figures   Her most famous speech   Ain t I A Woman   given at the 1851 Women s Rights Convention in Akron  Ohio  has become a classic text on women s rights   Sojourner Truth was a powerful figure within several additional national social movements  including the abolition of slavery  the rights of freedmen  temperance  prison reform  and the termination of capital punishment          Sojourner Truth died November 26  1883 in Battle Creek  Michigan   She has since been inducted into both the Michigan Women  s Hall of Fame  1983  and the National Women  s Hall of Fame  1981  in Seneca Falls  New York   A United States Postage Stamp was dedicated in her honor at the Sojourner Truth Library in New Paltz  New York  on February 5  1986            A copy of the bill is included below         109th CONGRESS  2d Session  H  R  4510  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES    ________________________________________       AN ACT      To direct the Joint Committee on the Library to accept the donation of a bust depicting Sojourner Truth and to display the bust in a suitable location in the Capitol           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled       SECTION 1  FINDINGS       Congress finds as follows         1  Sojourner Truth was a towering figure among the founders of the movement for women s suffrage in the United States  and no monument that does not include her can accurately represent this important development in our Nation s history         2  The statue known as the Portrait Monument  originally presented to Congress in 1920 in honor of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote and presently exhibited in the rotunda of the Capitol  portrays several early suffragists who were Sojourner Truth s contemporaries but not Sojourner Truth herself  the only African American among the group       SEC  2  ACCEPTANCE AND DISPLAY OF BUST OF SOJOURNER TRUTH IN CAPITOL        a
