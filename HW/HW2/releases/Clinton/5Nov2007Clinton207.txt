November 5  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Declaration of Emergency Rule in Pakistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I oppose General Musharrafs declaration of emergency rule   America stands with Pakistanis in their struggle for democracy and against terrorism   But arresting opposition leaders  suspending the constitution  and suppressing human rights can only undermine the struggle against extremism   I call on General Musharraf to cancel the state of emergency  restore the Constitution  release arrested opposition leaders  and hold free and fair elections on schedule     The failed policies of the Bush administration are part of the reason we are in this difficult and dangerous position   The policies of this administration have diverted resources and attention from the fight against terrorism on the Afghanistan Pakistan border  while inciting radical elements inside Pakistan   We now find ourselves having to cope with yet another threatening challenge made worse by the failed policies of this President
