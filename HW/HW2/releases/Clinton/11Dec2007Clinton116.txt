December 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the U S  Ratifying the Hague Adoption Convention                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  I am pleased that the United States will ratify the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption tomorrow  By doing so  our nation   the world s leader in international adoptions   will join more than seventy nations committed to uniform policies  procedures and safeguards to ensure as many secure international adoptions as possible  By signing this treaty  we will help smooth the way for tens of thousands of people looking to build loving families through adoption  According to the State Department  over the past seven years  Americans have adopted almost 120 000 children from overseas  Many more would have adopted  but have been hindered by the bureaucratic process of international adoption      This news has been long awaited  and I have been a strong advocate for moving towards this day  The United States signed the Hague Convention in 1994  In 2000  my husband signed into law the Intercountry Adoption Act  which provides for the implementation of the Convention regulations  In October  I sent a letter to Secretary Rice urging the Department of State to complete the rule making process to enable the US to ratify the Convention  I also joined my colleagues in urging President Berger of Guatemala to work swiftly towards implementing the Convention regulations to help the more than 3 000 children whose prospective adoptions have been placed on hold   It is my hope that the Guatemalan government continues its efforts to implement a Hague compliant system  I also joined with a Senate coalition in sending a letter to UNICEF requesting they join the Hague Permanent Bureau and the United States Department of State in publicly supporting the processing of pending adoption applications to allow for a smooth  timely  and transparent transition to the Hague Convention for Guatemalan children and their future families     For more than thirty five years  I have worked as a mother  an advocate  a lawyer  a First Lady and a Senator on behalf of children in America and around the world  As First Lady  I worked with Congress to establish the Adoption Incentives program  which has more than doubled the number of children adopted out of foster care  In the Senate  I strongly supported legislation  which has become law  to reauthorize the Adoption Incentives program while providing stronger incentives for the adoption of children with special needs and older children  I also co sponsored legislation to increase the tax credit for special needs adoptions from  6 000 to  10 000 and the tax credit for non special needs adoptions from  5 000 to  10 000  I will continue to be a strong advocate for streamlining the adoption process in  order to help more children find the permanent  loving families they deserve
