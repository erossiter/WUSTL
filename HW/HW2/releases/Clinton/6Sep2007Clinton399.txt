September 6  2007 NY Senators   Tri State Reps  Seek Answers from Bush Administration Following Resignation of 9 11 Health Task Force Chair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC  Following Dr  John Agwunobis resignation on September 4th as Chair of the Bush Administrations 9 11 Health Task Force  Senators Charles Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  and Reps  Carolyn Maloney  D NY   Jerrold Nadler  D NY   Vito Fossella  R NY   Ed Towns  D NY   Christopher Shays  R CT  and Frank Pallone  D NJ  today wrote to Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael Leavitt and asked if he intends to name a replacement for Dr  Agwunobi in the near future  In their letter  click here for a copy of the letter   the lawmakers also asked when HHS intends to release its plan to medically monitor and treat everyone exposed to toxins released by the collapse of the World Trade Center towers  The Administration needs to fully fund without further delay the health care  treatment  and testing of the thousands of selfless first responders who didnt hesitate for a moment to answer our nations call for help in the days  weeks  and months after 9 11  said Senator Schumer  With the sixth anniversary of 9 11 fast approaching  the federal government must step up to the plate and give these heroes the help and support they need and deserve  This Administration continues to let our first responders down  We have seen government officials come and go while thousands of people still suffer  Our 9 11 heroes deserve a real commitment from the Federal government  rather than empty promises and musical chairs  I hope that Secretary Leavitt will not allow personnel changes to prevent him from coming to us very soon with a solid  comprehensive commitment to our ailing Ground Zero workers  volunteers  area residents  office workers and students  Senator Clinton said  Six years after 9 11  with thousands sick and many dead from Ground Zero toxins  the Administration still has no plan  no one in charge  and no answers  said Congresswoman Maloney  I am disappointed that the Administrations point man on 9 11 health is taking off for a job with Wal Mart without delivering a federal 9 11 health plan  We will not rest until we have in place a comprehensive federal program to monitor everyone exposed to the toxins and treat anyone whos sick as a result  The Bush Administration is asleep at the switch  said Rep  Nadler  While thousands continue to suffer from the health consequences of 9 11  Dr  Agwunobi failed to get the 9 11 Health Task Force to act  Now  he is leaving the Administration with little to show for his efforts  President Bush and Secretary Leavitt need to exercise true leadership now and finally provide for the health care needs of first responders  residents  area workers  and school children affected by the collapse of the World Trade Center  Rep  Fossella said  It is important that a replacement be appointed quickly to ensure there is continuity and no lapse in Dr  Agwunobi s work  The need for a federal plan of action grows more important every day as responders and residents fall ill as a result of the breathing the air at Ground Zero  Our nation s unsung heroes have waited too long already for the federal government to develop a plan to ensure that everyone exposed to these toxins have access to monitoring and treatment  Once again the incompetence of this Administration is revealed  said Congressman Towns  There s no plan in place and to add insult to injury  there is now a lapse in personnel since the former Assistant Secretary for Health decided the grass was greener at Wal Mart  Nearly six years after the cataclysmic attacks on the World Trade Center  shock waves still emanate from Ground Zero  Diverse and delayed health problems continue to emerge in those exposed to the contaminants and psychological stressors unleashed on September 11  2001  First responders and residents exposed to toxins need effective care and they  regretfully  have not yet gotten it  It s time for a comprehensive plan to provide monitoring  treatment and support  said Congressman Shays  Six years of administration foot dragging must end  Pallone said  The Bush administration needs to finally prioritize the health of 9 11 rescue and recovery workers by quickly replacing Dr  Agwunobi and finalizing the WTC Task Force recommendations  We need a plan in place so that we can help treat and monitor these workers who accepted the call to serve their nation after its darkest day  Background In a meeting with lawmakers last year  Secretary Leavitt announced that he was creating a 9 11 Health Task Force chaired by Dr  Agwunobi  then the Assistant Secretary for Health  In January 2007  the New York area delegation received word that the Administration had included  25 million for 9 11 health issues in the President s Fiscal Year 2008 budget  At that time  Administration officials told the lawmakers that this funding was a placeholder  or down payment  until Dr  Agwunobis Task Force finalized its plan on how much additional funding would be needed  Though the Administration stated that its plan would be completed by February 2007  it has yet to share any plan with Congress or the American public   In April 2007  Sens  Schumer and Clinton and Reps  Maloney  Nadler  Fossella  Towns and Shays sent a joint letter to Secretary Leavitt after Dr  Agwunobi refused in testimony before Congress and in correspondence to provide further information on the Administrations plan  To date  the delegation members have not received a response from Secretary Leavitt
