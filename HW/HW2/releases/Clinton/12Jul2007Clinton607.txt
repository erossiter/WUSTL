July 12  2007 Byrd  Clinton Press for End to Iraq War Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Legislation De Authorizes Iraq War by the Fifth Anniversary of the Original Vote  Washington  DC   The resolution that gave President Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq is outdated and should be de authorized   That is what U S  Senators Robert C  Byrd  D W Va   and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D N Y   are asking their colleagues to help them do   by the fifth anniversary of the original vote    On October 11  2002  the Senate voted to provide President Bush the authority to use military force against Iraq in order to stop the development of weapons of mass destruction  to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein  and to give the Iraqi people the opportunity to create their own government   Those goals  the Senators maintain  have been achieved   That authorization has run its course    The 2002 resolution is hopelessly outdated   The fight that Congress approved is not the fight we have in Iraq today   We should end that out of date authorization  Byrd said   The President talks about a new mission in Iraq   If he believes this new mission  is worthy of the continued sacrifice of our troops and their loved ones  he should define it  tell the country his plan for success  make his case  and then let the people decide   But continuing along the road of policing a civil war in Iraq is not what the Congress approved in 2002    The American people have called for change  the facts on the ground demand change  the Congress has passed legislation to require change   It is time to sunset the authorization for the war in Iraq   If the president will not bring himself to accept reality  it is time for Congress to bring reality to him  said Clinton  an original co sponsor of separate legislation offered by Senators Carl Levin  D MI  and Jack Reed  D RI  requiring the Secretary of Defense to commence the reduction of U S  troops from Iraq within 120 days and allowing the Secretary of Defense to deploy or maintain members of the Armed Forces only for specific missions    Byrd and Clinton  both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee who serve with Chairman Levin and Senator Reed  made their appeal in a letter to all 100 Senators  the text is below   and in an op ed that ran earlier this week   They plan to offer their proposal to repeal the 2002 use of force resolution to legislation in the Senate next week as a complement to the Levin Reed legislation      As their letter states  If the Byrd Clinton amendment passes along with the Levin Reed amendment  the President would have to seek new authority for any missions beyond those permitted in the FY 2008 Department of Defense Authorization Bill   The Administration would have to explain to the public why our young men and women should be sent into the middle of a fight between religious factions and explain why we should continue to devote  10 billion each month to this fight    And as their joint op ed stated  Today  more than 150 000 members of our armed forces are caught in a civil war  According to the Pentagon  overall levels of violence in Iraq have not decreased since the surge began  The last three months have been the deadliest period for American troops since the start of the war  It is time for the waiting to end and for our troops to start to come home    The text of their letter to colleagues follows     July 12  2007   Dear Colleague    Today we filed an amendment to the FY 2008 Department of Defense Authorization Bill which would sunset the authorization for the Iraq War effective October 11  2007  five years to the day after the original authorization vote      You will find attached a recent op ed that we published in the New York Daily News which lays out the arguments in favor of deauthorizing the war      Our amendment is designed to complement the Levin Reed amendment requiring the Secretary of Defense to commence the reduction of U S  troops from Iraq within 120 days and allowing the Secretary of Defense to deploy or maintain members of the Armed Forces only for specific missions   The Byrd Clinton amendment contains a specific provision which states that nothing in the amendment shall be construed as preventing missions that are specifically permitted in the National Defense Authorization Bill for 2008    If the Byrd Clinton amendment passes along with the Levin Reed amendment  the President would have to seek new authority for any missions beyond those permitted in the FY 2008 Department of Defense Authorization Bill   The Administration would have to explain to the public why our young men and women should be sent into the middle of a fight between religious factions and explain why we should continue to devote  10 billion each month to this fight     As our op ed states  today  more than 150 000 members of our armed forces are caught in a civil war   According to the Pentagon  overall levels of violence in Iraq have not decreased since the surge began   The last three months have been the deadliest period for American troops since the start of the war   It is time for the waiting to end and for our troops to start to come home     Sincerely     Robert C  Byrd   Hillary Rodham Clinton   Read the
