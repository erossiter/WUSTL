            New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congresswoman Louise Slaughter today welcomed news that the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York has awarded over  1 2 million to help fund seven major housing projects across New York through its Affordable Housing Program  AHP   The AHP is a competitive grant program that helps finance the development of affordable housing for moderate  low and very low income households          Sadly  affordable housing is becoming increasingly scarce across New York and the country   Senator Clinton said   I am thrilled that the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York has decided to award these grants and give these communities more resources as they work to provide low income families with the opportunity to secure affordable housing and purchase homes of their own          In addition to their immediate investment value  these grants will help leverage funds from federal  state and local agencies and the private sector to stimulate investment in affordable housing   Senator Clinton said   This funding will provide a real boost  not only for the creation of more affordable housing but for the revitalization of neighborhoods and the realization of home ownership dreams         Congresswoman Slaughter said   These grants will play a vital role in the economic revitalization of Rochester and Buffalo  while at the same time  providing much needed affordable housing for those Americans left behind by the Bush Administration          Slaughter added   We can only create a true  ownership society  if we strive to provide the working poor with a real opportunity to buy into the American dream  The Home Loan Bank System of New York does just that and is turning dreams into reality for thousands of hardworking New Yorkers
