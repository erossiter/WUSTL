June 2  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Foiled Terror Plot at JFK Airport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Today s announcement that local  state and federal officials disrupted a terrorist plot to attack JFK International Airport is a testament to the hard work of the dedicated law enforcement officers who worked hand in hand to make these arrests  Today s news reminds us that we must continue to remain vigilant in the face of the threats to our country  They underscore the need to promote and to foster interagency cooperation and to provide all levels of law enforcement with the tools they need to continue the fight against terrorism here at home   This case also painfully highlights that critical measures like screening airport employees continue to lag behind and we cannot become complacent in the face of continued threats to our nation
