July 11  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on President Bush to Provide Individual Assistance to Flood Ravaged Areas in Delaware County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to provide Individual Assistance to those affected by the devastating floods in Delaware County last month   In a letter to the President  Senator Clinton asked him to expand the current funding to make Individual Assistance Grants available to the impacted areas    The Senators letter follows the recent announcements by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  of a Major Disaster Declaration for Delaware and Sullivan Counties   FEMAs declaration provides Public Assistance to the flood ravaged communities  and provides funding statewide for Hazard Mitigation Programs  but not Individual Assistance Grants    The cost of this flooding is not only being felt by the counties and towns  it is also being felt by families and individuals  Senator Clinton said   Public Assistance from FEMA is a good start  but alone it will not provide the needed funding for impacted individuals and families to put their lives back together   Individual Assistance is absolutely essential to helping those affected get back on their feet   I hope the President will see how tough this situation has been and issue a declaration to provide Individual Assistance to Delaware County as soon as possible    Under the current FEMA Disaster Declaration  state and local governments and certain nonprofit organizations will be eligible for Public Assistance from FEMA for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the flooding   These Public Assistance Grants will be available for projects in both Delaware and Sullivan Counties   The Disaster Declaration also provides Hazard Mitigation Grants statewide  aimed at providing funding for actions taken to prevent or reduce long term damage risk from natural disasters    A copy of Senator Clintons letter follows    The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    As you are aware  on June 19  with almost no warning a series of thunderstorms dropped six to eight inches of rain in the span of three hours near the border of Sullivan and Delaware Counties  causing devastating flash floods   This flooding destroyed roads  bridges and homes in the Town of Colchester      At Governor Spitzer s request  which both Representative Gillibrand and I supported  you issued a disaster declaration which provides both Public Assistance to the affected areas and a statewide Hazard Mitigation Grant Program   I applaud your swift decision in issuing this declaration and essential funding   However  the area is in need of more   In line with Governor Spitzers request  I would also urge you to provide Individual Assistance to the affected areas as soon as possible      The Town of Colchester received eight inches of rain in less than two hours   The rains affected two roads in Colchester  County Route 7 and town road Holliday Brook   Miles of road washed out and six miles of the town road were completely demolished   Lives were lost  homes were washed off their foundations  and residents were left stranded     The damage wrought by these storms was nothing short of devastating   The concentrated destruction in the Town of Colchester requires a thorough effort by the federal government to supply the Town with necessary assistance    Colchester is now working under five disaster declarations  and is being forced to absorb the costs of two other floods for which they did not receive disaster declarations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency   The combined financial burden of these floods is overwhelming for the residents  and Individual Assistance is absolutely critical in helping Colchester residents recover from this disaster    I thank you for your immediate consideration of this critically important matter   I look forward to your quick response    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
