April 17  2007 Senators Clinton  Schumer and Menendez Call for Federal Funding to Fight Asian Longhorned Beetle Infestation In New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Funds will Support Efforts to Completely Eradicate Infestations by 2014                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Following reports of new infestations of the devastating Asian Longhorned Beetle  ALB  in Queens and Staten Island  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer and Robert Menendez  with the support of Senator Frank Lautenberg  are calling for sufficient federal funding to help eradicate the beetle in parts of New York and New Jersey  In a letter to the Senate Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee  the Senators requested  48 million in federal funds to help stop the infestation           Reports that infestations of the Asian Longhorned Beetle have spread across New York City and New Jersey demand that we act swiftly and effectively   said Senator Clinton   The Asian Longhorned Beetle poses a severe threat to New York City  with a potential to wipe out nearly half our city s trees at a cost of more than  2 billion  It is essential that we provide adequate financial support for our efforts to eradicate this dangerous and costly infestation            Across New York City  we ve already seen firsthand the devastating toll these voracious creatures can have on our city s trees and parks   said Senator Schumer   With thousands of trees in the City and on Long Island already dead  and a new quarantine called on Staten Island  it is no exaggeration to say that if additional money is not secured to eliminate the Asian Longhorned Beetle  we run the risk of losing millions of trees in New York State that clean our air  cool our climate  attract thousands of tourists  and improve the overall quality of life  We must act swiftly to ensure that the USDA s elimination program is adequately funded  in order to provide it with all the weapons it needs to permanently eradicate this invasive species            Without proper action to combat them  these beetles have the potential to cause serious environmental and budgetary damage  They re killing our trees and hitting us in the wallet  and they should be stopped   Senator Menendez said          First discovered in Greenpoint  Brooklyn in 1996  the beetle is characterized by its nearly endless appetite for hardwood  already destroying over 8 400 trees  The beetle puts 35 percent of American urban trees at serious risk  at a combined replacement value of  669 billion  The threat is even greater in New York City  with 47 percent of its 5 2 million trees susceptible to Asian Longhorned Beetle infestation           In their letter to the subcommittee  the Senators asked for  48 million to be included in the FY 2008 Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration  and Related Agencies Appropriations bills to be dedicated to the eradication of the Asian Longhorned Beetle  The Senators also welcomed the support of Senator Lautenberg  D NJ    Senator Lautenberg  who is a member of the Appropriations Committee  expressed his support for this funding and will work with the Appropriations Committee on this issue          Although relatively easy to stop and eliminate once found  identification of infestations remains difficult with a limited number of inspectors available  The U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  has been conducting programs to eradicate the Asian Longhorned Beetle  With an annual appropriation of  48 million  sufficient resources would be provided to eradicate the Asian Longhorned Beetle by 2014          The full text of the Senators  letter to Chairman Kohl and Ranking Member Bennett is as follows          Dear Chairman Kohl and Ranking Member Bennett     As you move forward with the FY 2008 Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration  and Related Agencies Appropriations bills  we respectfully request that you include  48 million for the eradication by the Asian Longhorned beetle  ALB              The ALB is a devastating pest of hardwood trees including maple  elm  willow  poplar  and birch   The ALB  first discovered in the New York City area in 1996 and subsequently in Illinois and New Jersey  is a local  regional  and national environmental threat   The ALB is active in nine counties in New York and New Jersey and has already destroyed over 8 400 trees   In the United States  35  of all urban trees are at risk  at a combined replacement value of  669 billion   The need to increase resources to combat the ALB is paramount            The U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  program has been conducting programs to eradicate the ALB   The ALB has not been detected in Illinois since 2003 and while gains have been made in Illinois  the threat of the ALB in New York and New Jersey is severe   47 percent of the 5 2 million trees in New York City are susceptible to the infestation of ALB with an estimated the replacement value of these trees at  2 2 billion   On the basis of forested areas  New Jersey could lose 25 4  of its tree cover or 250 million trees if the ALB is not eradicated           An annual appropriation of  48 million will provide the resources needed for the eradication of ALB by 2014   Failure to provide the resources to eradicate the ALB will result in the extended duration of this eradication program and the loss of thousands of trees   A shorter duration of this program provides less opportunity for the ALB to spread naturally or through the movement of infested host material that would result in the need for additional resources            We are pleased that our colleague  Senator Frank Lautenberg  who is a member of the Appropriations Committee  has also expressed his support for this funding and will work with the Appropriations Committee on this issue           We thank you for the consideration of this request           Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Robert Menendez
