in the world economy     said Anne B  Pope    Our work with Microsoft is a model for the kind of public private partnerships that are vital in bringing technology and advanced telecommunications services and skills to Appalachian communities           The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self
