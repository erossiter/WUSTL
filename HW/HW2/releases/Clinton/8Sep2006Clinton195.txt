September 8  2006 Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Progress Since 9 11  Protecting Public Health and Safety of the Responders and Residents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today delivered the following remarks at   Progress Since 9 11  Protecting Public Health and Safety of the Responders and Residents     an oversight hearing of the U S  House of Representatives Subcommittee on National Security  Emerging Threats  and International Relations into federally funded programs that register  screen  monitor and treat individuals who were in the vicinity of the World Trade Center  WTC  following the September 11 terrorist attacks           Transcription of her remarks as delivered          I want to acknowledge and thank Congressman Shays  Congresswoman Maloney  Congressman Fossella  Congressman Nadler and Congressman Weiner   They have been part of our bipartisan New York regional team to bring this issue to public attention and to work until we obtained support for those who are suffering for the consequences of their exposure to the toxic stew at the World Trade Center site and at Fresh Kills   I also want to thank Lillian Roberts  the Executive Director Of DC 37 for welcoming us to your home and all the labor leaders who are here who have been absolutely instrumental in pursuing the struggle to get attention to the needs of so many thousands of responders  workers  volunteers and residents  And all of the people who have been directly affected   those who did respond  those who worked  those who lived and those who volunteered   thank you for being here and being part of this important hearing   I also want to recognize and thank some of the people with whom I have worked on this for now nearly five years   I see Dr  Kerry Kelly and Dr  David Prezant in the audience   they were among the very first to sound the alarm on behalf of the fire department  the fire fighters and fire officers   I will never forget Dr  Kelly  s extraordinarily vivid testimony before the committee in the senate on which I sat  within weeks of 9 11  about what the physical and mental challenges and stresses confronting the firefighters would be going forward because of their experiences  I also want to thank Dr  Robin Herbert and Dr  Steven Levin who among the very first to take up this cause  working out of Mount Sinai to try to help create a system to conduct the monitoring and screening that would give us the evidence that we needed to support what we could see  feel  smell  and taste ourselves  that what happened  with the collapse of the buildings  with the implosion and sending into the atmosphere  the pulverized concrete  the miniscule glass shards  the asbestos particles and so much else  was going to impact  over many years  the health and well being of thousands and thousands of men and women          We  re about to have the fifth anniversary of this horrible event  and we will rightly recognize and honor the sacrifice and commitment of our first responders  who conducted the greatest rescue mission in the history of the world   It is not in any way an overstatement to suggest that probably 35 000 people  s lives were saved because we had brave men and women who went in to danger on behalf of others   It is also going to be a time for us to take stock in our country as to what lessons we have learned  what work we are doing to ensure our safety going forward  and whether we are honoring our commitment to those who were affected  directly and indirectly  by the events of 9 11            The work that commenced from the very moment the first plane hit was hazardous and difficult  and for as long as nine months  you had first responders  trade and construction workers and others who were working amidst the dust and the fog and the smog  a toxic mix of debris  smoke and chemicals  From the very first visit that I made  within 24 hours of the attack  I met people who were emerging from that dark curtain of hell  covered with the results of the collapse of the building   Standing there with other public officials  I could feel and smell what they were working in   It was clear to us that these were not healthy working conditions and that the air was not safe to breathe   Unfortunately  different assurances were provided  and there wasn  t a concerted effort to try to convince obviously committed workers on that pile to wear whatever respiratory protection devices were available     Starting in October of 2001  I began with the support of people like those whom I  ve mentioned  along with Dr  Phil Landrigan  one of the nation  s experts on the environmental impact of various working conditions and exposures on people  s health  to advocate for a program to monitor and screen those who had been exposed  and to make sure that the fire department had the resources it needed to conduct its own monitoring and screening  which was fully appropriate because they had the information available from before 9 11 that they could compare to post 9 11 health conditions            I was very grateful that we were able to secure  12 million dollars in December of 2001 to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program at Mount Sinai   When it was obvious that that money was woefully inadequate  we all worked together to get an additional  90 million dollars to expand the number of workers and volunteers who were eligible   This week  the report was released  and it confirmed our worst fears  and it confirmed an earlier report of the fire department  s study that also confirmed our worst fears   thousands  I would say tens of thousands of first responders  workers  volunteers and residents had experienced mental and medical health problems   You know the litany all too well  asthma  bronchitis  persistent sinusitis  laryngitis  and for these individuals  their illnesses are a constant reminder of that terrible day and of the days and weeks and months later   But so many had much more serious illnesses develop  and we are only beginning to understand the extent of those            You will hear from some witnesses on the first panel who tell their stories or the stories of their loved ones   And the prayers and love and compassion that were offered in the wake of 9 11 were a wonderful tribute to our and our resilience  but it is not enough   It is not enough to say we stand with our police officers  or our fire fighters  or our iron workers  or our laborers or anyone else   Words at this point  nearly five years later  are really inadequate   That is why we must stand up for and obtain the support and the resources required to treat those who are suffering            I was proud to work with DC 37 and others who as a coalition  tried to get the resources we thought we needed   We secured money  more than  100 million for medical screening and health monitoring  and then there was a dispute over the money  the  125 million altogether   We made an allocation   50 million for workers comp claims related to the 9 11 attacks and  75 million for long term medical and mental health needs            Just yesterday  the group before you  along with some other of our colleagues met with Secretary Leavitt   They made a promise to us that the  75 million  which has been sitting in the federal treasury that has been designated to get out to help people  will finally be delivered   And we are going to hold him to that promise   We  ve heard these promises before and if promises counted for anything  everybody would be taken care of by now because we  ve have more than our fill of them  and we  ve got make sure that this time the money is delivered   I want to thank Dr  John Howard  who was put in the position of helping to move this along at the federal level  given no staff  no budget and he  despite of considerable obstacles has been a real support to those of us waging this struggle            So we hope out of this hearing will come a greater awareness even than we have now  a greater commitment than we have had until now  and an absolute rock solid decision that we are going to get the help we need from all levels of government  for everyone who requires it   There is nothing we can do to turn the clock back  There is nothing we can say to comfort those who  ve lost loved ones   And there is very little we can say to help the young men and women who  on September 10th  five years ago  were running marathons and lifting weights and just feeling full of vigor and vitality  who today can hardly breathe   One thing I know for certain is that we cannot rest until we put into place a system to take care of every single person who was affected by 9 11   I thank my colleagues  and I particularly thank the witnesses and all of those who have worked so hard to make the progress on this important issue   for what we  ve done up until now  but lets keep going  We have a long way to go  we  ve miles to go  and promises to keep          Thank you very much
