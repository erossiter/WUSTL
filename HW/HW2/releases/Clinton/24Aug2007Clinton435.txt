August 24  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Concerning Entergy s Continued Failure to Meet Siren Deadlines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Senator to call on FEMA Inspector General to conduct an investigation into what went wrong                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   More than two years after we passed a law requiring a new siren system to be put in place  and more than six months after the original deadline  Entergy has announced that the new system is ready  Unfortunately  because the full set of test data was not submitted until yesterday  there was no way that the August 24 deadline could be met  That is unacceptable  and I will be asking the DHS inspector general to evaluate what went wrong In addition  I urge FEMA to conduct a thorough review of the test data to ensure that the system meets applicable standards  as public safety is paramount Should the NRC find fault with Entergy s actions  I would urge FEMA to use any enforcement flexibility available to them to redirect fines to local governments for emergency preparedness  I also remain convinced of the need to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment at Indian Point as I believe that the best way for Entergy to demonstrate its confidence in Indian Point is to invite independent inspectors inside to examine the plant alongside the NRC   Since September 11th Senator Clinton has worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  including the siren system  Senator Clinton added a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to install a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated failures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power  That provision was signed into law in August of 2005  and the NRC set a January 2007 deadline for having the system operational  Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th  and subsequently missed the deadline  NRC fined Entergy  130 000 and Senator Clinton announced that she would sponsor Senate companion legislation to a bill to be sponsored in the U S  House by Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D Westchester Rockland  and Congressman John Hall  D Hudson Valley   that would steer fines levied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for safety violations to counties surrounding nuclear facilities in order to assist them with emergency planning     Senator Clinton has also continued to call for the NRC to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment  ISA  at Indian Point and has introduced legislation to require an ISA at the plant
