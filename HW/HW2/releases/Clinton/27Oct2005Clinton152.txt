October 27  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Withdrawal of Harriet Miers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I hope that the President honors the Constitution  s mandate and seeks the   advice and consent    of the Senate as he considers his next nominee to serve on the Supreme Court   Whomever he chooses must be a guardian of the rule of law who puts fairness and justice before ideology    I urge the President to take seriously the Constitution  s charge and to engage the U S  Senate    both Republicans and Democrats    in a process of genuine consultation in order to identify and ultimately confirm a consensus nominee
