August 17  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on BRAC Commission to Reject Proposed New York Base Closures as They Begin Final Deliberations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator argues that new information makes the case for all of New York  s bases even stronger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    As the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission prepares to begin its final deliberations  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on the Commissioners to seriously consider the strong case she and others have made for preserving New York  s military installations  In a letter to Chairman Principi and the members of the Commission  the Senator said that the case for the bases has become even stronger since the Commission began its work  pointing out a number of factors that had been revealed since its June 27  2005 regional hearing          As the Commission begins its final deliberations  I urge the commission to keep open the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and the Rome Defense Finance and Accounting Service facility   I also urge the Commission to preserve the Sensors Directorate at the Rome Air Force Research Laboratory and four C 130 aircraft at the Stratton Air National Guard base in Scotia     Senator Clinton said in her letter         With respect to the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station  the Senator pointed out that with the 914th Airlift Wing based at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station voluntarily remobilizing  for duty in support of on going operations in the Central Command Area of Responsibility    their third tour so far    it would send a devastating message if a closure of Niagara were announced on the eve of their deployment        The Senator also pointed out that in response to her own inquiries  additional information had come to light that the Air Force grossly underestimated the costs of moving C 130 airplanes from Niagara Falls and Stratton  In its submissions to the BRAC commission  the Air Force estimated that the costs for this move would be approximately  102 million  however  in response to the Senator  s request  the Air Force recently released a report of a site survey which estimated the costs for implementing the BRAC recommendations at the base at  292 million  almost three times the Air Force  s estimate         With respect to the Rome DFAS facility  the Senator pointed out that an analysis of the costs and space availability at the Rome DFAS facility demonstrates that Rome is one of the lowest cost DFAS facilities in the nation and has the ability to add additional jobs with without any construction  Further  since the June hearing  the Department of Defense has been unable to confirm that it conducted any specific analysis of the topography or the frequency availability at Wright Patterson Air Force Base when it recommended moving the Sensors Directorate at Rome         The BRAC Commission recently announced that its final deliberations will begin Wednesday  August 24           A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached        August 16  2005       Dear Chairman Principi           Since the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission  s regional hearing in Buffalo on June 27  2005  the case for preserving New York  s military installations impacted by the Department of Defense  s Base Closure recommendations has become even stronger   As the Commission begins its final deliberations  I urge the commission to keep open the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and the Rome Defense Finance and Accounting Service facility   I also urge the Commission to preserve the Sensors Directorate at the Rome Air Force Research Laboratory and four C 130 aircraft at the Stratton Air National Guard base in Scotia             As the Commission begins its final deliberations  the 914th Airlift Wing based at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station is being remobilized for duty in support of on going operations in the Central Command Area of Responsibility   222 of 246 personnel are being remobilized and all individuals being remobilized are volunteers   This will be the unit  s third deployment to the region    The willingness of the 914th to volunteer to serve a third tour is a testament to the demand for their skills as well as to their commitment to our nation   It would send a devastating message to these brave men and women if a closure of Niagara were announced on the eve of their deployment              The 914th  s skills and capabilities are among the many reasons why the Niagara Falls Air Reserve station should be preserved   At the BRAC Commission regional hearing in Buffalo  the Commission heard many strong arguments in favor of preserving the Niagara Falls Air Reserve station which demonstrated the facility  s military value as well as errors in the DOD  s calculation of the cost of closing the facility   Since that hearing  we have discovered additional information that the Air Force grossly underestimated the costs of moving C 130 airplanes from Niagara Falls and Stratton             The Air Force recommendations call for moving C 130 airplanes from all over the nation    including eight from Niagara Falls and four from Stratton   In its submissions to the BRAC commission  the Air Force estimates that the costs for this move are approximately  102 million   However  in response to my request  the Air Force recently released a report of a site survey which estimated the costs for implementing the BRAC recommendations at the base at  292 million  almost three times the Air Force  s estimate   This acknowledgement by the Air Force of the true costs of complying with the BRAC recommendations dealt a serious blow to their proposal to close the Niagara Falls Air Reserve station or remove C 130s from Stratton             Similarly  the case for preserving the Rome DFAS facility and the Sensors Directorate at the Rome Air Force Research Laboratory has only become stronger since the June hearing   During its hearings  several commissioners raised concerns with DOD  s proposal regarding DFAS   An analysis of the costs and space availability at the Rome DFAS facility demonstrates that Rome is one of the lowest cost DFAS facilities in the nation   Moreover  Rome  s DFAS facility has the ability to add additional jobs with without any construction                  At the June 27 regional hearing  the Rome community and several elected officials  including myself  noted that the Rome Sensors Directorate is located in an area that has unique topographical features and frequency availability   The DOD BRAC recommendations showed no indication that these were taken into account in its BRAC recommendation to move the Sensors Directorate to Wright Patterson Air Force Base   Since the June hearing  DOD has been unable to confirm that it conducted any specific analysis of the topography or the frequency availability at Wright Patterson Air Force Base when it recommended moving the Sensors Directorate at Rome   Moving the Sensors Directorate from Rome could thus result in losing capability that already exists               As you begin your final deliberations  I urge you to consider the issues raised by New York communities as you develop your final recommendations to the President   I appreciate the seriousness with which the BRAC Commissioners and the Commission staff have undertaken the task of reviewing the Department of Defense  s BRAC recommendations              Thank you for your consideration          Hillary Rodham Clinton
