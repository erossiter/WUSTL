October 13  2005 Clinton Renews Call for President and Administration to Act on Potential Terrorist Threat Posed by General Aviation Aircraft to Populated and Key Areas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator urges action following theft of charter jet in Florida                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today urged the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation to conduct a nationwide assessment of the potential threat posed to cities  states  and key infrastructure from the theft or misuse of general aviation aircraft by criminals or terrorists  The Senator  s renewed call comes after the latest report that a man was arrested on charges of stealing a Cessna Citation 7 plane and taking it on a 350 mile joy ride from Florida to Georgia  Earlier this year  an intoxicated individual stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from an airport in Danbury  CT  eventually landing at the Westchester County Airport  located just to the east of the Indian Point nuclear facility          Following the Danbury incident  the House and Senate Conferees negotiated a final FY 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill which included a requirement  authored by Senator Clinton  for a report to be done by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Transportation assessing the dangers posed to high risk  large populations and critical infrastructure areas  should general aviation aircraft be stolen and used as a weapon  The study would also require an assessment of the vulnerabilities of general aviation airports and aircraft  Senators Durbin  D IL   Lautenberg  NJ   Corzine  NJ   Schumer  NY   and Lieberman  CT  co sponsored the original Amendment             Thankfully  the recent thefts of planes in Florida and Connecticut ended without any damage  destruction or death and were not acts of terrorism   But  they are a significant forewarning of the types of threats to which our communities remain vulnerable     Senator Clinton said    Our nuclear plants  key infrastructure  military bases  not to mention our large cities  could be threatened should a coordinated attack occur and all of the advances we have made in the area of homeland security could be subverted if general aviation airports can be breached this easily and airplanes used as weapons                I believe that this kind of national assessment is absolutely necessary to avoid a repeat of the type of attack carried out on September 11  2001 or some sinister copycat of it     Senator Clinton said    The 9 11 Commission warned us of this vulnerability and we must not turn away from the challenge of assessing threats posed by thefts or hijackings of general aviation aircraft              It is estimated that there are more than 19 000 landing facilities nationwide  including heliports  lakes  and dirt landing strips from which aircraft could be launched and more than 200 000 general aviation aircraft in the United States           In its report  the 9 11 Commission concluded that     M ajor vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security   These  together with inadequate screening and access controls  continue to present aviation security challenges     The report also said that part of the failure of the U S  government  s ability to thwart the September 11th terrorist attacks using airplanes was  in part  due to a lack of imagination about new and emerging threats in the bureaucracy           In May 2004 the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  issued their   Security Guidelines for General Aviation Airports     in which they outlined some guidelines general aviation airports should follow in order to secure aircraft and airfields  However  the same report also stated that    A s vulnerabilities within other areas of aviation have been reduced  General Aviation may be perceived as a more attractive target and consequently more vulnerable to misuse by terrorists              Specifically  the report created by Senator Clinton would require the Secretary of Homeland Security  in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation  to report on the vulnerability posed to high risk areas and facilities from general aviation aircraft that could be stolen or used as a weapon against those areas within 120 days upon enactment of the bill into law  Such areas to be considered include those with critical transportation infrastructure  nuclear facilities  military bases  and other highly populated areas with similarly situated critical infrastructure  The report will include an analysis of what security vulnerabilities exist at general aviation airports that would permit a general aviation aircraft to be stolen and used as a weapon  whether existing security precautions to prevent breaches of flight lines  perimeters  and aircraft are sufficient  and any additional security measures that could increase the security of general aviation aircraft and airports             I respect and admire the work being done by the general aviation fixed base operators  pilots  owners  airport managers  and others who have worked hard to increase security measures at general aviation airports     Senator Clinton said    General aviation is a significant contributor to the national economy and I believe our aviators should enjoy the freedom of flight throughout the country while at the same time our Department of Homeland Security can ensure safety on the ground
