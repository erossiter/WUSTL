                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   In remarks today on the Senate floor and in a statement for the record  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton emphasized her opposition to ill considered military commissions legislation rushed to the Senate floor that has   serious implications for our national security interests abroad  the rights of Americans at home  our reputation in the world and the safety of our troops      She emphasized that the Senate has a responsibility to get this right and that   we must convict and punish the guilty in a way that reinforces their guilt before the world and does not undermine our values                 We must do all we can to defeat the enemy with all the tools in our arsenal and every resource at our disposal  All of us  every one of us  is dedicated to deterring and defeating this enemy     Senator Clinton emphasized on the Senate floor     The challenge before us on this bill  in the final days of the session before the November election  is to find a solution that serves our national security interests   I fear  however  that there are those who place a strategy for winning elections ahead of a smart strategy for winning the war on terror               Democrats and Republicans alike believe that terrorists must be caught  captured  sentenced  punished  I believe there can be no mercy for those who perpetrated 9 11 and other crimes against humanity   But in the process of accomplishing what I believe is essential for our security  we must hold on to our values and set an example that we can point to with pride  not shame  Those captured are going nowhere  They are imprisoned now  So we should follow the duty given us by the Supreme Court and carefully craft the right piece of legislation to try and punish them  The President acted without authority and it is our duty now to be careful in handing this President just the right amount of authority to get the job done     Senator Clinton underscored            The following is Senator Clinton  s full statement for the record        Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton      September 28  2006      Mr  President  the Senate is currently debating a bill on how we treat detainees in our custody and  more broadly  on how we treat the principles on which our nation was founded           The implications are far reaching for our national security interests abroad  the rights of Americans at home  our reputation in the world  and the safety of our troops          The threat posed by the evil and nihilistic movement that has spawned terrorist networks is real and gravely serious  We must do all we can to defeat the enemy with all the tools in our arsenal and every resource at our disposal  All of us    every one of us    is dedicated to deterring and defeating this enemy          The challenge before us on this bill  in the final days of session before the November election  is to find a solution that serves our national security interests  I fear  however  that there are those who place a strategy for winning elections ahead of a smart strategy for winning the war on terrorism          Democrats and Republicans alike believe that terrorists must be caught  captured  sentenced  punished  I believe there can be no mercy for those who perpetrated 9 11 and other crimes against humanity  But in the process of accomplishing what I believe is essential for our security we must hold on to our values and set an example we can point to with pride  not shame  Those captured are going nowhere    they are imprisoned now    so we should follow the duty given us by the Supreme Court and carefully craft the right piece of legislation to try and punish them  The president acted without authority and it is our duty now to be careful in handing this president just the right amount of authority to get the job done          Mr  President  During the Revolutionary War  between the signing of the Declaration of Independence  which set our founding ideals to paper  and the writing of our Constitution  which fortified those ideals under the rule of law  our values    our beliefs as Americans    were already being tested          We were at war and victory was hardly assured  in fact the situation was closer to the opposite  New York City and Long Island had been captured  General George Washington and the Continental Army retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania  suffering tremendous casualties and a body blow to the cause of American Independence          It was at this time  among these soldiers at this moment of defeat and despair  that Thomas Paine would write    These are the times that try men s souls     Soon afterward  Washington lead his soldiers across the Delaware River and onto victory in the Battle of Trenton  There he captured nearly 1000 foreign mercenaries and he faced a crucial choice          How would General Washington treat these prisoners  The British had already committed atrocities against Americans  including torture  As David Hackett Fischer describes in his Pulitzer Prize winning book  Washington s Crossing  thousands of American prisoners of war were   treated with extreme cruelty by British captors     There are accounts of injured soldiers who surrendered being murdered instead of quartered  countless Americans dying in prison hulks in New York harbor  starvation and other acts of inhumanity perpetrated against Americans confined to churches in New York City           You can imagine  the light of our ideals shone dimly in those early dark days  years from an end to the conflict  years before our improbable triumph and the birth of our democracy  General Washington was not that far from where the Continental Congress had met and signed the Declaration of Independence  But it is easy to imagine how far that must have seemed  General Washington announced a decision unique in human history  sending the following order for handling prisoners        Treat them with humanity  and Let them have no reason to Complain of our Copying the brutal example of the British army in their Treatment of our unfortunate brethren       Therefore  George Washington  our commander in chief before he was our President  laid down the indelible marker of our nation  s values even as we were struggling as a nation    and his courageous act reminds us that America was born out of faith in certain basic principles  In fact  it is these principles that made and still make our country exceptional and allow us to serve as an example  We are not bound together as a nation by bloodlines  We are not bound by ancient history  our nation is a new nation  Above all  we are bound by our values          Now these values    George Washington  s values  the values of our founding    are at stake  We are debating far reaching legislation that would fundamentally alter our nation  s conduct in the world and the rights of Americans here at home  And we are debating it too hastily in a debate too steeped in electoral politics          The Senate  under the authority of the Republican Majority and with the blessing and encouragement of the Bush Cheney Administration  is doing a great disservice to our history  our principles  our citizens  and our soldiers  The deliberative process is being broken under the pressure of partisanship and the policy that results is a travesty           Fellow Senators  the process for drafting this legislation to correct the administration  s missteps has not befitted the   world  s greatest deliberative body     Legitimate  serious concerns raised by our senior military and intelligence community have been marginalized  difficult issues glossed over  and debates we should have had have been shut off in order to pass a misconceived bill before Senators return home to campaign for re election          For the safety of our soldiers and the reputation of our nation  it is far more important to take the time to do the job right than to do it quickly and badly  There is no reason other than partisanship for not continuing deliberation to find a solution that works to achieve a true consensus based on American values          In the last several days  this bill has undergone countless changes    all for the worse    and differs significantly from the compromise brokered between the Bush Administration and a few Senate Republicans last week           Fellow Senators  we all know we are holding this hugely important debate against the backdrop of November  s elections  There are some in this body more focused on holding on to their jobs than doing their jobs right  Some in this chamber plan to use our honest and serious concerns for protecting our country and our troops as a political wedge issue to divide us for electoral gain          How can we in the Senate find a proper answer and reach a consensus when any matter that does not serve the Majority  s partisan advantage is mocked as weakness  and any real concern for our troops and values dismissed demagogically as coddling the enemy          This broken process and its blatant politics will cost our nation dearly  It allows a discredited policy ruled by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional to largely continue and to be made worse          We must stand for the rule of law before the world  especially when we are under stress and under threat  We must show that we uphold our most profound values  The rule of law cannot be compromised          Our Supreme Court in its Hamdan v  Rumsfeld decision ruled that the Bush Administration  s previous military commission system had failed to follow the Constitution and the law in its treatment of detainees  The question before us is whether this Congress will follow the decision of the Supreme Court and create a better system that withstands judicial examination    or attempt to confound that decision  a strategy destined to fail again           The bill before us allows the admission into evidence of statements derived through cruel  inhuman and degrading interrogation  That sets a dangerous precedent that will endanger our own men and women in uniform overseas           Will our enemies be less likely to surrender  Will informants be less likely to come forward  Will our soldiers be more likely to face torture if captured  Will the information we obtain be less reliable  These are the questions we should be asking  And based on what we know about warfare from listening to those who have fought for our country  the answers do not support this bill           As Lieutenant John F  Kimmons  the Army  s Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence said    No good intelligence is going to come from abusive interrogation practices             Allowing coercive treatment and torturous actions toward prisoners not only violates the fundamental rule of law and the institutions of justice  not only will it fail to bear fruit in intelligence gathering  but it promotes radicalization  Ayman al Zawahiri  Osama bin Laden  s second in command  the architect of many of the attacks on our country and throughout Europe and the world  has said  over and over  that torture helps the cause of extremism    watering the seeds of jihad          M  President  I would like to submit for the Record letters and statements from former military leaders  9 11 Families  the religious community  retired judges  legal scholars and law professors  all of whom have registered serious concerns with this bill and its provisions           The bill also makes significant changes to the War Crimes Act  As it is now written  the War Crimes Act makes it a federal crime for any soldier or national of the United States to violate  among other things  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions in an armed conflict not of an international character  The administration has voiced concern that Common Article 3    which prohibits   cruel treatment or torture       outrages against human dignity     and   humiliating and degrading treatment       sets out an intolerably vague standard on which to base criminal liability  and may expose CIA agents to jail sentences for rough interrogation tactics used in questioning detainees           But the current bill  s changes to the War Crimes Act have done little to clarify the rules for our interrogators           This bill undermines the Geneva Conventions by allowing the President to issue Executive Orders to redefine what are permissible interrogation techniques  Have we fallen so low as to debate how much torture we are willing to stomach  By allowing this Administration to further stretch the definition of what is and is not torture  we lower our moral standards to those whom we despise  undermine the values of our flag wherever it flies  put our troops in danger  and jeopardize our moral strength in a conflict that cannot be won simply with military might          Once again  there are those who are willing to stay a course that is not working  giving the Bush Cheney Administration a blank check    a blank check to torture  to create secret courts using secret evidence  to detain people  including Americans  to be free of judicial oversight and accountability  to put our troops in greater danger           The bill has several other flaws as well          This bill would not only deny detainees habeas corpus rights    a process that would allow them to challenge the very validity of their confinement    it would also deny these rights to lawful immigrants living in the United States  If enacted  this law would give license to this Administration to pick people up off the streets of the United States and hold them indefinitely without charges and without legal recourse          At the very least  this is worth a debate on the merits  not on the politics  This is worth putting aside our differences    it  s too important          Our values are central  Our national security interests in the world are vital  And nothing should be of greater concern to those of us in this chamber than the young men and women who are  right now  wearing our nation  s uniform  serving in dangerous territory          After all  our standing  our morality  our beliefs are tested in this chamber and their impact and their consequences are tested under fire  they are tested when American lives are on the line  they are tested when our strength and ideals are questioned by our friends and by our enemies          When our soldiers face an enemy  when our soldiers are in danger  that is when our decisions in this chamber will be felt  Will that enemy surrender  Or will he continue to fight  with fear for how he might be treated and with hate directed not at us  but at the patriot wearing our uniform whose life is on the line           When our nation seeks to lead the world in service to our interests and our values  will we still be able to lead by example          Our values  our history  our interests  and our military and intelligence experts all point to one answer           Let  s pass a bill that  s been honestly and openly debated  not hastily cobbled together          Let  s pass a bill that unites us  not divides us          Let  s pass a bill that strengthens our moral standing in the world  that declares clearly that we will not retreat from our values before the terrorists  We will not give up who we are  We will not be shaken by fear and intimidation  We will not give one inch to the evil and nihilistic extremists who have set their sights on our way of life          Vladimir Bukovsky  who spent nearly 12 years in Soviet prisons  labor camps  and psychiatric hospitals for nonviolent human rights activities had this to say    If Vice President Cheney is right  that some   cruel  inhumane  or degrading   treatment of captives is a necessary tool for winning the war on terrorism  then the war is lost already             Before George Washington crossed the Delaware  before he could achieve that long needed victory  before the tide would turn  before he ordered that prisoners be treated humanely  he ordered that his soldiers read Thomas Paine  s writing  He ordered that they read about the ideals for which they would fight  the principles at stake  the importance of this American project          Now we find ourselves at a moment when we feel threatened  when the world seems to have grown more dangerous  when our nation needs to ready itself for a long and difficult struggle against a new and dangerous enemy that means us great harm          Just as Washington faced a hard choice  so do we  It  s up to us to decide how we wage this struggle and not up to the fear fostered by terrorists  We decide          This is a moment where we need to remind ourselves of the confidence and bravery of George Washington  We cannot  we must not  subvert our ideals    we can and must use them to win
