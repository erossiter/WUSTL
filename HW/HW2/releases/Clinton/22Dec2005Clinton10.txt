December 22  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It is my profound obligation as United States Senator  both to my constituents in New York and to my country  to do all I can to ensure that we have a strong national defense  That is why I voted in support of the Department of Defense Appropriations conference report          While the final bill was not perfect and does leave me with some concerns  the priority must be supporting and bolstering our nation  s Armed Forces against the very real threats that we face        This bill included numerous provisions that will fund defense projects in New York and throughout the nation  This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support   New York companies and institutions have a great deal to offer to our national security and one of my top priorities as a Senator on the Armed Services Committee has been to raise awareness about the contribution New York makes to our national defense   The investments in this bill will enhance our national security and provide much needed resources for the men and women of our military        Also included in this bill is  125 million for workers   compensation claims and the ongoing medical and mental health needs of our firefighters  police officers  first responders  workers  and others who labored at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills  I am pleased that my colleagues in the New York delegation and I were able to secure these critical funds  This was money previously promised to New York  s heroes who put their health and lives on the line in the days  weeks and months after September 11th        Controversial legislation to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling had no place in a bill to fund our troops  and I am pleased that the Senate voted to remove it   Including the drilling provision was a cynical ploy  made even more outrageous by Republican efforts to make funding for border security  heating assistance  and rebuilding along the Gulf Coast contingent upon agreement to this controversial measure        I fear that we have truly lost sight of what is important when we play politics with border security and support for low income Americans struggling to heat their homes this winter        I am sorry  too  that the Republican Congress saw fit to deny several funding measures for reconstruction efforts along the Gulf Coast  though I am grateful that this bill does contain nearly  30 billion in aid for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and affected areas  Though more must be done  this bill will help alleviate some of the hardships suffered by individuals and businesses by providing funding for the region  s agriculture  highways  levees  education and other major economic development initiatives   We must sustain the momentum to get people home and to rebuild communities  When Congress returns next year  I hope we do whatever is necessary to help the people of the Gulf Coast get their lives back in order        One particularly troubling measure in the bill gives sweeping liability protections to pharmaceutical manufacturers  I support limited liability protections when drug companies are developing products that our nation needs in the event of an emergency  This provision  however  would grant blanket immunity    without judicial review    for all claims of loss for any drug that the Secretary of Health and Human Services designated as limiting the harm caused by a pandemic or epidemic  That may very well encompass any drug  providing an extraordinary and dangerous giveaway to these drug companies        With U S  troops serving bravely in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  we owe it to our men and women in uniform to ensure that we have the best trained  best equipped force possible   Our priority must be serving these men and women and strengthening our military  That is why  though I am troubled by several provisions included  I supported passage of this legislation
