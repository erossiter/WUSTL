December 7  2006 Clinton  Tauscher Introduce Legislation to Help Prevent Nuclear Proliferation  Safeguard Nuclear Materials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Clinton Calls on Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees to Step Up Focus on Non Proliferation Efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher  D CA  today introduced legislation in both chambers of Congress to help prevent nuclear terrorism   The Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act of 2006 would create a senior advisor to the President to focus solely on preventing nuclear terrorism   The bill would also require the President to develop a comprehensive plan to work with the international community to secure the nuclear materials that terrorists could use to build a nuclear weapon   Senator Clinton announced that she would introduce this legislation in a major address to the Council on Foreign Relations on October 31   In addition  Senator Clinton wrote today to the incoming chairmen of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees  urging that they hold hearings in the next Congress to discuss how best to address the serious cracks in the international nonproliferation regime  with the aim of creating a new nonproliferation blueprint for the security of the United States and the world               The possibility that terrorists may acquire and use a nuclear weapon against the United States is an urgent threat to the security of our nation and the international community     said Senator Clinton     We must do everything in our power  working in concert with other nations  to make that these dangerous materials are as secure as possible in order to prevent such an attack  This legislation is an important step toward achieving that goal              There s no larger threat to global security than loose nuclear materials in the hands of a terrorist or rogue nation   The question is  what are we doing about it   For too long  the answer has been not nearly enough   Our legislation raises the level of commitment to match the threat head on  by creating the post of a Senior Advisor to the President dedicated to preventing nuclear terrorism and requires the administration to work with the international community to develop specific nuclear standards     said Representative Tauscher            The Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act of 2006 legislation introduced today would create the post of Senior Advisor to the President for Preventing Nuclear Terrorism  The advisor will be responsible for developing a strategy to prevent nuclear terrorism  coordinating the efforts of the Departments of Energy  Defense  State and other agencies   The advisor will lead efforts to work with the international community to develop specific standards for the security of weapons usable nuclear material and assist countries in meeting these standards   The advisor will also be responsible for providing Congress with a yearly report on all sites with weapons usable material  plans for securing or removing material from these sites  details of country s efforts to secure their own weapons usable material and an update on efforts to create specific international standards for the protection of these materials   The bill would also authorize an additional  50 million for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative  GTRI  to encourage countries to replace highly enriched uranium  HEU  with less proliferation sensitive low enriched uranium  LEU            Senator Clinton s letter to the Chairmen of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees follows          The Honorable Joseph R  Biden Jr   Ranking Member  Committee on Foreign Relations  439 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510      The Honorable Carl Levin  Ranking Member  Committee on Armed Services  228 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510      Dear Senator Biden and Senator Levin        Congratulations on being named chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee  respectively   Your chairmanships will provide an opportunity for those committees to exercise oversight and consider policy issues that are critically important to the United States national security           For the past 40 years  the United States has provided strong leadership in building the network of treaties and expectations that have been largely successful in preventing states from developing nuclear weapons   The United States Senate has played a significant  bipartisan role in these efforts   Unfortunately  the international nonproliferation regime has begun to show serious cracks  as exemplified by North Korea  s recent nuclear test and Iran  s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons   Repairing this system is absolutely vital to our national security   I believe that the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees  and the United States Senate as a whole  have a responsibility to confront this challenge head on          As the proliferation challenges of Iran and North Korea continue to make headlines  there are also non state crises that gravely threaten our security  ranging from al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that have explicitly stated their desire to acquire a nuclear weapon  to the A Q  Khan proliferation network that stretched from Europe  to the Middle East  to the Far East   It is essential that the Senate take every possible step to prevent terrorists from acquiring a nuclear weapon and ensure that no new black markets for nuclear weapons related equipment are created          Unfortunately  our nation  s influence as a leader in nonproliferation has been eroded by this Administration  s actions   The abandonment of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Administration s interest in developing new nuclear weapons  have hurt our standing within the global nonproliferation community    We must restore our nation  s status as a leader in preventing proliferation worldwide   I believe that the committees you chair can help propel that effort forward          In addition to discussing the issues above  I believe that the Senate can play an important role by examining proposals such as the guaranteed supply of nuclear fuel and a nuclear fuel bank          I ask that the Senate Armed Services and Senate Foreign Relations Committees work together in the 110th Congress to schedule a series of hearings to discuss the future of the international nonproliferation regime with the aim of creating a new blueprint for our shared security            Thank you for your consideration           Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton          CC             Senator John W  Warner  Chairman   Senator Richard G  Lugar  Chairman
