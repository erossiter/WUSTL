September 9  2005 Clinton Calls on President to Increase Funding for Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Renews Her Call for President to Take Action to Reduce Gas Prices including Launching FTC Investigation into Price Gouging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New York  NY    Responding to new U S  Department of Energy projections of staggering price increases for home heating oil and natural gas due to Hurricane Katrina  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to request  1 276 billion in emergency funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    LIHEAP  which offers federal funds to help low income households meet their home heating needs  will be critical to helping to deal with a looming crisis for thousands of New Yorkers caused by the soaring cost and diminishing availability of home heating fuel as fall and winter approach   Last year  an estimated 800 000 New Yorkers received LIHEAP assistance             The average New York family will need to spend at least  400 more this winter to pay their heating bills   This could spell disaster for seniors  low income families  and the disabled across New York who are struggling to make ends meet   That  s why I am calling on President Bush to support emergency funds for LIHEAP as part of the next Hurricane Katrina relief package     said Senator Clinton     Unless we take action now  thousands of New Yorkers will be left out in the cold             According to a new report by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA     Hurricane Katrina caused significant direct damage to offshore rigs  refineries  pipelines and ports in the Gulf of Mexico  with wide scale electricity outages and flooding exacerbating the already devastated infrastructure  compounded by the evacuation of thousands of employees      As a result of this damage  the EIA projects that home heating oil will hit  2 49 per gallon this December and that natural gas prices will also be higher than expected    See table below for analysis of the projected cost increase per New York family            In light of this forecast  Senator Clinton today wrote to President Bush to request an additional  1 276 billion in funding to enable LIHEAP to have the same purchasing power as last year   This would provide  150 million in additional funding to New York so that New York can provide the same level of service to seniors  disabled and low income families as last winter            Senator Clinton is working on all fronts to help New Yorkers affected by skyrocketing energy prices   On August 18  Senator Clinton sent a letter to President Bush urging him to  direct the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to investigate whether oil companies are engaging in anti competitive practices  release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  and pressure our OPEC allies to increase production   In the wake of Hurricane Katrina with gas pricing growing even more suspicious  Senator Clinton last week co sponsored legislation along with Senator Bill Nelson of Florida to require the FTC to investigate price gouging at the gas pump   Senator Clinton also supports a temporary suspension of the gas tax if savings are passed on to consumers and there is no negative impact on New York jobs or projects            I will continue to fight to ensure that oil companies aren  t profiting at the expense of consumers and that the federal government takes the short term steps that we can to get gas prices under control   The fact is that this Administration needs to take control and tell the oil companies that they should be taking some of their profits and passing them onto consumers who are struggling to pay for gas to get to work  and  soon  heat their homes               Senator Clinton today also called on the President to provide emergency funding for programs to reduce demand for energy  urging the President to request that the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP  be fully funded   The program was reauthorized at  500 million in the energy bill recently approved in Congress   Through this program  weatherization service providers install energy efficient measures in homes of qualifying homeowners free of charge   According to the U S  Department of Energy  the program reduces energy use by approximately 31 percent in each home it serves and saves the average homeowner about  300 per year   It also produces  1 83 in energy savings for every federal dollar invested   Senator Clinton also underscored the need for a conservation plan for the Northeast Region so that we are prepared for possible supply disruptions  particularly of heating oil             Last year  New York received  20 3 million in WAP funds  which enabled the state to serve approximately 11 000 families   If overall WAP funding were raised to  500 million  New York  s share would increase by  24 1 million and the number of homes served would increase by 13 000  or an overall increase of 55          Click here   to view the

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500         Dear President Bush          On September 1st  I joined with colleagues in writing to you to request your support for  900 million in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funds as a component of supplemental funding to address the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina   In the letter  we stressed that we stand ready to help the millions of people in the Gulf region whose lives have been turned upside down by the hurricane   This remains our top priority   However  we also know that the effects of Hurricane Katrina are being felt by Americans outside of the Gulf Region as gasoline  heating oil and natural gas prices rise in the wake of this disaster   Indeed  there is an imminent emergency confronting millions of Americans in cold weather states   The current rise in energy prices coupled with energy debt remaining from last winter are leading to increased disconnections and arrears among consumers as the winter heating season begins    threatening the well being of low income families and seniors   This situation warrants the provision of emergency LIHEAP funding in the supplemental request  and we asked in our September 1 letter that you include  900 million in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funds as a part of the Katrina supplemental appropriations to enable the program to have the same purchasing power as the LIHEAP funds that were provided last year           It now appears that  900 million will not be sufficient to accomplish this goal   Two days ago  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  released its monthly   Short Term Energy Outlook    for September   As noted in the report    Hurricane Katrina caused significant direct damage to offshore rigs  refineries  pipelines  and ports in the Gulf of Mexico  with wide scale electricity outages and flooding exacerbating the already devastated infrastructure  compounded by the evacuation of thousands of employees      The impact of this damage is reflected in the Eva  s new price forecasts for heating oil and natural gas   Whereas the prior EIA   Outlook    forecasted that home heating oil prices would be  2 27 a gallon after taxes in December in the Northeast  the Eva  s new forecast is that home heating oil will hit  2 49 this December   Similarly  natural gas prices are now projected to be higher than previously thought   The EIA forecasts that residential natural gas prices in the Mid Atlantic region  which includes New York  will be  17 30 per thousand cubic feet in the first quarter of 2006  versus  12 33 for the first quarter of 2005   For the average New York family  these projected increases mean that a family using heating oil will need to spend  1 729 this winter  an increase of  479 over last year  and a New York family using natural gas will need to spend  1 540 this winter  an increase of  442 over last year             In light of these new forecasts  I ask that you include  1 276 billion in emergency LIHEAP funds in your next supplemental funding request to enable the LIHEAP program to keep pace with skyrocketing heating oil and natural gas prices   This step is needed to help avert a looming  but preventable  crisis for the estimated 800 000 New Yorkers and millions of other Americans who will depend on the LIHEAP program            In addition to helping low income families and seniors pay their heating bills  I think that the projected energy prices make it imperative that we provide emergency funding for programs to reduce demand for energy   I urge you to request emergency funding to fully fund the Weatherization Assistance Program  which was authorized in the energy bill at  500 million   Through this program  weatherization service providers install energy efficiency measures in the homes of qualifying homeowners free of charge   According to the Department of Energy  this program reduces energy use by approximately 31  in each home that the program serves  and produces  1 83 cents in energy savings for every federal dollar expended            Finally  I am disappointed that the Administration has still not responded to my call of August 18th to launch an investigation into gas price gouging and pressure our OPEC allies to increase production   Since then  prices have continued to skyrocket at the pumps  but your Administration has refused to act           Thank you for your consideration of these requests            Sincerely          Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
