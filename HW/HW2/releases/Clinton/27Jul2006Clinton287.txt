July 27  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Announcement of Record Profits for Exxon Mobil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    This week has brought record gas prices for New Yorkers and record earnings for the oil companies   Today s announcement makes it clearer than ever that we need a new direction in energy policy  one that puts us on a path to a clean energy future instead of lining the pockets of big oil executives   That is why I have introduced legislation to eliminate oil company tax breaks and use that money to create a Strategic Energy Fund that would speed development of biofuels  help people buy hybrid cars  and fund research into cutting edge energy technologies   It is time for the Republican leadership to get serious about addressing our energy crisis and stop putting the interests of oil companies over the needs of families struggling with skyrocketing gas prices
