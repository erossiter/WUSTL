March 8  2007 Remarks on Military Readiness and Support for Our Troops                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Click here to watch video of Senator Clinton s remarks    Courtesy of Center for American Progress       It is a great personal pleasure for me to be here at CAP and to commend all of you who are working every day to make CAP such a reliable and leading voice on the important issues that face our country and the world   And I thank Melody for her introduction and for her leadership here   And particularly because of these issues I want to express my gratitude to Larry Korb and his team here at CAP because he has been extremely helpful in setting the priorities that we should be following and giving some real guidance based on his experience and expertise to those of us who are in the Congress   I certainly miss seeing my dear and longtime friend John Podesta who is  as Melody says  out on a family matter but I want publicly to really applaud his leadership here at CAP   I don t think CAP would have made the mark that it has in such a short period of time without John Podesta showing the way   So thank you all for everything that you are doing          I ve joined you here at CAP at a time in which the readiness of our armed services and the support structure for our service members are at the forefront of our minds and our national debate            Four years after the Iraq war began  our troops are stretched to the breaking point with many soldiers   as Larry said   on second  third  or even fourth deployments   Readiness levels are down   According to the recent Center for American Progress report by Larry Korb and others   public statements by high ranking officials about overall readiness indicate that two thirds of the Army   virtually all of the active Army s combat brigades not currently deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan   are rated not combat ready   and the authors conclude   Not since the aftermath of the Vietnam War has the U S  Army been so depleted   Well  unfortunately  Larry  I agree            This widespread lack of readiness extends also to the National Guard and Reserves   On March 1st  a congressionally appointed Commission on the National Guard and Reserves released its second report to Congress   The years of repeated and prolonged deployments and inadequate budgets have left the Guard and Reserves so short of equipment  training  and personnel that 88 percent of the Army National Guard units and 44 percent of the Air National Guard units are not ready to be deployed   They are not prepared for overseas deployments and in some cases cannot even adequately respond to homeland security threats or emergencies   The chairman of this commission reported   We can t sustain the  National Guard and Reserves  on the course we re on    Again  unfortunately  I agree            Once deployed  our soldiers continue to carry the burden of these strains   We are still hearing reports from the frontlines of inadequate training and equipment   In January  after visiting Iraq and Afghanistan  I stopped back by Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany to meet with recovering soldiers   A young soldier lying in his hospital bed told me that his armored Humvee saved his life  but that too many of his comrades would not have been so fortunate because they do not have properly armored vehicles   We have all heard story after story of mothers and fathers or husbands and wives buying body armor and shipping it to their loved ones   I even heard  Larry  a story recently about a family that shipped welding equipment to their son so that he could help try to weld on additional armor onto the vehicle that they had been issued            While the Pentagon has publicly expressed its commitment to equipping every soldier with the proper body armor  our experience over the past four years has demonstrated that strong congressional oversight when it comes to personal equipment or vehicles is necessary to ensure that our troops have the protection they deserve   And mission after mission  we find that our soldiers are facing some very difficult challenges   They face these challenges before deployment  they face these challenges during deployment  and now we know they face these challenges after deployment          We ve all been following with great distress the story about Walter Reed s outpatient facility and news reports of other hospitals and facilities where soldiers are struggling to receive appropriate care   When I visited Walter Reed again on Friday to meet with soldiers from New York  I found their tales of being caught up in the bureaucratic nightmares that surround them heartbreaking            A soldier I visited with   a major from New York   has been at Walter Reed for more than two years in part because after he was injured in Afghanistan  he did not want to be removed from the battlefield and from the troops that he commanded   He stayed longer than he should have  and by the time he was finally evacuated his condition had deteriorated   Because of inattention and ill treatment at Walter Reed  he had to seek care at Bethesda Naval Medical Center   not an easy decision for a soldier   He appealed his diagnosis and he was finally given the surgery he required  Now he faces yet another battle  with the medical evaluation board  to determine his level of disability   His case officer canceled the first four appointments because of overwork and being overly burdened   The major asked for legal assistance but his requests have gone unanswered           I want to make clear that in my experience  and based on what I m hearing from our young men and women in uniform  the doctors and nurses and staff  when it comes to acute care  are performing admirably   But everyone is falling into the same trap laid by a broken bureaucracy  a strained military  and presidential leadership that is missing in action   It turns out there are only three lawyers and one paralegal assigned to Walter Reed s entire evaluation process   Compare that to 4 000 Army JAG lawyers assigned to active duty  the National Guard  and the Reserves   A perfect if heartrending example of what are the real priorities for our administration            The reports out of Walter Reed represent the latest pointed example in a constellation of disgraceful episodes  a pattern that has to go right to the top   a failure of planning  a failure of priorities  and a failure to achieve results   Too often our young men and women who give their all for us lack proper healthcare and preparedness before deployment  then the equipment and training is missing during deployment  and then they come home and once again lack proper treatment and care            In the leadership vacuum that has been left by the Bush administration  too many members of the military and their families have been left literally holding their breath about what will happen next   Our soldiers are often finding themselves in impossible conflicts abroad where they re not sure who the enemy is  who s shooting at them  who s side they re on   And then back here they feel  in a metaphorical way  just about the same  who s on their side   Who s standing up for them   Who s speaking out for them   Where do they go to get the help that they and their families deserve          I m here to say that the buck does stop with this president   And if he doesn t take responsibility  I can assure you that the next president will   because our soldiers  our Marines  our airmen  our sailors  our Guard and Reserve  they don t have the luxury of passing the buck to somebody else   They step forward and they step up and they do the best they can  often under incredibly difficult and dangerous circumstances               When did we stop seeing every young man and woman who wears the uniform as our sons and daughters   Because we would certainly would not stand for this treatment for our own sons and daughters   And so today I m proposing a series of steps to remedy some of these problems that have come to our attention  to enact a new G I  Bill of Rights and a series of reforms aimed at keeping our promise to those who serve our nation   But we ve got to do more  and we ve got to make sure that we are reordering our priorities from wasting billions of dollars in overpayments to contractors overseas that cannot be accounted for  and instead spending what it takes to give the benefits that truly are needed by our soldiers  our veterans  and their families            I believe if you serve your country your country should serve you   And that means we send that promise out to those who we ask to enlist  those who we ask to fight  those who we ask to do their best no matter what the orders they receive might be          During my parents  generation  the original beneficiaries of the G I  Bill   signed into law by President Roosevelt   believed in that basic bargain  that their country would give them something in return for what they gave their country  And they understood that if that basic bargain wasn t honored for our soldiers and our veterans  you couldn t count on it being honored for anybody   And the bargain helped a generation return from war to build families and businesses  highways and schools  expand higher education  forge the great middle class  and unleash the creative and hardworking spirit of America          Now  we have been blessed in our history with leaders who understood that in the face of a  long  twilight struggle  we simply cannot close our eyes and wait for morning to come   We have to have control over our own destiny   We have to make smart decisions that protect America s interests and we have to honor those who are willing to serve          Now  since joining the Armed Services Committee  I ve worked hard to uphold that bargain with more than words   indeed  with actions   And improving and expanding access to health care for members of the Guard and Reserve was one of my first priorities   Tracking the health of members of the military is something that I took very seriously because during the Clinton administration some of you may recall we had people coming back from the first Gulf War with all these unexplained illnesses   You know  perfectly healthy young men in the prime of life who went over and served their country came back from the desert with chronic fatigue  with gastrointestinal problems  with very serious skin conditions and other problems that nobody could figure out where they came from  what had caused them   And we didn t have a good tracking system so that we hadn t tracked them before they were deployed  and it was very difficult to make a proper diagnosis when they got back   It became known as the Gulf War Syndrome or the Gulf War Illness   And I headed up a commission during the Clinton administration to bring more attention to what was happening to these brave veterans who had served our country so well          So one of the first pieces of legislation that I worked on and got passed was to set up a pre deployment and post deployment tracking system   I ve worked to make sure that we gave financial literacy education to military families  not only the deploying member but the family that would be left behind often not knowing how to pay mortgages or how to keep up with car payments   We re talking about very young people   The 20 year old soldier who deploys may be leaving an 18 year old wife and a one year old baby and they needed that help to get in charge of their financial situation             We demanded oversight  and frankly until recently we haven t gotten what we demanded   There was an unwillingness in the Congress to hold the administration accountable and a disdain toward Congress from the highest levels of the Pentagon and White House          So when we think about what we should be doing  let s look at the situation that describes most of our active duty Guard and Reserve members now   You know  gone are the days when Guard and Reserve duty meant one weekend a month and two weeks a year   We are using our Guard and Reserve on an op tempo that hasn t been seen since World War II  and with these new demands come these new responsibilities   And when you look at what was clearly a disparity between active duty and Guard and Reserve  it became clear that we were sending off young Guard and Reserve members who had health problems   About 20 percent of them couldn t even deploy because of health problems   You might ask   Why did they have health problems    Because a lot of them didn t have health insurance   They were employed by employers who didn t provide health insurance or often they were self employed and could not afford health insurance          In September 2002  the GAO reported that the Department of Defense had found more than 20 percent of Guard and Reserve members did not have health insurance  a higher percentage than that for the general population   I worked with my colleague  Senator Lindsey Graham  to expand TRICARE  the military s healthcare program  so that now for the first time every member of the select Reserve and Guard can buy into TRICARE  and so can the small businesses who employ our citizen soldiers   I also succeeded in creating a health tracking program to monitor the health of our service members before deployment and to improve treatment after            But what I m finding is that oftentimes it s not implemented   It s not being actually applied   And we could not   when I did this legislation with former Senator Talent  we couldn t persuade the Pentagon to approve it if it included mental health screening  so we now have a big problem with traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder and we don t have the baseline  and we re going to try to fix that          When I heard coming from Fort Drum and other bases in my state about unscrupulous lenders fleecing members of the military and their families  I went to work with Senator Enzi to try to make better financial education and training available so that people wouldn t be taken advantage of   And when I started hearing about equipment shortages and inadequate supplies of body armor and armored Humvees  I called for a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing to investigate these reports   I requested a Government Accountability Office investigation to focus on how the Pentagon s procurement decisions were made for this equipment   And I demanded that the Army make every effort to provide that additional body armor as quickly as possible to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan          I have also proposed a plan that I call the Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act that will prohibit funds from being spent to send troops to Iraq unless the secretary of defense certifies to Congress that the troops are being deployed with adequate equipment and training for their mission   Promises simply are not enough anymore          And finally  we have a duty to our young men and women when they return home and they are now veterans and they will be veterans for life   And some come back with debilitating injuries and some of course we know never come back   And because of what has now come to light  we can finally focus attention of the Congress and the country about what we need to do to try to fix the problems that have been identified          Today I m proposing new efforts to fix the disability benefits system  to help returning service members adapt to civilian life  especially while recovering from their wounds and their psychological challenges  their traumatic brain injuries and their post traumatic stress disorder  and I also want to help the children of single parents who have lost their mom or dad in service to our country          In response to the reports of the disgraceful conditions and treatment that we have been receiving  I ve asked the Army Inspector General to investigate what senior Army officials knew about the conditions and treatment of patients at Walter Reed and when they knew it   It s important that we hold people up the chain of command accountable  and we haven t done enough of that in these wars since 2001          One common thread of the complaints that I ve heard from the soldiers from New York with whom I met on Friday is the disjointed and unfair process for evaluating disabilities  the untrained and overworked staff  the inaccurate documentation by a revolving door of medical providers  the missing documents  the lack of legal counsel  the failures to address new conditions  namely  traumatic brain injury  which is becoming the signature injury of the war in Iraq  and the endless time that our soldiers are made to wait to get any decisions at all          We also know that 45 percent of the Traumatic Servicemembers  Group Life Insurance claims have been denied   This is an unacceptable rate for insurance that is meant to provide immediate financial relief for wounded service members and their families   There s a perception from these soldiers that the Army is only concerned with releasing them with greatly reduced disability benefits in order to avoid costs   So today I m announcing a proposal to fix the process that determines medical compensation for injured troops   The Department of Defense should review previously denied cases and failed appeals   If warranted  we should provide these service members a new hearing            We also have a duty to reform and ready the military for the increased number of veterans that are suffering from complex injuries  Many have recently learned about the traumatic brain injury after hearing the incredible story of journalist Bob Woodruff   But there are literally thousands of these stories  and lots of them don t have such a positive ending   They re being told in small towns and cities across our country            Hundreds of thousands of the troops that have rotated through Afghanistan and Iraq have not been given the support they need   According to a March  2006  study  19 percent of Iraq veterans and 11 percent of Afghanistan veterans reported mental health problems  and many of them will not report those problems   It is estimated that traumatic brain injury affects more than 25 percent of bomb blast survivors            When I was in the lobby at Walter Reed  I met a young Army officer who had lost one arm and lost three of his fingers   And I stopped to talk with him and ask him how he was doing  and he said   You know  I m working hard at my rehabilitation and they re taking great care of me with my prosthetics   he said   but what really bothers me is my memory   I don t have the focus that I used to have   I can t really set out tasks and know that I can accomplish them    And he said   That s the thing that really bothers me    He said   I ll be able to cope without my arm and my couple of fingers  but I ve got to have my brain back    And that s what I m hearing from so many of these young men and women   A lot of them have no memory of what happened when the explosion occurred   They re trying to sort that out   They lose their short term memory   And the diffuse and debilitating symptoms that they suffer leave them with cognitive and emotional problems  including the inability to adapt to civilian life          And lots of times traumatic brain injury goes undiagnosed because a lot of returning soldiers don t even know they suffered the concussion   It happened in a split second   They regained consciousness   They re in a battle zone with all kinds of chaos going on   It s not until later when they try to begin to re enter that they realize that there s something not quite right          Now  last year I introduced legislation called Heroes at Home   It was an initiative aimed at helping U S  troops transition after deployment   The Congress passed that into law because it is a first step in recognizing these practical problems that our returning vets experience   And it requires that we do a better job not only by beefing up our response in our military hospitals and our VA hospitals  but starting to use more networks of care even in the civilian community so that people are not waiting for six weeks or six months until they can get in to talk to somebody to try to figure out whether what s happening to them is something that unfortunately is a result of their experience and the dangers they  faced  or maybe there s something else that is wrong with them          So today I m announcing a new initiative to expand my previous initiative that was enacted into law  the Heroes at Home  and I ve developed this with the Wounded Warrior Project and the National Military Family Association   One  we should do what I tried to get done back in 2002  screen our troops for physical and mental conditions before they are deployed   Two  help families that take care of a loved one  Give them the education and the training they need for dealing with brain injuries and psychological challenges   When a roadside bomb explodes halfway around the world  it touches the lives of so many others who are waiting here at home           And when the injured soldiers return home  they should be greeted with open arms  not a wall of bureaucratic red tape  Shortly after I joined the Armed Services Committee I heard reports about injured soldiers being in the hospital receiving bills for damaged or missing equipment   Now  imagine how you would feel  as one young man whom I met from New York  Robert Loria  felt   Here he was having lost his arm and being dunned because he didn t pick up his equipment and gather it while he was being evacuated on a stretcher   I mean  this was just out of some kind of Catch 22 world that just made absolutely no sense   It was embarrassing to hear these stories   And I have been pushing the Pentagon ever since   I ve called for hearings   I ve written the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army to call for investigations   I got every one of them to admit to me that they would begin to try to fix these problems           And I demanded an audit   And just last month I received the results of that audit  The Department of the Army found that almost a quarter of the 1 216 wounded soldiers that they examined in the audit had not been paid what was owed them on time  so clearly we have a lot of work to do to straighten out so many of these unconscionable delays  difficulties  and barriers that our soldiers and their families face          And finally  there s an issue that doesn t get a lot of attention  but it s one that I think every one of us ought to be just determined we re going to fix   We re deploying a lot of single parents overseas   They leave their children maybe with their parents or their siblings or a trusted other relative or friend   And when that single parent is killed in the line of duty  that child   now an orphan   is often cared for by a loving  but financially ill prepared grandparent  relative  or guardian   In too many cases  single parents killed in combat were not given sufficient understanding of the options they faced to designate a guardian as a beneficiary for survivor benefits  So today I am proposing a simple but important step  to provide service members the option to select a guardian as a beneficiary to provide care for designated dependents   That is an option that we currently do not offer            Now  everything that I ve talked about today I wish we didn t have to talk about   I wish that this was not the subject that anybody could give a speech on  but it s important that we face up to our shortcomings   And no matter how anyone feels about the war in Iraq or any other issue concerning the use of our military  I think we all agree that we owe these young men and women the very best care and treatment that we can offer them   A new G I  Bill of Rights will honor the basic bargain at the heart of America s promise  our troops deserve all the healthcare and support that they are entitled to          I want to end with just two quick stories   Another one of the New Yorkers I met on Friday   a staff sergeant   is in outpatient facilities   He  too  was physically injured and suffered from traumatic brain effects as well   He s appealing a disability benefit of 10 percent   His wife is also in the service  an active duty soldier who recently returned from a hardship tour halfway around the world   This couple is doing everything they can to support our country and to fulfill their duty  but they re not being given the best that they deserve   The staff sergeant requested that his wife be reassigned or made temporarily available so that she can assist him in making this transition he s going through   He s in tremendous pain   He suffers memory problems            And the morning that I met with him  he heard I was coming and he wanted to feel like he was in total control of his faculties  so he denied himself his medication so that he could tell me his story   And his story really is about how he feels  that he s been left behind by our country   It was clear that despite the low disability rating he d been given he is terribly afflicted          The second story comes from an earlier time in our history   On December 9th  1941  when President Roosevelt addressed the American people in one of his fireside chats  the nation was in shock   Pearl Harbor had taken place just two days before            At that moment  the president said   We are now in this war   We are all in it   all the way   Every single man  woman  and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history   We must share together the bad news and the good news  the defeats and the victories           That was presidential leadership that understood when American soldiers are in harm s way  we are all at risk   When any one of them is injured  we are all diminished   And when they give the ultimate sacrifice  it is all of our loss            Two and a half years after the attack on Pearl Harbor and that fireside chat  President Roosevelt signed into law the original G I  Bill of Rights            Well  we have a choice to make  are we all in it   Are we all going to stand behind those who are giving everything they have   I think we will  but I think we need to be summoned to do that   So let us work not just to respond to the outrage and the problems of the moment  but to chart a new course for the military and the VA to take care of those who are taking care of us   I have no doubt in my mind that we are guided by the best of American values  not by politics  and if we are steered by the truth  not by wishing it were different  we will produce real results and not just rhetoric   And that is what our troops deserve from us          Thank you all very much
