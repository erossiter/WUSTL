                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Clinton Amendment Would Require Government Accountability Office to Conduct Comprehensive Assessment of the Readiness of Ground Forces Within the Army and Marine Corps      Amendment Included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill Approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has approved a significant initiative  that she sponsored  to require the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of the Ground Forces within the Army and Marine Corps           The provision was included in the FY 2007 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill which was approved last Thursday by the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member   The bill will now head to the Senate floor  The House of Representatives passed their version of the bill last Wednesday            I am concerned about the strain on the ground forces of our nation  s military and their ability to continue at the current pace in Iraq  Afghanistan  and other theaters of operation   We must continue to focus on recruiting and retaining our forces  and on training and equipping them in a manner that ensures they are able to meet today  s challenges and tomorrow  s future requirements     said Senator Clinton  who is also on the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support     Because we have our young men and women in uniform in harm s way  separated from their families  we owe it to them to have open and candid discussions on the current and projected readiness of our forces             The Senator  s amendment is aimed at providing additional transparency as to the true readiness of the military  so as to better identify where Congress can help focus its efforts              The military  by its very nature  executes the missions it is assigned   They do it in a selfless manner  with the equipment and the resources they have on hand     Senator Clinton said    It is our job in the Congress to ensure they have the right quality and quantity of troops and the equipment they need for the missions they are asked to do today and for the missions that may come up in the future             The Senator s amendment would require the GAO to               assess trained and ready forces for ongoing operations as well as future requirements              assess the availability and readiness of equipment for training and ongoing operations              review current personnel tempo with a particular focus deployment and retention rates for both unusually high and low demand skills              evaluate service efforts to mitigate high personnel operational tempos  and             describe current reserve component mobilization policy with an analysis of projected future availability           Senator Clinton  s amendment is part of a continuing effort to study the current state of our ground forces and better highlight where Congress should focus its efforts to ensure the continued preparedness of our Army and Marine Corps          In March of this year  at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support examining Ground Forces Readiness  Senator Clinton questioned both Lieutenant General James J  Lovelace  US Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans  and Lieutenant General Jan C  Huly  US Marine Corps Deputy Commandant  Plans  Policies  and Operations  about the current and projected readiness of our forces and expressed her serious concerns about providing adequate equipment  training and resources to the troops           Concerned that the United States Army is straining to meet its current obligations and that the National Guard and Reserves are stretched to the limit  Senator Clinton has also joined with Senators Joseph Lieberman  Bill Nelson and Jack Reed and Representatives Ellen Tauscher and Mark Udall to introduce legislation to significantly increase the Army  s baseline troop strength  The United States Army Relief Act will boost the overall troop levels authorized by Congress by 20 000 active duty members per year over the next four years  giving the Army the breathing room to reduce the overburden on our active duty troops as well as our Guard and Reserve and rebuild our capacity to respond to future threats          In related efforts to improve the readiness of our military forces  Senator Clinton joined in a successful push with Senator Jim Talent  R MO  to secure legislation  the Armed Forces Personnel Medical Readiness and Tracking Act of 2004  to establish a new tracking system that would make certain that active duty military personnel and reservists would receive regular health screenings
