August 23  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Key Judgments of the Iraq National Intelligence Estimate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   As I have said many times before  there is not a military solution in Iraq  Progress will only come from political reconciliation and compromise from the Iraqis themselves  In January  President Bush argued that the escalation of U S  troops into Iraq would create the political space for reconciliation among the Iraqis  At the time that the President announced the escalation  I opposed this new strategy because I did not believe the Iraqi government was committed to making the tough political decisions necessary for Iraq to resolve its sectarian divisions  Indeed  the declassified key judgments from the most recent National Intelligence Estimate regarding Prospects for Iraq s Stability clearly demonstrate that progress toward political reconciliation in Iraq has not been achieved since the beginning of the President s decision to add additional troops into Iraq  The NIE s key judgments provide additional evidence that the President s escalation strategy has failed  We need to stop refereeing this civil war  and start getting out now
