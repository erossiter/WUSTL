             Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today joined thirty seven of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter to President Bush urging him to provide adequate health care funding for America  s veterans          America  s veterans have served our nation and the cause of freedom proudly and bravely   It is our duty to make sure they have access to the health care and support they need and deserve     Senator Clinton said        Earlier this year  Senator Clinton voted for an amendment that would have provided  1 98 billion in emergency funding to the VA   The amendment was defeated on the Senate floor after the Secretary of Veterans Affairs wrote a letter assuring that the VA did not need additional emergency funds this year   However  the VA has now disclosed that there is an approximate  1 billion shortfall in funding for this fiscal year        Senator Clinton has co sponsored legislation to address the recently disclosed shortfall in VA funding  Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York veterans    to provide full funding for veterans   health care  to guarantee funding for VA health care  and to keep New York VA hospitals open          The attached letter was signed by Senators Murray  Reid  Boxer  Leahy  Corzine  Lautenberg  Johnson  Rockefellar  Kohl

Landrieu  Conrad  Biden  Pryor  Bill Nelson  and Levin         Please see attached letter        June 27  2005       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States of America  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW  Washington  DC 20500    Mr  President     As you prepare for your Tuesday evening address to the nation regarding our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan  we urge you to take this opportunity to level with the American people about a major cost of these conflicts   the care of our nation s veterans        As of January 2005  over 1 million U S  troops have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 3 and one half years   The Department of Veterans Affairs   VA  annual mid year budget review confirmed that many of these soldiers have returned home and are beginning to access the VA health care system in record numbers  placing increased demands on an already overburdened agency   Many of us saw a looming crisis and sought to take steps that would avert it        With the recent announcement that the VA is facing a shortfall of approximately  1 billion in fiscal year 2005 it seems that our concerns are well founded  Unfortunately  the VA s current shortfall  and larger shortfalls predicted for future years  has confirmed that your Administration has not prudently addressed the budget impacts of these conflicts   We urge you to do so now   Only by confronting this problem head on can we ensure that our veterans receive the support and healthcare they were both promised and deserve          Adjusted for inflation  the VA is spending 25 percent less per patient than it did in fiscal year 2000   Some veterans have to wait over three years to have surgery   And some VA hospitals are only seeing veterans who have more than a 50 percent service connected disability   The evidence that the VA cannot function under your proposed budgets and needs immediate relief to provide veterans access to quality health care continues to mount        War is costly   This is a lesson we all know personally   As Senators we have dealt with legislation authorizing the use of military force  we have worked on spending bills to support our troops  and we have talked to the families of those who have lost loved ones   We also know that failing to provide for the men and women who have sacrificed for our freedom is wrong          In a September 7  2003 speech to the nation you stated   the heaviest burdens in our war on terror fall  as always  on the men and women of our Armed Forces and our intelligence services  They have removed gathering threats to America and our friends  and this nation takes great pride in their incredible achievements  We are grateful for their skill and courage  and for their acts of decency  which have shown America s character to the world  We honor the sacrifice of their families         Mr  President  we urge you to provide the American people with a full accounting of the cost of these conflicts  including the cost of caring for our veterans upon their return home  during your Tuesday evening address   We ask that you directly share with the nation how your administration will make up the VA s current FY 2005 budget shortfall of  1 billion  as well as the looming shortfall projected for the future  And  we stand ready to work with you to pass an emergency spending bill to address this shortfall before the July 4th Congressional recess        Sincerely
