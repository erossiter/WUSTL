May 26  2005 Senator Clinton  Representative Markey Introduce  Legislation to Help Prevent a Dirty Bomb Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today introduced the Dirty Bomb Prevention Act  legislation to strengthen safeguards on radioactive materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb  Representative Edward J  Markey  MA  is introducing companion legislation today in the U S  House of Representatives          As a nation  we must be concerned that radioactive material used to make a dirty bomb is widely available in our country  Alarmingly  radioactive material is not subject to the level of control needed to keep it out of the hands of terrorists   said Senator Clinton   It is clear that we need to do a better job  This legislation will help close the gaps in controlling these materials and keeping them out of the hands of those who wish to do our country harm          We have known for some time that Al Qaeda is trying to build dirty bombs or homemade nuclear weapons    documents with nuclear information have turned up in caves in Afghanistan  and other intelligence and terror alerts have made explicit mention of the threat of radiological bombs   said Rep  Markey   Yet security associated with these materials is sorely lacking         Radiation sources are numerous in the United States and not all radiological materials are subject to federal oversight  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  reports that about 157 000 general and specific licenses have been issued authorizing the use of radioactive materials for industrial  medical  and other uses  About 1 8 million devices containing radioactive sources have been distributed under these licenses  A 2003 GAO report found that since 1998  there have been more than 1 300 incidents where radiation sources were lost  stolen or abandoned  While not all of these sources and incidents present potential dirty bomb threats  it is clear evidence that we need to improve oversight of radioactive materials         The bill introduced today by Senator Clinton and Representative Markey aims to correct serious deficiencies in security by taking immediate action to close gaps in our control and oversight of these materials  The legislation gives the NRC the authority and mandate to provide oversight of Radium 226 and other naturally occurring radiological materials that have historically remained outside of federal control  Radium 226 is of particular concern  The Department of Energy considers it one of the top ten isotopes of concern for use in a dirty bomb  and it is on the list of radiation sources that the United States has agreed to control as part of adhering to the International Atomic Energy Agency Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources  However  it remains in the public domain and outside of the federal regulatory net  Radium 226 was used in medicine starting early in the 20th century  increasing in use until the 1950s when there were more than 5 000 radium users in the U S         The legislation would also require the NRC within six months to enact a  cradle to grave  tracking system to ensure that we know the location of all radiation sources of concern at all times  The bill also requires the establishment of import and export controls for radiation sources so that we know what is coming into and leaving our country as part of our efforts to control these materials         Finally  the bill includes forward looking measures to help reduce our risks  The bill directs the Academy of Sciences to conduct an assessment of whether some current industrial uses of radiation could be replaced with non radioactive or less dangerous radioactive materials and creates an interagency task force on radiation source protection that will provide recommendations to Congress and the NRC on the safety and security of radiation sources         The legislation builds on bills that Senator Clinton and Representative Markey introduced in the 108th Congress  They will work in both Chambers of Congress to try and enact the legislation this year
