November 3  2006 Senator Clinton Calls for Better Support for National Guard and Reserve Members and their Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today submitted recommendations to the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves on expanded support needed for National Guard and Reserve members and their families in recognition of the greater demands placed on them to meet national and homeland security objectives   Senator Clinton  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  was invited by the Commission to submit recommendations            We need to recognize the increased role of these units  and acknowledge their ever increasing sacrifice  A failure to address these new realities and challenges will inevitably lead to recruitment and retention problems  and they could hinder the ability of the National Guard and Reserve components to meet their new  expanded missions thereby inhibiting and undermining the ability of the Armed Forces as a whole     Senator Clinton underscored             If the National Guard and Reserves are asked to play a more active role overseas and in homeland security deployments  then we have to provide more benefits and opportunities on par with our other active duty forces  To do otherwise is unfair to those who sacrifice so much for our country  We need to provide National Guard and reserve soldiers with better health care and health tracking  better training and equipment  and better support for military families     Senator Clinton emphasized          The independent Commission on the National Guard and Reserves is charged by Congress to recommend any needed changes in law and policy to ensure that the Guard and Reserves are organized  trained  equipped  compensated  and supported to best meet the national security requirements of the United States   The Commission was established under the FY 2005 Department of Defense authorization bill           The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s recommendations          Major General Arnold L  Punaro  USMC  Ret    Chairman  Commission on the National Guard and Reserves  Suite 650  2521 South Clark Street  Arlington  Virginia 22202      Dear General Punaro       Thank you for the invitation to make a submission to the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves   As our nation continues to place heavy burdens on the National Guard and Reserves  the work of your commission is critical to the future of our national defense            As you are well aware  Guard and Reserve service no longer means one weekend a month and two weeks a year  Over 380 000 National Guard and Reserve members have deployed in support of the Global War on Terrorism since the attacks on September 11   Activated units are playing critically important roles in the War on Terrorism  and subsequently their deployments are reflective of their active duty counterpart   The National Guard and Reserve members have responded magnificently to the increased demands placed upon them   They serve willingly and nobly even though  in some circumstances  they return to economic and family dislocation          This shift in how we employ the National Guard and Reserves from a strategic to operational force requires a holistic review   We need to recognize the increased role of these units  and acknowledge their ever increasing sacrifice   A failure to address these new realities and challenges will inevitably lead to recruitment and retention problems  and they could hinder the ability of the National Guard and Reserve components to meet their new  expanded missions thereby inhibiting and undermining the ability of the Armed Forces as a whole   If the National Guard and Reserves are asked to play a more active role overseas and in homeland security deployments  then we have to provide more benefits and opportunities on par with our other active duty forces   To do otherwise is unfair to those who sacrifice so much for our country   We need to provide National Guard members and Reservists with better health care and health tracking  better training and equipment  and better support for military families       Benefits      The importance of medical readiness of Reserve members    ensuring Reserve members are medically ready to deploy before calling them to active duty    must be addressed   Additionally  consideration should be given to health care stability for family and service member  as well as adding more relief for self employed service members   Early in my tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee  I was surprised to learn that the percentage of members of the reserve components of the military without health insurance coverage was 20 percent higher than the general population   Over the past few legislative cycles we have made progress in providing greater access to TRICARE  the military health insurance program  for members of the reserve component  expanding coverage based on time spent on active duty and providing greater cost share options for certain personnel            Since joining the Senate Armed Services Committee  I have advocated expanding access to TRICARE for members of the reserve component   In 2003  I joined Senator Lindsay Graham and several other colleagues in introducing the National Guard and Reserves Reform for the   21st Century which proposed permitting Selected Reserve members to enroll themselves and family members under the TRICARE program   Last year  Senator Graham and I secured passage of an amendment to the Department of Defense  DoD  bill that made all members of the Selected Reserve eligible to enroll in TRICARE  and created a separate category based on whether a member of the Guard or Reserves had been deployed           This year  I co sponsored legislation with Senator Graham and Senator Saxby Chambliss to further expand health care to members of the Guard and Reserves in this year  s Authorization Act as well as lowering the retirement age for Guard members and Reservists based on years of service    Therefore  it was a significant victory when the final bill signed into law by the President included legislative language which expanded TRICARE access to all National Guard and Reserve members at a 28 percent cost share   The next challenge will be to ensure that the Department of Defense implements this expanded benefit expeditiously            Another health care issue important to our Guard members and Reservists is the treatment that they receive when they return from combat tours overseas   Many of our service members serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  including members of the Guard and Reserves  have suffered grievous injuries including Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI    With Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI  emerging as the   signature    injury of this war  we must be prepared to deal with the long term implications on our soldiers and veterans   We must plan for the requirements TBI will bring with it   The Fiscal Year 2007 DoD Authorization bill included most elements of an amendment I authored entitled   Heroes at Home      This amendment will assist military service members of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  with readjustment to work  the problems of posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and other mental health issues  and traumatic brain injury  TBI   The initiative  which is supported by the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  also provides support to their family members           Now we must ensure that the Department of Defense fulfills its obligations and establishes appropriate policies and procedures to meet the evolving needs of the members of the Reserves and their families when they are on active duty or back home   As a starting point  the DoD Appropriations bill included  3 million to provide initial funding for Heroes at Home   This funding will help support community based programs that provide mental health and readjustment assistance to National Guard and Reserve members and their families  since many of these troops return to local communities scattered across the country far away from military bases and VA hospitals   The funding will also bolster community resources to more effectively support our newest generation of war heroes serving in the Guard and Reserve after deployment  in addition to their loved ones   Despite more services offered at DoD and VA facilities  service members often are reluctant to go to traditional military or veterans   mental health clinics due to stigma and concerns about confidentiality  and their family members may not be eligible   With this funding  programs offered in places like community clinics  community colleges  and family support organizations will be better equipped to help Guard and Reservists and their families with mental health problems  such as providing education to increase awareness about PTSD and other readjustment concerns and making referrals for additional care if needed   The community focus of this effort is crucial because many Guard and Reservists and their loved ones will first turn to resources in their local communities and neighborhoods for assistance with challenges like PTSD  depression  and relationship difficulties   Moving forward  we must increase funding for these critical programs            Another issue that is important for the recruitment and retention of our reserve component is lowering the retirement age based on years of service   This year  the Senate passed an amendment  which I co sponsored  to the Defense Authorization bill which would require that for every consecutive 90 days a member spends in an active federal status  the age at which they receive their retirement annuity would be decreased by three months   The lowest a member could collect retirement pay as a result of this provision would be age 50 but the age at which they would qualify for health care benefits would not decrease   Any Guard or Reserve member who is called or ordered to active duty or volunteers for active duty would qualify   While this provision did not survive in the House Senate Defense Authorization bill conference report  the support that it received in the Senate demonstrates that this will continue to be an issue that resonates in future Congresses         Equipment and Training      Our experience in Iraq  especially  demonstrates that our forces need to be trained for an environment where the threats come more from shadowy insurgents than a standing military force   Today s battlefield is without boundaries and our enemy knows no difference between active and reserve  thus we need to insure that the reserve components are being given the same quality of equipment as the active duty forces and that their training is being adjusted to take into account the new challenges that our military is facing   Unfortunately the readiness of our reserve component is suffering   In August 2006  according to Lt  General Steven Blum  the chief of the National Guard Bureau  more than two thirds of the Army National Guard s 34 brigades are not combat ready due largely to vast equipment shortfalls that will take as much as  21 billion to correct          We need to rebalance forces  forecast reserve components needed for deployment  mobilize those needed  and provide proper refresher training in basic skills and targeted training for the area of deployment   We must consider the re set  re equip plans for the reserve components to ensure they are trained  ready  and able to support potential missions   While priority necessarily goes to deploying units  reserve component units cannot afford to wait 3 5 more years    as they re enter a deployment cycle    to have their equipment replaced   There must be a coherent plan in place to ensure reserve component units have the personnel in place  equipment on hand  and time to train for all possible future mission   According to Lt  Gen  Jack Stultz  the Chief of the Army Reserve   We have provided a lot of equipment to  the Iraqi  theater that has remained   That creates shortages on this  stateside  end    We still have deuce and a half trucks    We ve got to get that equipment replaced    Moreover  I have heard anecdotal stories of New York families sending their own personal equipment  bulletproof vests  night vision goggles  and even bandages  to try to help their loved ones who are stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan   Inadequate equipment for any of our troops  whether they are active duty  Guard or Reserve is unacceptable         Support for Guard and Reserve Families      We also need to do a better job providing support and communication with Guard and Reserve families who may not have been prepared for extended deployments   Spouses and children of the reserves experience the same challenges  often without the supportive environment that a military post provides for active family members   It is critical that we create this same kind of network and communication so that families do not feel abandoned   Support and communication with families can play an important role in ensuring that we are able to recruit and retain members of the National Guard and Reserves         The National Guard and Homeland Security      We need to take account of the increasingly important role of the National Guard in homeland security   Hurricane Katrina showed us how essential the National Guard is in responding to natural disasters   Similarly  since September 11th  we have asked the Guard to assist in securing our critical infrastructure   These tasks have provided the National Guard with unique challenges  and we need to take advantage of the National Guard  s knowledge regarding homeland security    We need to share this knowledge with other first responders and to develop a seamless mechanism which allows the National Guard to work closely with local police and fire departments to prepare for and respond to future incidents of national concern   Much of this can be done without any change to posse comitatus  which prohibits the United States military acting as law enforcement          While we need to be thinking of ways in which the National Guard can contribute to homeland security  we need to be sure that the pattern of Guard and Reserve deployments do not actually end up hindering our homeland security   In many communities throughout our nation  a significant number of police officers  firefighters  and EMTs  who are first responders in case of attack  are also members of the National Guard or Reserves   And in a time of large scale activations and extended deployments  many communities are left short handed without enough first responders to handle a major crisis   This has occurred in communities in New York  and it is likely that other states face similar crippling challenges          Expanding the Army    Finally  one way to reduce the burden on the Guard and the Reserves is to expand the size of the Army   I have supported legislation that would expand the Army by 80 000 troops over a four year period   Given the strain that the Guard and Reserve are experiencing   we must strongly consider the need to expand the size of the Army so we can take some of the strain off the reserve components and shift capabilities of the National Guard and Reserves to better meet today  s and tomorrow  s needs       Conclusion      In the last few years  our nation s reserve components have been called on to serve throughout the world and here at home   They have adapted and transformed themselves to meet these challenges in the midst of a war   They honor the spirit of American citizen soldiers who have been serving since even before the birth of our nation and reflect the full diversity of our nation   It is our responsibility to ensure that they are given the support they need  support at a time when they are adapting and adjusting to this very demanding  changing role   If we are going to demand more from them  we must be prepared to fight for their rights on the principle that they deserve the very best from us           Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my views on this important issue   I look forward to the final report from the Commission            Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
