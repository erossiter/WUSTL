October 25  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on House Vote on Children s Health Insurance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  The House has done the right thing for the millions of children who are waiting for the healthcare they need and deserve   I hope that the Senate will act quickly and that the President will finally put the needs of uninsured children before politics and ideology and sign this bill into law    This bill will provide access to healthcare for an additional nearly four million uninsured children  including approximately 17 000 children in New York   I believe that all children and all Americans should have access to quality  affordable healthcare and this is an important step toward meeting this goal   However  I am disappointed that this bill will not allow high cost states like New York the flexibility to meet their needs   I also am disappointed that this bill does not include the Legal Immigrant Childrens Health Improvement Act  which I introduced with Senator Snowe to enable states to provide the same Medicaid and CHIP coverage to low income legal immigrant children and pregnant women as they do to U S  citizens   I will keep pressing to remove restrictions preventing thousands of legal immigrant children and pregnant women from receiving preventative health services and treatment for minor illnesses before they become serious         I am proud that this bill includes a measure I put forward with Senator Dodd to extend Family and Medical Leave for six months for families of wounded servicemembers   This measure implements a key recommendation of the Dole Shalala Commission on the Care for Wounded Warriors and will have an immediate impact on families facing extraordinary circumstances as they struggle to care for loved ones wounded in service to our nation   I urge the President to support our men and women in uniform and their families and make this needed action the law of the land      Rea  d more statements by Senator Clinton concerning children s health insurance
