August 3  2005 Senator Clinton Joins Other Women Senators in Urging President to Continue to Express US Support for Iraqi Women  s Rights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    With the deadline for the Iraqi National Assembly to approve a draft constitution fast approaching  Senator Clinton and 10 other women Senators sent a letter today to President Bush urging him to support a draft Iraqi constitution that would maintain equality before the law for both men and women          Just last January  we saw Iraqi women who refused to be turned away from polling stations despite enormous risk and sometimes even flying bullets   It would be a travesty if Iraqi women were in any way marginalized under their new government     said Senator Clinton     The new Iraqi constitution should make it clear that their government will be a government of  by and for Iraqis  including Iraqi women             This letter was sent in response to reports that the draft Iraqi constitution  which is scheduled to be approved by the Iraqi parliament on August 15  contains provisions that would specifically target women  s rights and weaken many of the provisions contained under the draft law    In the letter  the Senators stated    To dilute or delete any language that establishes the principle of equality before the law  regardless of gender  would greatly hurt the women in Iraq  especially those who are helping to rebuild this country in the post Saddam era  These women should not be denied their rightful place in society by those who do not believe women  s rights are human rights               The following is a text of the letter            Dear Mr  President          We are deeply concerned that provisions being considered for inclusion in the Iraqi draft constitution may jeopardize the rights of Iraqi women  We are pleased at the comments of Zalmay Khalilzad  U S  Ambassador to Iraq  stating that the United States will work to guarantee the principle of   equality before the law for men and women    and we urge you to continue to express our support for a constitution that would maintain rights for women and equality for all Iraqis          As you know  the National Assembly is scheduled to approve a draft constitution by August 15  2005  with a national vote on this document by October 15  2005  This constitution will replace the Transitional Administrative Law  TAL   which provides for equality of all Iraqis regardless of gender and sets the goal of providing Iraqi women with 25  of the seats in the transitional assembly  We strongly believe that Iraqi women must have every opportunity to participate in all levels of government so that they can ensure that any laws passed by the Iraqi government will not take away their rights or relegate them to second tier status          It is our understanding that the current draft of the constitution contains provisions that would weaken the language contained in the TAL  Additionally  we understand that the draft would not include language ensuring the significant representation of women in the parliament  To dilute or delete any language that establishes the principle of equality before the law  regardless of gender  would greatly hurt the women in Iraq  especially those who are helping to rebuild this country in the post Saddam era  These women should not be denied their rightful place in society by those who do not believe women  s rights are human rights          At a time when our troops are fighting to support freedom and equality in Iraq  we should support their work by expressing our strong belief in equal rights for all Iraqi citizens  We would urge you to continue to demonstrate our country  s support of equality for all Iraqis before the law  regardless of gender  and help the Iraqi people as they continue to establish a new  democratic government  The women of Iraq deserve our full support as they seek to achieve equal rights in their new society          Thank you for your attention to this matter          Sincerely
