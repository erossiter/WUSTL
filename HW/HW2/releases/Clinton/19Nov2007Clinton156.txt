November 19  2007 Clinton and Rockefeller Introduce Legislation to Improve the Process of Adopting Children from Foster Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator John Rockefeller today announced the introduction of the Adoption Improvement Act of 2007  The bill establishes a demonstration project aimed at improving the retention of adults who inquire with child welfare agencies about adopting children from foster care    We have made important advances in the child welfare system since the Adoption and Safe Families Act was introduced a decade ago  but we still have work to do in order to increase the number of adoptions nationwide  Senator Clinton said  This initiative will help the tens of thousands of children still waiting for families find permanent  loving homes    I believe that success today is when we hear of a child who has found a loving home  and when we see a sad situation turn into an inspirational story of hope  Senator Rockefeller said  But success tomorrow will be when we reach each and every child  when not one is left wondering who is there to love them  when not one is left without a nurturing home    A recent study conducted by the Evan B  Donaldson Adoption Institute in collaboration with Harvard University and the Urban Institute indicates that while 240 000 prospective parents inquire annually about adopting a child from foster care  only a fraction of these individuals follow the process through to adoption   According to this study  78 percent of adults who call for more information about becoming adoptive parents neither fill out an application nor attend an orientation meeting for prospective parents  Only 6 percent of those who call for information actually complete an adoption homestudy  a requirement for all parents seeking to adopt  Prospective adoptive parents encounter a number of barriers that discourage them from adopting  such as unpleasant initial contacts with the child welfare system and frustration in navigating the adoption process     This situation persists at a time when tens of thousands of children linger in foster care  awaiting permanent families  According to the most recent federal data  there are 114 000 children in foster care with the goal of adoption  Only 13 percent of these children live in pre adoptive homes  For years  child welfare researchers have highlighted the detrimental effects of prolonged foster care on children  Permanence for these children is therefore essential     The Adoption Improvement Act helps child welfare agencies in their quests to find permanence for children in foster care  The legislation establishes a demonstration project to help child welfare agencies retain prospective adoptive parents throughout the adoption process  Participating agencies will create their programs according to recommendations drawn from child welfare research  Program elements will include  among others  establishing an adoption hotline  hiring specially trained professionals to answer adoption inquiries efficiently and sensitively  providing prospective parents with explicit information about the adoption process  its rewards and challenges  and incorporating the input of parents who have already adopted from foster care      This bill marks another initiative in Senator Clintons long history of working toward increasing and improving the adoption of children from foster care  As First Lady  Senator Clinton worked with Congress to establish the Adoption Incentives program  and in the Senate she has fought to increase the adoption tax credit  and has co sponsored legislation aimed at increasing adoptions of foster children with special needs
