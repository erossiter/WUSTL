October 13  2006 Letter from Senator Clinton to Federal Aviation Administrator Blakey Calling for an Immediate and Thorough Reevaluation of the Current Airspace System in the New York Metropolitan Area                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Click here to read Senator Clinton s statement concerning the Tragic Plane Crash in New York City       The Honorable Marion Blakey  Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20591      Dear Ms  Blakey       As you are aware  a small general aviation aircraft crashed into a building on East 72nd Street in New York City yesterday afternoon killing two individuals and causing major damage to the residential building impacted   The National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  has launched their   Go Team    to begin the federal investigation into the cause of this crash          The Department of Homeland Security issued a report in May 2006  in response to an amendment I had included within the FY 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill   The language included in the bill required the Secretary of Homeland Security  in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation  to submit a report on   the vulnerability posed to high risk areas and facilities from general aviation aircraft that could be stolen or used as a weapon against those areas      The areas required to be assessed include   critical transportation infrastructure  nuclear facilities  military bases  and other highly populated areas with similarly situated critical infrastructure             The report addressed general aviation nationwide and confirmed the findings of the 9 11 Commission Report   Both reports refer to the threat that general aviation poses and that because we have put significant resources into protecting our commercial aviation system those seeking to do harm to our nation will shift their attention to general aviation assets          Yesterday  s crash revealed some disturbing aspects about the rules governing the airspace surrounding New York City   In particular  that general aviation aircraft of various types are allowed along the Hudson and East Rivers  in close proximity to several key landmarks and buildings without a requirement of having to coordinate with air traffic controllers   We do not know the cause of yesterday  s crash   However  I believe we need an immediate reevaluation of the airspace regulations in and around densely populated areas as well as such landmarks as the Statue of Liberty            I realize that any changes to the current airspace system must be done with the input and recommendations of several experts   The destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11  2001  showed us the true threat posed by commercial aviation   None of us wants to learn the same tragic lesson about the threat posed by general aviation aircraft   We must do everything in our power to mitigate against future incidents            Therefore  I am asking the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  to conduct an immediate and thorough reevaluation of the current airspace system in the New York Metropolitan area and to brief Congress on suggested changes to existing airspace rules to ensure that the safety of both those in the air and on the ground is appropriately balanced          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton    CC             The Honorable Mary Peters  Secretary of Transportation    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary of Homeland Security    The Honorable Kip Hawley  Administrator  Transportation Security Administration    The Honorable George Pataki  Governor of New York    The Honorable Michael Bloomberg  Mayor of New York City    The Honorable Fran Townsend  White House Homeland Security Advisor
