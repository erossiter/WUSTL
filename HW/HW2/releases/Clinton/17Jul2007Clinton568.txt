July 17  2007 Senator Clinton Introduces Legislation to Help Safeguard Children Against Lead Hazards in the Home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DCToday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton reintroduced legislation to provide a tax credit for safely removing lead based paint hazards from homes and rental units  This legislation offers much needed incentives for property owners to ensure homes are free of environmental dangers that can harm children   Although the federal government has set a goal of eliminating toxic blood levels in young children by 2010  an estimated 500 000 children under the age of six have enough lead their blood to adversely affect their development    Lead poisoning is a serious  entirely preventable threat to the health and development of our children  affecting intelligence  behavior and ability to learn   We need innovative  cost effective solutions to reach the goal of eliminating lead poisoning  said Senator Clinton        The Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2007 changes the IRS code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for 50 percent of the cost of lead hazard reduction efforts  up to a maximum of  3000 for lead abatement and  1000 for interim control measures   These measures can include window replacement  safe repainting  and specialized renovation work practices to reduce lead poisoning   This tax credit is targeted to homes with children younger than six years of age  women of childbearing age  low income residents  and buildings built before 1960  as these include more than 96 percent of all units where lead based paint is prevalent     Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still over 24 million housing units in the United States that have lead paint hazards  with about 1 2 million in New York State alone   However  current Federal lead abatement programs only have resources sufficient to make approximately 8 800 home lead safe each year   The Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2007 would help to make over 80 000 homes safe from lead each year  nearly 10 times the capacity of current Federal programs     In New York State  about five percent of children screened for lead poisoning at age two were found to have elevated blood lead levels  more than twice the national average   Minority and poor children are disproportionately at risk  For example  in New York City  about 95 percent of children with elevated blood levels were African American  Hispanic or Asian     Lead poisoning is the number one environmental health threat to children of color in the United States  especially low income children and children living in inner cities   African American children are estimated as having 2 5 times greater risk of being exposed to lead poisoning than white children  and Latino children have 1 5 times greater risk than white children   Compounding the problem is the fact that 77 percent of eligible children are not screened for exposure to lead      Senator Clinton has a strong record of leadership on lead poisoning prevention  Senator Clinton joined with her colleagues to introduce legislation to remove lead from child care facilities and separate legislation to tighten lead safety standards in childrens toys and electronics   She also joined with colleagues to call on the Senate Appropriations Committee to provide  185 million for the Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide needed resources for lead poisoning prevention
