April 6  2005 Senator Clinton Confronts EPA Nominee Over Mercury and Acid Rain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Calls on next possible EPA Administrator to revisit mercury rule and release long awaited report on acid rain as priorities if confirmed  Washington  DC    As part of her continued efforts to counter the effect of the Bush Administration  s poor environmental policies on New York  Senator Clinton made several requests of the President  s nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency EPA   Stephen L  Johnson  The Senate is considering Mr  Johnson  who is currently Acting Administrator  to replace former Administrator  Michael Leavitt      In a private meeting with Acting Administrator Johnson late yesterday and then again today in a statement submitted to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Clinton called on Mr  Johnson to revise and strengthen the Administration  s recent regulation on mercury emissions from power plants  and to release a long awaited report to Congress on acid rain if he is confirmed by the Senate        In my meeting with Mr  Johnson  I raised a number of environmental issues of critical importance to New York     Senator Clinton said    I urged Mr  Johnson to take swift action on these issues if he is confirmed by the Senate         Citing her concern over continued acid rain damage in the Adirondacks  Senator Clinton called on the Acting Administrator to produce a report to Congress about acid deposit trends across the nation  Under the Clean Air Act  the EPA is required to present such a report to Congress every four years and yet so far  has not fulfilled this requirement         In spite of evidence of continuing problems in the Adirondacks and elsewhere across the state and the country  the Bush Administration has not fulfilled its requirement to regularly report to Congress on the impact of acid rain     Senator Clinton said     It is critical that Congress have this information to understand what additional steps are needed to restore places like the Adirondacks that have been ravaged by acid rain  The Environmental Protection Agency has a responsibility to Congress and to the people to release this report and I have asked Acting Administrator Johnson to release this report as one of his first priorities if he is confirmed         To ensure that Congress has the information it needs to determine whether acid rain is being adequately addressed  the Clean Air Act requires the Administration to submit a report to Congress every two years showing acid deposition trends   Every four years  this report is also required to recommend pollution reductions levels necessary to prevent adverse ecological effects      Senator Clinton also criticized the Acting Administrator for recently finalizing the EPA  s rule on mercury emissions and called on him to act immediately to revise the rule if confirmed  flagging her own intention to seek a congressional means by which to block the implementation of the rule        The recent decision to finalize a mercury rule was both unlawful and inadequately protective of public health and the environment     Senator Clinton said     In our meeting yesterday  I told Mr  Johnson that I will be supporting Congressional efforts to overturn this regulation and I urged him to act immediately to revise the rule to better protect New Yorkers   health and environment from the dangers of mercury         New research appearing next month in the scientific journal Ecotoxicology documents for the first time the wide ranging negative impact of mercury deposition on ecosystem health   We now know that certain regions of the Northeast  including the Adirondacks  have been identified as hotspots or areas of high mercury contamination in fish  birds and other animals   In spite of these facts  the rule that Acting Administrator Johnson finalized requires only modest mercury cuts  does not require installation of mercury specific emissions controls at power plants for more than a decade  and allows trading of mercury
