February 17  2007 Clinton Plan to End War Reject the President s Escalation  Protect U S  Troops in Iraq  Begin Redeploying Our Troops  Enables President to End War Before Leaving Office                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Introduces the Iraq Troop Reduction   Protection Act of 2007 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton renewed her call on President Bush to reverse course and endorse the plan she outlined several weeks ago that would cap the level of U S  troops in Iraq at the number prior to his escalation plan  and begin the long overdue phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq beginning in 90 days   Senator Clinton outlined her plan when she returned last month from her third trip to Iraq and is formally introduced the legislation yesterday           I came back from Iraq more determined then ever to stop the President s escalation of troops into Iraq  and to start the long overdue redeployment of troops out of Iraq   Senator Clinton said    The Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act that I proposed last month and introduced this week caps the number of troops in Iraq at the level before the President s escalation   It would be against the law to send more  The legislation also protects our troops who are performing so heroically  by making sure they aren t sent to Iraq without the body armor and training they need   empty promises from the President just aren t enough anymore    And it calls for the phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq   I ve been pushing for this for almost two years   Now it s time to say the redeployment should start in ninety days or we will revoke authorization for this war   This plan is a roadmap out of Iraq   I hope the President takes this road   If he does  he should be able to end the war before he leaves office           The Iraq Troop Protection   Reduction Act of 2007 presents a comprehensive approach to Iraq that halts the President s escalation policy and provides an alternative strategy in Iraq with the goal of stabilizing the country so American troops can redeploy out of Iraq   Senator Clinton s legislation puts real pressure on the Iraqi government  requiring the Iraqis to make political progress or lose funding for their military and reconstruction  require the Bush Administration to begin a phased redeployment and convene an international conference within 90 days or a new Congressional authorization would be required to remain in Iraq   Finally  the legislation would prohibit the use of funds to send troops to Iraq unless they have the proper equipment and training   If the President were to follow the provisions in this legislation then the United States should be able to complete a redeployment of troops out of Iraq by the end of his term           A Summary of the legislation    STOPPING THE PRESIDENT S ESCALATION OF THE WAR  This legislation would cap U S  troop numbers in Iraq at the January 1  2007 level   prior to the announcement of the troop escalation by President Bush   It would require Congressional authorization to exceed the cap    ENDING THE BLANK CHECK FOR THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT   Recent press reports have indicated that U S  trained Iraqi security forces may be infiltrated by Iraqi militias and thus U S  funds may have been used to train the very people that our men and women in uniform are fighting   In order to exert leverage on the Iraqi government  the legislation would cut off funds for Iraqi security forces  including private contractors as well as reconstruction funds within 90 days unless the President certifies that the Iraqi government has met certain conditions   The legislation would require that the Iraqi government meet a number of conditions  including         The security forces of the Government of Iraq are free of sectarian and militia influences              The security forces of the Government of Iraq are assuming greater responsibility for security in Iraq              The government of Iraq provides for an equitable distribution of the oil revenues of Iraq              There has been significant progress made in political accommodation among the ethnic and sectarian groups in Iraq            The security forces of the Government of Iraq are assuming greater responsibility for security in Iraq               The government of Iraq provides for an equitable distribution of the oil revenues of Iraq               There has been significant progress made in political accommodation among the ethnic and sectarian groups in Iraq      If Congress disagrees with the President s certification  Congress would have 60 days to  disapprove  of the Presidential certification resulting in a cutoff of funds for the Iraqi government       STARTING PHASED REDEPLOYMENT AND INVOLVING COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IN THE FUTURE OF IRAQ   The legislation requires the U S  begin a phased redeployment of U S  troops in 90 days or the authority of the use of force would cease   Specifically it requires that a phased redeployment of United States military forces from Iraq has begun including the transition of United States forces in Iraq to the limited presence and mission of         Training Iraqi security forces              Providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces              Protecting United States personnel and infrastructure  and              Participating in targeted counter terrorism activities            Providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces               Protecting United States personnel and infrastructure  and               Participating in targeted counter terrorism activities      The legislation also requires that the United States has convened or is convening an international conference so as to            More actively involve the international community and Iraq s neighbors              Promote a durable political settlement among Iraqis              Reduce regional interference in the internal affairs of Iraq              Encourage more countries to contribute to the extensive needs in Iraq  and              Ensure that funds pledged for Iraq are forthcoming            Promote a durable political settlement among Iraqis               Reduce regional interference in the internal affairs of Iraq               Encourage more countries to contribute to the extensive needs in Iraq  and               Ensure that funds pledged for Iraq are forthcoming   PROTECTING OUR TROOPS SENT INTO IRAQ   The legislation would prohibit funds from being spent to send troops to Iraq unless the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the troops being deployed are adequately equipped and trained for their mission in Iraq            Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
