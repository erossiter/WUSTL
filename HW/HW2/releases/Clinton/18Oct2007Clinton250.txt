October 18  2007 Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Press Conference Call on the Appointment of Dr  Susan Orr as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Click here for audio    Senator Clinton  This is Hillary Clinton and I want to echo my friend and colleague Senator Murrays comments  I want to thank Cecile and Planned Parenthood for their dedication to protect womens health  We know that progress around the world depends upon the progress of women and it is just beyond satire to see what this administration has once again done     The appointment of Dr  Susan Orr sent a message to women that ideology trumps womens health  We have therefore joined together  Senator Murray and I along with a number of our colleagues  to send a letter to Secretary Leavitt today  urging that HHS withdraws this nomination  Unfortunately  this nomination is part of a dangerous pattern  political appointees overruling doctors  muzzling scientists  putting ideology ahead of sound decisions governing womens health  In fact  last November I joined with thirteen of my colleagues in opposing the last nomination the Bush Administration made to the same position  This is dj vu all over again     The office to which Dr  Orr has been appointed gives her the authority over Title X which funds low cost  confidential family planning and health screening services that would otherwise be out of reach for millions of Americans  In the Bush Administration  it truly is the fox guarding the henhouse when it comes to family planning and womens health  and women across the country should be alarmed  Dr  Orr would also oversee counseling in the providing of information to women on a broad range of family planning and reproductive services  including contraception     She has a troubling history of opposing federal funding for contraception  which is counter to the mission of the office to which she has been appointed   In 2001 she spoke in favor of a Bush Administration plan to drop a requirement that health insurance for federal employees cover birth control  Were quite pleased because fertility is not a disease  she said at the time on contraception  Its not a medical necessity that you have it    Dr  Orr also publicly urged President Bush to overrule scientists and doctors to revoke FDA approval for RU 486  And before joining the Bush Administration she was senior director at an organization whose ideologically driven agenda labeled the scientifically  based  medically based FDA approval of emergency contraception known as Plan B a grave threat to womens health     You know  the American people deserve a qualified public health expert who will ensure that the needs of women and families are met  It is our hope that the Bush Administration will withdraw this appointment and select a Deputy Assistant Secretary who will serve womens health  instead of serving an ideological and political agenda
