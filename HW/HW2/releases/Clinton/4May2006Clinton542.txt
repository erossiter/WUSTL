May 4  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Zacarias Moussaoui Verdict                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Today  s decision by a federal jury that Al Qaeda terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui should spend the rest of his life in prison for his role in the September 11th terrorist attacks is a painful reminder not only of the tragic loss suffered that fateful day  but that we must do everything within our power to ensure the safety of our citizens and our nation   I praise the bravery of the families who came forward and testified at his trial   Their strength should serve as an example of the resilience we must all display in protecting our nation from future attacks   My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to all the families who lost loved ones on September 11th
