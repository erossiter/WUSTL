September 11  2007 Senator Clinton Questions General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker on Iraq at Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Senator Clinton  I want to thank both of you  General Petraeus  Ambassador Crocker  for your long and distinguished service to our nation  Nobody believes that your jobs or the jobs of the thousands of American forces and civilian personnel in Iraq are anything but incredibly difficult    But today you are testifying about the current status of our policy in Iraq and the prospects of that policy  It is a policy that you have been ordered to implement by the president  And you have been made the de facto spokesmen for what many of us believe to be a failed policy     Despite what I view as your rather extraordinary efforts in your testimony both yesterday and today  I think that the reports that you provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief     In any of the metrics that have been referenced in your many hours of testimony  any fair reading of the advantages and disadvantages accruing post surge  in my view  end up on the downside    I started my morning today at ground zero  where once again the names of the nearly 3 000 victims of the attack on our country were read solemnly in the rain     We have seen Osama bin Laden reappear on our television sets  essentially taunting us  We have the most recent reports out of Germany of terrorists plotting against American assets who have been trained in Pakistan  And we get very little comfort from the fact that the mastermind of that mass murder is at large  neither captured nor killed  and that the Taliban and Al Qaida are resurging in Afghanistan and their network is certainly  if not tightly organized  a loose confederacy that has grave consequences for us            With respect to Anbar province  a lot has been made of the coalition s work with the sheiks  but that was going on before the surge     General  in your testimony during your confirmation hearings you referenced the fact that the sheiks were coming over  that there was already a decision by a lot of the tribal leaders that they would no longer tolerate the extraordinary brutality of the Al Qaida elements in Al Anbar province     With respect to violence within Iraq  although the charts tell part of the story  I don t think they tell the whole story  If you look at all of the evidence that s been presented  overall civilian deaths have risen  The number of car bombings is higher  May was the deadliest month in 2007 with 1 901 civilian deaths    American military casualties are greater every month in 2007 than in the same month in 2006  leaving us with a total thus far  through August  of 739 Americans killed     The Iraqi reconciliation process is now described as relying upon bottoms up efforts  which are anecdotal  which have very little hard evidence to support what needs to be accomplished     Senator Warner s very specific questions about what is happening from top down certainly lead to the conclusion that not very much is occurring that can give us comfort that the Iraqi leadership is yet ready to put aside their sectarian  commercial and personal interests for some kind of greater Iraqi political reconciliation     Iraqi public opinion  according to an ABC  BBC  NHK poll released September 10th shows that since the escalation began  Iraqi opinion has starkly turned against the U S  occupation  as most Iraqis see deepening dissatisfaction with conditions in Iraq  lower ratings for the national government  growing rejection of the U S  role there     For example  65 percent to 70 percent of Iraqis say the escalation has worsened rather than improved security  39 percent say that their lives are going well  down from 71 percent in November 2005  and 47 percent now favor immediate withdrawal of U S  forces  a 12 point rise since March     Overwhelming majorities give negative ratings to electricity  jobs and access to health care     So I give you tremendous credit for presenting as positive a view of a rather grim reality  And I believe that you  and certainly the very capable people working with both of you  were dealt a very hard hand     And it s a hand that is unlikely to improve  in my view     General  I want to ask you what    about what appeared to be a contradiction in your testimony  Earlier today  you were asked by Senator Biden if  in fact  the circumstances on the ground are exactly what they are today in March of next year  will you recommend the continuation of somewhere between 130 000 and 160 000 American troops being shot at  killed  and maimed every day     Your answer  I would be very hard pressed to recommend that at that point in time     In response to Senator Collins  who asked  I thought  a very important question about what if in a year from now  there has been very little progress  your answer was  Well  we would have to consider what to do at that time     General  don t you think the American people deserve a very specific answer about what is expected from our country in the face of the failure of the Iraqi government to pursue its own required political agenda that they have essentially been unwilling or incapable of doing so            General Petraeus  Senator  I don t see quite as big a difference in the answer     But  I mean  I will stand by the answer that I gave earlier  which is that I would be very hard pressed  at that time  to recommend a continuation     As you know  this policy is a national policy that results from policies put forward at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue  with the advice and consent and resources provided at the other  And I would  obviously  provide recommendations to that     And again  I would just say  I would be very hard pressed at that time  It s an awfully big hypothetical  And it is not something that I would want to try to determine right here  right now  about a point a year from now  without some sense of all the other variables that  I think  understandably  would go into a huge recommendation like that    Senator Clinton  Ambassador  it s not only the Iraqi government that  in my view  has failed to pursue a coherent strategy  I think our own has as well     You ve been tasked  as I understand it  with carrying the only contact with the Iranians and others in the region  And many of us have long advocated that our government needed to be much more engaged in a robust diplomatic effort     Do you believe that  if the full force and effect of the American government were brought to bear on the region and  more broadly  on countries that have a stake in the future of Iraq  even beyond the region  that there were some process established that could begin to try to sort out what was or wasn t possible  that that would be an additional benefit to your efforts  going forward in Iraq    Ambassador Crocker  Senator  engaging the region and the international community more broadly in support of Iraq is important  And that is ongoing and it s accelerating    This fall  we ll have at least two ministerial level meetings on Iraq  the one that I mentioned involving the neighbors  plus the P 5 and the G 8 in Istanbul    And then  in a little less than two weeks in New York  the secretary general of the U N  and Prime Minister Maliki will jointly chair an international ministerial level meeting to review progress on the International Compact with Iraq and also to focus on how the new United Nations mandate for Iraq    the expanded mandate for Iraq can most effectively be implemented     So I think we re seeing an increase in regional and international diplomacy in support of Iraq  We re also starting to see  I think  some change in attitudes  I talked a little bit earlier about some positive developments among some of Iraq s Arab neighbors  I think we re also seeing a new look at Iraq on the part of  at least  some of the European states     During a 10 day period  for example  at the end of August  we had the visits of Bernard Kouchner  the foreign minister of France  and then right after that  Carl Bildt  the foreign minister of Sweden    the first time  really  since 2003  we have seen major European states kind of send their foreign ministers into Iraq to kind of assess where Iraq is and how they can perhaps more effectively engage for the future     So I think we re seeing that kind of diplomatic initiative now gain some further momentum
