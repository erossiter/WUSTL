May 14  2007 Statement Of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton On Recent Developments In Nigeria s Elections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    In the wake of the April Nigerian elections  which international and domestic observers have judged to be deeply flawed  opposition leaders have wisely decided to take their complaints to the courts  rather than to the streets   I urge both Nigerians and the greater international community to allow the legal process to continue to its conclusion  peacefully and patiently   I  along with many of my colleagues in the United States Congress  was disappointed that the most recent test of Nigeria s democratic institutions  national elections  failed that country s citizens   It is my hope that the judicial decisions regarding the outcome of these elections will be made expeditiously so that Nigerians from all political persuasions can move forward in their efforts to fully institutionalize the hallmarks of democratic governance  progress which I welcome and encourage   Nigeria is a country of great importance to the United States  and I hope that as Nigeria s democracy strengthens  so too will our bilateral relationship
