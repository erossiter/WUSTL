April 29  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  on the Congressional Budget Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    This budget resolution is the latest example of the misplaced priorities of the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress  It walks away from any semblance of fiscal responsibility and it turns a blind eye to the real challenges facing our nation        The Republican budget creates an additional  106 billion of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans with cuts to programs that help millions of low income children and families in New York and across the country  The budget makes devastating cuts to our safety net  including a  10 billion cut to Medicaid that will cut funding to New York by  1 37 billion   7 billion in cuts from student loan and child nutrition programs  and  3 billion in cuts for farmers and food stamps recipients         The great irony is that even with these devastating cuts  this budget does nothing to get the deficit under control  Republicans maintain that they are cutting the deficit in half  but they only achieve that illusion by leaving out the cost of our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond this year  the expense of fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax  and the trillions of dollars in borrowing needed to fund the President s Social Security scheme         The Republican Congressional leadership abandoned fiscal responsibility when it blocked Democratic efforts to reinstate the  pay as you go  rules that require offsets for tax cuts or spending that increase the budget deficit  This budget  despite its authors  claims of fiscal responsibility  puts us on track to break last year s record budget deficit of  412 billion  And under this budget  we will keep adding to our national debt at a rate of about  600 billion a year  In fact  a provision tucked away in the budget calls on the Congress to raise the debt limit by over  780 billion this year  This budget assumes that foreign countries like Japan  China  South Korea and the OPEC nations  who currently hold 40  of our publicly held debt  will continue to finance our fiscal irresponsibility        This budget is a step backward for New Yorkers and all Americans  It is unconscionable to balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans and that is exactly what Republicans in Congress and the White House have chosen to do
