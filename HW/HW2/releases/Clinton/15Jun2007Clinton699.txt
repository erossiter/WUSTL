                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senate Hearing to Examine the Federal Response to 9 11  Including U S  Environmental Protection Agency Programs to Test and Clean Indoor Spaces in Lower Manhattan  Lessons Learned from 9 11 and Federal Readiness to Respond to Releases of Hazardous Substances in Future Emergencies   Committee to hear testimony from President s Council on Environmental Quality  Environmental Protection Agency  the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Government Accountability Office among others  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced the witness list for the hearing of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health into the EPA s response to 9 11 and lessons learned for future emergency preparedness   The June 20  2007 hearing  to be held in Washington  DC  will include testimony from U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  official Susan Bodine  who oversees the EPA s emergency response office  The EPA will testify about their post 9 11 activities  including their two programs to test and clean indoor spaces  The hearing will also include testimony from James L  Connaughton  Chairman of the Presidents Council on Environmental Quality  CEQ   After the release of the EPA Inspector Generals  IG  report about EPA s 9 11 response in August of 2003  Mr  Connaughton committed the Administration to establish the EPA World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel  That panel examined a range of issues relating to contamination of indoor spaces that were raised by the 2003 IGs report   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  will also testify about investigatory work they have done at the request of Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler to evaluate the EPA s efforts to test and clean indoor spaces in New York City  Read More    The Senate Sub Committee will also hear from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health and a local resident  to examine the federal response to 9 11  including risk communication and EPA programs to test and clean indoor spaces in lower Manhattan  The hearing will also examine lessons learned from 9 11 and federal readiness to respond to releases of hazardous substances in future emergencies  We need to examine what went wrong and assess whether the federal government is better prepared to respond to environmental hazards in future disasters  said Senator Clinton  I also remain concerned about potential indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center and want to take a close look at the EPA s inadequate program to test and clean residential areas in Manhattan  For over five years  Clinton and Nadler have staunchly criticized the Administration s misleading public statements about post 9 11 air quality  as well as its continued failure to provide a proper testing and cleaning of indoor spaces contaminated by WTC toxins and its lack of provision of health care for the thousands of people who are ill as a result of exposure to the pollutants   New Yorkers were depending on the federal government to provide them with accurate information about the air they were breathing  And they are still depending on the federal government to assess the level of ongoing risk  Senator Clinton said  I hope this hearing will get to the bottom of what went wrong with the EPAs testing and clean up plan in response to the post 9 11 environmental disaster  what lessons were learned  and what the EPA intends to do to protect New Yorkers going forward  Senator Clintons hearing  along with the companion House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties hearing to be chaired on June 25  2007 by Congressman Jerrold Nadler  NY 08   represent the first comprehensive Congressional oversight investigations into these environmental matters since the immediate aftermath of the attacks  The two hearings together will take a comprehensive look at the failures of the Federal government in responding to the environmental crisis that resulted from the September 11  2001 World Trade Center attacks  While in the Majority  Republican House leadership steadfastly refused to hold a single hearing on this matter  More than five years after the attacks of September 11  2001  the EPA s work to address the environmental health consequences of those attacks remains unfinished  Starting from the EPAs assurances immediately following the attacks  and continuing throughout the past five years  the EPA s response to September 11th has not adequately protected public health and the environment  Senator Clinton said  There has also been a familiar pattern in which the Agency has sought to downplay the potential risks and convey false assurances regarding World Trade Center contamination  rather than developing a scientifically sound approach to assessing and reducing these risks   The full panel list is below      Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health Hearing EPA s Response to 9 11 and Lessons Learned for Future Emergency Preparedness 10 00 AM
