July 28  2005 Clinton Legislation to Provide Access to Billions in Funding for Pollution Controls Included in Final Transportation Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Clinton Inhofe provisions will reduce harmful diesel pollution from construction equipment in areas with poor air quality as well as school buses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  announced that the transportation reauthorization bill approved by the House Senate conference committee and is expected to pass the full House and Senate this week includes her legislation to provide access to billions in funding to reduce air pollution from construction equipment   The provision was added to the Senate version of the bill as a bipartisan amendment authored by Senator Clinton and cosponsored by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe  R OK    Clinton also announced that a measure she cosponsored to authorize funding for the Clean School Bus program was included in the final highway bill               This legislation has enormous potential to reduce pollution  create manufacturing jobs  and help the small businesses that build our roads and highways     said Senator Clinton    It provides access to billions of dollars for states and localities to use to help road builders add modern pollution controls to their equipment   I am extremely proud that the filters at the heart of these controls are manufactured by Corning in New York State               We commend Senator Clinton for her leadership on a variety of environmental issues that have been considered in Congress this year     said Peter Volanakis  chief operating officer  Corning Incorporated    The highway bill  s provision to use federal funds from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program    CMAQ     for diesel retrofits on vehicles and equipment used on construction highway projects in non attainment areas is a very significant accomplishment  In addition to providing communities across the U S  with new options for achieving cleaner air  this provision has the potential to increase demand for diesel after treatment systems by helping to finance the installation of retrofits on existing diesel vehicles and equipment              According to the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   there are approximately 1 2 million pieces of construction equipment that can potentially benefit from being retrofitted with pollution control or anti idling technologies  A typical piece of construction equipment  such as a 178 hp bulldozer  emits as much pollution as 26 new cars today  which contributes to ozone and fine particulate pollution            According to the EPA  studies have shown a significant association between exposure to fine particles and premature death  Other health impacts of exposure to fine particulates include aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease  decreased lung function  asthma attacks  and certain cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and irregular heart beat   Children  the elderly  and people with heart and lung disease are particularly vulnerable to these health effects              Adding pollution controls to construction equipment can cut these harmful emissions by more than 90 percent  greatly reducing the health impacts of pollution from these sources   Senator Clinton  s provision accomplishes this goal by enabling states to tap into the approximately  8 6 billion included in the transportation reauthorization bill for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program  CMAQ    CMAQ funds are distributed to states under a formula that factors in population and air quality   In Fiscal Year 2004  New York received  191 million of CMAQ funds   The funds can be used for a range of congestion mitigation and air quality projects             Senator Clinton  s provision modifies the CMAQ program to enable New York and other states to use these funds to purchase diesel retrofit pollution controls for construction equipment   To qualify  the equipment must be used in federally funded highway projects that are located in areas that exceed EPA s pollution standards for ozone and particulate matter    In New York State  these areas include the New York City metro area  as well as the Buffalo  Rochester  Albany and Poughkeepsie metro areas           The Clinton provision builds on pilot projects to reduce pollution from construction equipment at the Big Dig in Boston and at Ground Zero  as well as National Research Council recommendations for improving the CMAQ program  It is supported by the Associated General Contractors of America  Environmental Defense  the Emissions Control Technology Association  the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  and the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators  and the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials           The transportation conference report also includes an amendment that builds on Senator Clinton  s work to increase funding for EPA s Clean School Bus USA program  With help from Congressmen Walsh and Houghton  Senator Clinton has successfully pushed for increased funding for this program  by which EPA makes grants to school districts to help pay to retrofit old buses or purchase new ones to reduce pollution from school buses  This program was funded at  7 5 million for FY 2005  an increase of  2 5 million over the  5 million appropriated in FY 2003 and FY 2004  Senator Clinton teamed with Senator Inhofe  who offered an amendment to the transportation reauthorization bill to increase authorized funding for this program to  55 million per year           The conference report is now scheduled to be considered by both the Senate and the House sometime later this week  After passing each house  the approved Report will then to go the President  s desk to be signed   The bill originally passed the House on March 10 and the Senate on May 17
