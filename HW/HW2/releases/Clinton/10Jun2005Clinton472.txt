June 10  2005 Senator Clinton Leads Congressional Effort To Stop Federal Funding Cuts To New York Colleges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ten colleges set to lose vital funding for student services if action not taken                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON  D C     In a letter to Education Secretary Margaret Spellings  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton assailed the Administration  s decision to slash funds to ten colleges in New York and urged that the money be restored   Nine members of the New York delegation joined the Senator in denouncing the decision to eliminate all funds coming to ten New York colleges through the TRIO Student Support Services  SSS  Program which helps low income and first generation students and students with disabilities        As a result of the Administration  s action  New York stands to lose over  3 million in funding  cutting off services for more than 2 000 students and ending nearly 20 percent of all SSS programs in New York State  including those at Rockland Community College  Fordham University  Iona College  Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology and six City University of New York  CUNY  campuses including Bronx Community College  Hunter College  John Jay College of Criminal Justice  Medgar Evers College  Queensborough Community College and Queens College          At a time when we are encouraging students to stay in school and do their best  it is outrageous that the Administration has cut funds to those who need our help the most     Senator Clinton said    It is not a great deal of money  but it can make a great deal of difference to many students  I am pleased that my colleagues have joined in this effort and I call on the Secretary of Education to reverse this decision immediately           In reaction to the Department  s decision  Senator Clinton urged a number of her congressional colleagues to sign a letter to the Secretary of Education  Margaret Spellings  expressing grave concern about the impact of the discontinuation of funding  In their letter  Senator Clinton and her colleagues expressed their concerns that New York was disproportionately targeted for these cuts and urged Secretary Spellings to reconsider the Department  s decision        Without SSS funding  Fordham University will be forced to end a program that has provided academic preparation services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds for more than twenty years   At Iona College  200 students will lose professional counseling  peer mentoring  grant aid  workshops in areas such as study skills and test taking  and tutoring from professionals in writing and in mathematics   If SSS funding is not renewed at Vaughn College  225 low income  first generation  and minority students would lose access to summer English and math remediation courses and the essential financial  academic and personal support services that allow students to successfully pursue a degree and graduate  If Rockland Community College  s  RCC  SSS grant is not renewed  the Student Support Services Program Tutoring Lab will close  eliminating a vital tutorial service to almost 200 academically underprepared students        Further  the Department  s failure to renew the six City University of New York  CUNY  SSS programs will harm more than 1 600 students  and result in a loss of more than  2 million to the University   As the nation  s largest urban public university system  CUNY provides higher education opportunities to a large number of first generation and low income students   In addition  CUNY provides critical support services to more than 9 000 students with disabilities  One quarter of all New York State college students with disabilities are enrolled at CUNY  and most of those students are eligible to participate in SSS programs         The TRIO SSS programs are designed to improve the retention and graduation rates of students from low income households  first generation students  and students with disabilities   The program provides opportunities for academic development  assists students with basic college requirements  and serves to motivate students towards the successful completion of their postsecondary education  The SSS program may also provide grant aid to current SSS participants who are receiving Federal Pell Grants  The goal of SSS is to increase the college retention and graduation rates of its participants and facilitate the process of transition from one level of higher education to the next        Senator Clinton also recently worked with her colleagues  Senators DeWine and Jeffords to send a letter to the Appropriations Committee asking to retain GEAR UP  another critical early intervention program that helps disadvantaged children go to college  created under the Clinton Administration  President Bush proposed eliminating this program in his FY2006 budget          A copy of the congressional letter on the TRIO program cuts is attached          June 9  2005         The Honorable Margaret Spellings  Secretary of Education  United States Department of Education  400 Maryland Avenue  NW  Washington  D C   20202       Dear Madam Secretary        We are writing to share our concerns about the impact of the Department of Education  s recent decision to discontinue funding for 10 New York State TRIO Student Support Services  SSS  programs   This cut represents nearly 20 percent of all programs targeted for elimination across the nation and the highest percentage of TRIO SSS program losses experienced by any state   We are particularly concerned that it appears New York was disproportionately targeted for these cuts and are deeply troubled about the negative effect this decision will have on students and families in our communities   We urge you to provide an external review of these applications to ensure that they received a fair and impartial evaluation and ask that you carefully consider the appeals of individual campuses         We recognize that  by its nature  a peer review process involves subjective judgment and that some peer review panels impose stricter standards than others   It is our understanding that  for this reason  the Department  s usual practice is to distribute applications from each state or region across panels   However  in the case of Student Support Services applications from New York State  it appears that this was not done consistent with usual practice   We understand that at least five applications from New York were concentrated in one panel and that all five of those applications were targeted for elimination   We are concerned that this result may have stemmed from a failure to provide for a fair and unbiased reading of applications from New York         The TRIO SSS programs support the retention and graduation of low income students  first generation students  and students with disabilities   A comparison of the currently funded SSS projects in New York and the list of projects approved for funding as a result of the 2005 TRIO SSS grant competition reveals that 10 campuses in New York State are slated to lose funding   As a result  New York will lose over  3 million in funding  cutting off services for more than 2 000 students   These program eliminations come at a time of significant need for SSS funding in New York State and despite more than 25 years of experience that many of our state  s institutions possess with the SSS program        As a result of the Department  s decisions  nearly 20 percent of all SSS programs in New York State will end  including the programs at Rockland Community College  Fordham University  Iona College  Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology  and six City University of New York  CUNY  campuses          If Rockland Community College  s  RCC  SSS grant is not renewed  the Student Support Services Program Tutoring Lab will close  eliminating a vital tutorial service to almost 200 academically underprepared students  Without SSS funding  Fordham University will be forced to end a program that has provided academic preparation services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds for more than twenty years   At Iona College  200 students will lose professional counseling  peer mentoring  grant aid  workshops in areas such as study skills and test taking  and tutoring from professionals in writing and in mathematics   If SSS funding is not renewed at Vaughn College  225 low income  first generation  and minority students would lose access to summer English and math remediation courses and the essential financial  academic and personal support services that allow students to successfully pursue a degree and graduate        Further  the Department  s failure to renew the six City University of New York  CUNY  SSS programs will harm more than 1 600 students  and result in a loss of more than  2 million to the University   As the nation  s largest urban public university system  CUNY provides higher education opportunities to a large number of first generation and low income students   In addition  CUNY provides critical support services to more than 9 000 students with disabilities  One quarter of all New York State college students with disabilities are enrolled at CUNY  and most of those students are eligible to participate in SSS programs         These TRIO program reductions come at a time when large gaps in college enrollment and completion exist for low income and minority students   Of high school graduates  those from high income families enter college at rates 25 percentage points higher than those from low income families   By their late 20s  more than one third of Caucasians have at least a bachelor  s degree  but only 18 percent of African Americans and 10 percent of Hispanics have attained degrees   TRIO SSS programs serve as a vital link to higher education for these students by providing a range of services from pre college summer programs  to tutoring and developmental instruction  to counseling and advising programs  and peer support         Research indicates that TRIO SSS programs across the nation are working to increase college retention and graduation rates   A national study of the program commissioned by the Department of Education found that Student Support Services increases retention to the third year by nearly one third   Currently  Student Support Services programs at over 930 colleges and universities assist nearly 200 000 low income and disabled youth each year        We are confident of your commitment to ensure a fair and impartial review of all applications submitted to the Department for funding  as well as your commitment to ensure public confidence in the process   We hope you agree that the apparent irregularities uncovered in the reading of applications from New York are unacceptable  and we urge you to provide an external review of these 10 New York TRIO SSS applications   Our staff will arrange to meet with you to discuss information about the review process and the steps you will take to address our concerns          We are hopeful that we can work together to save TRIO programs across New York State and thank you for your attention to this important matter        Sincerely        Senator Clinton  D NY   Senator Schumer  D NY   Congressman Serrano  D NY 16   Congresswoman Maloney  D NY 14
