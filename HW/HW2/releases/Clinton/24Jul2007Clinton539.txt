July 24  2007 Senator Clinton Introduces Legislation to Block Closure of Local Agricultural Outreach Offices Across New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Legislation Would Block Closure of USDA Field Offices Planned for Albany  Broome  Clinton  Fulton  Herkimer  Monroe  Niagara  Onondaga  Oswego  Rensselaer  Steuben  Suffolk  Sullivan

        Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she has introduced legislation aimed at blocking the closure of Farm Service Agency  FSA   Natural Resource Conservation Service  NRCS  and Rural Development  RD  field offices across New York State and the nation   The Senator also sent a letter to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Michael Johanns  protesting the proposed closures   The Senators actions come after the USDA announced a consolidation plan to close offices Albany  Broome  Clinton  Fulton  Herkimer  Monroe  Niagara  Onondaga  Oswego  Rensselaer  Steuben  Suffolk  Sullivan  Tompkins  Wayne and Yates Counties    Federal assistance is only helpful if people can access it and consolidating these offices means that farmers may have more difficulty obtaining all the services they need  Senator Clinton said today   These changes will place an undue burden on family farms and we simply cannot let that happen  Small farmers cant leave their farms for half a day to go to several different offices to access services  yet they are the ones who need these services the most   This legislation will ensure that family farms will continue to have easy  in person access to the services they need     Senator Clintons legislation will be a companion to legislation introduced in the House by Rep  Stephanie Herseth Sandlin  The bill will prohibit the closure or relocation of any county field office of the USDA until at least one year after the enactment of the coming Farm Bill  to provide for the continuation of agricultural programs for fiscal years after 2007   This language was accepted into the House version of the 2007 Farm Bill that is going to the floor this week and Senator Clinton is pushing for its inclusion in the upcoming Senate version of the Farm Bill    The Farm Service Agency  FSA  administers and manages farm commodity  credit  conservation  disaster and loan programs as laid out by Congress through a network of federal  state and county offices   The Natural Resource Conservation Service  NRCS  works with its customers to create conservation plans that address the conditions of their natural resources  Rural Development  RD  provides financial programs to support such essential public facilities and services as water and sewer systems  housing  health clinics  emergency service facilities and electric and telephone service  The office of RD promotes economic development by supporting loans to businesses through banks and community managed lending pools  RD also offers technical assistance and information to help agricultural and other cooperatives get started and improve the effectiveness of their member services and technical assistance to help communities undertake community empowerment programs    A copy of Senator Clintons letter is below     July 24  2007   The Honorable Michael Johanns  Secretary  United States Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20250   Dear Mr  Secretary    After hearing from my constituents and being briefed on your proposal to close multiple United States Agriculture  USDA  field offices  including Natural Resources Conservation Services  NRCS   Farm Service Agency  FSA  and Rural Development offices  I write to express my serious concerns about the impact of these closures   The proposed reorganization follows the closure of multiple offices over the past few years and I am very concerned that this new proposal to close additional offices will mean even more difficulties for farmers not only in New York  but throughout our nations agriculture areas  and will possibly lead to further closings    If you go forward with these proposals  farmers could experience longer drives to offices and possibly have to visit multiple offices to access different services that ideally should be located in a single site   Your department has indicated that you are hoping to solve inadequacies within the USDA and the New York State field offices  however it is far from clear that the proposed closings will increase the efficiency of the offices or benefit farmers   Finding a way to improve the quality of USDA field offices without short changing our farmers should be the course of action  not a restriction in local services for those who utilize these important programs and services      If staff shortages are a concern  measures should be taken by the USDA to help increase the number of employees in the current service centers while focusing on the development of programs that will more effectively recruit  train and maintain employees   We must find a way to improve and increase the quality of the offices without any closings     These offices were designed and located to effectively serve farmers and I can see no evidence that the proposed closings will do anything other than inconvenience farmers   Further  the proposal to close these field offices lacks consistency and organization across the board   The offices should remain open until we see where the emphasis of the 2007 Farm Bill lies and how it will lead the agriculture industry in the next five years     As always I am eager to work with USDA to ensure the best possible service for our producers      Sincerely yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton   CC  Chuck Conner  Deputy Secretary of
