February 12  2007 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Assault on Elie Wiesel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The shameful attack on Elie Wiesel is a violent reminder that we must continue to speak out against Holocaust denial and against hate crimes that seek to silence free speech  Elie survived the Holocaust and has spent a lifetime urging us never to be indifferent toward horrible violence against humanity  never to be passive in the face of suffering and moral wrong  We must not be indifferent when confronting violent acts of hate or disgusting hate speech   whether preached by a world leader or petty thugs   like denying the horrors of the Holocaust  We should all take a page from Elie  passionately dedicating ourselves to fighting genocide  fighting indifference  and fighting for a better future for all children
