December 19  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton on Senate Approval of Medicare  Medicaid and Children s Health Insurance Extension Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC  The Senate did the right thing in preventing the expiration of the Children s Health Insurance Program  crucial Medicare and Medicaid provisions and healthcare programs critical to New York   The six month extension of many important provisions will ensure seniors  children  people with disabilities and working families continue to have access to these vital programs   It is deeply disappointing  however  that the good faith efforts of those on both sides of the aisle to address our healthcare challenges  particularly the Childrens Health Insurance Program  continue to be undermined by an Administration and a minority of Republicans who chose to put politics and ideology above meeting our healthcare challenges            The President had the opportunity this year to join the bipartisan consensus in Congress and do the right thing by providing healthcare to millions of uninsured children   Before this extension expires  I hope we can find the common ground needed to provide uninsured children with access to the quality  affordable healthcare they need and deserve    This bill takes a number of important positive  if temporary  steps   It suspends scheduled cuts to physician payment rates and provides a slight increase in reimbursement rates for the next six months   It extends an important program to provide premium assistance to low income Medicare beneficiaries  and authorizes an expansion of outreach and enrollment assistance provided by Area Agencies on Aging and Aging Disability Resource Centers   It extends the moratorium on cuts to important rehabilitative and school based services that help children and adults with developmental disabilities   And it freezes implementation of a rule that would undermine the ability of New Yorks inpatient rehabilitation facilities to treat patients who would benefit from their specialized care    Unfortunately  this bill has also extends the Title V abstinence only unless married program for an additional six months   It is critical to reexamine this program and the quality and accuracy of sexual education we provide our students   Thats why I introduced the Prevention First Act  which would allow states to implement comprehensive sex education in schools     This bill is yet another band aid  not a cure  for our healthcare crisis  and I will continue to work toward real  permanent solutions to these challenges
