April 6  2007 Senator Clinton and Colleagues Ask Poland to Implement Fair and Equitable Restitution Laws for Property Confiscated During Holocaust                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has again joined with her colleagues from the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe  also known as The Helsinki Commission  in requesting that the Polish government ensure the passage of legislation that will return or provide proper compensation for property confiscated illegally during the Holocaust and communist eras          In a letter to Polish Prime Minister Kaczynski  Senator Clinton and other members of the Commission welcomed statements by Polish government officials that they would work to pass legislation on the issue by the end of this year  but the Commission expressed concern that the victims have thus far experienced numerous delays which have exacerbated the injustices they have suffered as a result of past religious and political persecution           The delay in resolving the property claims of elderly survivors and their family members has gone on for too long    I hope that the Polish government takes the recommendations of the Helsinki Commission into account so that any bill passed is fair  equitable and acknowledges the tremendous loss suffered by so many   Senator Clinton said          The Commission provided specific recommendations in the letter to Prime Minister Kaczyski to ensure that the government properly and fully addresses the rights of the victims  These recommendations include actual restitution of property or appropriate compensation  minimal burdens for filing a claim  consistent involvement of the central government  and the rightful return of artwork          Senator Clinton has worked with the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe on numerous occasions to ensure that victims of the Holocaust as well as those persecuted during the communist eras are compensated for the injustices that they and their relatives have suffered  With her colleagues on the Helsinki Commission  she has written letters and participated in a Commission hearing  asking the Government of Poland for proper compensation for property confiscated illegally during the Holocaust and communist eras  In September of 2006  the Helsinki Commission sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Hungary urging him to provide missing archival records for a Holocaust museum in the United States  Clinton was also outspoken in pressuring the Justice Department to settle with victims of the  Gold Train  Case which involved confiscated property from Hungarian Holocaust victims        A copy of the letter from the Helsinki Commission to Prime Minister Kaczynski is attached      Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe  234 Ford House Office Building  Washington  DC 20515   202  225 1901      H E  Jaroslaw Kaczynski  Prime Minister  Republic of Poland  AI  Ujazdowskie 1 3  00 583 Warszawa  Polska      Dear Prime Minister Kaczynski       As you may know  members of this Commission have been engaged in a dialogue with Polish officials for many years now on the issue of the wrongful confiscation of property during the Holocaust and communist eras  We have welcomed the measures taken in various European nations to address this complex issue          We recognize that this matter may be more complicated in Poland than in any other Central European country due to various historical factors  and we are aware of the complexities and sensitivities surrounding this subject  However  the passage of time does not make this issue less complicated or less difficult  On the contrary  Polish Government delay has added a layer of unfairness  especially for elderly survivors and their family members          For most victims of wrongful property confiscation  the seizure of their homes or other real property was inextricably part of the religious or political persecution they suffered  We are heartened by your recent statements indicating your commitment to getting legislation adopted in 2007  Your personal leadership will be critical in moving this legislation forward  bringing some measure of justice to the victims of past abuse  and helping Poland bring closure to this painful chapter in history          With a view to ongoing drafting efforts  we urge to you take into consideration the following recommendations            Actual restitution of property should remain the goal  especially for properties that are currently held by the national or local governments            The adoption of a law in 2005 compensating individuals who suffered confiscations east of the Bug River  that is  formerly Polish land that became part of the Soviet Union after World War II  at 20 percent of the value of the property is a notable step and should pave the way for redressing other private property confiscations in Poland  At the same time press reports that compensation for other claimants might be set at less than 20 percent are deeply troubling            The purpose of passing a property claims law is to give the victims of past abuse some measure of justice  Accordingly  every effort should be made to ensure that the burden of filing a claim   including the production of documents  confirmation of the death of former owners  especially those who died during the Holocaust   and determination of one s status as an heir   should be minimized as much as possible            Although implementation of the law may take place at the local level  it is critically important that the national government retain a central role in ensuring that the law is properly and equitably implemented and devotes the necessary resources to that end            Finally  consistent with international principles  looted artwork should be returned to original owners and not re classified as  national patrimony          Mr  Prime minister  once again  we appreciate your stewardship in helping to resolve this challenging and complex matter          Sincerely       Alcee L  Hastings  M C
