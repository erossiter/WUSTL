December 21  2005 Senator Clinton Welcomes USDA Change of Heart On Food Stamps For New Yorkers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Decision Means Many Will Receive Increased benefits to Offset Higher Heating Costs    Clinton urged President Bush last week to make the change to help thousands of New Yorkers cope with bitter winter and rising energy costs                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed news that the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  has agreed to change the federal formula used to determine Food Stamp grants  a move that will lead to a higher benefit level for many recipients in New York         Last week  Senator Clinton wrote to President Bush  urging him to approve an increase in food stamp benefits for New Yorkers to offset higher heating costs  Senator Clinton s call for action was prompted by an earlier U S  Department of Agriculture decision to reject an application for a food stamp benefit adjustment by New York and several other states         Earlier this year  New York and four other states applied to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  for an adjustment to the food stamp benefit formula to reflect increases in heating costs the Department of Energy has projected for this winter  The USDA announced on December 13th that it had denied the request of New York and the other states         According to the NYS Office of Temporary   Disability Assistance  as a result of USDA approval  many food stamp recipients  mostly elderly and disabled  will see an increase in their monthly food stamp benefit of about  10           I am very pleased to hear that the USDA has changed their mind and approved this increase in benefits for New York  s food stamp recipients  many of whom are facing a bitter winter with heating bills they simply cannot afford to pay     Senator Clinton said    We simply cannot force New Yorkers to choose between food  medicine or heat this winter  Now more than ever  especially with the holidays approaching  this was the right thing to do           The level of food stamp benefits is based in part on how much families are expected to pay in utility bills  The U S  Department of Energy projects heating costs will rise 27 percent for New York households that use natural gas and 25 percent for home heating oil over last winter  Approval of New York  s application would mean an increase in food stamp assistance of up to  25 per family per month         In her letter to President Bush last week  Senator Clinton noted that the food stamp adjustment is especially important because legislation she has supported to increase funding for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program  LIHEAP  has repeatedly been blocked by Republican leaders in Congress         The full text of Senator Clinton s letter appears below        December 16  2005   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  D C  20500        Dear Mr  President         I am writing to strongly protest your Administration  s decision earlier this week to deny New York  s request for increased Food Stamp assistance to offset higher heating costs  This decision comes at a time when we know that families are already feeling the pinch of higher heating costs  and should be reversed         For needy families  higher heating costs often mean a choice between paying the heating bills and buying food  The National Energy Assistance Directors Association recently completed a survey of 1 100 low income families across the country to find out what steps they take when they cannot afford their energy bills  The responses were troubling  Among the study  s findings  32  of families in the survey sacrificed medical care  24  failed to make a rent or mortgage payment    and 20  went without food for at least a day         We already know that heating costs will be significantly higher this winter  Your own Department of Energy projects that heating costs will rise 27 percent for New York households that use natural gas and 25 percent for home heating oil over last winter  To help families deal with these higher costs  I have supported several efforts to increase funding for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program  LIHEAP  to  5 1 billion  Unfortunately  efforts to increase funding to this level have been repeatedly blocked         In light of all of these facts  it is unacceptable that earlier this week the United States Department of Agriculture announced that it had denied New York  s application to adjust Food Stamp payments upward to help needy families continue to afford both food and heat  Approval of New York  s application would have meant an increase in Food Stamp assistance of up to  25 per family per month  money that could eliminate the need for New York  s neediest to have to choose between heating and eating        I urge you to reconsider this decision and approve New York  s application         Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton
