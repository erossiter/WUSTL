July 17  2006 Senator Clinton Co Sponsors Legislation to Address Gap in Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Coverage Gap Could Affect 400 000 New Yorkers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Continuing her efforts to mitigate the ongoing problems New Yorkers are experiencing with the new Medicare prescription drug program  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she is cosponsoring two new pieces of legislation to address a gap in coverage  known as the   doughnut hole     that will strike millions of beneficiaries across the country in the coming months   During this gap  enrollees have no drug coverage and have to pay full price for their medications   To add insult to injury  enrollees are still responsible to pay their monthly drug premiums during this time            It is outrageous that millions of beneficiaries will be forced to pay full price for their medications and on top of that continue to pay premiums for a prescription drug plan that isn  t paying for their medications   This defies logic and will put an unacceptable burden on New York  s seniors and people with disabilities already struggling to make ends meet   Beneficiaries have a right to expect that the drug plan they are paying a premium for will cover their prescription drug costs   We need to close this gap and make sure that prescription drug plans are working for beneficiaries     said Senator Clinton          Under the Medicare law  the new Part D benefit provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit to the 43 million people enrolled in Medicare   In 2006  the benefit has a  250 deductible  covers 75 percent of prescription drug costs up to a coverage limit of  2 250  followed by the gap in coverage where beneficiaries pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach  5 100 in drug costs   At this point  they have hit the   catastrophic limit    and the Medicare Part D benefit pays 95 percent of the beneficiaries   drug costs through the end of the year  when the cycle starts all over again   More than one third of all Medicare beneficiaries are projected to have drug spending at the level where they would be affected by this gap  according to the Congressional Budget Office   In New York  1 33 million people have prescription drug coverage governed by Medicare Part D rules   If one third are affected  400 000 New Yorkers could be impacted by this coverage gap in 2006          Senator Clinton is cosponsoring the Prescription for Fairness Act  which would provide short term relief for seniors and people with disabilities by waiving the Medicare Part D premium for any month that a senior falls into the doughnut hole  by requiring the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to pay the premium on behalf of the affected beneficiary   This cost will be offset by reducing a   slush fund    in the Medicare law that benefits insurance companies            Senator Clinton is also cosponsoring the Medicare Prescription Gap Act to address the dire situation faced by our most vulnerable low income beneficiaries   This bill will allow costs incurred by federally qualified health centers  AIDS Drug Assistance Programs  Indian pharmacies  certain safety net hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturer sponsored Patient Assistance Programs   entities that provide prescription drugs or drug assistance for populations under their care   to count toward a beneficiary s annual out of pocket threshold   Under current law  costs incurred by these programs on behalf of Part D enrollees during the time they are in the doughnut hole are not permitted to count towards reaching that  5 100 threshold   As a result  many individuals with HIV AIDS  Native Americans  and other low income individuals receiving assistance through community health centers or other qualified safety net hospital pharmacies will get stuck in the doughnut hole and never reach the point at which Medicare would pay 95 percent of the beneficiary  s drug costs              Senator Clinton is also a cosponsor of legislation introduced earlier this year  the Medicare Prescription Drug Gap Reduction Act   This legislation will reduce the impact of the doughnut hole on Medicare beneficiaries by giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate with drug companies to obtain the lowest possible price for Medicare beneficiaries  and requiring that savings from this provision be applied towards reducing the impact of the doughnut hole on Medicare beneficiaries          Senator Clinton has been a vocal advocate for the need to fix the problems plaguing the new Medicare prescription drug program and to ensure that Medicare recipients receive the assistance they need and deserve   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has called on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to release to the public the quality and performance information it collects on participating plans about levels of service provided to consumers  including information about grievances  appeals and complaints  This   report card    of participating plans would help hold them to high standards and help consumers make informed choices about plans            Senator Clinton has also co sponsored comprehensive legislation that would make needed fixes to the program  including helping those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid transition into the new Medicare prescription drug benefit by requiring outreach and education to pharmacies on dually eligible beneficiaries and waiving the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting these beneficiaries  She has also co sponsored legislation that would prevent Medicare prescription drug plans from ending coverage of drugs that were available when beneficiaries enrolled in the plan and extend the amount of time seniors have to enroll in the program  In addition  Senator Clinton has released a resource guide to prescription drug coverage under Medicare  available in English and Spanish  to help New Yorkers navigate this transition  The guide has been distributed to more than 75 000 New Yorkers and is posted on Senator Clinton  s website at www clinton senate gov
