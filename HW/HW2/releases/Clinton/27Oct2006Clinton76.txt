

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today reiterated her call on the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to delay closing the Acute Psychiatric Unit at the Canandaigua VA Hospital until the final plan for the hospital is completed  The Senator reaffirmed her stance today following receipt of the VA  s response to her October 20 letter asking for a delay in the closure plan for the unit  In responding to Senator Clinton  s letter  VA Secretary Nicholson said the plan for the beds in the unit is   still under development               I am very pleased to hear that the VA has not yet finalized its plans for the Acute Psychiatric Unit and I will continue to urge them to delay any decisions until the plans for the entire hospital facility are completed and revealed  The VA must listen to the concerns of local veterans and the community as it moves through the final stages of this process     Senator Clinton said          On October 20  Senator Clinton wrote to the Department of Veterans Affairs expressing her concern that it would be premature to remove the inpatient psychiatric beds from Canandaigua before the completion of the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  decision process for the Canandaigua VA site  Read more here   The decision to close the acute psychiatric unit was made in 2004 as part of the CARES decision but news reports indicated that the closure of the unit could happen as soon as November 30          In September  Senator Clinton also wrote to the Department of Veterans Affairs  asking for an update on the planning for the Canandaigua VA because nothing had been done in over a year  Senator Clinton welcomed the VA  s recent announcement about the future of Canandaigua as a positive step  but expressed her concerns that as the CARES process moves forward in the months ahead  the VA must engage fully with the local community to understand the needs and concerns of veterans        A copy of the VA Secretary  s letter to Senator Clinton is below       October 26  2006      The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510      Dear Senator Clinton       This letter is in response to your inquiry of October 20  2006  regarding the closure of the 8 bed acute care psychiatric unit at the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  You had asked that the closing of the unit be delayed until future plans for the Canandaigua campus are finalized          The decision to close the 8 bed acute care psychiatric unit at Canandaigua was made by Secretary Principi in May 2004  However  the plan to execute that decision is still under development  Any proposed plan must be approved by the Under Secretary for Health prior to execution to ensure continuity of care  It is expected that the proposed operational plan would include details on the transfer or discharge of patients in the 8 bed acute care psychiatric unit  as appropriate based on their clinical condition  VA  s Syracuse and Buffalo facilities have higher level capabilities and provide additional specialized services and long term care  Additionally  the Canandaigua VA Medical Center will be enhanced by a new 22 bed long term care unit which may be appropriate for some of the transferred patients          In anticipation of the new 22 bed unit staffing needs  facility managers have begun discussions to best meet the career needs and goals of our employees  particularly those currently working in the 8 bed acute care psychiatric unit  This will enable staff to pursue opportunities for continued employment at the Canandaigua facility          You had also asked about our plans for a mental health Center of Excellence at the Canandaigua facility  Current plans call for a Center of Excellence at Canandaigua in collaboration with the University of Rochester to conduct research  educational  and educational programs in mental health  with a focus on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   depression  and related disorders          I assure you that the proposed operational plan for the closure of the acute inpatient psychiatric unit will consider all appropriate facts  We are committed to meeting the needs of veterans and the valued employees who serve them every day          Sincerely yours       R  James Nicholson
