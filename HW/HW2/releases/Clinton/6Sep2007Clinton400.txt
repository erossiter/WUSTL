September 6  2007 Senator Clinton Questions General James Jones  Ret   on the Findings of the Iraqi Security Forces Independent Assessment Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator Clinton   Thank you Mr  Chairman  and again I thank the Commission for your work in this excellent report   And I guess I would follow up to some extent on Senator Kennedys questions because clearly this is a very difficult dilemma that our country faces and that we  sitting on this side  face as well    The theory behind the tactic of the surge was that adding these troops would create the political space for some kind of political reconciliation  reconciliation may be too hopeful a term  but certainly political compromise that could lead to a greater commitment to the stability and security of the country and an end to the sectarian and personal advantages that were being sought    It is clear in your report as well as in the NIE that the Iraqi government will struggle to continue to achieve such national reconciliation  What if any factors that you assessed in your work on the security forces lead you to believe that the government will pursue this political reconciliation  General Jones   General Jones   Senator  that question is a little bit outside of our charter   The only thing that the commission observed is that absent such a reconciliation  which has not been codified at any rate  even though we are encouraged to hear that in our conversations with senior Iraqi officials  members of the government  that they are working on it  that they understand the importance of it   But the fact is  it hasnt happened  and we regret that because that certainly is a key to accelerating the progress that we would all like to see in Iraq   So weve identified that very strongly as essentially the starting point for good things to take place    On the surge  Id like to just say a few words about that   The surge had two components to it  one was Iraqi and the other was the Coalition  And the surge itself had an effect  but it had effect in the area where it was concentrated  and that is the Baghdad region   Two other phenomenon that also happened simultaneously to enhance the security situation were the unexpectedly good performance of the Iraqi army  which is a credit to our trainers and those who have brought them online  and also the stunning turnaround in Al Anbar province where Al Qaeda lost the popular support of the people  which has resulted in the countrys most violent province becoming one of the most peaceful    So those three things  the surge  the Iraqi armys performance  and Al Qaedas reversals have been positive in terms of the Iraqi security forces   But this progress will always be measured against the overall sectarian problem in the country and it simply has to be a political solution   Senator Clinton   Well of course thats our dilemma  because how do we get the appropriate pressure on the Iraqi government to do what we know they must do for the Iraqi people to have any future and for us to withdraw and hope that there can be some stability in the region       You know  I am concerned that we are not getting answers to the questions that we need from the administration and  in fact  I think its fair to say that Senator Warner led the effort to have this Commission created to get an independent judgment because we heard so much contradictory information going back now so many years    I wrote a letter to the President yesterday requesting that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker be prepared to address twenty questions that come from the NIE  the GAO  your commission report  because at the end of the day we have to make judgments on whether or not we believe continuing military presence by American troops  whether theyre in Iraq for a day  a year  or ten years will make any difference to the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people   And I have obviously reached a conclusion that I dont see that difference occurring  I dont see the Iraqi government responding    And if we take away deadlines  we take away benchmarks  we take away timelines  what is the urgency that will move them to act      You can have pockets of stability  were now seeing as the British withdraw in the south a lot of the militias vying for power within the south   Youre seeing the Iranian proxies  and the Saudi proxies  and everybody elses proxies  you know  looking for advantage   So  I think that your Commission has certainly performed a great service  but one of the problems is that in evaluating Iraqi policy the administration and the Iraqi government keep moving the goalposts for success  And I am deeply concerned that were not going to see any difference in 12 18 months   but well see more American casualties  and well see the opportunity costs of our being bogged down in Iraq with respect to all of the other challenges we face  from Iran to the Middle East to China and everywhere else   So  Mr  Chairman  I greatly appreciate the Commissions report  and I have some additional questions that I would like to submit to the record  but Id better go and try to get this vote in  and I thank you all very much    Earlier   Senator Clinton Calls on President Bush to Answer Key Questions on Iraq Policy  Read more statements by Senator
