September 20  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Federal Housing Administration Reform Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC  Reforming the Federal Housing Administration must be a critical component of addressing the troubles in the housing market and helping more Americans get safe and reliable mortgages    For well over a year  I have advocated taking steps to improve the FHA so that it can be a more effective alternative for home buyers lured by the subprime or risky mortgage products that were a major reason for the current housing crisis    I am pleased that the legislation that passed the Senate Banking Committee and the House incorporates the ideas Ive laid out in my FHA modernization bill  The 21st Century Housing Act      The reforms I have called for include      Allowing the FHA to make investments in both personnel and its information technology infrastructure to help meet the market demand for affordable mortgage products and work more efficiently with mortgage lenders and borrowers       Increasing the FHA s mortgage limits which will help create more home buying opportunities  especially in high cost of living states like New York  so that working families don t get priced out of their own neighborhoods       Allowing the FHA to develop responsible mortgage products     I hope that the Senate will have an opportunity to take up this legislation quickly so that it can go to the Presidents desk as soon as possible    This is a common sense proposal that will help hundreds of thousands of working families achieve and keep the dream of home ownership
