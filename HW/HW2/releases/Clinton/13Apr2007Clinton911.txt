April 13  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Reports of Millions of Spoiled FEMA Meals During the 2006 Hurricane Season Along the Gulf Coast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Today s report that FEMA is responsible for losing more than  40 million worth of food for hunger relief groups  while tragic  is unfortunately not surprising   We still see the failures on the part of the Administration when it came to responding to Katrina and this is another painful lesson on the lack of planning before and after the hurricanes   Today over 86 000 victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are still living in federal government provided trailers and mobile homes   I believe that the lesson learned is that DHS is ill equipped to oversee FEMA and its responsibilities  and that consolidating these duties within an independent FEMA is the best way to ensure the efficient and effective handling of our federal disaster efforts           In September of 2005  Senator Clinton authored legislation to restore FEMA to independent  cabinet level status to ensure that it has the authority it needs to effectively manage recovery efforts for future national crises  As many as 6 million prepared meals stockpiled near potential victims of the 2006 hurricane season spoiled in the Gulf Coast heat last summer when the Federal Emergency Management Agency ran short of warehouse and refrigeration space  according to agency officials
