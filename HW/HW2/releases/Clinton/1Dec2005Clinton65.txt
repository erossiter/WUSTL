December 1  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on World Aids Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today marked World AIDS Day with the following statement   This year  World AIDS Day seeks to reaffirm the commitments made by governments to fight HIV AIDS   With the theme of   Stop AIDS  Keep the Promise     World AIDS Day offers the opportunity to evaluate the progress made by both the U S  and other governments in the fight against AIDS following the 2001 United Nations General Assembly  s Special Session on HIV AIDS         On this year  s World AIDS Day  as communities around the world gather to remember those who are affected by this epidemic  we must all remain committed to fulfilling the pledges we have made to fight this disease in both the United States and around the world      We must continue to provide resources to combat the global AIDS epidemic  To date  our funding has not kept pace with our pledged support  I believe that we need to increase our contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  which reaches millions of individuals in countries around the globe  and is an essential tool in our global response to these three diseases   It is also vital to ensure that the appropriations for the President  s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  PEPFAR  fulfill the promise of  15 billion of assistance over five years for the countries hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic  Increasing funding will allow PEPFAR supported programs to reach the greatest number of individuals       Because women bear the brunt of the epidemic  with over 7 000 women and girls becoming infected with HIV every day worldwide  our government needs to do everything in its power to prevent and treat HIV in this vulnerable group  We need to ensure that women have access to services  including reproductive health services  that will allow them to protect themselves  I call upon the Administration to restore funding to the United Nations Population Fund  which provides vital health services  including HIV AIDS prevention  education and treatment programs  to women around the world      In the United States  we must continue to fulfill the promise of care and treatment for those living with AIDS  The best way to maintain these essential services is through the upcoming reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act  Since 1990  this legislation has helped to fund medication and services for Americans living with HIV and AIDS  In the upcoming reauthorization  I am committed to strengthening the program and ensuring that it continues to fund vital services in New York and around the nation  particularly for the communities and populations hardest hit by the epidemic  I would also urge my colleagues in the House to support the Senate passed Medicaid demonstration project based upon the Early Treatment for HIV Act  which I introduced with Senator Smith earlier this year  This demonstration project would provide federal funding to expand Medicaid eligibility to people living with HIV  allowing them to access critical medical services before they develop symptoms     While funding for care and treatment programs is essential in helping those who are living with HIV and AIDS  we must also increase our support for prevention programs that can halt the spread of this disease  We cannot let ideological beliefs interfere with the delivery of prevention information rooted in science  We know how this virus is transmitted  we know how to prevent its spread  and we must be honest and open in our discussions about AIDS  otherwise  our prevention efforts will fail      I believe that our government should commemorate this day by renewing support for efforts to end the AIDS epidemic in the United States and around the world  We must make good on our promises  and increase support for programs that help people affected by AIDS  40 million people are already living with HIV  and we must do everything in our power to keep millions more from dying
