August 2  2007 Senator Clinton Urges the President to Fill Vacancy at Consumer Product Safety Commission in Wake of Toy Recalls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Recent Toy Recall Highlights the Need for Leadership at Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  In the wake of the recent recalls of childrens toys containing lead paint  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today urged President Bush to act quickly to nominate a qualified  unbiased commissioner for the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC    For over a year  the agency has been operating without the leadership of a permanent chairman   CPSC is responsible for protecting Americans from injury or death from over 15 000 types of consumer products  including toys  power tools  and household chemicals   Several recent cases of unsafe levels of lead detected in childrens toys have resulted in the recall of approximately three million toys worldwide        The recent recalls of imported toys containing lead paint have caused parents great uncertainty and anxiety and threatened to undermine the progress we have made as a country in reducing our childrens exposure to lead hazards   With this danger coming to light  it is more critical than ever that we have permanent leadership at the Consumer Product Safety Commission to make sure it can perform its critical role in protecting public health and safety  said Senator Clinton      Lead has known adverse health impacts on children  causing impaired growth and function of vital organs and problems with intellectual and behavioral development  A recent well publicized study has linked lead hazard exposure in childhood to violent behavior later in life  Lead poisoning poses a serious and entirely preventable threat to a childs health      Senator Clinton has a strong record of leadership on lead poisoning prevention  Senator Clinton is the sponsor of the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act  which would provide home owners and landlords with a 50 percent tax credit for lead abatement costs   She also joined with her colleagues to introduce legislation to remove lead from child care facilities and separate legislation to tighten lead safety standards in childrens toys and electronics  She also joined with colleagues to call on the Senate Appropriations Committee to provide  185 million for the Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide needed resources for lead poisoning prevention    The following is Senator Clintons letter to President Bush    The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC 20500    Dear President Bush    I am writing to express my concern over several recent cases of unsafe levels of lead detected in childrens toys  These discoveries have resulted in the recall of approximately three million toys worldwide  and have caused great uncertainty and anxiety among American parents  While the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  has worked with the companies involved to announce recalls of these toys  I believe the CPSC needs to be strengthened to adequately protect American children from lead paint hazards    Lead poisoning is a serious  persistent  and entirely preventable threat to a childs health   Childhood lead poisoning has been linked to impaired growth and function of vital organs and problems with intellectual and behavioral development   At very high levels  lead poisoning can cause seizures  comas  and even death  robbing a child of his or her future   Furthermore  a recent well publicized study has linked lead hazard exposure in childhood to violent behavior later in life     Since 1978  when lead was banned from house paint  our country has made gains in reducing lead exposures  Yet more than 300 000 children in our nation are estimated to have elevated blood lead levels  and these toys put millions more children at risk   Furthermore  many of these toys include familiar characters  including those from the popular Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer television programs  aimed at young children  who often learn by putting things in their mouths   We must take all necessary measures to ensure that the products we buy for our children are free of lead contamination     The CPSC should have three commissioners to carry out the agencys important consumer protection activities  with one of them acting as the chair  For over a year  the agency has been operating without the leadership of a permanent chairman  and is trying to carry out its activities with only two of the three commissioner positions filled  After waiting roughly eight months to nominate a commissioner  your nominee was forced to withdraw his name from consideration after concerns were raised about possible conflicts of interest that would limit his ability to act in the American consumers best interest  We must give the CPSC the authority and resources needed to protect our children and families  and I would urge you to appoint a qualified  unbiased commissioner to act as the Chair of CPSC as soon as possible    It is shocking to me that the gains we have made in reducing lead hazard exposure are in danger of being overturned due to these unsafe toys  and I believe we cannot let this public health danger remain unchallenged   I look forward to working with you to ensure the CPSC has every tool necessary to reduce and prevent exposure to all products that pose threats to our children    Thank you    Hillary Rodham Clinton
