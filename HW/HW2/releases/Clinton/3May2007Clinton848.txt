May 3  2007 Senator Clinton Questions U S  Central Commander Admiral William Fallon at Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator Clinton  Thank you  Welcome Admiral Fallon         Admiral Fallon  Morning Senator       Senator Clinton  During your confirmation hearings  as we discussed my and the committees concerns with the level of force protection currently available at the time for our troops that we re going to deploy as part of the President s announced escalation  we discussed the fact that as Commander of Pacific Command  you had been asked to review your equipment stocks in order to identify what items could be cross leveled to Central Command   In fact  since that dialogue  Admiral Keating has testified that pre positioned equipment sets in the Pacific had been depleted to fill your new Command s requirements   You mentioned that you and General Patreaus would review the issue and determine whether the right sets of equipment were available and if the current process for equipment transfers were in place   Within the last two months there have been two attacks where Americans have lost their lives while exposed in vulnerable  joint security outposts   These two attacks were with vehicle born suicide bombs and small arms fire  Last week s attack resulted in nine paratroopers being killed as a result of the attackers penetrating the perimeter of the outpost   Admiral  now that you ve had some time to review the situation in your new command  can you give us any thoughts as to what additional steps can be and will be taken to provide the required force protection and to mitigate the risks from these new kinds of deployments and the devastation of these attacks       Admiral Fallon  Really good question Senator   There are several factors here  One is the ability of our enemies to observe carefully  and to calculate and adjust to our changing tactics on the ground      and they are really good at this  And the ability to take note of what we do and to try to adjust to it is pretty remarkable   On the other hand  we are pushing hard            First of all  there s some risk  There is no doubt about it that as we implement this new strategy  the tactical aspects of it on the ground   that by leaving the big FOBs  as they call them  these Forward Operating Bases and getting out and about in the population  there are some additional risks   The calculation going into this  the assumptions are that those risks are going to be offset by the potential gains of actually being out there and amongst the population   This tragic attack you referenced in which we lost nine Americans last week  I was up with those troops two days before that happened in Diyala   and talking to them and getting their perspectives on just how this could work and what we might do in way of adjustments            I don t want to get into the tactical adjustments now  but we re taking really three lines here I will talk to you about generally  One is to look at these joint security stations  These are great ideas in theory because we have our forces  Iraqi forces  Iraqi police forces  and they are out in neighborhoods or areas in towns where we should be able to have a presence that people can see and then take advantage of that by having our people network with folks there and get their confidence so they ll start telling us about the enemy so we can start neutralize it   Another thing though  is we put these places out there   There is a little bit of a dilemma here  because we have   the desire clearly is to be able to integrate and get information from the people  as well as provide the confidence of our presence  our visible presence   We still got to protect our own people   So how we do this is an interesting challenge for the tactical forces  They are working on this and as we evolve this we re going to be doing a couple of different things to show them some different faces           In the business of protection for our troops in these vehicles   It is very clear that the enemy has taken note of the most ubiquitous vehicle over there  the HumVee and it s various varieties  and their approach is to come up with bigger and bigger IEDs   We have information now that indicates  and data that proves this  that certain designs of our own can mitigate a lot of the effects of these heavy blasts   I just  last week  got a request for a review of this entire business from General Odierno  endorsed by General Patreaus  and we sent it on just today to try to adjust the acquisition system to try to get more of these  which appear to be much more effective   Is this going to be the end of the day  Of course  not   There are going to be adjustments made on the part of the enemy and the challenge  the emerging challenge  is this different type of projectile that s being used by  clearly coming with Iranian support  these so called EFPs  which are a different thing all together            But back to the business of the joint security stations and trying to link up with the people   It seems to me that we are going to be adjusting and trying to figure out the best way to do this and it s probably going to vary by neighborhood and by town   We ve got to get general security in the area and then to the best of our ability   The intent is to open this up and get Iraqi forces primarily in the lead  but with us backing them up to be able to get into the people       Senator Clinton  Thank you  Admiral  I d like to turn now to Saudi Arabia   In your prepared testimony you state that Saudi Arabia remains a vital partner  and its campaign against terrorists has significantly degraded Al Qaeda operations on the Arabian Peninsula   But as we all know  the Saudi King recently told the Arab League that in Iraq  and I quote   the bloodshed is continuing under an illegal foreign occupation    And just this last week  King Abdullah declined to meet with Prime Minister Maliki to discuss the critical issue of political reconciliation  the point that my colleague Senator Nelson was speaking about a few minutes ago            Admiral  I d like to ask about our relationship with the Saudi s  and I know that this is a delicate area of inquiry   but let me if I can  ask you to comment about the King s recent statements and what impact they have in Iraq and in the region   And whether you believe that the Saudi s share the American goal of a stable Iraq  in which the Shiites  the Sunnis  and the Kurds  share both power and oil revenue   And finally  whether you think the Saudi s are doing all they can to promote stability in Iraq  including preventing the cross border flow of weapons  money and foreign fighters that support the Sunni insurgency   And with respect to that last question  what is the identity  in so far as it can be determined  of the suicide bombers in vehicles and in vests and of the Sunni insurgent fighters associated with Al Qaeda  whom you either capture or kill       Admiral Fallon  Senator  to Saudi Arabia first   I believe the Saudi government  certainly the King  shares with us a common interest in security and stability in the region   I also believe that they recognize the importance of a stable Iraq as a linchpin of security in this region  but then there are differences of opinion            I spent about an hour and a half with King Abdullah a couple of weeks ago  subsequent to his remarks at the Arab summit   I think we had a very frank discussion   He told me several times in the course of that discussion that in his opinion our policies had not been correct in his view   He also told me that he had severe misgivings about the Maliki government and the reasons for that   He felt  in his words  that there was a significant linkage to Iran   He was concerned about Iranian influence on the Maliki government and he also made several references to his unhappiness  uneasiness with Maliki and the background from which he came   Nonetheless  we agreed on the importance of trying to work whatever way we can together to get stability in this area             From my part  I encouraged him very strongly to at least show some support of the Maliki government   He does not have to like him   I know he doesn t really have a lot of trust there    I think  it is my opinion  it s unrealistic to expect us to change that government   We re not going to be the puppeteers here    It also  given the many constraints that we re under that it was not very realistic to expect that a new government is going to do any better in a short period of time    I will take note of I think  although  he has made public statements and he also made apparently  declined to meet with Maliki   On the other hand  it is my understanding that they are in the process of agreeing to wave a very substantial part of the debt that they hold for Iraq and that is extremely useful in my opinion            So  out of this compact meeting that is going on today in Sharm El Sheik  I certainly hope that we can get that behind the scenes cooperation that will provide a foundation to Maliki and his government   They are desperate  that is not the right word  they are craving some kind of recognition from the Sunni majority in this region so that they can have some confidence to move ahead            I tried to explain my view to the King   Your Sunni minority within Iraq would benefit from some signs of the Sunni governments in these neighboring countries to give some support to the government   It may not be the best government  it may not last beyond whatever the term is  but they have got to start down this road and to date they have largely been just sitting on the sidelines  just watching this   And I tried to make the point that unless they get engaged  we are not going to be successful and you are going to have a good chance of an unstable Iraq that would lead to one thing             So it is encouraging to see  in recent weeks  that in fact they are doing some things that I think hopefully  three items that were on the agenda for this neighbors conference   one is dealing with the refugee problem   There has been an outflow of millions of people from the troubles in Iraq   There is another real need  a practical need  to do something to be able to get fuel sources   It is really ironic  isn t it   That this country of Iraq  which has this vast resource of oil and gas and exports   billions of dollars and they ve got billions sitting in the bank  still can t get enough fuel to run automobiles and for heating and for cooking and things   So there was an agreement to at least approach this issue and hopefully there will progress here this week to actually make some arrangements from the neighbors   Again  it s the neighbors   Iraq can t be  we can t succeed  I believe by isolating Iraq   It is going to have to include the neighbors             Anyway  I am talking to long  But I find that this is an amazing requirement for just dialogue   People need to sit down   They need to talk   They need to hear the other views  at least to make some recognition and accommodation to those other views   I think anything is possible if they can get there   This is the Middle East   There are many different vectors  many concerns  but people had a history of making deals with one another for centuries and I think there is no reason why we couldn t expect to have something enough come together right now to give this fledging government of Iraq a start and then take it a step at a time       Senator Clinton  Admiral  what about the identity of the suicide bombers and others whom you ve been discussing       Admiral Fallon  Our belief is that the vast majority of these are Al Qaeda connected   It s tough because most of them are suicide bombers now and there is not much left when they re over   But the finger prints  maybe not literally  are certainly indicative Al Qaeda connected to Sunni   There is no doubt   You look at the targets  the big targets are Shiite targets       Senator Clinton  Are they mostly non Iraqi       Admiral Fallon  I can t tell you that   Instincts are that if they are not foreign fighters then they are certainly people that have been somehow co opted by Al Qaeda into doing these things       Senator Clinton  Thank you               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
