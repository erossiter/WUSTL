October 26  2006 Statement of Senator Clinton on Exxon Mobil  s Announcement of a  10 5 Billion Third Quarter Profit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Today s announcement of record third quarter profits by Exxon Mobil is a clear reminder that we need a new direction in energy policy   Instead of continuing to line the pockets of big oil  we should move towards energy policies and technologies that can reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create jobs   That is why I have introduced legislation to eliminate oil company tax breaks and use that money to create a Strategic Energy Fund that would speed development of biofuels  help people buy hybrid cars  and fund research into cutting edge energy technologies
