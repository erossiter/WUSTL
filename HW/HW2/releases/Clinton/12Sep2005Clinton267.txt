September 12  2005 Clinton Calls for Investigation Into Misuse of 9 11 Small Business Funds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Report showed that 9 11 funds were given to businesses that were not affected by the September 11th attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on the Small Business Administration to investigate reports that funds meant to help small businesses recover from the September 11th attacks were used for other purposes  A recent report discovered that several loans made under the Small Business Administration  s Supplementary Terrorism Activity Relief  STAR  program were given to businesses    including a South Dakota country radio station  a Virgin Islands perfume shop  and a Utah dog boutique     not affected by the events of September 11th         In a letter sent to SBA Administrator Bareto  Senator Clinton called for an immediate investigation into the situation  The Senator also called for an investigation into reports that the SBA had encouraged banks and other lenders to use the STAR program   liberally    and offered advice on how to qualify loan applicants for the program even if they could not meet the specified criteria           At a time when many New York small businesses are indeed still recovering from the disruptions caused by the attacks of September 11th  these reports of abuse of the STAR program and the profligate use of scarce government resources are indeed inexcusable     Senator Clinton said in her letter         A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached        September 9  2005       Mr  Hector V  Barreto  Administrator  Small Business Administration  409 Third Street  S W   Washington  D C   20416       Dear Mr  Barreto        It has come to my attention that loans administered through the Small Business Administration  s Supplementary Terrorism Activity Relief  STAR  program may have been used for purposes other than assisting businesses affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11th  2001  as specified under the FY 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act           Recent news reports have outlined instances in which recipients of loans through the STAR program were not affected by the events of September 11th including    a South Dakota country radio station  a Virgin Islands perfume shop  and a Utah dog boutique       In fact  in one instance  a recipient of a STAR loan was not even aware that the loan was administered through the program   As troubling as these examples are  I am particularly concerned by the reports that the Small Business Administration  SBA  itself had encouraged banks and other lenders to use the STAR program   liberally    and offered advice on how to qualify loan applicants for the program if they could not meet the specified criteria         I therefore urge to you to conduct a comprehensive review of the STAR program and make a report to Congress with your findings as expeditiously as possible   In particular  I believe that questions relating to the administration and marketing of the loan program  the administrative requirements placed on lenders by the SBA to ensure that loan recipients were indeed affected by the attacks of September 11th  and the reports of SBA involvement in assisting lenders to circumvent the requirements of the STAR program need to be adequately and thoroughly addressed   Moreover  given that it has been estimated that fewer than 11 percent of these loans have been made to businesses in New York City and Washington  D C   Ground Zero for the attacks of September 11th  I also believe that an analysis of the geographic distribution of these loans is in order given that that would be one of the determinative factors in the granting of these loans         I am a strong supporter of the mission of the SBA  and indeed  many of my constituents have benefited through the services and assistance provided by your agency   Nevertheless  I believe that these reports  if true  constitute a breech at least of the spirit of the law that created the STAR program   At a time when many New York small businesses are indeed still recovering from the disruptions caused by the attacks of September 11th  these reports of abuse of the STAR program and the profligate use of scarce government resources are indeed inexcusable        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter  and I look forward to hearing from you        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
