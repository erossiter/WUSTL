May 25  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Senate Committee Approval of Over  21 Million for Defense Projects to Benefit Southern Tier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Funding Included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill Approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized defense funding for SUNY Binghamton  Johnson Outdoors  Inc  L 3 Communications  Rockwell Collins Lockheed Martin  and Schweizer Aircraft Corp           The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill  Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor           Our local research and development facilities are developing cutting edge technology in support of our troops but they are also critical for the local economy  As our troops continue to fight bravely overseas and to defend our nation  we know too well the importance of giving them the best equipment available  And these investments are a welcome boost as we continue to promote the Southern Tier as a center for research and New York s rightful place at the forefront of defense development and manufacturing   Senator Clinton said          The bill also included two amendments that Senator Clinton proposed  including one that would protect financial benefits for military family members by closing gaps in coverage for Death Gratuity and Survivor Benefits beneficiaries and one that would expand and extend a Government Accountability Office  GAO  study to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of the Ground Forces within the Army and Marine Corps   The study would also assess the impact of the recent troop surge initiated by President Bush          Funding in the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill includes       SUNY Binghamton   The Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing  CAMM     2 million         FY08 funding will be used to continue development of new  flexible and low cost electronics based on roll to roll  R2R  manufacturing technologies to enhance U S  military superiority  while strengthening our nation s role as a global technology leader    The Army Research Laboratory supports the CAMM and recognizes that advancements in the underlying materials and manufacturing technology for flexible  organic and printed electronics components and devices are critical for visionary applications related to the military and to national security   As part of a future combat system  the soldier must have extensive communications capability  enhanced power sources for the many electronics devices  extensive sensors deployment for threat detection and health monitoring  and active body armor and camouflage for security  These developments are critical to make the future warrior more mobile  more lethal and more secure       Johnson Outdoors  Inc   Rapid Deployable Shelters  RDS  in Comparable Size to the MGPTS Type III    6 million         These funds will be spent to manufacture military tents to meet the needs of our armed forces around the world and to maintain the industrial base necessary to meet these needs   A 2005 report to Congress by the Defense Logistics Agency concluded that unless additional funds are provided to support the domestic military tent industrial base   the Military Services will continue to experience limited wartime supply availability of critical tent and shelter systems that are essential to the success of military operations that support national defense objectives        L 3 Communications   Predator Aircrew Mission Training System Upgrade    4 million         USAF has fielded Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operating in combat today  and is now fielding its first major upgrade  the MQ 9  Reaper   This project will build a Predator Aircrew Mission Training System simulator for the Reaper   Funding will help to upgrade engineering  performance  visual system and sensors       Rockwell Collins   Global Air Traffic Management Program for KC 135s    9 million         Aircraft equipped with the required systems will have the operational advantage of choosing the most efficient and economical routes of flight  as well as continued access to airspace that is now regularly used in DoD world wide operations   While operational access to airspace has been important to address the military commitments of the 1990 s  it has now reached a critical stage as U S  servicemembers continue to fight bravely in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere   It is imperative that the U S  is capable of projecting airpower to any location via the most direct route   This is fundamental to having combat crews reach the target area with the most fuel and in the least fatigued condition possible       Lockheed Martin   VH 71A Executive Helicopter Development    279 7 million  As requested in President s Budget          A new Marine One helicopter fleet is needed  as today s security environment requires urgent upgrades to the presidential fleet s security and defensive systems   The current VH 3D fleet has been in service for thirty plus years and is now at the end of its useful life  and also has insufficient payload capacity that will not allow the installation of additional communication and defensive equipment   The FY08 president s budget request was modified by the Navy prior to Office of the Secretary of Defense  OSD  submission from the original program plan  and is now  412M less than the original Research  Development  Test   Evaluation  RDT  program funding plan   This budget restructure brings the budget in line with program expenditures and holds long lead production to a period after additional aircraft testing is complete   The FY08 budget request will ensure the aircraft test program remains on track and that the program will meet its plan of delivering five IOC aircraft in late 2009  and eighteen Fully Operation Capable aircraft in 2015   The FY08 budget request is the minimal amount required to keep the program on schedule       Schweizer Aircraft Corp   MQ 8B Fire Scout VTUAV    37 million  As requested in President s Budget          The Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  VTUAV  System is being developed for the U S Navy and Army  its primary role is to provide situational awareness and precision targeting for Navy forces at sea and Army forces ashore   Its long endurance  performance  sophisticated payloads  ability to take off and land vertically  and an autonomous operational capability make Fire Scout uniquely capable to provide long range surveillance and reconnaissance under the most demanding of tactical conditions   Funding would allow for the procurement of four additional vehicles       Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation   Semiconductor Focus Center Research Program    5 million         The Focus Center Research Program  FCRP  is jointly funded by the Department of Defense and the semiconductor industry to perform basic research at 38 universities across the country  including Columbia  Cornell  NYU  RPI  Stony Brook and the University at Albany SUNY  Funding is used to help maintain U S  leadership in semiconductor technology that is critical for national defense and economic competitiveness   Technology leadership is also important to the many upstream companies that supply the semiconductor industry and the computer and telecommunications equipment companies that depend on semiconductor advances
