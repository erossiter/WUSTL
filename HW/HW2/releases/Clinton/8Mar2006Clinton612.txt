March 8  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on International Women  s Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC      Today is International Women  s Day  a chance for us to reflect upon the status of women around the globe  recognize their achievements  and recommit ourselves to ensuring that women can fully realize the rights with which all humans are endowed           There is much for women to celebrate this year  Women in Kuwait were granted the right to vote and run for office  while women in Afghanistan exercised their right to vote in November  s elections  In Tanzania  and Burundi  among other countries  the number of women serving in elected office increased to record levels  In all parts of the world  women are seizing opportunities to weigh in with their governments on the issues of greatest importance to their lives   But there is still so much work to be done to help women achieve equal rights and equal protection           The corruption apparent in far too many countries has a disproportionate impact upon women  In Latin America  women have disappeared or been killed without proper criminal investigations  In other countries  women who have endured rape or sexual abuse experience further stigmatization and punishment  including forced detainment and death threats  All across the globe  women and girls are trafficked across borders  often with the knowledge of local officials who tolerate the presence of their captors  We need to devote more energy to making our communities safer for women  ensure that crimes against women are given fair and full consideration by law enforcement  and that bribery and cronyism do not dilute the rule of law          Women  the caregivers in families and communities around the world  must also have the opportunity to seek and receive appropriate health care   More than 500 000 women each year die of largely preventable pregnancy related complications  while millions more suffer injuries  like obstetric fistulas  for which they cannot get treatment  In many countries in sub Saharan Africa  where AIDS has had the greatest impact  the majority of young women still do not have adequate knowledge of the ways in which HIV is transmitted   Girls and women account for 70 percent of the world  s hungry  and malnutrition in pregnant women leads to deficiencies in their children  s development  We need to recognize the way that gender inequality contributes to disease and address these disparities through increased education and outreach and equal access to medical treatment and support services          As international trade transforms economies around the world  we must ensure that women have equal access to these opportunities  In one third of the world  women are the breadwinners for their families  Female farmers account for 80 percent of the agricultural workforce in Africa  and 60 percent in Asia   Yet despite their contributions to the economy  women make up 60 percent of the world  s working poor  struggling to survive on less than one dollar a day  They are too often placed in situations of informal employment    temporary or part time positions that do not offer a formal salary or benefits  We must ensure that all girls and women have access to educational opportunities that can lead to employment at an adequate wage  and that women receive fair compensation for labor performed outside a traditional workplace setting          It has been more than a decade since I traveled to Beijing for the Fourth World Conference on Women  This week  the Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations is convening to evaluate the progress we have made in achieving the goals we set at that time  We must work to ensure that the commitments we made then become reality now  I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and counterparts in other governments to create a world in which every woman is treated with respect and dignity  every boy and girl is loved and cared for equally  and every family has the hope of a strong and stable future
