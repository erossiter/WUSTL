February 8  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Vote on Confirmation of General George W  Casey to be Army Chief of Staff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Army Chief of Staff has responsibility for training and equipping the brave soldiers who are serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere           During his nomination hearing to be Army Chief of Staff  I questioned General Casey about recent reports  both by the Department of Defense Inspector General and press accounts  that units and personnel lacked the necessary equipment  General Casey responded that was not aware of the problems cited in these reports and actually quite surprised at the reported shortcomings  In the Inspector General report s summary  the equipment shortages were attributed to basic management failures among military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan  General Casey was not aware of this investigation or its recommendations that oversight must immediately improve to ensure proper distribution of equipment  as a result units and personnel are not able to perform assign missions           General Casey has had a distinguished career and devoted his life to serving the Army and this nation  but his testimony lacked the sense of urgency and resolve required of our next Chief of Staff who will be responsible to provide trained and relevant Soldiers with the requisite equipment to the battlefield  I believe that our soldiers deserve the very best we can offer for their protection  therefore I voted to oppose General Casey s nomination to be Army Chief of Staff   After his confirmation today  I look forward to working with General Casey to ensure that our soldiers have the equipment and training that they need                Earlier  Senator Clinton Questions General Casey on His Nomination to be United States Army Chief of Staff   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
