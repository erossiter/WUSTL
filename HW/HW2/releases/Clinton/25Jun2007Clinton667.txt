June 25  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the U S  House of Representatives Hearing on 9 11 Air Quality Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I want to commend Congressman Nadler for holding this important hearing to get to the bottom of the EPA s misleading statements about air quality in the aftermath of 9 11   We need to know what went wrong and why  because New Yorkers deserve answers   Today we heard former Administration officials try to defend their air quality statements  but the illnesses of first responders and residents speak for themselves   We need to provide care for those who are sick as a result of exposure to toxins on 9 11 and we need to make sure that we do not make the same mistakes in responding to future disasters    Last week  Senator Clinton  Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  questioned Administration officials at a companion hearing about the systematic failures of the Federal government in responding to the environmental crisis that resulted from the September 11  2001 World Trade Center attacks  Senator Clintons hearing was held to examine the federal response to 9 11  including risk communication and EPA programs to test and clean indoor spaces in lower Manhattan   The hearing also examined lessons learned from 9 11 and federal readiness to respond to the release of hazardous substances in future emergencies    For more than five years  Senator Clinton and Representative Nadler have staunchly criticized and questioned the Administration s misleading public statements about post 9 11 air quality  as well as its continued failure to provide a proper testing and cleaning of indoor spaces contaminated by WTC toxins and its lack of health care for the thousands of people who are already ill as a result of exposure to the pollutants
