                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Implementation of New Medicare Prescription Drug Program Threatens Coverage for Those Eligible for Both Medicare and Medicaid  Fails to Address Burden on Local Pharmacists                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has introduced legislation that will help beneficiaries who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid make a smooth transition from Medicaid prescription drug coverage to the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program   Seniors and disabled Americans who are dually eligible for both programs will stop receiving prescription drugs through Medicaid automatically on January 1 and local pharmacists will bear the brunt of responsibility for aiding and advising any of these recipients who have not enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan when they realize in trying to fill a prescription that they no longer have Medicaid drug coverage   To make matters worse  pharmacists will be charged a transaction fee for assisting these beneficiaries   Senator Clinton  s bill  The Medicare Dual Eligible Identification and Enrollment Facilitation Act  requires outreach and education to pharmacies on dually eligible beneficiaries and waives the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting these beneficiaries             It is critical that we do everything we can to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors do not fall through the cracks and pharmacies across the country are now our last line of defense   Helping them assist these beneficiaries and eliminating fees they incur for doing so are simple but critical steps we should take to ensure that not a single dual eligible beneficiary is left without prescription drug coverage     said Senator Clinton          The 6 4 million seniors and disabled Americans who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare are the most vulnerable members of an already vulnerable population   They are the poorest of the elderly  with incomes of less than  10 000 per year  and they are the sickest of the elderly  with approximately 25 percent residing in a long term care facility  They have significant health care needs  have often been diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions  and are in greatest danger of being affected by poor implementation of Medicare s new prescription drug benefit   More than 500 000 dually eligible beneficiaries reside in New York          Senator Clinton voted against the Medicare Drug bill in 2003 and has called repeatedly for the Bush Administration to correct its flaws and shortcomings  including the short time frame in which dual eligibles have to complete this transition   Under the new Medicare prescription drug program  most seniors have six months to choose a prescription drug plan   However  dual eligibles    the poorest and sickest portion of the Medicare population    were given only six weeks to evaluate and choose a prescription drug plan before they are cut off from the Medicaid drug benefit on January 1  2006            Senator Clinton has supported legislation that would extend the Medicaid drug benefit beyond January 1 to provide adequate time for the transition   However  Republicans in Congress have blocked these efforts  leaving these individuals without coverage if their transition from Medicaid to Medicare doesn  t happen before the end of the year          In response to the concern over the short implementation period  the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services  CMS  at the U S  Department of Health and Human Services announced that it will automatically enroll dual eligibles in a randomly chosen prescription drug plan by January 1  2006   In light of growing concern that some dual eligible beneficiaries will not be auto enrolled and arrive at their pharmacy counter on January 1 without coverage  CMS has announced a procedure to allow pharmacies to fill the prescription and a contractor to follow up with the beneficiary to facilitate enrollment in a Part D plan   While this is a positive step  local pharmacies may not be aware of this option and some beneficiaries will still fall through the cracks   In addition  pharmacies will be charged a transaction fee if they use this procedure and electronically inquire about the status of a beneficiary that comes to their pharmacy counter and isn  t sure what coverage they have or if they have coverage at all          Senator Clinton  s legislation would address this situation head on to help prevent this problem before it occurs   The bill is co sponsored by Senator Jay Rockefeller  D W Va
