February 8  2006 Senator Clinton Co Sponsors Bill to Maintain Coverage of Needed Prescription Drugs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton co sponsored bipartisan legislation introduced today to prevent Medicare prescription drug plans from ending coverage of drugs that were available when beneficiaries enrolled in a plan   Under current law  prescription drug plans can change which drugs they cover as many times as they want throughout the year  as long as they give advance notice to their enrollees   However  seniors have no recourse other than going through an appeals process which may or may not result in them getting their medicines if their drug plan suddenly drops their medicines   Seniors are required to wait to change plans until the next open enrollment period  which occur annually   The bill was introduced by Senators Dianne Feinstein  Calif    Susan Collins  Maine  and Olympia Snowe  Maine               Medicare beneficiaries deserve an assurance that their drug plan will uphold its commitment to provide the medications they have promised   Drug plans should not be able to alter their list of covered drugs  while seniors and the disabled remain locked in  forced to pay more or change medications   We will fix this critical flaw in the Medicare prescription drug program            Specifically  the Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act would guarantee seniors that the prescription drugs covered by their plan will continue to be covered the remainder of the calendar year in which they enrolled   For example  seniors who enrolled in a plan in January would be guaranteed access to specific prescription drugs which would remain consistent until the following year  Likewise  seniors who become eligible to enroll for the benefit later in the year  say in July or September  would be guaranteed that their prescription drug coverage would be the same until January  Seniors would then have the option of changing plans the next year if the company stopped covering a drug they need            Other co sponsors include Senators Byron Dorgan  N D    Jeff Bingaman  N M    Lincoln Chafee  R I    Charles Schumer  N Y    Patty Murray  Wash    and Barbara Boxer  Calif                Summary of the Medicare Drug Formulary Act           Under the Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act               If a senior signs up for a plan in January  the drugs covered by the plan will continue to be covered the rest of that year               If a senior becomes eligible for Medicare during the year  for instance he or she turns 65 in May  and signs up for a plan  the drugs covered by the plan when at the time of enrollment will continue to be covered the rest of that year  and                If at the end of the year during the open enrollment period  a prescription drug plan wants to change its formulary  it can do that   The plan must then notify its enrollees of the formulary changes and seniors can then decide whether to stick with that plan or switch to a different plan           Exceptions when a plan can change its formulary during the year                A generic alternative is introduced in the market                A brand name drug loses its patent protection               The FDA Commissioner removes the drug from the market or imposes a restriction on the use of the drug  or              The drug is deemed to be ineffective           In each of these instances  the plan must notify the Health and Human Services Secretary  affected enrollees  physicians  and pharmacies of the change
