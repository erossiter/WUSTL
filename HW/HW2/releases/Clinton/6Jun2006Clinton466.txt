                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Former Air Force Serviceman and Teacher from Getzville and Researcher from New York City Join Senator Clinton to Raise Awareness of Early Onset Alzheimer  s      Alzheimer  s Association releases new report focusing on early onset cases and other dementias                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    At a briefing of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer   s disease today  on the topic of Early Onset Alzheimer  s Disease  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with patients  caregivers  and advocates to raise awareness about this form of the disease that strikes individuals under the age of 65  Senator Clinton  who co chairs the Task Force with Senator Susan Collins  R ME  called on her colleagues to increase research funding and support legislation that would enhance respite care services and improve screening and treatment for diseases like Alzheimer  s             Today  about 4 5 million Americans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer  s  In New York alone  it is estimated that Alzheimer  s directly impacts 330 000 people  But contrary to what is generally acknowledged  Alzheimer  s doesn  t just affect the elderly     Senator Clinton said     When Alzheimer  s disease or other dementias unexpectedly strike younger individuals  they face daunting challenges in addition to the disease itself  like difficulty obtaining a diagnosis  early retirement and the loss of jobs and income             Americans with early onset Alzheimer  s can have trouble obtaining Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI  and Supplemental Security Income  SSI  and problems gaining access to health care insurance  If they do have health insurance they may face higher premiums and deductibles   The toll on family members can be devastating  emotionally  financially  and personally  Some have to give up jobs to care for their loved one  Others have to make hard choices between paying for health care and basic living expenses          At the briefing  Members of Congress heard from Jennifer Manly  PhD  Assistant Professor of Neuropsychology in Neurology  G H  Sergievsky Center   the Taub Institute for Research in Aging and Alzheimer  s Disease at Columbia University and several people suffering from and caring for loved ones with early onset Alzheimer  s  including Dr  Gerald Michalak  who served in the United States Air Force as a member of the Sixth Combat Defense Squad  Strategic Air Command  SAC  and taught elementary school in the Williamsville Central School System in Getzville  NY for over 30 years  In approximately 1998  Dr  Michalak began experiencing memory problems   He saw his primary care physician who diagnosed the problems as stress related   However  his memory problems continued to worsen  despite repeated visits to the doctor  Further loss of expressive language and cognitive abilities led to his retirement in June 2000 as his condition continued to decline   Finally  in June 2005  at age 62  he received a diagnosis of Alzheimer  s disease             Dr  Michalak  s story and others like it are proof of why we must increase awareness and education about those with early onset Alzheimer  s disease or other dementias and further evidence of why we must continue to push for critical investments in research and treatment     Senator Clinton said    I am hopeful that together we can combat this disease and do all we can to bring hope  help and an eventual cure to the millions of Americans with Alzheimer  s             At the briefing  the Alzheimer  s Association also released a report entitled A Hidden Generation of Dementia  A National Challenge  A Future Crisis that uses data from the nationwide Health and Retirement Survey  HRS  and testimonials to tell the story of early onset dementia that affects an understudied subset of the population        Click here to access the Alzheimer  s Association  s report         Although we have made progress in the awareness  diagnosis  and treatment of Alzheimer  s over the past 15 years  this new report and these personal stories are a reminder we must do more     Senator Clinton said    We must continue to make this disease a national priority  This means directing more resources to learn how to identify early onset dementia and stop its progression             Senator Clinton has long fought for funding for research into Alzheimer   s disease and for more support and services for those touched by it  She is fighting for passage of the Lifespan Respite Care Act to enhance respite care services available to family members caring for individuals with diseases like Alzheimer  s  Earlier this year  she succeeded in attaching an amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution to restore critical funding to the National Family Caregiver Support Program  Meals on Wheels and other programs that provide support to seniors  including those suffering from Alzheimer  s disease   The Senator  s amendment ensures that funding for Alzheimer  s  preventative health  nutrition  family caregiver and ombudsmen services are protected for our seniors  including funding for the Alzheimer  s 24 7 Contact Center  which provides families of Alzheimer patients access to life saving assistance any hour of the day   Her amendment also prevents elimination of critical funding to states for the development of innovative programs to help those with Alzheimer  s and their caregivers   In fiscal year 2005  38 states received such grants  including  290 000 received by the New York State Office for the Aging  Senator Clinton will continue to fight for this funding in the appropriations process  Senator Clinton also supported the doubling of the National Institutes of Health research budget initiated during the Clinton Administration and she continues to fight for increased research funding to find cures for diseases like Alzheimer  s           In April  Senator Clinton was honored with the   Remembrance Award    from the Northeastern New York Chapter of the Alzheimer  s Association at the Third Annual National Alzheimer  s Gala sponsored by the Alzheimer  s Association
