                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bill Now Goes to Senate Floor                Washington  DC  The Senate Armed Services Committee today approved a series of amendments offered by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  to strengthen the committees bill to address problems facing our wounded servicemembers   The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act was approved today by the Senate Armed Services Committee and will now go to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate   A cosponsor of the legislation  Senator Clinton had succeeded in including a number of provisions in the bill from her Heroes at Home Act of 2007  Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act and Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act  among others  Read More   Noting Senator Clintons leadership  Senator Carl Levin  D MI   Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  today noted that Senator Clinton has introduced more legislation to address the problems facing wounded servicemembers than any other Senator    We have gone a long way today toward meeting our responsibility to our servicemembers to provide the healthcare and support they need   I am proud that the Senate Armed Services committee has approved measures I put forward to improve screening for Traumatic Brain Injury  the signature wound of the war in Iraq  address problems servicemembers are facing as they transition between DoD and VA healthcare systems  and cut red tape preventing wounded servicemembers from receiving needed disability benefits   These are urgently needed steps for our servicemembers and their families  said Senator Clinton      Senator Clinton today secured approval of an amendment to give the Department of Defense a 180 day deadline for implementing a screening protocol for Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI    This builds on a measure Senator Clinton secured in the bill  first introduced as part of her Heroes at Home Act of 2007  to improve detection of mild and moderate TBI by developing an objective assessment tool to measure cognitive functioning of solders both prior to and after deployment   The bill approved today by the Committee also includes elements of another Heroes at Home Act of 2007 proposal to provide needed advice and training for families struggling to take care of a loved one with brain injuries and psychological injuries      In addition  Senator Clinton today won approval of an amendment to ensure that active duty and veterans healthcare services are available to all current and former members of the Armed Services who were injured after October 7  2001  not just those injured after implementation of the bill   Senator Clinton also cosponsored an amendment approved today to make sure that active duty and veterans health care services includes VA benefits so that active duty servicemembers receiving care at VA facilities are not denied access to VA benefits that can facilitate their rehabilitation and recovery   Senator Clinton first called for providing a two year overlap of active duty and medically retired health care services and benefits for injured members and former members of the Armed Services as part of her Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act following reports that soldiers were experiencing problems receiving the healthcare they need as they transition from Department of Defense to VA care     The Senate Armed Services Committee also approved an amendment today offered by Senator Clinton to make sure that efforts underway by the DoD and VA to create a joint electronic medical record result in a DoD VA medical record that is compatible and synchronized with the national efforts to develop a nationwide coordinated health IT infrastructure  an issue on which Senator Clinton has been a leader   This measure builds on provisions  which would provide oversight and leadership for a joint DoD VA interagency office  that Senator Clinton secured in the bill from her Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act   The SASC bill approved today also includes a measure from Senator Clintons Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act that would reform the current flawed disability rating system for wounded servicemembers by ending the flawed DoD rating system and having military departments adopt the VA disability rating system        Senator Clinton today also secured approval of an amendment to ensure needed oversight of the disability rating system for wounded servicemembers by continuing Government Accountability Office  GAO  reviews of treatment of wounded servicemembers   The amendment also will ensure that disability benefit determination cases under review are prohibited from being reduced by a new determination   Senator Clinton proposed similar measures as part of her Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act   The SASC bill approved today also includes two other measures from her Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act  a measure to help make sure servicemembers receive disability benefits they need and deserve by requiring an independent review of disability benefit ratings below 20 percent and increasing disability benefits as warranted and a provision to require that the shortage of Physical Evaluation Board liaison officers and attorneys be addressed by the DoD and VA    Finally  the Senate Armed Services Committee today approved an amendment offered by Senators Clinton and Collins  co chairs of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimers Disease  to require that any longitudinal studies on members of the Armed Forces with TBI also identify early signs of Alzheimers disease  Parkinsons disease and other neurodegeneration   Head injuries  after age and family history  are one of the leading risk factors for an individual developing Alzheimers disease   This amendment builds on a provision for a 15 year longitudinal study on long term health and mental health consequences of TBI that Senator Clinton got enacted in the FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act     The final bill also includes a proposal from the TBI Access to Options Act  introduced by Senator Clinton along with Senator Evan Bayh  D IN  to provide medical advocates for traumatic brain injured servicemembers in the transition from DOD to VA medical treatment  preventing them from getting caught in bureaucracy and red tape       As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need  She has introduced legislation to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families  Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits  She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform  She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing and was recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need  She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families    Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning
