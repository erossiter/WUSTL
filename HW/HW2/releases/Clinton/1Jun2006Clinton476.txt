June 1  2006 Senator Clinton Announces New Legislation to Help Working Families Own their Own Homes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Bill Represents the Second Phase in Clinton  s effort to Expand Access to the Federal Housing Administration  s Mortgage Program Mahopac  NY    In an address to local Chambers of Commerce  business and community leaders at a breakfast hosted by the Greater Mahopac Carmel Chamber of Commerce  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she has introduced the 21st Century Housing Act of 2006   S  3173  legislation designed to strengthen the Federal Housing Administration and increase the availability of FHA insured mortgage products across the country             The 21st Century Housing Act will provide hundreds of thousands of additional families with safe and affordable home ownership opportunities   At the same time  this proposal will help preserve a critical Federal initiative that has a strong tradition of service to low and moderate income participants by providing greater program and management flexibility  as well as stronger financial accountability     said Senator Clinton          The legislation  which represents the most comprehensive attempt at FHA reform since 1990  is the second part in Senator Clinton  s effort to help working families achieve the American dream of home ownership   After more than 70 years of existence  the FHA has helped over 34 million families realize the dream of home ownership   The FHA has been particularly effective at reaching first time home buyers  low and moderate income households and minority home buyers by providing an effective alternative to the sub prime and predatory lending market that often results in increased monthly mortgage payments of hundreds and thousands of dollars   However the FHA has been hampered by a lack of investment in personnel and technology infrastructure  and structural inefficiencies that have made it increasingly uncompetitive in many housing markets            The Senator  s bill makes several proposed changes to the structure of the FHA including               Allowing the FHA to offer loan terms up to 50 years  instead of the current limit of 30 years   This would have the effect of reducing the monthly mortgage payments and allowing families of more modest means to achieve home ownership              Providing the FHA with the flexibility to offer reduced and zero down payment products  mirroring private market practices  to reach families that have good credit but that lack the upfront cash for a down payment               Allowing the FHA to make investments in both personnel and information technology infrastructure to help meet the market demand for affordable mortgage products              Increasing the FHA  s loan limits for multifamily housing in high cost areas by 45 percent which will help create more home buying opportunities in high cost of living states like New York             Today  there are virtually no FHA loans being granted for multifamily homes in high cost areas in New York or across the nation   By increasing the number of these loans that are available and by providing this additional flexibility  more affordable opportunities will be created for those who live in areas like New York City and other parts of our state where the cost of home ownership is very high     said Senator Clinton            On behalf of more than 61 000 New York Realtors  I strongly endorse Senator Clinton  s legislation to modernize a critical link for many low and moderate income homebuyers to achieve the dream of homeownership   Whether it  s the purchase of a co op in Manhattan  a colonial in Rochester or a bungalow in Saratoga  FHA has given New Yorkers the chance to own a home and a piece of the American dream   Specifically  Senator Clinton  s bill makes thoughtful  creative and flexible additions to update FHA and prepare for the housing challenges of the 21st Century     said Gregory Connors  President  New York State Association of Realtors  NYSAR          In April  Senator Clinton initiated the first part of her home ownership effort  introducing legislation to enable home buyers in high cost of living areas to take advantage of the Federal Housing Administration loan program   Senator Clinton  s bill  the Federal Housing Fairness Act of 2006  increases the Federal Housing Administration  s  FHA  loan limits so that working families living in high cost of living states like New York can enjoy the benefits of the program   The bill ensures that the program reflects the generally higher median prices of homes that exceed the FHA loan limit             The Federal Housing Fairness Act of 2006 would raise the FHA loan limit for single family homes to 100 percent of the conforming loan limits offered by Government Sponsored Enterprises like Fannie Mae or 100 percent of the area median home price  allowing families in high housing cost areas to utilize the FHA program  While home ownership rates are at historically high levels on a national level  for many areas of the country  including many areas of New York  the advantages of a home mortgage insured by the FHA are denied because the loan limits are often smaller than the median price of a home in a high cost of living area   For example  according to the National and New York State Association of Realtors  the median home price is  446 500 in New York City   505 750 in Nassau County   413 000 in Suffolk County   550 000 in Queens   422 000 on Staten Island   395 750 in Putnam County   522 500 in Rockland County and  662 000 in Westchester County  In contrast however  under current law  the FHA loan limit is effectively  362 790  which means that working families  teachers  police officers  firefighters and other public servants are either closed out of the housing market where they work  driven into risky home purchase products or continue to make monthly rent payments  losing out on the opportunity to grow equity and family wealth
