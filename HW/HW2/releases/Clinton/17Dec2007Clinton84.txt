December 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the FISA Amendments Act of 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Today  the U S  Senate took up the FISA Amendments Act of 2007   The bill under consideration gives telecommunication companies blanket retroactive immunity for their alleged cooperation in the administration s warrantless wiretapping program   I continue to believe that a grant of retroactive immunity is unjustified  and I have co sponsored Senator Dodds measure to remove that provision from the bill   The Bush Administration has blatantly disregarded Americans civil liberties over the past seven years  and I simply will not trust them to protect Americans privacy rights     I did not support cutting off debate today  and I will continue to oppose the bill as long as it contains retroactive immunity   I believe that we should pass balanced legislation that protects our civil liberties and the rule of law while giving our law enforcement and intelligence agencies the tools they need to protect our country
