                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Clinton Renews Call for FTC Investigation of Gasoline Prices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today welcomed news that the U S  Department of Energy  DOE  would release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  to address supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina and reiterated her request that President Bush have the Federal Trade Commission investigate whether price gouging is responsible for any of the continuing increase in gasoline prices              Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a good first step in dealing with skyrocketing gas prices  now compounded by supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina     said Senator Clinton     We also need to be sure that oil companies are not exploiting the current crisis to make record profits at the expense of consumers   The President should publicly call on oil companies not to engage in price gouging  and should ask the Federal Trade Commission to immediately investigate whether any price gouging is occurring               The tragedy in the Gulf States is yet another reminder of the need for this Administration to deal with the energy crisis   Gas prices have been soaring for months  but the Administration did not respond to repeated calls to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve until a tragedy hit   It shouldn  t take devastation to get action   Consumers across the country deserve an answer from this Administration on what they are doing to bring energy prices down             On August 18th  Senator Clinton wrote to President Bush  asking him to take several short term steps to address the current high prices  including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  urging OPEC allies to increase oil production  and having the Federal Trade Commission evaluate whether price gouging has occurred   Since that time  gasoline prices have continued to rise in New York  reaching a new weekly average high price of  2 70 per gallon on August 29th            The text of Senator Clinton  s August 18th letter follows            August 18  2005           The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  D C   20500         Dear Mr  President          As you and all Americans know  gasoline prices have soared in New York this summer   According to the Energy Information Agency at the United States Department of Energy  the average weekly gasoline price in New York State reached a new high on Monday of  2 62  up 16 percent since May 30th and more than 32 percent since the beginning of the year            High gasoline prices are hurting New York  s people and its economy   Families are being forced to skip their summer vacations   Businesses face rising transportation costs   Airline margins are being squeezed   At the same time  oil companies are enjoying record profits   Exxon Mobil recently announced second quarter earnings of  7 64 billion  a 24 percent increase over last year  s second quarter   Other oil companies are also reaping massive profits  including second quarter profits of  5 59 billion for BP PLC   5 24 billion for Royal Dutch Shell  and  3 14 billion for Conoco Phillips            New Yorkers and all Americans are looking to your Administration for help in dealing with this alarming problem for working families and businesses across our country   The country is in need of an immediate plan to ease gasoline price spikes and ensure that consumers are not being gouged   Rising crude oil prices are largely responsible for the increase in gasoline prices   Therefore  I urge you to consider short term steps to increase crude oil supplies  including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  and urging our OPEC allies to maximize output   In addition  I ask that you request that the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether oil and gasoline price increases are resulting from anti competitive practices rather than supply and demand           While these immediate steps are important to help address our pressing needs  they are not a substitute for a strategic long term energy policy   New Yorkers literally should not be asked to pay more and more at the pump while their government sits idly by   I urge your Administration to report to Americans a course of action to provide whatever relief is possible from the burden of rising gas prices            Sincerely yours              Hillary Rodham Clinton
