January 27  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Nomination of Samuel Alito                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As I explained earlier this week from the Senate floor  I believe the key to American progress has been the ever expanding circle of freedom and opportunity   If you look at Judge Alito  s statements and his record  it is clear that Judge Alito would narrow that circle while endangering our nation  s fundamental system of checks and balances         This is a vote of tremendous significance   History will show that Judge Alito  s nomination is the tipping point against constitutionally based freedoms and protections we cherish as individuals and as a nation   He would roll back decades of progress  and roll over when confronted with an administration too willing to play fast and loose with the rules   Because I do not think Judge Alito would advance the principles Americans hold most dear  I oppose his nomination and support efforts to block his confirmation
