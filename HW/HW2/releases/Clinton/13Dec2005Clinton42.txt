December 13  2005 Clinton  Nadler Call For GAO Investigation Into EPA Post 9 11 Lower Manhattan Clean Up Efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Jerrold Nadler today reiterated their call for the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to undertake an investigation into the EPA s failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan for testing and cleaning indoor air contamination following the September 11th attacks         In a letter sent today to the GAO  Clinton and Nadler expressed their   serious concerns that EPA s response to September 11th has not adequately protected public health and environment     saying that   more than four years after the attacks of September 11  2001  EPA s work to address the environmental health consequences of those attacks remains unfinished   We hoped that the Panel process would lead to answers for New Yorkers  but instead it has raised new questions that we believe that the GAO should investigate with urgency           At a press conference last week  Clinton and Nadler joined with residents  workers and community advocates in calling on the EPA to revise its plan and announced that they would ask the U S  General Accountability Office to investigate the EPA s failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan in response to the post 9 11 environmental disaster        Twenty months ago  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  began working in conjunction with the World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel  WTC Panel  as well as community and labor representatives to develop a plan to determine the extent of remaining indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center   Substantial progress was made  but in recent months  development of the plan drifted   During 2005  only two WTC Panel meetings were held since February  and the last meeting took place more than four months ago in July          On November 29th  the EPA   ignoring input from its own panel members  residents  workers and the community   announced their plan to test and clean indoor air spaces following the collapse of the World Trade Center  Fundamentally  the plan fails to correct the major problems identified by EPA  s Inspector General in 2003   For example  the plan does not include testing north of Canal Street or in Brooklyn  in spite of the Inspector General  s conclusion that the cleanup boundaries were not scientifically developed   In addition  the plan ignores many of the recommendations made by the World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel over the last 20 months        In addition to the GAO report  Clinton and Nadler are also calling on the EPA to put forward a revised plan incorporating a number of key principles that were not included in the EPA s final plan  These principles include but are not limited to           The plan should include residential  commercial  and work places in expanded geographic areas  including north of Canal Street and Brooklyn  which has been supported by EPA in previous drafts           The plan should offer clean up for exceedances of benchmarks that have been developed for Contaminants of Potential Concern  COPC  as an incentive for participation in the program          The plan should provide for the continued development of a viable WTC signature  taking into consideration the recommendations of the peer reviewers without using the signature as a basis for clean up        The text of their letter follows        December 13  2005       The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C   20548       Dear Mr  Walker        We are writing to respectfully request that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  immediately conduct an investigation into the Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan in response to the environmental contamination resulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001 in New York        In August 2003  the EPA Inspector General  IG  released a report entitled  EPA s Response to the World Trade Center Collapse  Challenges  Successes and Areas for Improvement    This IG Report was very critical of the response by EPA and the White House Council of Environmental Quality  CEQ  to the terrorist attack on New York City   The report made a number of recommendations to EPA  including how to correct flaws in the indoor cleanup program conducted by EPA in 2002 2003        At the urging of Senator Clinton  the EPA and CEQ agreed to establish an independent panel to reexamine some of the problems identified by the IG   This  World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel   chaired by EPA and consisting of scientific experts as well as representatives from the community and labor groups  met regularly over a period of twenty months   During those meetings  the Panel made recommendations to the Agency about how to design a more scientifically sound testing and cleanup plan for indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center   On November 29  2005 the EPA released a final plan  which ignores many of the recommendations of the Panel  and instead would initiate a limited testing and cleanup program very similar to the 2002 2003 program that had been criticized by the IG   In addition  EPA announced its intention to prematurely dismantle the Panel          The final EPA cleanup plan has serious flaws  and disregards recommendations of both the EPA IG and the Panel   In the plan  EPA abandoned commitments it had made to the Panel and the community to test in businesses and workspaces  and to test in expanded geographic areas exposed to World Trade Center debris  such as Brooklyn   In addition  the EPA plan stops any further work on developing a signature or other means of identifying World Trade Center dust  ignores  reservoirs  of contamination  and fails to adequately address building HVAC systems        We have serious concerns that EPA s response to September 11th has not adequately protected public health and environment   Unfortunately  EPA s recent decision to dismantle the panel and initiate a flawed testing and clean up program repeats a familiar pattern in which the Agency has sought to downplay the potential risks and convey false assurances regarding World Trade Center contamination  rather than developing a scientifically sound approach to assessing and reducing these risks        Therefore  we respectfully request that the GAO initiate an investigation to answer the following questions        1  Has the Agency implemented the recommendations of the August  2003 IG report   If not  why not        2  Which issues raised by the IG did the Panel consider  and what did the Panel recommend to address these issues        3  Which recommendations made by the Panel and or the community groups has the EPA adopted in its plan  and what is EPA s rationale for adopting or rejecting these recommendations        4  The EPA IG found that the White House interfered with EPA s statements about air quality in the days following September 11  2001   Is there evidence of any similar interference by Administration officials in the Panel process or the development of the current plan   Did Administration officials inject political considerations ahead of science or the recommendations of the Panel in the development of the plan        5  How was it determined that  7 million was an appropriate amount for this testing and clean up program  and where did the figure originate        More than four years after the attacks of September 11  2001  EPA s work to address the environmental health consequences of those attacks remains unfinished   We hoped that the Panel process would lead to answers for New Yorkers  but instead it has raised new questions that we believe that the GAO should investigate with urgency        If you need any additional information  please feel free to contact us   We stand ready to work with you to answer any questions you may have        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senator        Jerrold Nadler  Member of Congress
