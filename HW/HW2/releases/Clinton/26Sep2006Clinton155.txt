September 26  2006 Clinton Again Calls for Change of Course in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Calls for the Full Declassification of National Intelligence Estimate  NIE         Washington  DC   Today at a press conference with Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Carl Levin  D MI   and Senator Jack Reed  D RI   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today reiterated her call for a change of course in Iraq  saying    The Bush Cheney administration has stretched our military to the brink  stretched the facts to fit their ideology and stretched the patience of the American people with rhetoric instead of results   The Bush Cheney Rumsfeld team cannot gloss over the cold  hard facts             Their press conference comes on the heels of yesterday  s Democratic Policy Council  DPC  oversight hearing on the war in Iraq  Read more        Below is a transcript of Senator Clinton  s opening statement at the press conference          You know  as we enter this final week before adjournment  the Senate will be rushing to complete its business so that Senators can hit the campaign trail          It s obvious that Republicans are trying to shift the focus away from the administration s failures in Iraq  to other issues          They may not have a plan to complete  successfully  the mission in Iraq  but they do have a plan to win elections here at home          The stakes are too high to let them take such a low road   Iraq continues to be of great concern   And as we just heard from Senator Reed  the Army is operating under tremendous strain          What Senator Reed just described to you is just a small portion of what we hear  the three of us on the Armed Services Committee          Now  the Army can t even submit a budget because they know they won t get what they need   The Bush Cheney administration has stretched our military to the brink  stretched the facts to fit their ideology and stretched the patience of the American people with rhetoric instead of results          The Bush Cheney Rumsfeld team cannot gloss over the cold  hard facts          Their policies are failing  our military is breaking and the American people are demanding a change          The writing is on the wall and it doesn t say   Mission accomplished   It says  It s time to change course          I just came from a meeting with President Talabani of Iraq  where he acknowledged many of the challenges that we face in Iraq  but  where  understandably  from his perspective  he says   We want you to stay until we tell you to go          Unfortunately  the Republican led Congress continues to support the Bush Administration s failed strategy in Iraq          And  most neglectfully of all  the Republican led Congress has failed to engage in meaningful oversight of the Bush administration s Iraq policy          The Administration has lost focus on winning the war on Iraq  and all Washington Republicans can focus on is winning elections here at home          Yesterday I attended the first oversight hearing that really deserves that description  that s been held on the war in Iraq   The Democratic Policy Committee  because we can t get cooperation from our Republican colleagues  held a hearing where three former military officers    two army generals  one Marine colonel  who served in Iraq  who have a long history of active  distinguished service on behalf or our country    testified about the failures of the Bush administration s Iraq policy          Now  the Democrats organized this hearing because the Republican Congress has refused to conduct meaningful oversight   We haven t heard  in any formal way  from commanders on the ground  either active duty or retired          We rarely even hear from outside experts who bring a different perspective and point of view          You know  sunlight is the best disinfectant  and this Republican Congress has spent too long trying to keep Bush administration failures in the dark          What we heard from these retired military officers was deeply disturbing  but it wasn t anything we haven t heard before   It just was the first time we actually heard it in a hearing room in the Congress          One former general referred to a war being  quote   fought on the cheap    And they all agreed that the execution of our policy in Iraq has been  quote   incompetent           Now  I joined my colleagues  Senator Levin and Senator Reed  first  last November  and again this past spring  when they proposed a change of course in Iraq          Under their proposal  supported by the Democratic leadership in both houses of Congress  we would begin a phased redeployment of U S  troops this year as a means of pressuring the Iraqis to take more responsibility for their future          We would also be pressuring them to deal with their internal political challenges  not kick them until next year  which apparently they ve decided to do  and put a real international effort together to try to decide what the neighbors were going to do to prevent a failed state on their borders          The news reports this week regarding the April classified national intelligence estimate assessing the impact of Iraq on the global war on terror only adds more urgency to the importance of changing course in Iraq          At this point  I would settle for just admitting that we re on the wrong course while we try to figure out what to do next   Let s have that debate in the Congress and in the country          Having reviewed the NIE  I m very much in favor of the decision to declassify it   This needs to be part of the debate  and this is information from those whom we entrust with assessing threats we face and providing their best analysis          Now  this November Americans will decide if they want to change course in Iraq or whether they want to continue with a rubber stamp Congress that continually supports a failed policy in Iraq  and now  as we can tell from what s been leaked about the NIE  a failing policy in terms of containing  deterring and defeating the terrorist leaders and operatives in the global war on terror          This is an important choice  and we need to continually remind our fellow Americans of what is at stake   And I particularly thank my colleagues because of their leadership over many years on behalf of these issues         Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
