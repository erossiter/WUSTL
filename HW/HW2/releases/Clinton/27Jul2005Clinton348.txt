July 27  2005 Senators Clinton  Schumer and Representatives Reynolds  Slaughter  Higgins Introduce Legislation To Compensate Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer joined Representatives Thomas Reynolds  Louise Slaughter and Brian Higgins in introducing legislation to reform the compensation program for nuclear workers at Bethlehem Steel and other former New York atomic weapons production facilities   The bill would enable employees to be added to a   special exposure cohort    and receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program if exposure records do not enable case by case decisions to be made             It is time to right the wrong that has been done to our state  s nuclear workers and their families who have not received the compensation they deserve     said Senator Clinton     This bill will ensure that nuclear workers are not penalized because  through no fault of their own  exposure records are inadequate               Our bill would correct years of injustice for Western New York  s nuclear workers     Schumer said    After the sacrifice these Cold War Heroes made for our country  they have waited far too long  This bill would finally put them on the path to getting the recognition and compensation they deserve               No one who deserves compensation should have it denied  period     said U S  Representative Thomas M  Reynolds  R  Clarence  the lead sponsor of the House bill     This legislation will fulfill a national commitment we made to these  Veterans of the Cold War   by providing them with compensation that is long overdue   It is the right thing to do for these victims and their families  and I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to help make it happen               The workers of Bethlehem Steel  Linde Ceramics  and many other Department of Energy facilities deserve immediate compensation  Despite many incidences of work related illnesses and deaths  employees across this country have not found relief because of insufficient records that not only delay site profiles  but also make dose reconstruction virtually impossible     said Rep  Slaughter     This bill  by allowing Special Exposure Cohort status designation to specific facilities  will help employees receive the benefits promised to them in a timely manner                This bill frees suffering workers and their families from a process that has failed them for too long  I am pleased to support this bipartisan bill  and sincerely hope that justice will finally be carried out for all those affected     said Congressman Higgins           Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 to compensate workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War   Under EEOICPA  former nuclear workers or their survivors were eligible to file claims with the US Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits   To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history             Claims are decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history   Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was likely to have caused the worker  s illness   This   dose reconstruction    process has been time consuming and controversial  particularly at facilities like Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna  New York  where workers did not wear individual radiation monitors  and there was minimal monitoring of ambient radiation   For Bethlehem Steel workers  compensation decisions have been made using a radiation exposure model that relies on data from another facility  the Simonds Saw facility in Lockport  New York             The bill introduced today would amend the criteria by which employees can be added to a   special exposure cohort      Being added to a cohort means that employees do not have to go through a   dose reconstruction    process   Instead  if a person has an eligible cancer and worked at a facility when weapons work was performed  their cancer is presumed to have been caused by workplace exposure and the person  s claim is paid    Under the legislation  workers would be added to a special cohort if                they worked at an eligible facility for an aggregate of at least 250 days  and               fewer than 50 percent of the total number of the workers at the facility were individually monitored on a regular basis for exposure to internal and external ionizing radiation using reliable methods under a formal health physics program or                individual internal and external exposure records for radiation are non existent or are not available  or                to the extent that a portion of individual internal or external records are available for that period from such facility  the exposure to radiation at such facility cannot be reliably determined for greater than 2 3 percent of workers            The bill also directs the Secretary of Labor to apply these criteria to the Bethlehem Steel facility within 90 days of enactment   Because individual records are not available at Bethlehem Steel  workers would qualify for inclusion in a special cohort under the legislation if they worked at the facility for an aggregate of 250 days during 1949 1952    Based on draft site profiles prepared by NIOSH for the Linde Ceramics and Simonds Saw facilities  it appears that many workers from these facilities would qualify under the legislation as well   Because these and other New York facilities are not as far along in the claims process as Bethlehem Steel  it is impossible to determine exactly how the legislation would apply   However  it could assist workers across New York   Click here to view the list of facilities with more than 20 claims filed
