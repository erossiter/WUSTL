April 2  2007 Senator Clinton Pushes for Full Funding of Appalachian Regional Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Request Comes on the Heels of Senate Committee Approval of Bill to Reauthorize the Commission     In 2006  ARC Funded Projects Created or Retained 28 866 Jobs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is continuing her support for the Appalachian Regional Commission  ARC   joining her Senate colleagues  including Senator George Voinovich  R OH  in signing a letter to the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Sub Committee  requesting that the ARC receive  75 million in full funding in this year s Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill  Senator Clinton also welcomed approval last week by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee of a bill she introduced  along with Senator Voinovich earlier this year  to reauthorize the commission           The Appalachian Regional Commission plays a critical role in strengthening the region s infrastructure  revitalizing the economy of the Southern Tier  and improving employment opportunities   said Senator Clinton   Now that the Environment and Public Works Committee has wisely approved the bill to reauthorize this commission  it is absolutely essential that we include sufficient funding for the Commission s programs  I strongly urge this committee to increase the commission s funding so that it can continue its important work to support communities  encourage small business and foster economic growth           Congress appropriated  64 8 million for ARC for fiscal year 2007 and President Bush s FY 2008 budget roughly maintains the 2007 levels  But with the region receiving less federal assistance per capita than the rest of the country  fully funding the commission at the  75 million level allows the commission to adequately pursue its goals of improving the quality of life in the region           Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined with Senator George Voinovich to reintroduce the Appalachian Regional Commission Reauthorization Act  The Commission provides communities in the Appalachian Region with tools to help bolster businesses and spur local economic development  The reauthorization continues all existing ARC general programs  including the special program in telecommunications and technology  which Senator Clinton has fought to fully fund  The bill also provides funding of over  95 million annually for the next five years and permits ARC to fund projects in fragile economies up to 70 percent of the cost of the project          Since ARC s creation  the poverty rate has been cut in half  from 31 percent to 13 percent   the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two thirds  and the percentage of adults with high school education has increased by over 70 percent   ARC funded health clinics have improved access to health care across the region   Moreover  approximately 1 6 million jobs have been created in Appalachia as a result of ARC activities in the region          Senator Clinton has long fought to support the ARC  joining in past years with Senator Voinovich  as well as Senator John D  Rockefeller  D WV  to write President Bush urging him to retain vital funding for this Commission  Last March  Senator Clinton was awarded the Development District Association of Appalachia  DDAA  Congressional Award for her leadership and for her support for the ARC  Senator Clinton also worked to pass amendments to the Appalachian Regional Development Act           Created by Congress in 1965  the ARC is a partnership between governors of 13 states  a federal representative and a grassroots network of local elected officials  and community and business leaders  Covering 200 000 square miles  it includes 23 million people and several counties in New York s Southern Tier  including Allegany  Broome  Cattaraugus  Chautauqua  Chemung  Chenango  Cortland  Delaware  Otsego  Schoharie  Schuyler  Steuben  Tioga  and Tompkins           The full text of the Senators  letter to Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member Domenici below           March 30  2007      The Honorable Byron Dorgan  Chairman  Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development  Committee on Appropriations                                           United States Senate  Washington  DC  20510      The Honorable Pete Domenici  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Energy and                                  Water Development      Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate                                   Washington  DC  20510      Dear Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member Domenici       We respectfully request that you include funding in the amount of  75 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission  ARC  in the Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill            ARC seeks to improve Appalachia s economic competitiveness by overcoming the region s challenges and building on its assets   ARC accomplishes this by strengthening basic infrastructure  improving the employability of individuals living an Appalachia  and helping diversify the regional economy   ARC also administers programs that focus on reducing Appalachia s isolation by constructing the Appalachian Development Highway System and expanding the region s telecommunications capacity            There are currently 410 counties in the 13 state region that makes up ARC  including 77 counties that currently qualify as distressed on the basis of low per capita income and high poverty and unemployment rates   ARC s reauthorization legislation requires states to spend at least half of their ARC funding on projects benefiting economically distressed counties and areas   Since 1965  the efforts of ARC have cut the number of distressed counties by over 65 percent  from 223 in 1965   However  many counties are only marginally outside of the distressed designation and remain at high risk            Since ARC s creation  the poverty rate has been cut in half  from 31 percent to 13 percent   the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two thirds  and the percentage of adults with at least a high school education has increased by over 70 percent   ARC funded health clinics have improved access to health care across the region  and ARC funded projects have provided more than 800 000 Appalachians access to clean water and sanitation facilities   Moreover  approximately 1 6 million jobs have been created in Appalachia as a result of ARC activities in the region           In fiscal year 2006  ARC invested  61 8 million in 397 non highway economic and community development projects and leveraged  194 million  3 1 ratio  in other public funds and  714 million  12 1 ratio  in private investment throughout the region   That is a leverage of  11 55 in private sector money and  3 14 in other public money and investments for every  1 ARC funds  ARC provides vital gap financing to help communities leverage their limited local resources and tap into the array of federal infrastructure programs  including the Economic Development Administration Public Works program and U S  Department of Agricultural Rural Development programs          In 2006  ARC funded projects created or retained 28 866 jobs   Infrastructure projects provided over 30 148 Appalachian households with water and sewer services  many for the first time          We are requesting a modest increase to help ARC address even more aggressively the region s infrastructure deficiencies  and persistence of human capital and leadership deficits which continue to result in concentrated areas of poverty and unemployment   Funding for ARC has been level at around  65 million for the last ten years  and the region continues to receive less federal assistance per capita than the rest of the country          Congress appropriated  64 8 million for ARC for fiscal year 2007   The President s fiscal year 2008 budget requests  65 million for ARC   Fully funding for the ARC at the  75 million level will allow the agency to continue its important work to improve the quality of life in Appalachia  especially in the region s poorest and underdeveloped counties          Despite the impressive accomplishments of ARC  the 410 county region still faces a complex set of economic and social challenges   ARC continues to be an important partner in fostering economic development and improving the quality of life for the 23 million people who live and work in Appalachia   Full funding of  75 million for ARC in fiscal year 2008 would be leveraged with additional federal  state  and local money and would go a long way in making a real difference in the region            Thank you for your consideration of our request          Sincerely
