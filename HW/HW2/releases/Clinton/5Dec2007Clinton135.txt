December 5  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton on Senate Environment Committee Global Warming Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The scientific consensus is clear   strong and swift action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is needed to prevent catastrophic effects of climate change   Today the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee took a first step towards that goal by reporting the America s Climate Security Act of 2007   This bill is a start   It makes steep reductions in emissions by 2020  encourages the development and deployment of clean energy technology  provides assistance for American families  and provides training for workers that the clean energy industry will demand    I congratulate Chairman Boxer for moving this bill through the committee   But as the bill moves forward  we have to do much better   I am firmly committed to reducing emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050   And I think it is imperative that we auction 100  of greenhouse gas permits rather than giving them away for free to polluters   I cast votes in the committee today for amendments to move the bill towards these goals  including an amendment I offered with Senator Sanders to eliminate giveaways to utilities and other companies under the bill   Although these amendments failed  I voted for the bill because it is a step in the right direction  and Congress can no longer afford to wait   It s time for the United States to show leadership on this issue by taking up and debating a global warming bill   Indeed  I believe Congress should be debating a cap and trade bill as part of a broad  comprehensive effort to combat global warming and reduce our dependence on foreign oil  including aggressive steps to improve energy efficiency and deploy renewable energy that would benefit our economy and help create millions of new jobs   But as this bill moves forward  it has to be improved to meet the enormous challenge that we face   As that process goes forward  I will continue my efforts to ensure that the final bill takes stronger action  ensures adequate assistance for American families  and ends unnecessary giveaways to corporations
