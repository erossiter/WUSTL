October 30  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Full Senate Approval of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The passage of this critical legislation is truly a great achievement   For New Yorkers  Amtrak is not just a commodity  but a life source   Passenger rail is an essential element of our transportation network that provides irreplaceable capacity and mobility to New York and the nation   For the past near seven years  we have had to fight the Administrations constant attempts to privatize and dismantle our nations premier passenger rail service  Amtrak   Eliminating Amtrak service would be an economic disaster and an irresponsible policy    Today  as gas prices continue to climb and airline delays are at an all time high  Amtrak not only provides a necessary and affordable alternative to our congested airways  it links commuters to local locations not serviced by the airline industry  The enactment of Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 will end the stop gap funding process for Amtrak  and will provide the traveling public with the security of a comprehensive plan for improving our nations passenger rail system      No country in the world has ever developed and maintained a successful passenger railroad system without assistance from their national government   Without offering an alternative  President Bush has aimed to simply shut down passenger rail in the U S      This plan will authorize  19 2 billion in federal funds for Amtrak by providing  3 2 billion over the next six years  and will allow Amtrak to make critical repairs and improvements to its service  Funding under the PRIIA will allow Amtrak to implement a comprehensive plan that will enhance rail security  reduce train delays  and improve customer service  It will also provide sufficient funding and direction to bring the Northeast Corridor up to a state of good repair  including vital tunnel life safety work in the Hudson River Tunnels     In recent years  attempts by Congress to improve and modernize Amtraks operations were stalled by the Republican controlled House  and earlier this year the President proposed cutting  493 million  more than 38 percent of Amtraks operating funds  This sort of backwards thinking would have severely jeopardized Amtrak s ability to serve their passenger lines in New York and throughout the Northeast     In the State of New York  Amtrak operates 140 routes  employs more than 1 900 people  and has two of the top ten busiest stations in their rail system  Amtrak is an integral part of our transportation infrastructure and continues to service parts of the state that need the influx of tourists  business travelers and others  The future without Amtrak for New York would be devastating      I am proud that the full Senate has rejected the Administrations approach to Amtrak   As an original co sponsor of this legislation  I commend Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott for their leadership in steering this critically important legislation through the United States Senate  I am pleased that my colleagues have voted overwhelmingly to continue to provide critical funding for Amtrak  and I look forward to when this legislation is signed into law
