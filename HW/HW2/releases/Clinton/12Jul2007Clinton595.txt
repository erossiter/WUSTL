years spending bill    This is great news for the Hudson Valley  Schumer said   The Newburgh project will revitalize and restore the Armory District  fueling the exciting economic development taking place in that wonderful Hudson River city   The new environmentally friendly bus fleet in Westchester puts that county at the cutting edge of environmentally sound mass transit  The improved ferry operations in Haverstraw supports a vital new transportation option for Rockland County commuters  And the new transit hub for Poughkeepsie will significantly improve commuting services for Dutchess County and the whole Hudson Valley  Finally  these funds will polish the jewel that is the FDR library  and make it the national treasure it ought to be     This funding is certainly great news for the Hudson Valley Region  These funds for the Revitalization Planning and Development of Newburghs Armory District will further assist with the redevelopment of their facilities  helping to improve the neighborhood both physically and economically  I am pleased that the funds for the Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will facilitate the construction of a centralized public transit center that will help to alleviate disruptive traffic congestion and promote public transportation that can reduce harmful green house gas emissions   I am also very pleased that funds will be coming to the Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus System  providing needed support to replace out dated buses that will decrease emissions  giving residents a cleaner  greener ride  Senator Clinton said   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive funds to increase parking capacity  improve passenger waiting facilities  and increase access from Manhattan   which will greatly contribute to the economic growth of the area   I am also pleased that we could secure approval for funds to renovate the Franklin D  Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Dutchess County   Although it is a tremendous source of tourist revenue  the Roosevelt Presidential Library has had little renovation since it opened in 1941   These funds will help to renew this local treasure as well as expand the museum and research facilities    The City of Newburghs Armory District Revitalization Planning and Development program will receive  200 000 of federal funds to be used for planning and design efforts within the Citys Armory District   Implementation will include corridor planning utilizing the principles of urban design  the development of architectural designs  and mixed use commercial

located in Orange County    The Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus Systems Low Emission ADA Accessible Replacement Buses project will receive  1 million of federal funds to

busses ordered in 2006 through 2008  to be delivered in 2007 through 2009    The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive  400 000 of federal funds to upgrade the ferry service to Lower Manhattan   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal currently serves the Haverstraw Ossining ferry  and will serve the Haverstraw Yonkers Lower Manhattan ferry service in the near future   Currently  there are limited parking and waiting facilities available at the site for passengers   These funds will be used to make parking and landside improvements  such as a climate controlled facility large enough to accommodate up to 100 passengers   When it is time for the ferry to move to their future  permanent home  several years from now   the passenger waiting facility structure can be relocated    The City of Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will receive  1 million of federal funds to build a combination Public Transit Hub and Parking Deck in the central business district to serve as a hub for city  county and private bus riders and provide resident parking   The City of Poughkeepsie is in the planning stages for a Public Transit Hub to be located on a City owned surface parking lot in the central business district  The structure will serve two much needed purposes by providing parking to residents and visitors and by serving as a transportation hub for bus riders on city  county  and intercity privately operated bus services   This project combines transit and economic development components  The first floor of the facility will serve the bus systems and their riders  and the upper floors will provide public parking spaces in support of the City s revitalization and redevelopment of the Luckey  Platt Building  the center piece of Main Street redevelopment efforts and a National Historic Landmark  The 150 000 square foot building is currently being redeveloped by private owners as a mixed retail market rate residential project    The bus systems and their riders are in dire need of a convenient and suitable location for downtown riders to wait for a bus or to transfer to another bus  Currently  riders must assemble at an on street transfer point bus stop  The current location does not accommodate the number of buses that are at that location during peak times  and riders have to wait at the curb or in a limited number of bus shelters   Within the Hub  the ground floor of the facility will house the transit hub with covered spaces for passengers and buses to enter  wait  and exit  Bus service will be maintained at its current location  but the transfer point for all buses will become the Transit Hub  Shuttle bus service from the Transit Hub to the Metro North and Amtrak Station may be an option as the City redevelops  Buses from the City Bus system  the Dutchess County Loop bus system  and regional intercity bus services will use the facility   Dutchess County will receive  750 000 for the Renovation of the Franklin D  Roosevelt Presidential Library

With this funding  the building that houses this priceless collectionmuch of which remains as it was when first constructed 65 years agowill be renovated to reflect National Archives and Records Administration  NARA  standards for preservation  Its research room will be expanded  and the attached museum  a source of over  400 million in tourism revenues for Dutchess County  will be modernized
